Go ahead and try those suggestions with something like Chrominum.
https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/chromium-dev/c16gosC3wm8
If your suggestions are true, a lot can be gained.
If you are suggesting not using stl, or boost, what do you want people to use?
There is overhead with doing large projects with C++, but as far as I have seen C++ is still the best way to write performance intensive code.

"It's not like compiling is the time-consuming part anymore" needs a sarcasm tag attached to it. Some people still deal with large compile times.

$1 Mil in Bitcoins is the total daily volume of MtGrox. I am thinking it might take some work to get that many bitcoins in short order.

The new ASIC miners coming out will make GPU mining pointless, CPU mining already is.

If "programmers" were overpaid and arrogant wouldn't a large group of people want to go out and become programmers because it is easy and highly paid.
That hasn't been the case for the last 10 years and that is why salaries are going up. The market is now just adjusting itself,people are realizing Computer Science could be a good field to be in. If salaries do not stay that way, then people are going into other fields.

Software development is a profession, it takes years of education and experience to do an effective job, and should demand a higher salary.

It would be nice if these companies would be putting this time and effort into pushing for / funding more S.T.E.M. education in the US.

Helps with battery life, and can allow you to run other things while playing video without a large performance hit.

Attached to: Ask Slashdot: Best Option For Printing Digital Photos?
I have used SmugMug for photo sharing, one of the perks of sharing images with there site is the photo printing. I have always been impressed with their quality and shipping speed. Their prints might cost a bit more, but it seems to be worth it.
I have also had prints made from Shutteryfly, Walmart, Walgreens. I normally use Walmart for when I need one hour prints done. The quality just doesn't seem to compare.
I would also suggest making a Blurb/Shutterfly book. Either site has an easy way to create a book, which is a lot more interesting for people then prints.

Attached to: Tesla Reveals Its Model X Gullwing SUV
Look at pretty much any review of the SLS - AMG, they all pretty much point out how hard it is to deal with Gullwing doors. The doors have issues such as you have to duck to get in and they are hard to close. The doors also have to be explosive incase of a rollover. From the looks of it the Model-X won't even fit in most garages with the doors open. Wonder how you get this in and out of a garage.
I wonder how many of those SUV mall mommies would want s to plugin there SUV all the time just to be able to drive 100 miles.

I can't wait for Jeremy Clarkson to review this Electric Sports Car/SUV with Gull Wing Doors. I am for sure he will have some great superlatives for how amazingly stupid this thing is. This SUV is the answer for the question no one asked.

Processing can be a lot of fun for small projects:
http://processing.org/discourse/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1222641158
Pros:
Cross platform, java based, simple IDE, supports keyboard/mouse input, 2D/3D.
Cons:
Only downside is limited audio support.
