I was sixteen flavors of pissed.<p>Google keeping me unpissed is worth $10,000 a year.  I'm a wee little customer.

My prediction:  If they don't change their ways this is headed to a huge class-action lawsuit and nothing but bad press.<p>My experience was interesting and revealing.  I had a bunch of domains (about 200) parked with GoDaddy in something called "cash parking".  Not a money maker, but, what the heck.  Once I realized that this was actually a service provided by Google I decided to look into cutting-out the middle man.<p>I looked into AdSense and found AdSense for Domains.  Exactly the same service being offered by GoDaddy.  I took all 200-some domains off GoDaddy, created an AdSense account and parked all of them with Google.  They approved every single domain name and put ads on them.  Great.<p>Two days later I get this email about fraudulent activity and the termination of my AdSense account.  I appealed.  No love.  So, the termination was, effectively, forever.<p>Here's the irony of this story.  The same 200 domains had been parked with GoDaddy for months without any issues.  Serviced by Google.  They even made a few bucks for all involved.  The domains were not advertised in any way anywhere.  I just parked them and went on with my business.  This means that Google was responsible for sending traffic to these sites, every bit of it.  About 50 of the domains were political in nature.  Being that this was around election time my guess is that they got more traffic than usual, and, I guess, hits.  I'll never know because the account was killed within two days of being formed with no data provided whatsoever.<p>So:  Google sends traffic to the sites.  The sites get clicks.  They close my AdSense account.  No appeal, no recourse, no human being to speak to.  Bullshit!<p>Google needs to get sued in a major way to "reset" some of their behaviors.  Why?  Because they are a de-facto monopoly.  Search is dominated by them.  Video (YouTube) is dominated by them. Advertising (AdWords and AdSense) is dominated by them.<p>They do not provide for any intelligent way to deal with problems.  They will tell you that you've done something wrong but will NOT provide proof, details nor an opportunity to rectify the problem.  A likely scenario is that of someone just getting started who makes a few mistakes and needs to learn.  Google does not provide for any of the above.  They are judge, jury and executioner and a pretty mean one at that.<p>This fellow with the boat site probably deserved a slap on the hand for his site.  He did no deserve to loose ALL OF HIS INCOME.  They could have easily said something like:<p>"Your site-based per-click revenue is now 10% of normal during a probation period.  These are the things you did wrong: link.  Here's where you can see the activity and what happened: link.  Here are the rules you need to pay attention to: link.  The account will be monitored and your earnings percentage slowly increased as we see that these violations are rectified.  We look forward to a continued relationship with &#60;company name&#62;".<p>...A far better approach.<p>If you are going to shut down someones entire revenue stream you need to have a humane and reasonable process to review the situation and seek resolution rather than hitting someone over the head with a sledge-hammer.<p>I don't know what will trigger this lawsuit.  I do think that it is almost inevitable.  They might even need to be broken into different verticals in order to make it all fair.  I think they are playing a dangerous game.  I think they are playing with fire.<p>The Google "do no evil" thing may have been a nice idea.  However, as it pertains to AdWords/AdSense they are headed straight for evil-land if they keep on this path.<p>There's another topic: Google censorship.  I think that, because they are a monopoly, they don't have the right to censor.  They can't be in charge of what is and isn't appropriate on the web.  Different issue.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">6</div><div class="commenthead">23 points by <a class="userlink" rel="joshklein">joshklein</a> 4  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2049268">1 reply</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>Relying on Google, or any other single source, for your income is the same as having an employer.

A discussion, not a computer generated decision. Perhaps the adsense account for the personal website should have been ceased, but doing so for the youtube one too, is petty. Of course (assuming) a computer can't tell the difference between these outlets a human voice would have helped in this matter.<p>After reading some of the comments, I really think pulling down the youtube videos and throwing up 30 second 'previews', with a link to the full version on Vimeo, is a great idea.

The research gives the public one more piece of information to judge the risks for placing their money in a financial institution.<p>The banking sector as participants in a free market who frequently advocate for opening of more sectors of the economy to the free market (and rightly so) should be encouraging such research. The research gives consumers of banking services more accurate information to consider when deciding how accessible their money should be. Additional information allows consumers to make more informed choices regarding the trade offs between security and convenience. Banks could offer insurance to their customers to protect them against the risks while still keeping the benefits of increased convenience.<p>It's an opportunity for the banks to differentiate their services and cater to the needs of their customers. Yes, not having a PIN is less secure, but it's also more convenient, with proper positioning of their products banks should be able to offer tailored solutions that better address the needs of their customers.</p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">5</div><div class="commenthead">10 points by <a class="userlink" rel="rlmw">rlmw</a> 3  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2053431">1 reply</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>To be fair I didn't read this the first time it was on HN - I'm inclined to think that the title of the post is more descriptive than the original, and its deserving front page material, even if it is a duplicate.</div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">6</div><div class="commenthead">12 points by <a class="userlink" rel="yesbabyyes">yesbabyyes</a> 3  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2053879">1 reply</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>Link to original letter - oh boy this is a good read: <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/ukca.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/ukca.pdf</a></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">7</div><div class="commenthead">36 points by <a class="userlink" rel="instakill">instakill</a> 3  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2053259">1 reply</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>Brilliant.

Businesses have always acted this way when it comes to computer security (for at least the last 15 years, feel free to cite earlier examples). By now they probably understand that what they're doing is wrong, from a security perspective. They may even understand that issuing takedowns increases publicity. Still, business are sociopathic, they don't care about the legitimacy of their actions. They have a staff of lawyers they're already paying for, and a responsibility to defend trade secrets and protect their product base. So they marshal their lawyers, essentially for free, and maybe they get something out of the effort as a result. If they don't, nothing much was lost, and they generally don't care about their perception in the security community. Same old story.

I like that it's dead simple. I can also see how it's incredibly viral as it asks you to ask others to describe you -- very smart. At first glance it looks to me like something that could enjoy tons of traffic, but which would probably be short-lived. The challenge would be finding a way to have that traffic stick around...<p>I view this as a bit of a long shot, but I would do a few things. First, you've <i>got</i> to have the site handle the traffic. No advice on how, but find a way to get that done. Next, I would try to become known as <i>the place</i> to get a quick summary on anybody -- even celebrities. I imagine people will receive multiple adjectives from different people, but I'd have the site tally the three most popular and promote those as best describing of the user. :) I see a couple of possible pages for "viewer stickiness". The homepage could feature very popular users. Imagine showing the three most submitted words to describe /paulg or /marrington and other users with large responses... Next, on each user's page it could show their "friends" and the words that describe them. The site also provides the most recently submitted three words on the user's page. This might at least make each user curious about checking back at their own profile to see how people were labeling them. As for monetizing, that's probably with ads, as usual, but you have to be careful about when and where to put them. Like I said, probably a long shot, but who knows? Good luck!</p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">3</div><div class="commenthead">17 points by <a class="userlink" rel="cd34">cd34</a> 3  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2051490">1 reply</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>Where is your current bottleneck?  mysql?  check your slow query log, turn on the log-queries-not-using-indexes, do a quick analysis of those to see if you have queries that aren't using an index or queries that can be optimized.

So you're looking at around $30/day revenue right now.<p>Consider switching to EC2. This will allow you to easily scale up to a more powerful server if growth continues or down to a less powerful one if traffic tapers off.<p>Depending on how you set things up, a common bottleneck for Facebook applications is API calls. Ensure you are not making any API calls from Rails, since this will cause Rails processes to hang until Facebook returns results. With high traffic this could easily cause your server to become overwhelmed. Move all API calls to Delayed Job or another background processing system if you haven't already.<p>It looks like you have relatively few remotely loaded assets, which is great. You can likely speed things up more by making sure that your database is well optimized for the server (Make sure query cache is enabled, and you have indexes on the right columns for example), and identify any actions that take a long time to return.<p>As for what to expect in the future, growth will not be infinite. There are a finite number of people on earth that are going to love your site and Facebook integration is a fantastic way to reach nearly all of those people in a very short amount of time. After a while most of those people will get bored and you will see traffic begin to fall. The best ways to address this are by consistently releasing new features to reengage users or by referring your users to other similar sites that you build.</p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">5</div><div class="commenthead">30 points by <a class="userlink" rel="kabuks">kabuks</a> 3  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2051389">1 reply</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>Your site seems to be down.<p>Think about moving the code over to Heroku now, and keep scaling to meet demand.<p>If you don't have the cash, email me and I'll front you what you need to keep it up until you figure out how you want to roll with this.

Database sanity check: Are you using indexes for calls like "Find user by username"? Does your database need its own dedicated box?<p>2. Pick up another box for memcached. Full-page cache everything you can with rack-cache. Don't worry about expiration, just use some reasonably low TTL to put a throttle on your read requests for now.<p>3. Move all of your static assets to S3 + CloudFront. Gzipped, with a far-future Expires header. While you're in there, move the JS to the footer of your layouts.

Monitor your retention. Are people coming back or just checking your site out once? You can go viral very quickly but tank just as quickly once the initial interest dies down.<p>2. Start thinking about a business model. Highly viral sites that don't retain well could really hurt your bank account if you're not monetizing. If you can't can come up with an interesting one, throw up some ads to tide you over.<p>3. As soon as possible, get your database on dedicated hardware. Your bottleneck is going to be the database: so memcache, add the right db indexes (get a backup db so you can hot-swap while you do this), and add lots of RAM if needed. You don't want to be scrambling to migrate your database once you hit the limit.</p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">18</div><div class="commenthead">5 points by <a class="userlink" rel="rms">rms</a> 3  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2051509">2 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>Don't forget to apply for the Thiel Fellowship!

Picking good technologies for your project is <i>hard work</i>, so there is to try one, and another and so forth, and even reconsidering after a few years (or months?) the state of the things again, given the evolution speed of the DB panorama in the recent years.<p>While I'm at it I like to share that in this exact days I'm working at a Redis disk back end. I've already a prototype working after a few days of full immersion (I like to use vacation time to work at completely new ideas for Redis).<p>The idea is that everything is stored on disk, in what is a plain key-value database (complex values are serialized when on disk), and the memory is instead used as an object cache.<br />It is like taking current Redis Virtual Memory and inverting the logic completely, the result is the same (working set in memory, the rest on disk), but this implementation means that there are no limits on the data you can put into a single instance, that you don't have slow restarts (data is not loaded on memory if not demanded), and there isn't to fork() to save.

At the time played wi an American guild (I'm Australian) and the time difference stopped me doing things with them most of them time since I had a 9-5 job. My server split and I went with them. The new server was fairly desolate and I ended up getting booted from lack of participation. That, combined with how my class had been screwed by the expansion, caused me to quit.<p>But I ended up selling my stuff on eBay for ~$3500 so it wasn't all bad. But the story doesn't end there.<p>Atually anoeth factor was that I was moving to the UK for work. That first year the was one of the most productive of my life. I had no Internet access at home (2001), no TV and a fairly active social life. Due to living in a cheap area of London, renting a flat and subletting the rooms and the low rate of effective taxation of contractors I SAVED in excess of $100,000 that year.<p>After some drama with flatmates (subletting was financially beneficial but a hassle) I moved closer to work. Suddenlyinsread of an our commute each way I had a 5 minute walk. I got cable Internet and bought a PC and a TV.<p>I started playing EQ again. New server, new class, starting from scratch. I leveled quickly and went through a series of guilds. Raiding can be a huge timesink. This period was the most fun I had in an MMORPG ever.<p>Later that year I got laid off as in the aftermath of the telco bubble bursting the previous year (it was 2002 by now).<p>I'd always wanted to learn a foreign language soi moved to Germany and enrolled in intensive learning classes.<p>But I still kept up with EQ. I transferred servers to a high end guild. The guild was American so I ended up sleeping from 7pm to 1am, playing EQ from 1am to 8am, going to classes til 1pm and then playing til 6pm. I never really adjusted to sleeping at these times.<p>But I did go to classes. After they ended I stayed and was playing up to 16 hours a day. In the end I got kicked from the guild for doing something I shouldn't have, which was probably the best thing that could've happened.<p>Still I view that time now as a wasted opportunity. I did learn the language but not as well as I could have and I certainly take full advantage socially or even to see and do things there.<p>But not before I'd gone back to my old company (they were hiring again) and my weird schedule had brought me into conflict with a toxic project manager, ending that job only a month after it had started.<p>2002-03 was a pretty terrible time in the UK  contractor market (39% unemployment amongst those who hadn't left the industry). It took months to find a new job. I'd also lost that "social" outlet of EQ so was pretty cut off. It was actually a fairly dark period for me.<p>I have played MMOGs since then but never to the same intensity and, frankly, I think the magic was gone. I'd seen it all before. Even now I think all these games are fairly formulaic with the same basic mechanics and psychological devices (compulsion loops, etc).<p>What I learnt about myself is that I'm fairly singleminded. This can be used advantageously as I'll dwel on a problem at work until I solve it. But if I have an unresolved issue personally it can, in a way, consume me--or at least consume my attention.<p>I do think I'd be better off without a TV or even without a home Internet connection. But I guess balance is my personal cross to bear.<p>Are these games dangerous? Possibly but I tend to thinkpretty much everything is dangerous to some people. Alcohol. Gambling. Trading. Even working out. It ultimately comes down to personal responsibility.<p>EDIT: One last thing I'll add: one problem with this kind of game is the longevity (timesink) nature. You see a similar (but much less severe) problem with tabletop RPGs. Because you invest so much time it increases your threshold for putting up with crap, basically.<p>In RPGs it might be a 7 hour session where nothing happens. In MMOGs it's spending 1-2 hours LFG (looking for group), a week figuring out a raid encounter, spending an our doing a CR (corpse recovery) and so on.<p>These days my leisure gaming activities are dominated by tabletop board gaming of the Euro variety (Agricola, Age of Steam, Reef Encounter, Le Havre, Dominion and so on). These tend to last 2-3 hours tops and, as such, have very little "downtime". I find it a much more rewarding experience than huge timesink games of any variety. Plus it's actually social.<p>On a side note, if there is anyone in NYC with interest I playing such games, contact me via my info. :)<p>EDIT2: fixed some typos (typing on an iPad is error-prone), :)</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">2</div><div class="commenthead">45 points by <a class="userlink" rel="xal">xal</a> 2  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2055667">5 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>It seems to be stated as a fact in this discussion that you can't play a game such as WoW and do anything other productive on the side, but it's a lot more nuanced.<p>Anecdotally, I've been playing WoW almost non stop since it launched and have been raiding once to three times a week. During this time I also got married, had a kid, founded Shopify, overtook the CEO role, grew it to be a multi million dollar business. In this community that seems far from being a failure.<p>I'm engaging in anecdotal junk science here but my theory is that the people who really loose themselves in games like WoW are people with very poor time management skills. I'm convinced those people have always been around before. However, previously almost all activities came with some inherent caps on the time you can productively spend on those. All sports wear you out and force you to stop after some time. TV repeats pretty quickly and there is no original content during the night. Reading works but that's a socially fully acceptable timesink.<p>WoW is just extremely good game that fulfills a lot Maslow's needs, especially the top ones. There is a great asymmetry in the lure of this game and the established defenses of some people.<p>I think one of the key parts of parenting for our generation will be to equipt our children with the time management skills and the willpower to handle and enjoy games like WoW properly.</p></p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">3</div><div class="commenthead">35 points by <a class="userlink" rel="ramanujan">ramanujan</a> 2  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2055406">3 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>What WoW needs to do is start hooking in-game rewards to real-life rewards.<p>For example, a deal with 24 Hour Fitness where you need to attend for 30 days in a row to unlock some kind of sword.

I essentially lost a chunk of my life from 21 to 23yo playing EverQuest with a guild that was rated one of the best to ever play the game. With that came the caveat of constantly being the first at conquering new expansions, leveling as fast as possible so you CAN conquer the new expansions, and end less other power play moves (questing for keys, blah blah).<p>Long story short - my life was rather pathetic during these times. I found myself so immersed in the MMORPG world that I'd pick raids and my friends in the game over family/friends for any circumstances. Birthday parties, engagement parties, night out with friends at the bars, hacking all night on something that can potentially change the lives of people one day -- all gone. Zero motivation, zero care in the world except to get that new robe for my necromancer.<p>I remember my friends would drive by the window and start screaming for me to come out with them for once. I would literally turn off the lights in my room so they couldn't tell if I was home or not. Sad.<p>We had raids that lasted from 6pm on a Friday night and wouldn't end until 12am on Saturday. Anyone remember Veeshan's Peak in Kunark for EQ? Not only was my social life directly impacted by way of never having a significant other, I wasn't picking up any new programming skills, my family was constantly on my case, and my close friends eventually just stopped calling, they gave up. What was more embarrassing is the once in a blue moon when I would show up some where, the comments were unbearable. "Oh look, Steve decided to join us instead of his MMORPG friends for a change."<p>I am not exactly sure where I am going with this - but one day when I woke up and saw five empty 2 liter bottles of coke with ten boxes of pizza collecting, lying next to my desk, I was disgusted with myself and my lifestyle. I was over weight. I probably didn't shower as much as I should have. I was disgusted with myself and my lifestyle. I was burning the most crucial years of my life away on something meaningless. These are the times to be learning and exercising your brain beyond its capabilities as learning only gets more difficult through out the ages. I bet most of you were writing bad ass code when you were 21,22,23 and learned a lot faster then than you do now if you're part of the older HN crew.<p>Given my competitive nature, I was never able to play an MMORPG casually. I had to be #1. Being #1 requires a lot of dedication (ie, time invested), and if you are not willing to put in the time, don't bother, you'll never be as good as the other guy or have the same inventory or capabilities as them. You'll be average at best. I have the sense that a large population of HN does not settle for average given the intelligence of the community.<p>Long story short, the only escape I had was to go cold turkey. Going cold turkey doesn't mean saying "Ok, I'm not going to login ever again" - that never works out. You always get sucked back in at some point. I had to go the drastic route. I had to sell all of my assets, which sold for $5,000 USD at the time. There was times when I was going through withdrawals and wanted to purchase my account back, but the original buyer refused. Thank god he did.<p>Saying that this was one of the smartest things I've ever done would be a huge understatement. I've achieved things I'm personally proud of since quitting playing any MMORPG including the following:<p>- I have a healthy balance of a social life and work life.<p>- I am respected among my peers for building new technologies/infrastructure out.<p><pre><code>  - I got married to the love of my life and had a baby girl with her, which is now the most important person in my life.<br /><br />  - I have worked at startups where I've learned priceless lessons.<br /><br />  - I bought a house that I would never be able to afford if I stuck to MMORPGs as my skills were no where near as blossomed as they are now - I'm assuming I'd be working an entry level job somewhere filling in Excel spreadsheets if I kept it up. Even then, I'd be lucky.<br /></code></pre><br />Good riddance. Do I still think about the days I played and get a small itch? Sure.

As a very avid WoW player of some years now, I would say WoW is something that can easily be something that holds your "life progress" or whatever you want to call it back, but it can also just as easily be played at a successful level (define that however you like) without that effect as well.<p>In the guild I'm in now and a guild I was in in the past I see both: players who are quite literally on welfare or unemployment and just play WoW and other games all day (colloquially "living the dream", mostly tongue-in-cheek), while others have what I would consider successful lives. One of our best priests works as some sort of company programmer or server maintainer/admin. Our best healing druid entered his first bodybuilding contest sometime in September of this year and plans on doing another next August iirc. Our guild/raid leader has an office 9-5 selling toys to retailers or something like that. Lots are in college, myself included. An old guild officer of mine was a Googler. A decent amount have wives/kids/gfs/main squeezes. etc.<p>I think the best argument of the post is the social obligations point. There are definitely some people who do "no-life" for the guild and such, but again, I think this is a some do some don't thing (as well as being limited to basically people in guild leadership situations). For every guild leader or officer I know who hasn't left a dead-end guild because of a feeling of obligations to the guild, I probably know twice as many officers who did left anyways, and 3-4x as many raiders who did as well. Anecdotally speaking, I left a guild where I was probably next in line to be guild/raid lead for a much better one, and am now debating doing some sort of ESL teach/travel program next year despite having been an officer in my new guild for roughly 6 months now.</p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">7</div><div class="commenthead">10 points by <a class="userlink" rel="merijnv">merijnv</a> 2  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2055076">1 reply</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>As someone who has played and stopped WoW for significant times over the past years. I think the article has some valid points about the addictiveness of WoW, on the other hand I feel that the choice between "real" work and WoW as presented here is a false dichotomy. "Real" work and WoW are not mutually exclusive.<p>The writer says he started playing he has spend his time working out. I started swimming for 40 minutes each day while playing WoW, a habit I continue now that I stopped.<p>He also states what if you spend the time you invest in WoW into achieving your goals. But you can't just work 24/7. I spend 8 hours a day doing research and hacking at the university, when I get home I just don't have the focus left in me to code or study. In the past I spend this time playing WoW, right now I spend this time reading fiction or hanging in front of the TV.<p>Now probably there are people who lose themselves entirely to the game and can't bring up the discipline to also work on their goals, but as everything in life, its really just about balancing yourself.<p>PS - I actually found myself being more productive during my WoW playing times then during my non-playing times. Reason? If I needed to do something I would not allow myself to log in until it was done. WoW was more addictive then procrastinating so I'd just knuckle down and do it. Now if I need to do something I find myself reading HN instead of just doing it...</p></p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">8</div><div class="commenthead">11 points by <a class="userlink" rel="bretpiatt">bretpiatt</a> 2  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2055068">4 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>Is playing a social game where you interact with other people any different than going out to a club or bar?

When I started, I used to be an occasional player.  But when I hit level 60 (that was the highest level a few years ago) it was impossible to advance further without being in a regular raiding guild.  So I started hardcoring: obligatory raids from 19:00 to 23:30, each evening, five evenings per week. Lower attendance was not tolerated. And gathering/grinding materials for potions/powerups afterwards, util 01:00 or so. This took place in a few months around the summer of 2006.  The reward was worth it: access to all high-level content, epic items, and being member of the most succesful guild on the server. However, after a few months hardcoring like this, the game felt more and more like a boring job. One day I realized that with this playing style, I would quickly lose all interest in this game, which I didn't want, so I quit the guild (only hardcorers were allowed to stay in) and changed to a casual player, which I still am today.<p>I didn't want to quit altogether because there was so much more game content to check out (I enjoy the sights &#38; sounds of WoW very much), and so many other classes to try. Up until then I played exclusively Holy Priest.<p>Blizzard must have somehow realized that players weren't able to get any further without hardcoring. The last years they have created more and more features for the casual player: the Dungeon Finder system, player-vs-player battlegrounds, cross-realm instances, other reward systems; all these have lessened the dependence on a guild.<p>I now sometimes fire up WoW, not everyday, and play a few hours.  I still like it, after all these years (and 3 expansion packs).</p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">13</div><div class="commenthead">6 points by <a class="userlink" rel="ThomPete">ThomPete</a> 2  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2055175">2 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>The problem for me with games like WoW, EQ and so on is that they aren't based enough on skills so to compensate you need to spend a lot of time in the game.<p>To contrast.

The author seems to acknowledge this is the title, but goes on to mostly treat WOW or gaming addiction like it is semi-unique. Granted, blizzard intentionally includes many elements that are more or less designed for addiction (quite common in the industry/genre) and that intention is troubling.<p>But otherwise it does seem like it shares a lot of traits with other addictions. You can waste your life away watching TV, playing games, shooting heroin, blogging, gambling, refreshing facebook, whatever. To be sure certain of those tasks seem much more likely to lead to addiction (warcraft/heroin) but it's clearly not the only factor.<p>There is also the question of whether addiction can be a pre-existing condition more or less waiting to go off. I am far from a psychologist, but I know that drug addicts often suffer from depression or other mental problems and it seems likely that instead of the drugs causing them, at least some times it was the condition that lead to the drugs (though I'm sure they become heavily intertwined). Are WOW addicts more likely to be depressed or agoraphobic? It seems quite possible. Would they have all developed this because of the game? I don't know.<p>I would like to see the industry self police itself a little better. Online games may always be addictive, but are lots of "brain hacks" intentionally being used by the genre to extend lifetime engagement. They're easiest to see in the more transparent copies - Zynga, foursquare, xbox live achievements. Maybe they should need to cut the most manipulative of these out or suffer chinese style regulation. We do, after all, try to shield kids from alcohol and tobacco.</p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">21</div><div class="commenthead">3 points by <a class="userlink" rel="brianwillis">brianwillis</a> 2  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2055013">0 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>&#62;Although WoW is a much better game than Farmville, with a substantially different business model, their tactics are fundamentally the same: use your social obligations to keep you clicking.

For me, I can actually say that the experience was beneficial to some extent. This was around 4,5 years ago, before I even knew HN existed.<p>Before I started playing the game, I heard some of my friends talk about raiding. For people that are not familiar with the concept, once you reach the maximum level in the game you join a guild. Once you're in that guild, you can go into dungeons with people from your guild and slay bosses. These bosses drop items that in turn allow you to upgrade the gear of your character. The cool thing about these bosses is that some of them actually quite challenging to beat. Once every couple of months, the developers of the game add a new dungeon that you can clear with your guild. They were also talking about these high end guilds that apparently consisted of insanely good players that would clear these dungeons before the masses did.<p>To give myself a challenge I decided to play the game but with a goal in mind, join one of these guild. Once I managed this I would quit. I began as a noob. I levelled up a character and joined a guild. Once I outgrew this guild I joined a better one.<p>I played for around a year in this specific guild. While playing here I actually met two people that I would call friends. Their background is so different from mine that the chance is so slim that I could have met them in real life. We've met up several times (in real life) and if I needed their help they'd be there for me. In this guild I was also in charge of leading the group of players through the dungeons. You're in charge of communicating how to do certain things and during the fights you give guidelines if something goes wrong. I raided 4-5 days per week from 19:00 - 23:00ish in this guild.<p>I then managed to join the guild that was N°1 at that time, together with one of my friends from my previous guild. In this guild, it was all about achieving the world first kill of a boss. It's great when you arrive at a boss and you have no idea as what to expect and how to kill it. It can be a pretty hard puzzle sometimes. If you're not there as one of the first you can read up on proven ways to handle the fight, which is less challenging. Also, contrary to popular belief, these guild usually play less then the other guilds. They go all out when a new dungeon is released (1-2 weeks) and then they play one 5 hour day a week for 4-5 hours a day and they wait for the next one. The funny thing is, the majority of the people that were playing here were also working as lawyers, programmers or were entrepreneurs. I spent a couple of months with the guild and once we cleared the last dungeon and had to wait for the next one, I quit. After that, I also quit the game.<p>Many people told me I was addicted to it, but considering it was rather easy for me to quit I'd say I wasn't. I was working towards a goal.<p>So what have I learned? I personally see life as a game. You win some, you lose some. Regardless of what you want to learn or achieve, you can. Also, communication is important in whatever you do, especially when you're in a leadership position. Oh, and I had a great time playing it. :)</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">25</div><div class="commenthead">1 point by <a class="userlink" rel="cheald">cheald</a> 2  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2056106">0 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>The author touches on something that is very important: if you're playing WoW <i>as a substitute</i> for accomplishing things/meeting people/etc, therein lies the problem.

I've never played WoW so I can't comment on that.  But I was kicked out of college indirectly due to my addiction to Counter Strike.<p>I dunno if the same is true for WoW but one of the reasons I believe Counter Strike is so addictive is the time you have to wait after you get killed, before the next round starts.<p>I believe this is due to the fact that variable reinforcement schedules are more resistant to extinction:<p>"Skinner also looked at variable schedules.  Variable ratio means you change the “x” each time -- first it takes 3 presses to get a goodie, then 10, then 1, then 7 and so on.  Variable interval means you keep changing the time period -- first 20 seconds, then 5, then 35, then 10 and so on.<p>In both cases, it keeps the rats on their rat toes.  With the variable interval schedule, they no longer “pace” themselves, because they can no longer establish a “rhythm” between behavior and reward.  Most importantly, these schedules are very resistant to extinction.  It makes sense, if you think about it.  If you haven't gotten a reinforcer for a while, well, it could just be that you are at a particularly “bad” ratio or interval!  Just one more bar press, maybe this'll be the one!"<p>Counter Strike is a variable interval schedule.  Once you die you have to wait an unknown amount of time before you can play again.  This makes counter strike playing behavior more resistant to extinction and I believe one of the big reasons why people get so addicted to it.  If you respawned the second you died in Counter Strike (as you do in deathmatch) I'm fairly positive there would be a much fewer number of people addicted to the game.<br />I believe this is quite a big factor in addiction.  I haven't heard of anyone addicted to any FPS deathmatch multiplayer game.  I'm sure there are some, but much less so than games like counter strike where you have to wait.</p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">27</div><div class="commenthead">1 point by <a class="userlink" rel="adriand">adriand</a> 2  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2056960">0 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>It's all part of the culture of entertainment we've developed, that is surely partly to blame for the economic situation that western societies are finding themselves in.

Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other."<p>Long version:<p>Compared to other kinds of entertainment (books, TV, sports, friends) -- World of Warcraft makes you think about it even when you don't play it. The longer you play the game, the more addicted you are, the more you think about all the things you're gonna do. That's how the game's designed.<p>You think about the game when you're not playing it. It's hard to really focus on something else if you're thinking about the game.<p>Does that sound familiar to you? If you're a hacker, if you are excited about computers, then it must. It's same with hacking and programming. It's the same principle. For example I tried a little Node.js magic the other night and the first thing I did in the morning was getting live comments to work. Then I found out there could be another cool feature, and so on. Excitement. That's what drives hackers. Call it addiction, whatever. Unlike, WoW, you're doing work, you're making money.<p>So please, don't be ever excited about WoW. You don't wanna waste your precious excitement thanks to which you make wonders with programming on WoW.<p>You can do both, but you can't be addicted to both.

A whole bunch of very impressive AAA games came out this year - in  the past I would have played all of them, this year I only played Bad Company 2 and Halo Reach. I think I no longer have the time/energy to make that initial investment in a game, where you jump through a bunch of frustrating hoops until the fun starts and/or you feel immersed in the game world. However, I still enjoy the competition online - outsmarting other humans in a game of skill and strategy.

I'm not sure if I'll ever get bored of that.<p>And for that reason I avoid WoW like the plague: endless human competition, massive social aspect.

Thankfully as a systems programmer in a research firm, I avoided the worst of it, but most people weren't so lucky. Here are some management behaviors that were effective:<p><i>Never thank people for finishing something on time, on budget, and to the project specifications. Instead, heap attention on those who finish in an all-nighter that ends in the final demo.</i> Heroic measures are sometimes necessary and deserve reward, but being part of the process is a big red flag.<p><i>Never set expectations or milestones, just expect the project to be finished on the due date.</i> This had an interesting effect on the work pace. Due to Parkinson's Law, individual workers finish days before the deadline, but that's not enough time to test integration. Major problems are discovered late, and everyone works ridiculous hours to fix it. Thank everyone for making it work at the last minute, rinse and repeat!<p><i>Tell employees to work weekends and nights for projects that could be unnecessary. Make these individual efforts to maximize the time one person wastes.</i> When burning the candle on both ends, it's satisfying when you're done and the work was needed. After all, you took on the impossible, and here it is! But when days or weeks of your life are thrown away with a laugh, you would find another job if you actually had the time.<p>The Perceived Threats were the Bad Things that would happen if our demos failed. Funding lines would dry up, the company would be in trouble, etc. So everyone pitched together to keep the system going. Everyone became so focused that they stopped realizing that it could be done another way.</p></p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">3</div><div class="commenthead">13 points by <a class="userlink" rel="edw519">edw519</a> 3  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2052490">1 reply</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>I once worked at a company that managed to pull off all four conditions with one brilliant but devious hack: The warehouse uniform was a t-shirt imprinted with, "The beatings will continue until morale improves."<p><i>Perceived Threat</i><p>This implied that problems were the workers' fault, not the boss's.

Am not ashamed to name and shame them either. ComXo, a Slough UK, based umbrella company with call2.com, buttontel.com and multivoice.com brands under them. Here's the deal....<p>"We run a tight ship, everyone has to be in at 9am" ... The employer had one person he believed is the cream for the week and their given top spot...everyone else is treated like dead wood for the next week or two. Percieved threat of getting fired if you were the dead wood, and some did...to our amazement..this kept the rest quiet, head down, trying utmost not to get noticed!<p>Small Kindness...This was amazingly executed. The employer introduced an great bonus scheme and got you to agree to it and the job/project delivery based on it. The scheme is known as "MBO"<p>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_by_objectives" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_by_objectives</a>).<p>The objectives were set, one/two meetings take place and then you got a nice tidy sum, around 8% of the total bonus...then the scheme was shutdown, your locked in to the project, otherwise...see perceived threat above!<p>Isolation from other perspectives - provided you met the project deadline, did the utmost to killoff the competition to be the "cream" mentioned about, you were in with a chance to be IT / Sales / product (you name the dept) manager.....keep waiting.....the perception was..."we dont need an manager, we do a great job without one". The employer is the manager for all depts, have you heard such tosh!<p>Perceived inability to escape - Majority was told, they could never get paid as well as they do there, the jobs easy and "you" make it difficult, all you have to do is A,  B  and C, we have to do D, E and F-Z..your lucky! They even went as far saying how would they cope without you...praise that were simply words to keep some staff working till 9PM when they would refuse to pay a penny over the 9-5 allocated!<p>Myself and other ex-employees all feel extremely grateful, we all get together on a regular basis and feel so lucky to have gotten out when we did too! We were only lauging last week when we found they were using their own employees to advertise their services on youtube (try serching for "comxo"), amazing what they got their employee to do in the name of the company!<p>Sorry for the long rant.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">13</div><div class="commenthead">5 points by <a class="userlink" rel="maeon3">maeon3</a> 3  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2052531">0 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>Amazing, I never thought if that way.

(I'm actually rather disappointed I haven't had more time to check out Clojure and to use Haskell and Scala more--I was doing quite a lot of front-end web stuff.)<p>1. Socket.IO (<a href="http://socket.io/" rel="nofollow">http://socket.io/</a>)<p>It lets you use websockets and automatically fall back to flash sockets, long polling, or several other real-time communication methods if websockets aren't supported by the client. There's a JS client and node-compatible server, as well as in-progress server implementations in a few other languages. Node is nice by itself, but it's with things like Socket.IO that it really shines.<p>2. Coffeescript (<a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/" rel="nofollow">http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/</a>)<p>Coffeescript is a nice-looking and nice-to-type syntax on top of JavaScript. It's made JS development a lot friendlier, and I now miss things about it every time I'm programming in Python and Ruby. I now use it whenever I'm doing any significant amount of coding in JS.<p>3. Node.js (<a href="http://nodejs.org/" rel="nofollow">http://nodejs.org/</a>)<p>Node should, by this point, need no introduction. Server-side JS. Plays very nicely with websockets thanks to Socket.IO, making it very easy to write the server-side part of real-time webapps. I've also found it very useful when trying to quickly prototype simple non-webapp things that have to communicate over a network.<p>I haven't had a chance to check out Backbone.js (<a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/" rel="nofollow">http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/</a>) yet beyond a very quick look, but I expect to use it (or something like it) next time I'm developing something that uses a significant amount of client-side JS.<p>I'm also very excited by the continued development on (and Yehuda Katz's participation in) SproutCore (<a href="http://www.sproutcore.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sproutcore.com/</a>).</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">2</div><div class="commenthead">39 points by <a class="userlink" rel="patio11">patio11</a> 3  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2054065">3 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>Twilio.

It sits in front of Apache and caches static content (or anything really) based on rules you define in the Varnish Configuration Language (VCL).<p>Varnish is cool because it is very fast.  It was written by Poul-Henning Kamp, who has a lot of experience in FreeBSD kernel development.  He makes effective use of virtual memory, is careful to avoid memory operations that result in expensive bus transactions on mutli CPU systems, and knows how many system calls it takes to serve up a cache hit.  All of this work has paid off.  Varnish can turn a plodding CMS into a site that screams, and your profiling tools (siege, apache ab) will fall over before the site does.<p>Of course it helps if your CMS supports cache control headers, and isn't utterly laden with cookies, but that's where the VCL language comes in.  You can write code to strip bogus cookies (like google analytics) coming from both the client and the server which vastly improves your cache hit ratios.<p>I like the way Varnish uses a shared memory pool for statistics and logging -- a wealth of information about the system is available to you but it doesn't generate a ton of I/O logging it to a file unless you ask it to.  I love how you can use the telnet admin interface to compile new VCL code into a running system and then switch to it, while keeping old named configurations around in case you need to revert back.<p>Varnish has really helped me make slow sites fast this year, although it hasn't happened without some VCL coding effort and some understanding of how the sites operate.</p></p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">4</div><div class="commenthead">46 points by <a class="userlink" rel="apu">apu</a> 3  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2054028">2 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>Redis.

This totally disconnected the database data structure from the code. Add a new field in the database and there was nothing to change in code.

This is much nicer than the textfile logs -&#62; sql -&#62; processing datapath I was using previously.<p>2. flask: this little framwork is in my sweetspot. It does all the annoying crap of webby stuff, without all the "use our orm/routing model/way of thinking of http" so common in the space<p>3. mongrel2: I like it because it uses 0mq as the backend and sanely integrates some components in a way I feel could be better for many use cases than traditional stacks.<p>4. 0mq: This gets special mention, because it has been around for a while and I was actively using it, but 0mq 2 came out sometime this year, and is different enough from the first round, that it could be considered a separate technology. It isn't revolutionary in the MOM space, but it is a cool lightweight approach, and the core team has the type of dedication I like to see in OSS projects.<p>5. ABSOLUTELY NOT NEW: Haskell -- this year is the first year I've had time to sit down with Haskell for real, and start understanding the weird FP thing. This has made everything I do feel shiny and new, because even though I never actually use Haskell, I find myself writing very short hsskell programs in python and c and the other languages I use in my day job. When I started coding I remember thinking "This must be what a wizard feels like!", Haskell has brought back that feeling for me.</p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">8</div><div class="commenthead">17 points by <a class="userlink" rel="SandB0x">SandB0x</a> 3  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2054019">1 reply</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>New to <i>me</i>: Numpy/Scipy.

I like to have the tightest possible scoping of names, but a common pattern makes that difficult. If you've got a function that produces a good value or indicates that it couldn't do so one way to write it is:<p><pre><code>  Type theVar;<br />  if (theFunction(theVar)<br />    { /*do something with theVar*/ }<br /></code></pre><br />theFunction returns true if it set theVar, false otherwise.<br />The problem is that theVar's visibility extends beyond our interest in it. The ZQ template lets me write this:<p><pre><code>  if (ZQ&#60;Type&#62; theQ = theFunction())<br />    { /*do something with theQ.Get()*/}<br /></code></pre><br />and all of a sudden I don't have to come up with anywhere near as many meaningful names as before.<p>To me it's neat because I've found many unanticipated uses for it e.g. wrapping the values in option-specifying structures where a default is cleanly indicated with a default-inited (or subsequently Clear()ed) ZQ, rather than having a separate 'use default' boolean, or 'set default' function.<p><a href="http://zoolib.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/zoolib/trunk/zoolib/source/cxx/zoolib/ZQ.h" rel="nofollow">http://zoolib.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/zoolib/trunk/zoolib...</a></p></p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">48</div><div class="commenthead">3 points by <a class="userlink" rel="kefeizhou">kefeizhou</a> 3  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2054303">0 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>1.

I mention this not to support my argument but to admit my bias up front. I have other biases as well - about whether this material was leaked, whether it should have been leaked, and whether it should have been published as it has been - but I'm trying to steer clear of such issues here and just address the specific topic of this article. The morality of these leaks is a political question; until there are changes in the law, responsibility for the leaks is a more narrow legal question.<p>For reference, where I talk about the contents of these chat logs I'm referring to the the same source Greenwald does, at <a href="http://firedoglake.com/merged-manning-lamo-chat-logs/" rel="nofollow">http://firedoglake.com/merged-manning-lamo-chat-logs/</a> That seems like factual summary with zero editorial commentary; citing it is not meant to express any particular view on the site's editorial/political stance. However, it does have some sloppy copyediting (summary descriptions of following section appearing inline as if they were the final line of chat) and seem to be somewhat incomplete, per this BoingBoing story <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/06/20/was-alleged-wikileak.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.boingboing.net/2010/06/20/was-alleged-wikileak.ht...</a> - likely an honest mistake, as BoingBoing's writer apparently edited the transcripts subsequently out a desire to avoid prejudice. Finally, I am not a lawyer, and so these are nothing more than the opinions of an amateur.<p>EDIT: downvoting doesn't bother me, but absent comment I have no idea what part of it you disagreed with...</i><p>It seems to me that Greenwald is assuming his own conclusion here, that the chat logs provide evidence of Manning's innocence. They could, of course; and I imagine that Manning's Lawyer will subpoena them for just that reason: if he can not get them from Wired, then he can get them from Lamo or the FBI. (Lamo apparently says the FBI took his computer with the logs on them, but until he says so under oath that doesn't mean a thing.)<p>There are alternative possibilities, which Greenwald does not address, that could well justify Wired's withholding other parts of the chat logs and still maintaining a high standard of journalistic ethics.<p>First: the possibility that the logs contain more evidence of Manning's or Assange's guilt. Lamo makes statements to multiple journalistic sources such as the NYT and Washington Post as well as to Wired; so whether Poulsen reports his remarks first or not, the fact that such allegations are being made is a matter of public record. Poulsen neither confirms nor denies Lamo's allegations with reference to the chat logs. Greenwald argues that he should, as Lamo's accusations amount to prosecuting Manning and Assange in public. However, accusations without evidence are just talk. If Poulsen releases the transcripts, many will see the contents as conclusive evidence, whether they support or undermine Lamo's assertions, or even if they are ambiguous. That could make a fair trial for Assange impossible, if indeed he is charged. It could also amount to conducting Manning's (military) trial in public in a way that undermines his rights.<p>As yet, there's no proof that Bradley Manning was 'Bradass87' or that he was the one conducting those conversations (vs someone else using his login, say), or that the logs are a true and unedited copy of actual chats. But the logs that are public already are being treated as the indisputable truth. That they are public makes it very difficult for Manning's lawyer to attack their admissibility as evidence: if he does so, many people will dismiss his arguments as lies. Just the fact that the public logs have the 'feel' of a real conversation is enough for many people to decide they're authentic, for the same reason that people often remember movies better than they do real history. Even if it can be shown that the chat logs are authentic records of conversations between Manning and Lamo, they are only <i>evidence</i> that Manning believed and said certain things to Lamo. As far as the logs talk about Assange, their legal value is that of hearsay evidence. But opponents of Assange will treat such hearsay remarks as proven facts (they're not even close), while his supporters will say none of it is admissible at all because it's hearsay (not true either). Regardless of which side Poulsen or anyone else is on, making that material public risks undermining justice.<p>Personally, I think it would have been better not to release any transcripts at all in order to avoid biasing a trial (either of Manning or of Assange, if he is charged later). Mind, that's very much a personal opinion. I'm also against police releasing mugshots or making people do perp walks because so many assume that criminal defendants must be guilty because they look bad. But suppose, for argument's sake, that there's so much evidence of Manning being the leaker that the facts are not really in question, and that's why Poulsen felt ethically justified in releasing partial transcripts.<p>This leads me towards the other possibility which might have led Poulsen to release only partial transcripts - the question of Manning's motivations. In the published logs he sounds like someone offended by the government's low ethical standards, unhappy in his job situation, and alternatively bragging and remorseful about the magnitude of the revelations. So his defense might go ahead on the basis of 'yes, he broke his oath and leaked all these documents, but he was young and idealistic and believed himself to be acting on a higher purpose, thus he's really only guilty of exercising very poor judgment.' But (in theory) if the unpublished logs include him having a bad day and going on an extended rant to the effect that 'bin Laden was right' or 'the American empire deserves to collapse' or something? Such sentiments are not unknown, and considering that members of Congress have already been calling for the kid's execution - although none of the charges against him carry the death penalty - if evidence of a 'bad' motivation comes before the public there's likely to be lynch mobs forming outside the camp where he's being held. More likely, there's an entirely different set of possible motivations.<p><i>[Quoting OP article]<br />When I first wrote back in June about Wired's concealment of these chat logs, the excuses Poulsen gave were quickly proved to be false.</i><p>That's very much a matter of opinion. The parts that were not in Wired's original release which later appeared in the WaPo (orange and red text at the link above) all seem to me to have a bearing on these subjects. 'Sensitive information' could refer to the removal of Assange's name/identifying detail in some places, but mostly Wired's redactions seem to concern such personal matters as Manning's emotions, mental stability, and life situation, which might interpreted as damning or mitigating by different people. Greenwald says several parts are neither, but doesn't say which parts or (more importantly) why he thinks so.<p>The personal information here appears to show Manning as a troubled kid who turned to the army in search of the stability that was missing in his life, but became deeply disillusioned with the institution and country he served. It appears that the army had become disillusioned with Manning too, and that he was being discharged for an 'adjustment disorder.' What that means is uncertain, but there's been a lot of speculation to the effect that Manning was gay or had gender identity issues. That's a pretty contentious subject as far as it relates to the military (see the depth of feeling in the recent debate about repealing DADT) and the extent to which it could have affected Manning personally, and the extent to which any lack of stability on Manning's part would be his fault or that of the army's, are questions which could have a significant bearing on his sentence. And because the issue is very contentious, it tends to split opinion further among those already holding polarized opinions: if you think Manning's a bad person, then his personal hangups may compound his moral failings or be an unacceptable sympathy play; if you think he's a good person, then his personal hangups may be an additional justification for leaking the secrets of an unfairly discriminatory, or an unacceptable attempt to smear him as a sexual deviant.<p>It seems to me that Poulsen decided to publish those parts of the logs which showed Manning's access to, awareness of, and methods for leaking classified information. In other words, the published excerpts offer answers to the question of where multiple different leaks of military and diplomatic information came from (one single intelligence analyst tasked with cross-referencing army intel with that from other branches of government); whether the leaking was a deliberate act, or an accidental result of bureaucratic incompetence (deliberate, with understanding of content, likely publicity, and negative impact); and whether the allegations were credible (obviously the government intranet does not include a 'leak to public?' option, and the weak point was the CD-RW supposedly filled with Lady Gaga tunes (am I the only person who finds this detail bizarrely ironic?)). All this information is concerned with factual issues. Courts-martial have to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt as do civilian courts, but they differ in terms of things like jury requirements, which may make it easier to deal with the publication of factual evidence than would be the case for a civilian trial. But while it may be easy to prove the acts occurred, mental state, criminal responsibility, and would be an appropriate sentence are much trickier questions. Because such matters are inherently subjective, the standards for evaluating them are different from those for establishing material fact, and there are different risks of potential bias.<p>My guess is that Wired's legal department (rather than Poulsen as an individual) would have gone through the transcripts marking different sections as factual or subjective, with lesser or greater possibilities of bias and thus legal liability for publication.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">3</div><div class="commenthead">52 points by <a class="userlink" rel="jeremymims">jeremymims</a> 6  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2043088"> replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>Glenn Greenwald has consistently delivered the best analysis of what has been going on with Wikileaks.

It's dying because it's not terribly easy to understand for most users. The article readily points this out.<p>And even for technical users like me, it isn't solving the main problem I have which is discovering new and interesting content. Sure, once I've found some new source of content it's nice to put its RSS feed into a reader. But really, bookmarking is pretty good too. Yes there are clear benefits to RSS over naked bookmarks, but the discoverability problem is still paramount.<p>Anyway this is kind of inconsequential to the point of whether native RSS functionality should be included in a browser. Mozilla is right to kill this "feature." RSS is an application-level protocol on top of HTTP, itself an application-level protocol. Browsers are built to perform HTTP requests. In my opinion they shouldn't do much else. A feature that displays and helps you manage RSS content falls into the category of bloat.</p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">4</div><div class="commenthead">23 points by <a class="userlink" rel="corin_">corin_</a> 12  hours ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2060370">3 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>I can't imagine that browser button pursuading anyone who doesn't already understand and appreciate RSS to start using it.

And there will always be RSS readers because every programming environment I can think of has a pre-built library for feed reading meaning a programmer could whip a reader up in under an hour.<p>As far as the button disappearing from browsers that just makes UI sense.  Chrome Browser taught the rest of the industry that most people hate clutter in their browser.  So buttons that 93% of the users don't use are being taken out.  But they can be added back with a simple browser extension/plug-in/whatever.

A full-featured RSS reader feels a lot like a mailing list, so I think it's appropriate to keep RSS in Thunderbird rather than Firefox.<p>In some respects, a web-app RSS reader (like Bloglines or Google Reader) is better. You can access your feeds from any computer, the read/unread status is kept synchronized between PCs, and the centralized web-app arrangement makes more efficient use of network resources. Better to have Google Reader poll a site every 30 minutes than to have 10,000 Firefox installs each polling it every few hours.<p>The only browsers I know of that ever had good in-browser RSS readers were Opera and Seamonkey.

Exposing it in the browser doesn't work very well and treating RSS as an Inbox (like Google Reader) where every item needs to be marked as read is too overwhelming.

(And as a bonus, I can hand it out to techie users).<p>I don't know, do you think that RSS readers dying will mean websites will stop producing RSS feeds?

I would be genuinely interested in his designs for one.  Of the many different RSS reader add-ons I've tried for Firefox, for example, there haven't been any that made me say "we've gotta put this in Firefox, let's delay $otherwork instead".  If we had an energetic contributor like Kroc, though, it's quite possible that we could end up in a great place.  I'm not trying to say "patches talk, chump", though of course they <i>do</i> speak quite compellingly. I'm trying to indicate that via open projects like Mozilla technical people can have agency beyond voting in bugzilla (!) or a letter-writing campaign.<p>It'll be interesting to test Kroc's thesis, though: if he's right that RSS will be harmed a lot by Firefox removing the RSS icon, then hits to the RSS stream from Firefox UAs should change trend-line between 3.6.x and 4.

It had to be batched and returned, sometimes hours later.  Imagine getting things done with only one compile per day.<p>- The programmer is giving an obscene gesture to the terminal because he forgot a semicolon (more likely a period in his COBOL program) and will now have to wait another day for a clean compile.  Move that deadline back to October.<p>- The terminal the programmer is giving an obscene gesture to is a state-of-the-art Datawriter, a PAPER-DRIVEN terminal.  A moment of silence is needed for all the trees sacrificed for our future.<p>- The programmer was special because he had access to the Datawriter, which was probably in the computer room.   Anyone else, including all users, had to use pencil and special forms (like taking their SATs) to enter data into the IBM Mainframe.  Those forms went to the Data Control Unit where teams of mostly women keypunched the data onto 80 column cards which were fed into a hopper.  The early keypunch machines put the holes in the cards as you typed, so that if you made a mistake, you had to start over with a new card.  Later, these machines had memory, so you could finish the virtual card, and hit a key that did the whole card.  Probably saved a lot of paper.<p>- Notice all the coats hanging in the break room.  It may have been winter, but just as likely, they were needed in the computer room.  It was cold in there!<p>- Note that the "Data Terminal" pictures are at the bottom of the page in the mini-computer section.  This was a big deal back then.  Mini-computers got CRT displays before IBM mainframes.  That's how they competed with Big Blue.  For programmers, this was as big an advance as we would ever get.  Imagine building that web app today, buying cases of cards from Office Depot and getting one compile per day.<p>- The Demonstration Center was a big deal, too.  Several places I worked had the computer room behind glass in the lobby.  Companies wanted their customers to physically see how advanced their technology was.<p>Thanks for the memories.  Now burn those pictures.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">2</div><div class="commenthead">43 points by <a class="userlink" rel="S_A_P">S_A_P</a> 3  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2052094">2 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>Love how everything had color back then.

(Don't remember how I got a job there, but I do remember adding some small features to their WATFOR Fortran compiler over one summer.)<p>TSO (time-sharing option) was a huge upgrade at the time, running as a permanent "job" under OS/360, and virtualizing the job partition to run separate sub-jobs per terminal user.

On certain occasions, this person was able to bring home thick printouts of the actual COBOL code that ran in the bank's mainframes. Probably one of my first exposures to source code. The lines would alternate between a green and white paper color. Along both the left and right edges were rows of holes, needed by the printer mechanism. The code itself was highly highly verbose plus was probably &#62;50% comments, both inline and in section delimiting blocks. I later got into BASIC programming myself as my first language, then 6502 Assembly, then C. Though I appreciate Java's strengths, I totally understand why some folks call Java the New COBOL: it's pretty verbose, full of ritual, and it's used everywhere now in large corporations and government. (Not sure if used in banks heavily, but would not be surprised. Though I know COBOL is still running in many banks as well.)</div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">8</div><div class="commenthead">6 points by <a class="userlink" rel="lukeschlather">lukeschlather</a> 3  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2053320">1 reply</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>Out of curiosity, how were those photos preserved?

The iPhone is an aggregation of things that collectively make up either an ecosystem or something akin to it.  And in most cases, the pieces of that ecosystem had been built up over a considerable time before the iPhone was a twinkle in Jobs' eyes.<p>For RIM to duplicate the iPhone would require them to give up on a lot of long held beliefs (e.g. physical keyboard), to ignore most of the tech pundits (the pundits themselves don't like to remind us that they were busy ridiculing the very concept of a one-button phone right up to and in some cases even after it started selling like hot-cakes), to focus on the consumer instead of the business user and last but by no means least to madly start implementing and iterating on their own consumer eco-system.<p>Now the iTunes store is by no means perfect, but if you don't have a drop in replacement for it, what are you going to replace that part of the eco-system with?  I think a lot of people grossly underestimate the time and effort it takes to create a system like the iTunes store, and never mind even all the iterations in features... how about the task of sitting down with every single recording industry association in every country that your product will be sold?  How about doing the same thing for movies and then telcos?  You'd have to be a masochist of the first degree.<p>On that note, one of the enormously revolutionary things that Apple did was to break the choke-hold that telcos had over the handset manufacturers.  On an iPhone, you always have access to the App store and iTunes stores... on a Blackberry it is up to the telco whether you get App World at all.<p>In any case, RIM should play to <i>their own</i> strengths, not Apples.  RIM groks business the same way Apple groks consumers.  (But of course business users are <i>also</i> consumers, while this 'should' give Apple a big advantage breaking into the corporate market, they <i>consistently</i> fail to capitalise on it.  I think the difference is they have to fight for the corporate space, whereas in the consumer space everyone else is falling over themselves competing to make the cheapest (read as: least profitable, also in the sense of 'nasty'), ugliest and hardest to use devices).<p>RIM has their own eco-system in the corporate space, mainly revolving around the BES (Blackberry Enterprise Server)... but what does that do?  It encrypts your email and pushes it to you (via Canada).  But is that really such a big deal now?<p>They have a plethora of device models, with differentiation based on presence or absence of things like GPS, trackballs and cameras, and also how wide you want your keyboard to be.  I'm not convinced that having so many options is helpful, but they seem to have a hard time deprecating the old ones.<p>Lately they have been making inroads with the teenage market in the UK because they have a cheap alternative to SMS (one advantage of running your own server infrastructure I guess).  But I wonder how many of those teens also carry iPods?<p>It is easy to look at a Blackberry and say something like "oh, this is why they're failing, their camera is bad and the browser is worse".  But that is overly simplistic.  When comparing the iPhone to other smartphones, the iPhone has two killer features: ecosystem and ease of use.  You may put out a phone that physically has all the features of an iPhone, but you get an extra 10% megapixels... and the world is not going to beat a path to your door.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">8</div><div class="commenthead">7 points by <a class="userlink" rel="elvirs">elvirs</a> 6  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2043804">2 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>Thats why even years later they tried to replicate iPhone and failed (see Blackberry Storm)</div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">9</div><div class="commenthead">1 point by <a class="userlink" rel="ankimal">ankimal</a> 6  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2044202">0 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>Thank God for the spirit of innovation and the never say die attitude.</div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">10</div><div class="commenthead">-2 points by <a class="userlink" rel="guelo">guelo</a> 6  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2043970">3 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>I don't know what the point of this article is except as some kind of Apple gloat.

It's like a huge step backwards. The argument is that you can filter out the garbage as your social graph will provide a level of curation.<p>Let me give you a concrete example. If I wanted t buy a camera I'd stil need t go to dpreview and other sites. It's highly likely that my friends don't really know a lot about this (but some will have an opinion anyway).<p>This same idea of human curation is behind such sites ad Mahalo and the garbage sites themselves to a degree. Of course at some point computers will be powerful enough to generate this garbage content.<p>Blekko's idea of slash tags s interesting (to a degree) but if it's successful its easily reproducible.

D's) are not good enough to have effective search, so we should introduce the human element.<p>Fair enough. There is the Open Directory Project (which is pretty old) and of course there is Facebook, Twitter, and other, human-curated services. Starting a whole new company to do search and compete with Google (and Bing)? Seems like a waste of time as Google can just copy what you are doing and incorporate it into its already massive site (complete with traffic, audience, and lots of other goodies). Instead, why not get Google to add more social recommendation and feedback features?</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">21</div><div class="commenthead">1 point by <a class="userlink" rel="DTrejo">DTrejo</a> 1  day ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2059188">0 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'><a href="http://duckduckgo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://duckduckgo.com/</a> works very well for me.<p><pre><code>  - less spam<br />  - programmer oriented results, when relevant<br />  - more legible search results</code></pre></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">22</div><div class="commenthead">3 points by <a class="userlink" rel="kokon">kokon</a> 1  day ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2058198">0 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>CMIIW, but is that the reason why Google acquired MetaWeb a few months ago?

I would pause before taking a sandwich from Hitler, because I'm human, but it's not pertinent to the question of whether the sandwich is any good. (Except in as far as you think it more or less likely that the sandwich is poisoned etc.)<p>So I find the whole first half of the text to be a flabby way of saying that the arguments of dishonest people need to be evaluated more critically than those of honest people. But I find that the arguments of honest people need to be critically evaluated too. I think that the authors of Haystack were honest, but their assertions turned out to be dangerously wrong. (Which, by the way, we know thanks to Mr Appelbaum.) So, as a guide, the motives of the author don't seem to be very useful to me.<p>Then, in the second half, we find a mixture of arguments that I find valid, and many that I don't. A sense of vertigo at the amount of trust that we have to put into software is justified. It is possible to hide major bugs in code and we're standing on a stack of hardware, kernel, and userland which is incomprehensible to any one person these days.<p>It's also true that there are some fairly effective attacks against Tor for the capable opponent. It's a real-time mix-net, with all the tradeoffs implied and it generates a lot of research. I recommend reading some papers of the papers, I find them often to be very good.<p>But accusing the Tor people of being NSA agents because they once got funding from the navy doesn't hold water. The Internet was an ARPA funded project. Military spending has subsidised much of the modern world.<p>Many people have read through Tor's source and evaluated the protocol etc. Of course, all those people could be NSA agents too, publishing fake papers. You could, in fact, be in The Matrix. But you probably aren't.<p>Some, likely massively exaggerated, secret project might be monitoring every ISP on the planet and thus able to break any real-time mix net, but they probably aren't.<p>Likewise, all the Tor node operators that I have met might all be NSA plants, but they probably aren't.<p>And finally the author picks out Mr Appelbaum for special criticism because he connects him with Wikileaks. I think his assertion that the goals of Tor and Wikileaks are in conflict is wrong, but we could go around all day trying to pin down the goals of Wikileaks so that's probably not fruitful. But it does seem ironic that the author voices support for Wikileaks right after asserting that such supporters are not to be trusted.<p>So, while the stack of software is, indeed, large, Tor remains a reasonable tool to use. If the author is so concerned with the human aspect, the Tor authors are make regular appearances at conferences and are wonderful people to meet. So do, and are, node operators in my experience.<p>Also, on top of Tor, there's a fair chance that the author is using a browser who's network and SSL stack I've had a hand in. And who knows what kind of person he's taking a sandwich from now?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">2</div><div class="commenthead">62 points by <a class="userlink" rel="poet">poet</a> 5  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2045387">5 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>It's shit like this Zed...<p>Two basic claims: Tor is tainted because (1) the concepts the software is based on were developed with partial funding from the military and (2) Zed thinks one of the committers is untrustworthy.  Guess what? That describes a huge amount of software, including <i>Mac OS X and Firefox</i>.  God damn Zed, this Hitler sandwich shit is pretty weak.<p>Zed also has a problem with Tor because he thinks there is a "gigantic percentage of hackers and security experts on the volunteer payroll of a group who's job is to illegally wiretap people and circumvent the law on behalf of the government".  He thinks some of these people work on Tor and thus Tor is untrustworthy. Funny though, <i>his ISP is likely guilty of the same thing</i>. I wonder if Zed takes that into account as a part of his paranoid fantasy.<p>There are serious problems with using Tor and Zed fails to mention any of them. You'll want to read what Thomas has to say on the subject (<a href="http://searchyc.com/tptacek" rel="nofollow">http://searchyc.com/tptacek</a>). Specifically, Thomas mentions that a general problem with tools like Tor is that it identifies your traffic as a subset of all traffic thats probably worth monitoring. You're essentially adding bright red neon signs to your most sensitive traffic.  The amount of traffic going through the Tor network is small enough that it is a tractable problem for a nation state to attempt to monitor all of it. Thomas also goes into how the incentive structure for these tools is completely broken.  The defenders are academic researchers going for tenure, the attackers are nation states with millions of dollars to spend, and the users are dissidents that get killed when the tool fails.  Unfortunately, arguments with this level of nuance appear to escape Zed in this case. I fear he doesn't have the domain knowledge to write something intelligent about this issue.</p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">3</div><div class="commenthead">28 points by <a class="userlink" rel="dublinclontarf">dublinclontarf</a> 5  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2045280"> replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>As someone living on the other side of the Great Firewall of China it's become VERY clear that a government can effectively censor the internet(without VPN to get out it's terrible), provided that the government in question put enough effort into it.<p>As I said in another comment, the Chinese government has beaten Tor.

TOR hides your IP address by preventing the destination server ever needing to do a TCP/IP handshake. There is no way to complete a TCP/IP handshake without you revealing your IP address. TOR then also stops the server you /do/ handshake with knowing the destination of your packet.<p>This is all TOR is supposed to do. This allows you to be anonymous to the receiving end, but it does not guarantee it. It is your responsibility to surf safely, to sanitise your traffic, to encrypt your traffic and do the rest. We know that most people can be uniquely differentiated by combining all the available information from their browsers (some of which doesn't need javascript) <a href="http://panopticlick.eff.org/" rel="nofollow">http://panopticlick.eff.org/</a> . Therefore we know, using TOR or not, that we need to be careful to do things well when we want to be anonymous.<p>There is little in this article which makes me worried about TOR.

I'm thankful for open source and the people who read code, but I am not going to read the source code of every damn piece of software I use.  Sometimes I'm just going to say, "The only source for this software is a shareware site in a country I've never heard of, and it claims to come bundled with porn, so I do not feel comfortable installing it on my Windows PC no matter how good some guy on 4chan says it is."  Nothing against porn or countries I've never heard of, but my Spidey sense is tingling.</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">16</div><div class="commenthead">21 points by <a class="userlink" rel="tonfa">tonfa</a> 5  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2045176">1 reply</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>Wikileaks is supposed to ensure anonymity to leakers, so I don't see how contributing to both projects is contradictory...</div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">17</div><div class="commenthead">16 points by <a class="userlink" rel="kungfooguru">kungfooguru</a> 5  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2045370">0 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>"I haven't once seen you answer the claims I made."<p>Woo, Zed is the new Glenn Beck.</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">18</div><div class="commenthead">2 points by <a class="userlink" rel="noonespecial">noonespecial</a> 5  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2046078">0 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>It's important to remember that TOR is an <i>anonymizer</i> not an encryption scheme.

How do such long terms contribute to the progress of sciences or the arts? The writers and main contributors to most of the pieces named are dead. The publishers have made their cash time and time again and now most of these pieces are by no means "hot sellers", though they may be of cultural or historical interest. And, there's 40 years left before the copyright expires.<p>All this does is allow two extra generations to leech off of the creativity of their fathers without actually contributing anything themselves. Same goes for the two subsequent generations that fill the publishing houses that originally print these works.<p>Do we really believe that Lord of the Rings or Lord of the Flies would not have been written or published if the copyright term was only 28 years (in fact, they _were_ published when the copyright term was 28 years)? It should be evident that cultural experiences will be generated even if the money doesn't flow down for 100-200 years (not that there won't be money anyway -- they'll just have to do something useful with the property, just like anyone else).<p>The whole thing is just patently ridiculous. What do we gain by refusing to allow free commentary or contribution on Lord of the Rings? Tolkien is dead and gone and made a comfortable existence on his work I'm sure. If he was concerned with ensuring his posterity and publisher would have money from his work, he could have taken various measures to do so, like divesting large amounts of money to them in his will.<p>It is ridiculous that all of society and culture has to suffer because of corporate lobbyists that don't want Disney et al to lose money. It's not like the publishers are being robbed here, they've made more than enough money on these properties and now it's time to share. Intellectual property was never meant to trap ideas -- it was meant to make their sharing plausible and reasonable (before the internet, there was significant overhead involved with publication and wide dissemination of such material). Now we just have leeches looking to ensure their own fat paycheck at the expense of free culture.<p>I would be very happy to see a copyright law of 28 years since publication or less with no extensions, applied retroactively to all works under copyright in the United States. I don't see why life of the author should be considered -- if someone writes a good story, that's great, but 28 years of unlimited monopoly on that is quite enough. And note that public domain doesn't mean the copyright holder can't make money anymore -- it just means he has to provide something that the market deems valuable, instead of standing as a gatekeeper and profiting off of everyone else's imagination.</p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">2</div><div class="commenthead">24 points by <a class="userlink" rel="ajays">ajays</a> 7  hours ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2061079"> replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>The current copyright law is a prime example of the impotence of the electorate in the face of the power of Big Money.

When you're doing something in the realm of social norms (e.g., for fun, for helping other people, for recognition, etc.) it's great because you get that warm fuzzy feeling inside for doing it.  The minute you cross into market norms (accepting profit for what you've done), it takes on a different form entirely and can lead some people to be less productive or motivated in their pursuit.  Not that either way is necessarily good or bad, it's just that when social crosses into market the initial spark can lose a lot of its appeal.  That might be why a lot of weekend projects are never properly monetized.  Apps built for fun are great when they're purely in the social norm realm (and stay that way), but lose a little bit when they cross into a for-profit.</div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">16</div><div class="commenthead">2 points by <a class="userlink" rel="doorty">doorty</a> 5  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2045772">0 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>I think it comes down to what your motivations are--money or fun. Then there are companies like Twitter that have no obvious revenue model when they get started, so do you call it a business? And how often do the Twitters of this world really scale up enough to actually call themselves a business. Given you're a developer, you're going to focus more on the creation of the product. Whereas someone without those skills is going to approach it from a business perspective in all likelihood. If it's just a weekend project, I would say go have some fun with it. But if you're going to invest some time in it as a way to make a living, it's worth doing that ground work before you even get started to make sure people are willing to pay for it.</div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">17</div><div class="commenthead">5 points by <a class="userlink" rel="J3L2404">J3L2404</a> 5  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2045655">0 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>Building things is more fun than marketing.</div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">18</div><div class="commenthead">2 points by <a class="userlink" rel="lwhi">lwhi</a> 5  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2046297">0 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>An app without a business is like a vine without a trellis.</div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">19</div><div class="commenthead">1 point by <a class="userlink" rel="Tycho">Tycho</a> 4  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2048814">0 replies</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>Ironically, that's a good business idea for someone: 'MonetizeMe.com'<p>It would be a company that specialises in taking a working web-app and setting up the payment gateway and other details necessary for making it a commercial endeavour.

Healthy cells will limit their own growth, and one theory is that the length of the telomeres at the end of the chromosomes plays an important role in limiting that growth. Cancer cells use high levels of the enzyme telomerase to regrow their telomeres, and thus the cells become "immortal". I am putting quote marks around the word "immortal" because it is important to be aware of what biologists mean when they use the word. The usage should be carefully qualified.<p>Anyone with cancer can be said to have "immortal" cells. Of any woman with cancer you could write: "I found out there was once a woman who had immortal cells."<p>Henrietta Lacks cells are important not because they are unique but because they are ordinary.

I am confident I'm an introvert I definitely NEED my quiet time - plenty of it.  I absolutely suck at small talk.  In fact, it's one of the things that causes me the most anxiety about business meetings.  I'm cool with the meeting/presentations/etc..., but if we have to go to lunch or dinner, I'm petrified!<p>Below are a couple of things that help me, and I'm curious if other introverts have adopted any tools to help them:<p>1.  Alcohol!  Of course, this isn't always appropriate, but it does seem to work.  Hah.<p>2.  Adopt a passion in a subject that is applicable to a large audience that falls outside your primary expertise.  For example - Fitness.  As the article states, introverts are perfectly capable of engaging in conversations that interest them without the exhaustion that comes with normal small talk.  Most people are interested in fitness.  Therefore, if the introvert is highly interested in fitness, it stands to reason that he can steer a conversation in that direction and engage with a wide array of personalities.  Food/Nutrition, Travel, history are other examples that might work.<p>How about you?</p></p></p></p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><div class="commentnumber">6</div><div class="commenthead">4 points by <a class="userlink" rel="blr_hack">blr_hack</a> 5  days ago <a title="number and link to replies to this comment" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2044961">1 reply</a> <span  title="expand this comment" class="commentopener">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class='text'>Some thoughts:<p>1) Am I the only one thinking, that some of the terms used to describe introverts: "guarded," "loner," "reserved," "taciturn," "self-contained," "private", have since long been stopped to be considered as negatives?<p>2) Think, Introverts easily command more respect, on an average, than extroverts (no data to back this up.

I find that <i>most</i> people are socially tiring, though I have a small network of friends I dont mind hanging out with long term.  The metaphor of gasping for air in a fog of contentless conversation is a great way to put it.  I was at dinner last night and remember counting the empty sentences of one of the people at my table.<p>I am also usually pretty quiet in meetings where people are hashing ideas out.  I usually like to think things through before speaking from a place of authority on them, which for me means doing a proof of concept and assessing the problems at that point.

Being a startup guy makes this much harder as I have to meet new people now and then. I love meeting new people, but the talking becomes unbearable, and I usually find a way out of the conversation to avoid awkwardness.
