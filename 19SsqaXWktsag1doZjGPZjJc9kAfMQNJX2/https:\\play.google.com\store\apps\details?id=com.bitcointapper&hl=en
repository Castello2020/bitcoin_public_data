Give me my coins that I have earned you cheats. Full Review Chris Murray April 29, 2014 You should pay out all the users that tapped before the feature was removed Full Review Nathaniel Visentin March 6, 2014 Doesn't work anymore Full Review Arunscape Woosaree February 23, 2014 Could use bigger payouts It's nice how you get free coin, but at this rate I'll never reach the payout threshold. I don't mind ads too much, so maybe you could turn them up to solve that... Full Review James Gosnell February 21, 2014 Crap payments. I was in love. Making on random like 0.0003-0.001 btc per click on a nice free app, then it dropped to like 0.000001 btc per click Full Review Casey Verreras February 19, 2014 This app is trash. Uninstall Gives you 0.000001 btc every 24hrs. So in a few years I might have enough to withdraw the bitcoin from it. Uninstall. Full Review A Google User February 24, 2014 . Had this app for 7 or so months, developer shut down payments. Disappointed at the amount of time wasted. Full Review Chris McCartin February 25, 2014 No more free BTC Like many other people, I was racking up the BTC and then started getting .000001 per day once I got close to the threshold. Now they say no more free BTC. What's the point of this app now? Waste of time! Full Review Jack Stephens February 22, 2014 . One thing. Needs higher payment, and to do it put some ads on the app. Full Review Alex Scott February 17, 2014 Terrible program You get random amounts untill you get enough to be close to pay out then you only get like 0.00001. Bullshit program Full Review Richard Jurica February 17, 2014 Just like Mikey Fischer stated. Random amounts of coins. Then I got about .003500 and ever since it adds .000001 a day. That means another ten thousand clicks and I can cash out...Unfortunately, that's 30 years. Full Review Rui Costa February 21, 2014 10 days after payment request, still waiting for the Bitcoins. No answer to emails. Don't use it! Full Review Jonathan Meuller January 21, 2014 Meh Don't get suckerd into paying for premium, it doesn't work and dev can't seem to figure it out. I printed qr codes of my addresses and just scan every 24 hours. I'm also in the beta.group and there is a huge lack of support... Full Review Mikey Fischer February 15, 2014 A complete waste It's a completely misleading program. It requires you to accumulate ". 012 bc" before you can cash out. But to do this, you tap once per day a button to gain random amounts of coins, but once you reach about ". 0.003" the rate drops so low that it will literally take you years to withdraw. It's a bs program. Full Review What's New - Free Bitcoin Tap feature has been removed due to funding issues.- App has been revamped with new features. Stay tuned for more updates!
