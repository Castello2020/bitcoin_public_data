That is one point, but yes.
&gt; 
&gt; Please restate
&gt;    o HTTPS is your preferred method for resolution because?
Because it allows for the giving of different addresses to each client
based on IP much easier.  Its possible with DNS by setting TTL to 0 and
hoping that Bitcoin clients will be using their own resolver, but that
is far from guaranteed.  Additionally, HTTPS stuff has already been
coded and implemented, so there&#39;s that...

Frankly, HTTPS&#39; advantages are very small here, but since they exist,
and DNS has no advantages that I can see, I don&#39;t see any reason to go
with DNS here.  I much prefer using a HTTPS library (of which there are
many which have had much more thorough security audits) than a
DNSSEC-implementing DNS recursion library with the root trust anchors
and root servers built-in (are there any?).

Maybe I&#39;m missing something here?

[Bitcoin-development] "To:" addresses missing
From: John Smith <witchspace81@gm...> - 2011-07-26 14:41:14
Attachments:
Message as HTML I first thought it was a problem in my UI, after syncing to the latest git
version. But the following screenshot says enough:

http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/7363/screencpf.png

The address are also missing in the detailed transaction view. It appears
that the problem is in script.cpp:

        BOOST_FOREACH(PAIRTYPE(opcodetype, valtype)&amp; item, vSolution)
        {
            uint160 hash160;
            if (item.first == OP_PUBKEY)
                addressRet.SetPubKey(item.second);
            else if (item.first == OP_PUBKEYHASH)
                addressRet.SetHash160((uint160)item.second);
            if (keystore == NULL || keystore-&gt;HaveKey(addressRet))
                return true;
        }

It will only return &#34;true&#34; on keys that are in the keystore (your own
private keys...). After commenting out the &#34;if (keystore == NULL ...&#34; line,
the display is fixed.

But that simple solution might have impact somewhere else.

&gt; 
Yes, DNSSEC is great if you are running your own recursive name server.
However, that is probably something like 0.01% of the people out there.
If this were to be made secure, one would have to implement a full
recursive nameserver inside of Bitcoin with the root trust anchors
hardcoded in.  This seems like way overkill to do name-&gt;address mapping.
(My attack scenario here is coffee shop wifi with the default DNS
resolvers being somewhere at the ISP and a ARP (or other) MITM attack
intercepting and playing with your DNS queries).
Additionally, HTTPS mapping offers some advantages such as ease of
offering up different to different people by eg. IP address (could be
done by setting DNS TTL to 0 and assuming all users will be using a
built-in resolver, but its still not guaranteed that other clients would
use a built-in resolver and then the IP of the resolver is not the same
as the IP of the Bitcoin node).  
Not that DNS is a terrible idea, but there are clear advantages for
using HTTPS (or similar) mapping over DNS and I see no clear advantage
for using DNS over HTTPS (aside from the &#34;that is what it is designed
for&#34; argument, which I would claim is an invalid argument as you have to
consider the technology, not its intent).
&gt; Also, a DNS mapping does not prevent or deny anyone from leveraging
&gt; HTTP(S) for simular mapping. My point is that DNS is designed for name
&gt; to thing mapping and its done a decent job. What I like about the DNS
&gt; is that it is frequently leveraged as a proxy for identity and http
&gt; URIs are not. Where https://wesson.us/ricks-bitcoin-address doesn&#39;t
&gt; feel like and identity (to me) and rick.wesson.us does.
&gt; 
&gt; My point is about usability and user experience. Bitcoin if used in
&gt; the DNS might make DNSSEC more popular which IMHO is a good thing.
Hold on there, Bitcoin is still tiny, I highly, highly doubt it will
make a difference to DNSSEC adoption.

also working on a internet-draft to describe how to put bitcoin addresses in

I&#39;d appreciate comments on issues around annomity, community push back and
