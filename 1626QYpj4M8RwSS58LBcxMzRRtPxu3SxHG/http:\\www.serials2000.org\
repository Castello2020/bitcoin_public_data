<h3><font color="red">Home of The GeFcReW and the Legacy that is Serials2000</font></h3>
<p align="center"><em>A message from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GregFultzPublic">Founder</a> of GeFcReW and owner of the domain Serials2000.org </em></p>
<p align="left"><font color="black" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The GeFcReW took over Serials2000.org in 2004 and from then to present we have held it in high regard with pride and respect for what the founders of S2K created. It's been an honor and privilege to carry on the legacy that they created. The site as you know has been on hiatus due to our personal lives getting busy and the need for S2k waning so did the support for the site but like all good things there is an end to everything.</font></p>
<p align="left">For the last couple years we have been debating on what to do with the site there is still a large dedicated following for S2K and of course the loyal fans and supporters as well. So with that said if anyone thinks that they can carry on the torch with as much pride and respect as we have and those before us you are welcome to contact us at [admin {at} serials2000.org] and we can discuss the options. As for the GeFcReW we are going to officially retire but we will not leave our dedicated and loyal supporters behind with no where to go. </p>
<p align="left">Our ViP's are still welcome to join our home away from home &quot;FookerVille&quot; the sister/companion site to serials2000.org where old friends can still fook around with each other and just hang out in the community forum and discuss a wide range of different topics including things still going on in the S2K scene. The ViP section of Fookerville will give some benefits not available to the public. So it's still a worthy place to fill the void that S2K will leave behind. </p>
<p align="left">As for the domain, we have decided to turn it into a memorial site and lay it to rest. It was first registered by the founders in 1999. So we think it's had a good long run and it's full of history so we will give it a final &quot;facelift&quot; and include the legacy of S2k and share the history of the site and how it come to be. If you have any information that you want included any memories or historical information please feel free to share your thoughts on the matter at [history {at} serials2000.org].</p>
<p align="left">So in closing, Thank you to everyone that supported the GeFcReW for the last 7+ years we could not of done this without you and it was a pleasure to continue the S2K legacy for as long as we did. if you wish to you can make a donation of any amount below for the years of service we offered you and of course any donation over $5 will recieve the ViP title at FookerVille. </p>
<p align="left">Cheers Everyone! </p>
