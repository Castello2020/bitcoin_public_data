Mother Trades Daughter for Car, Sells Other Daughter into Prostitution Deathpenalty for mum would be nice!
Sick f*ck. Police: Okeechobee mom sells daughters for car, prostitution Associated Press OKEECHOBEE, Fla. - A mother is under arrest, accused of selling a 12-year-old daughter into prostitution and trading a 14-year-old daughter for a car. The 39-year-old woman, whose name is not being released to protect the girls' identity, is charged with two counts of aggravated child abuse and two counts of sexual performance by a child. She was being held Tuesday in the Okeechobee County Jail on $400,000 bond. Both girls have been turned over to the Department of Children & Families, the Okeechobee News reported for Wednesday editions. The youngest girl and her mother were living out of their car and the prostituting was for food and an occasional shower at the men's homes, according to a report by Okeechobee County Sheriff's Office Detective K.J. Ammons The youngest daughter is currently three months pregnant, the report said, and the girl was 11 when her mother first forced her to have sex with a man. She charged $20 for the sex. The older daughter refused to be used as a prostitute and was allegedly sold for car. "She was sold to a man for a Mercury Cougar," Ammons said. "But, he never gave the mother the vehicle." Ammons said the car has an estimated value of $500-to-$1,000. That 23-year-old man has since been arrested. He was charged with sexual performance by a child and was booked into the county jail and is held on $100,000 bond. The youngest girl told detectives that her mother pulled both girls out of school for fear they would tell someone. "She said she was a good student and made A's and B's, and all she wants to do is go back to school," Ammons said. Ammons said DCF will get the girls into a new school.

Re: Mother Trades Daughter for Car, Sells Other Daughter into Prostitution That is sick! The mother should be put away in a black pit somewhere and left to rot. The men who had sex with an 11 year old are just as or more sick than the mother. I don't get it, wtf is wrong with those people? 18-04-2005

What i meant was that i'd understand a woman in (South) Africa would do that, they have no hope for a better future for the next 200 years anyhow. __________________ "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

Yeah well that's one side of the story.... although they'd have no use for a car either (but that's a completely different discussion so I'll shut up now ) __________________ Every answer is just a question away...
