45 year old mum abandons 15 year old daughter for 26 year old boyfriend Aint this a nice story Quote: Originally Posted by Daily Mail A single mother who abandoned her teenage daughter for a Turkish DJ she met on holiday vowed yesterday never to return to Britain. Elaine Walker, 45, said losing contact with 15-year-old Laura was "a price worth paying" for a life with toyboy lover Ali Murat. "I feel no guilt," said Miss Walker, who had five children by five different men.
She met 26-year-old Murat within hours of arriving at a Turkish holiday resort with her eldest daughter Stacey, 17. The pair had fled to Side, near Antalya, three weeks ago for a new life - leaving Laura home alone with just £35 to live on. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/liv...n_page_id=1770 __________________ This line is currently vacant.

Re: 45 year old mum abandons 15 year old daughter for 26 year old boyfriend How can one fly from Turkey to Britain with just 35 BP? There are just too many thousands of parents that abandon children who usually have to spend years waiting to be adopted and hate and miss their biological parents. It was a common joke when I was young because there were too many of them: "you were found below a bridge." 13-01-2009
