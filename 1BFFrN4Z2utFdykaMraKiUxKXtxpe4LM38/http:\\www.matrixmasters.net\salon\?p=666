PROGRAM NOTES:
“If it’s a psychedelic family business, then you’ve got to consider the ‘top line’ [as contrasted with 'the bottom line']. What’s the top line? The top line is: You have one unique life, and what do you love to do? What do you want to spend your life doing? What is the highest impact you can have on the world in a positive way?” -Alex Grey
“We know that in the wake of our psychedelic experiences we’re awakened to a oneness with the environment and with a sense of the need to protect it. And at least the dream of Eco-sustainability and how could we possibly manage that at this point in our trip. And yet it’s up to us to take responsibility for it. All of these things kind of naturally evolve in the wake of the psychedelic experience for many people.” -Alex Grey
“If you really want something big to happen in your life you have to make promises that you don’t know how you’re going to keep, and you have to keep them. That’s all. That’s all it takes.” -Allyson Grey

Lorenzo,
Thank you so much for putting out these podcasts. I’m an average joe who discovered psychedelics and artwork a couple years ago. Podcasts like this one truly help with the sometimes confusing and doubtful moments that I encounter during my creative pursuits. I discovered this website a few months ago, and it’s a treasure trove of amazing talks and information. I listen to these podcasts all the time while I’m creating art…it’s one of the best feelings in the world! Thanks again for all that you do Lorenzo. Check out my art if you get the chance…you helped me to create it! My site is: johnspeaker.com
