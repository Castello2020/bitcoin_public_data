Last week Slate&nbsp;published a misinformed piece on Sweden&#8217;s school choice program and what we can learn from it. The errors of fact and logic are glaring.

In August 2011, the Internal Revenue Service proposed offering subsidies through health insurance Exchanges established by the federal government, even though the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act clearly and repeatedly provides those subsidies are available only “through an Exchange established by the State.” Due to the PPACA’s interrelated provisions, the decision to offer unauthorized subsidies in federal Exchanges also triggers unauthorized taxes against mil...</span></a> <img src="http://www.libertariannews.org/wp-content/plugins/newspage/images/new.png" alt="New!" title="This was posted within the last 24 hours." style="vertical-align:middle;"></li>

A Washington Post profile of Art Pope, political donor and now budget director of North Carolina, finds a flaw in his fiscal management:
For all of his pull, the revolution Pope helped set in motion is not going quite as planned. The tax overhaul, styled in part off ideas promoted by Pope-backed groups,&nbsp;has contributed to tight finances&nbsp;in North Carolina at a time when other states are flush with cash.
