<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>It is often claimed that Einstein&#8217;s theories of relativity have withstood every test thrown at them. This article attempts to challenge that claim by presenting a list of predictive failures, falsifying observations, and alternative explanations that better agree with the general rule of Occam&#8217;s razor. In science, it is generally accepted that the theory with the least amount of hypothetical postulates is superior to one with more. It was primarily on this basis that Einstein&#8217;s version of relativity won out over Lorentz&#8217;s, as Einstein was able to demonstrate a way to calculate relativistic mechanics without the need for an aether. However, as time has progressed, the amount of hypothetical entities required by Einstein&#8217;s theories has grown exponentially.</p>
<h4>Results</h4>
</div>
<p>â¢ The LIGO hasÂ <a href="http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/58105/2/cqg7_22_002.pdf">never detected</a>Â a gravitational wave. LIGO (on the fourth science run [S4]) and GEO600 together did not detect any gravitational waves.<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[3]</a>Â To date, LIGO&#8217;s fifth science run [S5], which had all three interferometers running continuously in triple-coincidence for an entire year, has not yielded any gravitational wave candidates.<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[4]</a>Â These non-detections directly refute previous theory and stand in direct contradiction to predictions made by the theory of general relativity.<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[5]</a></p>
<p>â¢ The CDMS project has never detected any observational evidence of dark matter despite years of trying<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[6]</a>, nor has the much more sensitiveÂ <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18839-dark-matter-claims-thrown-into-doubt-by-new-data.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&amp;nsref=physics-math">Xenon 100</a>Â experiment.<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[7]</a>Â This directly refutes the notion that dark matter exists and is the supposed âmissing massâ of galaxies. This non-detection directly refutes previous theory and stands in direct contradiction to predictions made by the theory of general relativity. Â It&#8217;s often said that extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. Â Claiming thatÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter" target="_blank">95% of the universe</a>Â is composed of undetectable matter and energy is an extraordinary claim. Â To-date, no solid laboratory based proof of dark matter or dark energy has been presented.</p>
<p>â¢ Observed locations of dwarf galaxies undermine cold dark matter models of the universe. Â Marcel Pawlowski, a postdoctoral researcher in the astronomy department at Case Western Reserve University, isÂ <a href="http://www.libertariannews.org/2014/06/12/dwarf-galaxies-call-standard-model-into-question/" target="_blank">quoted as saying</a>, &#8220;The chance to have two galaxies with such huge disks of satellite galaxies is less than one in 100,000.&#8221; [115][116]
<p>â¢ A recent study of Quasars shows them to be devoid of all effects of time dilation.<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[8]</a><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[9]</a>Â This non-detection directly refutes previous theory and stands in direct contradiction to predictions made by the theory of general relativity.

<p>â¢ The cepheid mass discrepancy problem has no solution in the standard model of stars.

<p>â¢ Frame dragging has never been definitively proven despite numerous attempts to look for it using numerous satellites. The most famous of which is Gravity Probe B. The finalÂ <a href="http://einstein.stanford.edu/content/sci_papers/papers/PhysRevLett.106.221101.pdf">report</a>Â issued by the Gravity Probe B team highlights problems created by the effects of &#8220;contact potential difference&#8221; induced error on the gyros.<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying-observational-evidence-presented?pli=1#references">[1]</a>Â The raw data showed no signs of any frame dragging at all.Â <a href="http://knol.google.com/k/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying-observational-evidence-presented?pli=1#references">[2]</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Of the 4 gyroscopes (centering on the frame-dragging effect) 3 of them (#1,#2, and #3) show errors that admit values compatible with predictions closer to 0 mas/yr than to the -39 mas/yr prediction. One of them (#2) is compatible with a null result. Gyroscope #4 is compatible with -60.6 mas/yr . And these are the numbers achieved after more than 5 years of fitting the raw results to something tolerable.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;the reduction in noise needed to test rigorously for a deviation from general relativity &#8216;is so large that any effort ultimately detected by this experiment will have to overcome considerable (and in our opinion, well justified) scepticism in the scientific community&#8217;.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>â¢The observed surface brightness of galaxies is too high. QuotingÂ <a href="http://bigbangneverhappened.org/2007yearendreport.htm">Lerner</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the universe is expanding, the surface brightness (apparent luminosity divided by apparent surface area) of distant galaxies will be much less than that of nearby ones. But if it is not expanding, the surface brightness will be the same. It turns out that the surface brightness is, in fact, the same. The conventional, Big Bang, explanation of this observation is that the distant galaxies have extremely high intrinsic surface brightness but with cosmological dimming, by coincidence, they appear to have the same surface brightness as nearby ones. One of the big problems with this explanation is that the implied intrinsic surface brightness is much larger than that observed for any nearby galaxies and may beÂ <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.2948">physically impossible</a>.<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[13]</a><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[15]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>FÃ¤lthammar furtherÂ <a href="http://plasma.colorado.edu/phys7810/articles/Falthammar_MovingFieldLines_2007.pdf">explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The second concern is that the construct of moving field lines is sometimes confused with the concept of moving flux tubes. A flux tube can be thought of as an ensemble of field lines that are identified by their low energy plasma, which moves at the EÃB/B2 velocity. Some researchers have asserted that as the plasma moves from region A to region B at this velocity, the field lines that were at A are later at B, so the magnetic field lines moved together with the plasma. This conclusion is wrong for two reasons. First, it is meaningless to assert that a field line that was at A is now at B, because there is no way to identify or distinguish one magnetic field line from another. Second, the concept of moving magnetic field lines is reasonable if it is used only for visualizing the temporal evolution of the magnetic field, and then, only if equation (2) is satisfied. This point is emphasized by the fact that there are an infinite number of field line velocities that produce the correct temporal evolution of the field when equation (2) is satisfied [Vasyliunas, 1972].<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[17]</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The integration of two plasma parcels across space and time violates the ruleÂ FÃ¤lthammar has so eloquently described for us, which is how the MHD theory describes a reconnection event.</p>
<p>All observations of &#8220;magnetic reconnection&#8221; can be explained very simply using standard circuit theory in the form of anÂ <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986AdSpR...6R.135S">exploding double layer</a>.<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[20]</a><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[21]</a>Â Â Alfven provides us with the answers yet again:</p>
<blockquote><p>A simple mechanism of explosion is the following. Â The double layer can be considered as a double diode, limited by a slab of plasma on the cathode side and another slab on the anode side. Â Electrons starting from the cathode get accelerated in the diode and impinge upon the anode slab with a considerable momentum which they transfer to the plasma. Â Similarly, accelerated ions transfer momentum to the cathode slab. Â The result is that the anode and cathode plasma columns are pushed away from each other. Â When the distance between the electrodes in the diodes becomes larger the drop in voltage increases. This run-away phenomenon leads to an explosion&#8230;</p>
<p>Carlqvist ( 1969, 1982a,c) finds that in a relativistic double layer the distribution of charges Zn +(x) and n_(x)Â can be divided into three regions: two density spikes near the electrodes and one intermediate region with almostÂ constant charge density. The particles are mainly accelerated in the spikes; whereas, they move with almost constant velocity in the intermediate region. Examples are given of possible galactic DL voltage differences of 10 _2 V. This means that by a straightforward extrapolation of what we know from our cosmic neighborhood, we can derive acceleration mechanisms which brings us up in the energy region of cosmic radiation.<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[20]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>â¢ There are no such things as âfrozen in magnetic fields in plasma.â Such a plasma is purely abstract formalism and cannot be demonstrated in a lab. A simple discharge tubeÂ <a href="http://fascistsoup.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/PlasmaDischargesDiagram.jpg">experiment</a>Â proves that plasma is not an ideal conductor (a superconductor with zero-valued resistance). Voltage in a real plasma never drops to zero and therefore resistance never drops to zero, ergo plasma is not an ideal conductor. Hence, any theory that relies on plasma being regarded as an ideal conductor having âfrozen inâ magnetic fields is in error. This is also covered in the above point, but I feel it needs to be highlighted in a separate point. The use of MHD models to describe entire systems of plasma interaction is a classic example of â<a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/reification">reification</a>.â It is interesting to note that the man who won the Nobel prize for creating MHD theory (Alfven) flatly disagrees with its use in modeling astrophysical phenomena. Â  Â Because plasma is quasi-neutral it MUST obeyÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff's_circuit_laws">Kirchhoff&#8217;s circuit laws</a>. Â Any complete theory of a plasma system must close the circuit, even if the location of the input and output currents areÂ unknownÂ to us at this time.</p>
<p>As Don Scott says:</p>
</div>
<blockquote><p>Laboratory measurements demonstrate that a nonzero-valued electric field in the direction of the current (E parallel &gt; 0) is required to produce a nonzero current density within any plasma no matter what mode of operation the plasma is in. Negative-slope regions of the volt-ampere characteristic (negative dynamic resistance) of a plasma column reveal the cause of the filamentary properties of plasma, but all static resistance values are measured to be &gt; 0.</p>
<p>Thus, although plasmas are excellent conductors, they are not perfect conductors. Weak longitudinal electric fields can and do exist inside plasmas. Therefore, magnetic fields are not frozen inside them.<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[16]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>â¢ The M87 galactic jet has beenÂ <a href="http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hu/db/images/hs-2009-16-a-print.jpg">observed</a>Â to eject matter at speeds faster than the speed of light. Theories proposing orientation as a solution for this do not agree well with observation. Peratt has shown how charged plasma can account for all observations of the M87 galactic jet without the need to invoke âblack holesâ. Indeed, Perattâs theory, which is based on Alfvenâs work, can account for the double jets we observe in some AGNs â which I believe remains unexplained in the standard model. Double radio sources were predicted by Alfven before their discovery.

<p>â¢Â <a href="http://www.nrao.edu/pr/2006/ringcluster/">Abell 3376</a>Â emits massive amounts of x-rays in a halo estimated thermally to be at over 60 million degrees Kelvin. There are no plausible explanations for this outrageous amount of heat and xray emission that encompasses the entire galaxy cluster using standard shock and gravity theory. The so-called shock &#8220;injection problem&#8221; in proposed solutions to these observations is ignored. Collisional heating of neutral gas can not generate 60 million degree temperatures. Mechanisms for the creation and maintenance of the required magnetic fields and the associated plasma have not been addressed. The Sun doesnât even get that hot. Thatâs over 20 times hotter than the hottest point of the solar corona and over 10,000 times hotter than the surface of the Sun. The electric model of galaxy formation offers an obvious solution to this problem as well as the unaccounted for magnetic fields.<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[30]</a><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[31]</a><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[32]</a></p>

Black hole physics violates SR, which means it also violates GR. Even by the mainstreams own standards, black holes are an impossibility. SR forbids infinite point mass particles such as a black hole singularity. Further, Schwarzschildâs original paper that proposed the solution to the Mercury orbit problem, from which the black hole is supposedly derived, is regular in all of space-time. This absolutely refutes the notion of black holes. Schwarzschildâs original paper in English can be foundÂ <a href="http://www.sjcrothers.plasmaresources.com/schwarzschild.pdf">here</a>. Hilbertâs solution to the field equations is erroneous.Â Crothers undertook aÂ <a href="http://www.libertariannews.org/2011/03/17/epic-black-hole-dispute-between-scientists/">longÂ dialog</a>Â withÂ a Dr. Christian Corda,Â Editor-in-Chief of The Open Astronomy Journal, who freely admits that there is no such thing as black holes, but then refuses publication of Crothers&#8217; papers based on ideological disagreements.It is interesting to note that black hole ânon-believersâ include Einstein, yet his name is continually put forth as a backer of this theory. Out of respect for his position, the use of Einsteinâs name in conjunction with these objects should cease immediately.<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[35]</a><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[36]</a><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[37]</a><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[38]</a><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[39]</a><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[40]</a></p>
<p>â¢ All observational evidence of the Sun refutes the notion that the Sun is a gravitationally collapsing gas cloud that is powered by a hydrogen to helium fusion reaction. The surface of the Sun is only observed to reach around 6000 degrees, while the corona high above it can get into the millions of degrees. Sun spots are the deepest place we can see into the Sun, yet they are the coldest places we can measure. These observations directly refute the notion that heat energy is being released from the core of the Sun. Other observed anomalies that refute the notion the Sun is a gravitationally collapsing gas cloud: neutrino deficiency, neutrino variability, differential rotation by latitude, differential rotation by depth, sun spots, the sun spot penumbra, even magnetic field, etcâ¦ the list goes on.

<p>â¢ Recent research has discovered that the convective flows in the Sun, which supposedly give rise to the Sun&#8217;s magnetic fields, move 100 times slower than the standard model of stars predicts. Â This leavesÂ no compelling theory to explain the generation of magnetic fields under the standard model. Â This issue is resolved in an electric model of stars.<a href="http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2012/07/09/researchers-create-mri-of-the-suns-interior-motions.html" target="_blank">[114]</a></p>
<p>â¢ Neutron stars and pulsars violate the known laws of physics. The proposed density of neutrons in these stars by the standard model violates the Island of Stability in nuclear chemistry. Neutrons can not be packed together that densely without having them fly apart instantaneously. Also, in pulsars, rotation rates have been observed on the order of 1200 hz. This also flies in the face of standard theory. It is impossible that a star can rotate that fast. The outer edges of the star would be approaching appreciable speeds of light.</p>
<p>Given the ridiculous assumption of a meager 10 mile radius, the outer edge of a pulsar rotating at 1122 hz would be traveling at .37 c (almost half the speed of light). A 25 mile radius would mean the outer edge would be traveling at .9 c. Such compact bodies with such high rotation rates are utterly preposterous. The scientific community is telling the public that an object the size of an asteroid is spinning around at near light speed emitting a beam of energy detectable across galactic distances. THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS! Pulsar XTE J1739-285 must be made entirely of neutrons if its spin rates are to be believed.</p>
<p>Previous theory held that ~700 hz was the maximum attainable spin rate for a pulsar. Healy and Peratt offer a far simplerÂ <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1995Ap&amp;SS.227..229H">explanation</a>Â that doesn&#8217;t violate any laws of physics.

<p>â¢ Stars have been observed that are too cold to possibly host nuclear fusion. These stars are called brown dwarf stars and may be the most numerous stars in the galaxy. The explanation of these objects by the standard model is poor. If the star is too small to gravitationally ignite a fusion reaction, it stands to reason they shouldn&#8217;t be cooling at all.

<p>â¢ All comets observed falling into the Sun or passing very near the Sun have subsequently been followed by coronal mass ejections, some of which actually &#8220;disconnected&#8221; the tails of comets from the nucleus. This is not explained at all by the idea a comet is a dirty snowball, yet this is well explained by electric cosmologyâs view of comets. Also, comets have observed to brighten at distances too far from the Sun to possibly be attributed to sublimating ice. This too is explained well by electric cosmologyâs view of comets.<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[74]</a><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[75]</a></p>
<p>Further, magnetic reconnection is invoked to explain tail &#8220;disconnection&#8221; events and other obviously electrical phenomena observed in comets. As was demonstrated in a previous point, magnetic reconnection violates conservation laws in physics and is nothing more than a blatant reification of MHD simulations.</p>

<p>Such interaction wasÂ <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc1981/pdf/1005.pdf">well predicted</a>Â by Alfven who died long before Cassini took Langmuir probe measurements of the rings.

<p>â¢ Quasars with low red shift have been proven to be related to their host galaxy. This follows Halton Arpâs<a href="http://www.haltonarp.com/articles/intrinsic_redshifts_in_quasars_and_galaxies.pdf">ejection model</a>Â of quasar formation. Paper proving quasars relate to their host galaxies red shifts, with the odds of correlation 1.5 in a million, can be foundÂ <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1978ApJ...223..747S">here</a>. Further, high and low red shift objects are observed to be interacting with each other. The odds of quasar/galaxy quartetÂ <a href="http://www.haltonarp.com/articles/research_with_Fred/illustrations/figure_1_b.jpg">NGC 7603</a>Â being a random chance alignment are on the order of billions to one. However, NGC 7603 does not stand alone; dozens of other interacting objects have been observed.<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[83]</a><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[84]</a><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[85]</a><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[86]</a><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[87]</a></p>
<p>â¢ Quasar red shift is observed to be quantized, as is shown in the published papers listedÂ <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/cosmologyquest/what-we-do-know/redshift---expanding-space">here</a>. This means the Earth must be at the center of the universe in order for the Big Bang model to be true. Quantization is shown to be related to the harmonic 0.062 in quasar and galactic red shiftÂ <a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/astro-ph/pdf/0211/0211091v1.pdf">here</a>.

<p>â¢ Quasars brightness doesÂ <a href="http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Cambridge/Figures/figure9.gif">not correlate</a>Â to their observed red shift as it does with galaxies. This refutes the notion of âexpanding spaceâ and the big bang. High red shift quasars can be well accounted for with known properties of light acting in the plasma vacuum of space. Several papers in support of thisÂ <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/cosmologyquest/what-we-do-know/redshift---expanding-space">here</a>.<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[90]</a></p>
<p>â¢ Quasars with low red shift along with galactic red shift can be explained by theÂ <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/27/28301/01265341.pdf%3Farnumber%3D1265341&amp;authDecision=-203">CREIL effect</a>, a property of light acting in the plasma vacuum of space interacting with diffuse hydrogen. This effect can account for all the effects of galactic red shift caused by âexpanding space.â<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[91]</a></p>
<p>â¢Â <a href="http://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2004/images/040726nebula.jpg">Quasar Q2237</a>Â âThe Einstein Crossâ â this quasar directly refutes the notion of gravitational lensing. This quasar is supposedly ONE quasar being lensed into FOUR images. The individual quasars are observed to<a href="http://www.holoscience.com/news/img/Einstein%20Cross.jpg">change in brightness</a>Â independently. They are not oblong in shape. They are are visiblyÂ <a href="http://www.holoscience.com/news/img/Einstein%20Cross%20Lyman%20alpha.jpg">connected</a>Â by plasma to the galactic core. They are observed to change position. All of these observations are in direct contradiction to gravitational lens theory. The proposal that this is one quasar being lensed into four images is preposterous! The notion that gravitational micro-lenses are the cause of this effect are at such extreme odds that it is next to impossible for them to properly account for the variations observed over time. Recent papers on lensing read like a science fiction novel with a nearly infinite number of hypothetical postulates propping up the theory.<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[92]</a><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[93]</a><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[94]</a><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[95]</a></p>
<p>In conjunction with this argument:</p>
<p>If you agree that gravitational lensing is caused by black holes, it follows that you agree that all super-massive black holes must exhibit gravitational lenses.</p>
<p>If you agree that all super-massive black holes must exhibit gravitational lensing, then explain why we donât see any lensing effects at the center of the Milky Way. High mass objects bend light according to GR as was supposedly demonstrated in the 1919 eclipse paperÂ <a href="http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEM7I9R1VED_index_0.html">here</a>, given that, the measurement arm excuse seems to fly in the face of standing theory. In fact, gravitational lensing theory has so many contradicting theories in support of it, one can not find a single standard view of lensing to even refute. I could attempt to refute one model, only to face conflicting data from another model, and so forth â of course none of the models are backed up by any laboratory experimentation.<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[96]</a></p>
<p>Further, if we look strictly at the observational evidence in support of lensing, excluding red shifts, we find that halo structures are all thatâs left to explain. If the assumption is made that red shift is caused by some other property beside expanding space, all one needs to do is explain the observed halo effects and light refraction. There exists in our own solar system such a massive halo effect that is not caused by gravitational lensing. TheÂ <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/oct/07/saturn-ring-space-exploration">Phoebe ring</a>Â of Saturn is a great example of a non-gravitational lensing halo. Also on the galactic scale, theÂ <a href="http://www.nrao.edu/pr/2006/ringcluster/">Abell 3376</a>Â galaxy cluster exhibits a ring system that is not due to âgravitational lensing&#8221; as do numerous other galaxies and galaxy clusters such asÂ <a href="http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hu/db/images/hs-2002-21-a-web.jpg">Hoag&#8217;s object</a>. Ring formations are a common occurrence in space, the majority of which are totally unrelated to any proposed &#8220;lensing.&#8221;<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[97]</a><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[30]</a><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[98]</a></p>
<p>Further, given that we know its possible to bend light here on earth without gravity, it stands to reason that there is probably some real property of plasma acting in space that can account for what is observed. Magneto-optical effects such asÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-focusing">self-focusing</a>Â have not been thoroughly reviewed as a possible cause of the observed visual distortions around the Sun. Given the electric model, it seems such effects could possibly account for the observed refraction of light.<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[99]</a></p>

<p>â¢ Gravity isÂ <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/cosmologyquest/what-we-don-t-know/gravity">not constant</a>. Every attempt to measure gravity has resulted in changes over time. No method of measuring gravity has ever proven gravity to be constant as is mandated by the general theory of relativity. Also, it has beenÂ <a href="http://metaresearch.org/cosmology/speed_of_gravity.asp">demonstrated</a>Â that gravity propagates at a speed faster than that of light if one assumes gravity propagates outward from the Sun,<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[104]</a>Â which is forbidden by Special Relativity. Newton&#8217;s equations assume gravity propagates at an infinite speed, and it is Newton&#8217;s equations (not Einstein&#8217;s) NASA uses to calculate orbits. This is direct falsifying observational evidence that Einstein&#8217;s version of gravity is wrong. Attempts to measure gravity have resulted in variations by as much as .7%.<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[105]</a>Â Atom interferometry shows variations outside of acceptable limits. Further, one has to question the use of atoms to measure gravitational forces. Common sense tells us the most accurate measurement would be by an object that is strongly effected by it.<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[106]</a></p>
<p>â¢ GPS clocks and all other phenomena that supposedly âprovesâ Einsteinâs version of relativity can be accounted for better using steady state models of the universe. Lorentzâs model can well account for observations in a steady state universe. Physicist Tom Van Flandern lays out the evidenceÂ <a href="http://www.metaresearch.org/cosmology/gps-relativity.asp">here</a>. An alternative theory based on Lorentzâs work that accounts for why the MM experiment showed a null result, as well as all other aberrations, can be foundÂ <a href="http://www.rhythmodynamics.com/Gabriel_LaFreniere/matter.htm" target="_blank">here</a>. Similarly, physicist Randal Mills has demonstrated predictive success with aÂ <a href="http://www.blacklightpower.com/theory/theory.shtml">model</a>Â solely based on classical physics. The simplicity of these models and accuracy of their predictions merits further review. Â The models presented are predicated on closed form classical physics, which is the only type of model that is fundamentally tied to reality.Â <a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[107]</a><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[108]</a><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/michael-suede/einstein-was-wrong-falsifying/31bvt2170ijjb/1#references">[109]</a></p>
<p>â¢ Fossil records indicate the Earthâs gravity was far less during the time of the dinosaurs. David Esker has put together aÂ <a href="http://www.dinosaurtheory.com/big_dinosaur.html">site</a>Â detailing many of the findings. Esker seems to think atmospheric pressure can account for this, but we all know thatâs bunk. There is only one thing that makes sense, and thatâs a lower gravity field.

<p>â¢ The Ehrenfest Paradox: Consider a spinning hoop, where the tangential velocity is near the speed of light. In this case, the circumference (2ÏR) is length-contracted. However, since R is always perpendicular to the motion, it is not contracted. This leads to an apparent paradox: does the radius of the accelerating hoop equal R, or is it less than R?</p>
<p>â¢ The Twin Paradox: Consider twins who are separated with one traveling at a very high speed such that his âclockâ (age) slows down, so that when he returns he has a younger age than the twin; this violates Relativity because both twins should expect the other to be younger, if motion is relative. Einstein himself admitted that this contradicts Relativity.</p>
<p>â¢ Based on Relativity, Einstein predicted in 1905 that clocks at the Earthâs equator would be slower than clocks at the North Pole, due to different velocities; in fact,Â <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v227/n5255/abs/227270a0.html">all clocks at sea level measure time at the same rate</a>, and Relativists made new assumptions about the Earthâs shape to justify this contradiction of the theory; they also make the implausible claim that relativistic effects from gravitation precisely offset the effects from differences in velocity.</p>
<p>â¢ Based on Relativity and the failed 1887 experiment by Michelson-Morley to measure the aether, Einstein claimed in 1909 that the aether does not exist, but in order to make subatomic physics work right, theorists had to introduce the aether-like concept of theÂ <a href="http://www.fnal.gov/pub/inquiring/questions/higgs_boson.html">Higgs field</a>, which fills all of space andÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_symmetry_breaking">breaks symmetries</a>.</p>
<p>â¢ Minkowski space is predicated on the idea of four-dimensional vectors of which one component is time. However, one of the properties of aÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space">vector space</a>Â is that every vector have an inverse. Time cannot be a vector because it has no inverse.<a name="Conclusion"></a></p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<div>
<p>After nearly 100 years, Einsteinâs theories have not been unified. They are not falsifiable. These two facts alone merit reconsidering their continued use. The lack of unification and lack of fundamental ties to reality demands explanation. The LCDM model of the universe has no less than 5 adjustable parameters that can arbitrarily be adjusted to account for observation. This is no different than Ptolemyâs epicycles that were continually adjusted to account for observation without providing any real explanation of the mechanics behind what is being observed.</p>
<div>
<p>At this point it is almost impossible for even a professional cosmologist to name all of the hypothetical entities required by Einsteinâs theories. Occamâs Razor demands we follow the theory with the least amount of unnecessary entities. While the standard model may be able to formulate responses to the problems presented, it seems that electric cosmology offers a solution to all of the problems by simply adding ONE postulate to the universe â that current flows in space plasmas. Given the utter simplicity of this postulate and the overwhelming evidence in support of it, Occamâs Razor demands it be given full attention.Modern cosmology is engaging in what can broadly be categorized as scientific fraud. Nearly every explanation of astrophysical phenomena involves the use of frozen-in fields, an impossibility in any real plasma. Nearly every explanation involves the use of some totally unproven, unfounded, and baseless hypothetical form of matter or energy, be it dark energy, dark matter, or fictional black holes that blatantly violate Einsteinian relativity. Every attempt to prove the existence of these hypothetical entities has resulted in failure.Because a steady state universe, as postulated by Lorentz, does not require unification and complies with Maxwellâs equations (which themselves assume an infinite universe and universal speed), this also resolves the long standing problem of unifying Einsteinâs theories.And finally, a largeÂ <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/cosmologyquest/peer-reviewed-papers">collection of papers</a>Â in support of the arguments made.Professor Donald Scott lays out the case for electric cosmology at the NASA Goddard Space Centerâs Engineering Colloquia in thisÂ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8tqgntbjyE">video</a>.If youâre interested in why scientists ignore all of the above findings, hereâs a sociological researchÂ <a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/4369/1/soc_cosmo.pdf">paper</a>Â on the mindsets of cosmologists.</p>

It&#8217;s nice to see someone thinking outside the box. Young Earth Creationists are nuts and Darwinian Evolutionists are morons.

<p>There is no evidence to support your &#8220;theory&#8221; other than some abstract garbage from a college drop out and a few small scale experiments done by engineers.  You are stupid if you follow one physicist verses all of science. . . You are relying on engineers to discover the properties of the large scale universe without even looking at it.</p>
<p>The one time science gave these jerkoffs the benifit of the doubt they got probe time and found jack shit. . . nothing no supporting evidence can be seen in the heavens.  And with the resent weak lensing confirmation of hubble your completely baseless theory is more dead then ever.</p>

I have learned about the EU theory from you (from your posts on ATS) and I have been fascinated with it ever since. It is so simple and so true &#8211; I must admit that some of the scientific evidence is hard to understand (working on it), but in general, the theory is simple and facts confirm it.<br />
I cannot thank you enough, you have changed my view of life, science, everything. I have watched your videos, as well as other scientists who advocate this theory, and I am forever grateful to all of you.</p>

There are a lot of scientific methods as I think you suppose to know well.

These paper would not be count as the good resource for data collected.</p>
<p>Second, the Einstein theory does not clarify the existence of the gravitational force but explain how it may work. If the raw data we got does not detect the existence of the gravitational force, it does not mean the force does not exist. We should test it multiple time and come up with the consistency results. As you said the probe rotating itself. So does the rotation of the probe is hypothetical ? If it does then the result will be hypothetical. In fact, does the probe really rotate ?</p>
<p>Frame dragging does not come from Einstein himself. You should know Einstein get thisï»¿ theory from other scientists. By using the deductive reasoning within this analogy, we would say Einstein theory is crumple under such fallacy. Still, by inductively reasoning, Einstein theory still does not get disproved yet. This may due to the uncorrected constructed experiments. Thinking that you should not use the deductive reasoning too much in reviewing the scientific paper. I believe you are being too subjective here.</p>
<p>By using the hypothetical theory to disprove the other theory does not give a strong hold on the theory itself. Within the unknown universe we imagined in the past would not give us the strong understanding at all. Still, as being a theory, the Einstein putting his opinion too much in the research itself which made his research being subjective. This may be the main error Einstein had ever made, still his theory is still applicable in use for currently research. Was Einstein wrong or his theory?</p>
<p>To this end, I respect your point of view and your research but it seems a little bit shaky, and attacking to the person (Einstein) but not the theory itself. Besides, you are using too much general/overstating terms such as :&#8221;nothing ever, never, absolutely, all wrong&#8230;etc&#8221;. The understanding for such complicate matter such as universe of course would not be easily solved by single human being. Still, Einstein was not wrong in make his point, but his theory was wrong. I know what you are talking here, but hope you fix it a little bit so it would not be mislead.</p>

There are a lot of scientific methods as I think you suppose to know well. I wonder what are theï»¿ journals you are using to talk about here, as I think you mostly read the review scientific articles which purely being subjective to the writer point of view over the data. These paper would not be count as the good resource for data collected.</p>
<p>Second, the Einstein theory does not clarify the existence of the gravitational force but explain how it may work. If the raw data we got does not detect the existence of the gravitational force, it does not mean the force does not exist. We should test it multiple time and come up with the consistency results. As you said the probe rotating itself. So does the rotation of the probe is hypothetical ? If it does then the result will be hypothetical. In fact, does the probe really rotate ?</p>
<p>Frame dragging does not come from Einstein himself. You should know Einstein get thisï»¿ theory from other scientists. By using the deductive reasoning within this analogy, we would say Einstein theory is crumple under such fallacy. Still, by inductively reasoning, Einstein theory still does not get disproved yet. This may due to the uncorrected constructed experiments. Thinking that you should not use the deductive reasoning too much in reviewing the scientific paper. I believe you are being too subjective here.</p>
<p>By using the hypothetical theory to disprove the other theory does not give a strong hold on the theory itself. Within the unknown universe we imagined in the past would not give us the strong understanding at all. Still, as being a theory, the Einstein putting his opinion too much in the research itself which made his research being subjective. This may be the main error Einstein had ever made, still his theory is still applicable in use for currently research. Was Einstein wrong or his theory?</p>
<p>To this end, I respect your point of view and your research but it seems a little bit shaky, and attacking to the person (Einstein) but not the theory itself. Besides, you are using too much general/overstating terms such as :&#8221;nothing ever, never, absolutely, all wrong&#8230;etc&#8221;. The understanding for such complicate matter such as universe of course would not be easily solved by single human being. Still, Einstein was not wrong in make his point, but his theory was wrong. I know what you are talking here, but hope you fix it a little bit so it would not be mislead.</p>

Frame dragging is a result of Einstein field equations. If frame dragging is false then Einsteinian field equations too. </p>
<p>lol Stop commenting when you are drunk! Michael attacks the theory only with the experimental data but you find a false excuse &#8230; Fluoride and brain washing had its effects&#8230;</p>

<p>I have been thinking of doing a series of videos myself on the misunderstood topic of corrosion in domestic condensing boiler heat exchangers and you have inspired me to get on with it. </p>

<p>    Given that General Relativity was disproved September 23rd 2011<br />
    candidate theories should be considered.Â  I wrote Finite Theory<br />
    which gives the right rotation curve for all galaxies without the</p>
<p>    use of dark matter and gives the constitution of a black hole.Â  A<br />
    paper can be found here:</p>

<p>    The whole theory is explained better inside the following book; it<br />
    includes a thought experiment disproving Special Relativity and a<br />
    practical way to achieve FTL:</p>
