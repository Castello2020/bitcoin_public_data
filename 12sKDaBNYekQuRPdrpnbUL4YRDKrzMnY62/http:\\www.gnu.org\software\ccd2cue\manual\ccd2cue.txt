     Manifesto: On the internet there is a gigantic quantity of optical
     disc image files in numerous formats.  Countless times we need to
     burn some of them.  Some time ago I needed it, but I came across a
     file format extremely irritating for a Free Software user like me:
     a CD layout descriptor file, with ‘.ccd’ suffix, generated by a
     proprietary software called CloneCD. I searched the internet for a
     way to burn that file on the GNU+Linux-Libre system, but I only
     found a lot of people asking for a solution on a lot of forums, and
     getting the unanimous answer: no way!  At first I could not believe
     at that point there was no option.  Then, with a little bit of
     patience and research, I wrote some code to convert that files to a
     format much more common and accessible, an ad-hoc standard in the
     GNU operating system: the CUE sheet format.  So I could burn a lot
     of what I wanted!  I wondered whether it would be useful for
     others… and here is the result!
              — _Bruno Félix Rezende Ribeiro (oitofelix)_

   There is a well known and widely employed proprietary optical disc
authoring software called CloneCD(1) which is intended to make a nearly
exact copy of audio and/or data optical discs for archival and/or
reproduction purposes.  When making a copy of an optical disc to hard
disk that program can output three files: audio/data raw image,
sub-channel data and layout description.  The GNU ccd2cue program
operates exclusively on the latter to produce a hopefully equivalent(2)
layout description in the CUE sheet format and possibly a companion
CD-Text meta-data file.  Since there are free software packages that can
easily and fully handle CUE sheet files, this frees the user from the
temptation to use a proprietary program or from the burden of searching
for the desired disc data into a supposedly more free software friendly
format.

   One such software capable of burning a raw image file laid out by a
CUE sheet file, as well as to convert a CUE sheet file to the TOC sheet
format, is _cdrdao_(3).

Notably, GNU ccd2cue can handle:
   • Mixed-mode CCD sheet file(4);
   • CD-Text meta-data(5);
   • Track special sub-code flags(6);

   This manual is split in two major logical segments: instruction and
reference.  In the former resides the manual content targeted to
instructional, reasonably tutorial, use.  It is composed by the
following chapters:

_Overview_
     General information about purpose, distribution, copying,
     community, contribution and donation for this package.
_Release_
     Presents information specifically relevant for the current release
     or subject to change between releases.
_Operation_
     Teach how the program works from the user’s perspective;
_Tutorial_
     Guides the reader step-by-step using the program in face of
     practical common use cases.
_Invocation_
     Concerns ‘ccd2cue’ invocation syntax, accepted options and their
     meanings.
_Burning_
     Gives an _important warning_ and advice about burning the resultant
     CUE sheet.  *READ THAT!*

   In the latter, one can find the reference material comprised of the
following appendices:

_Compact Disc fields_
     Describes some Compact Disc information that are common concepts to
     CCD and CUE sheet formats.
_CCD sheet format_
     Describes the CCD sheet format (at least the part we know about —
     it is a reverse engineering process, and you are encouraged to
     help).
_CUE sheet format_
     Describes the CUE sheet format.

   Now that you are acquainted to the program and documentation,
*HAPPY HACKING!*

1 Overview
**********

   This chapter briefly explains for what this package is intended,
gives relevant considerations regarding dependencies, configuration,
build, installation and use, describes which are the rules for its
distribution, how to get a copy of it, how to contact the community, how
to fill bug reports, how to contribute to the package, how to make
donations to support its development and how to get started hacking the
code.  Bear in mind that instructions in this chapter are
package-specific; for general and in-depth configuration, build and
installation instructions refer to the file ‘INSTALL’ present in the
top-level directory of the source distribution.  If you have checked out
the source tree from the CVS repository see *note Hacking::.

   For more information about this program you can visit its home page
at <https://www.gnu.org/software/ccd2cue/>.  If you want to receive
notifications about new releases of this program or important issues
related to it, subscribe to the mailing list, as described in *note

1.1 Description
===============

   GNU ccd2cue is a CCD sheet to CUE sheet converter.  It supports the
full extent of CUE sheet format expressiveness, including mixed-mode
discs and CD-Text meta-data.  It plays an important role for those who
need to use optical disc data which is only available in the proprietary
sheet format CCD, but don’t want to surrender their freedom.  It fills
an important gap in the free software world because before its
conception it was impossible to use complex forms of optical disc data
laid out by CCD sheets in a whole/holy free operating system.

   The GNU ccd2cue documentation is also intended to be a reference
documentation for both sheet format specifications.  That way we can
reverse engineer the secret CCD sheet proprietary format only once and
then make the information available for developers in order to benefit
all free software users that want their software to be interoperable.
The CUE sheet format is not a secret, but with this package we take the
opportunity to ensure that its specification is available under a free
documentation license for the sake of the whole free software community.

1.2 Distribution
================

   This program is "free software"; this means that everyone is free to
use it and free to redistribute it under certain conditions.  This
program is not in the public domain; it is copyrighted and there are
restrictions on its distribution, but these restrictions are designed to
permit everything that a good cooperating citizen would want to do.
What is not allowed is to try to prevent others from further sharing any
version of this program that they might get from you.  The precise
conditions are found in the GNU GPL
(https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) (General Public Licence).  The
program manual is covered by the GFDL (*note GNU Free Documentation
License::).  This license is similar in spirit to the GNU General Public
License, but is more suitable for documentation.

1.3 Getting a copy
==================

   One way to get a copy of this program is from someone else who has
it.  You need not ask for our permission to do so, or tell any one else;
just copy it.  You may also receive this program when you buy a
computer.  Computer manufacturers are free to distribute copies on the
same terms that apply to everyone else.  These terms require them to
give you the full sources, including whatever changes they may have
made, and to permit you to redistribute the program received from them
under the usual terms of the GNU General Public License.  In other
words, the program must be free for you when you get it, not just free
for the manufacturer.

   If you have access to the Internet, you can get the latest
distribution version of this program at
<https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ccd2cue/>.  Please, use a mirror if possible;
you will be automatically redirected to the nearest mirror at
<http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/ccd2cue/>.

   A CVS repository, where the development takes place, is also
available.  It maintains the full history of modifications of every
single source file.  You can checkout any given revision of any file or
get a snapshot of the entire source tree in a particular desired state.
Special build tools, as described in *note Hacking::, are required to
build from those checkouts, though.  Notably, to stay up to date with
the latest developments in the source tree, you can anonymously checkout
the repository with the following command:
     cvs -z9 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/sources/ccd2cue co ccd2cue

1.4 Contact
===========

   You can get in touch with other users and the developers of this
program subscribing to the mailing list.  Anyone is welcome to join the
list; to do so, visit the bug-ccd2cue web interface
(https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-ccd2cue/).  You can use this
list for all discussion, including asking for help and bug reporting,
although the preferred method for reporting bugs is the dedicated bug
tracking web interface described in *note Bug reporting::.  To post a
message to all the list members, send email to <bug-ccd2cue@gnu.org>.
To see the collection of prior postings to the list, visit the
bug-ccd2cue archive (https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-ccd2cue/).

   If you feel somewhat chatty, eager for a somewhat more instantaneous
response from community, you can join us on our friendly IRC channel:
‘irc://irc.freenode.net/ccd2cue’.

1.5 Bug reporting
=================

   If you come across some problem and need help you can contact the
community as described in *note Contact::.  If you think you found a
bug, but is not quite sure about it, you can instead ask for support on
our support tracker (https://savannah.gnu.org/support/?group=ccd2cue).
We will revise your post, advise you and take the appropriate measures.
If you are confident you have found a bug, you can submit a bug report
directly at our bug tracker
(https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=ccd2cue).  Please, when reporting
a bug include enough information for the maintainers to reproduce the
problem.  Generally speaking, that means:

   • The contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug and
     command line invocations of the program(s) involved (crucial!).
   • A description of the problem and any samples of the erroneous
     output.
   • The version number of the program(s) involved (use ‘--version’).
   • Hardware, operating system, and compiler versions (‘uname -a’).
   • Unusual options you gave to configure, if any (see
     ‘config.status’).
   • Anything else that you think would be helpful.

1.6 Contributing
================

   This program is a collaborative effort and we encourage contributions
from anyone and everyone — your help is very much appreciated.  You can
help in many ways:

   • Donate to developers in order to support their work.  See *note
     Donating::.
   • Write documentation.  We are specially in need to complete the CCD
     sheet format specification.
   • Help users in the mailing list and IRC channel.
   • Find and report bugs.  *Note Bug reporting::.
   • Fix reported bugs.
   • Implement new feature ideas.
   • Write test cases.
   • Check the documentation against the implementation.
   • Translate the program strings to other languages.

   You can join the development team to contribute code and
documentation at the development page
(https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/ccd2cue/).  Patches are most welcome,
but contributed code should follow the *note (standards)::.  If it
doesn’t, we’ll need to find someone to fix the code before we can use
it.  It is also necessary that the contributor be willing to assign
their copyright to the FSF, since the developers plan to make it
officially part of the GNU operating system and they want FSF to enforce
the program’s license.  To get started hacking see *note Hacking::.

1.7 Donating
============

   If you find this program useful, please *send a donation* to its
developers to support their work.  If you use this program at your
workplace, please suggest that the company make a donation.  We
appreciate contributions of any size – donations enable us to spend more
time working on this package, and help cover our infrastructure
expenses.

   If you’d like to make a donation of any value, please send it to the
following Bitcoin address:

     12sKDaBNYekQuRPdrpnbUL4YRDKrzMnY62

   Since we aren’t a tax-exempt organization, we can’t offer you a tax
deduction, but for all donations over 0.05 BTC, we’d be happy to
recognize your contribution on the donors page (DONORS.html) and on
‘DONORS’ file for the next release.

   We are also happy to consider making particular improvements or
changes, or giving specific technical assistance, in return for a
substantial donation over 0.5 BTC. If you would like to discuss this
possibility, write to us at <ccd2cue@gnu.org>.

   Another possibility is to pay a software maintenance fee.  Again,
write to us about this at <ccd2cue@gnu.org> to discuss how much you want
to pay and how much maintenance we can offer in return.

                      *Thanks for your support!*

1.8 Hacking
===========

The development sources are available through CVS at Savannah:

     https://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=ccd2cue

   If you are getting the sources from CVS (or change ‘configure.ac’),
you’ll need to have Automake, Autoconf and Gettext installed to
(re)build.  You’ll also need help2man.  All of these programs are
available from <https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/>.

   After getting the CVS sources, and installing the tools above, you
can run ‘./bootstrap’ to do a fresh build.  After that first time,
running ‘make’ should suffice.  See file ‘INSTALL’.

   When modifying the sources, or making a distribution, more is needed,
as follows:

   • This distribution also uses Gnulib
     (https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib) to share common files, stored
     as a submodule in git.
   • When updating gettext, besides the normal installation on the
     system, it is necessary to run ‘gettextize -f’ in this hierarchy to
     update the ‘po/’ infrastructure.  After doing so, rerun
     ‘gnulib-tool --import’ since otherwise older files will have been
     imported.  *Note (gnulib)::, for more information.

2 Release
*********

   In this chapter one can find information that are specific to the
current release or subject to change between releases.  It is presented
the features this package acquired over time, problems that affects its
overall usage and what possibly could happen to it — by our wishes — in
the future.  Last but not least, people whose contribution for this
package are noteworthy are acknowledged.

2.1 News
========

   This document contains a list of user-visible changes worth
mentioning.  The changes are split and ordered by version in reverse
chronological order.  If you want to receive notifications about new
releases of this program or important issues related to it, subscribe to
the mailing list, as described in *note Contact::, or subscribe to the
package atom feed
<https://savannah.gnu.org/news/atom.php?group=ccd2cue>.

0.3
        • The program ccd2cue has become a GNU package, and therefore is
          now dubbed GNU ccd2cue.  Its code and documentation have been
          updated to reflect such remarkable occurrence.
        • The target ‘homepage’ generates the package homepage primarily
          from release documentation.
        • Some interesting GNU philosophy essays were added to
          documentation.
        • Various bugs in the program and documentation were fixed.
0.2
        • Support for all features of the CUE sheet format, prominently
          CD-Text meta-data and track sub-code flags.
        • Internationalization support using gettext.
        • Compliance with the GNU Coding Standards and the GNU
          Maintaining Standards.  See *note (standards):: and *note
          (maintain)::.  Noteworthy changes are the use of the GNU build
          system for the ease and consistency of build and installation
          (see ‘INSTALL’ file), documentation in the Texinfo format,
          notably an user manual that can be outputted in numerous
          formats including, but not limited to, printable pdf, info,
          html and plain text.
        • Traditional Unix man page automatically generated by help2man
          (https://www.gnu.org/software/help2man).
        • Doxygen for in-depth source code documentation.  That can be
          used to output pdf, html and numerous other formats
          documenting the inner workings of the code.
        • GNU compliant command line parsing provided by Argp.  It is no
          more necessary to provide arguments in the fixed order of
          command’s synopsis; the arguments can be given in any order
          and long options are accepted.
        • The command line options suffered the following changes to
          comply with GNU Coding Standards:
          ‘-o’
               Has companion long option ‘--output’.
          ‘-i’
               Has companion long option ‘--image’.
          ‘-h’
               Changed to ‘-?’ with companion long option ‘--help’.
          ‘-v’
               Changed to ‘-V’ with companion long option ‘--version’.

          The following command line options were added to cover new
          features:
          ‘-c CDT-FILE’
          ‘--cd-text=CDT-FILE’
               Writes CD-Text data to ‘CDT-FILE’.
          ‘-a’
          ‘--absolute-file-name’
               Uses absolute file name deduction.
          ‘--usage’
               Gives a short usage message.

        • It is no longer required to specify ‘-i’ option in every
          invocation.  It is enough to specify only one file name on the
          command invocation, as an option or non-option argument, since
          the remaining needed file names are now deduced automatically.

2.2 To do
=========

   This chapter contains a list of ideas and features which would be
nice to see implemented some day.  If you are ready to start working on
any of these TODO items, we appreciate your help; please write to
<bug-ccd2cue@gnu.org> so we can be aware that the problem is being
addressed, and talk with you how to do it best.  It is best to consult
the latest version of this file in the program source code repository.
See *note Getting a copy:: and *note Hacking:: for instruction on how to
access it.

   Since the developers of this program are willing to assign the
copyright of this package to FSF, please be prepared to sign legal
papers to transfer the copyright on your work to the FSF too.  For more
details on this and some more practical details about getting involved,
see *note Contributing::.

   As well as the issues listed here, there are bug reports, which are
effectively to-do items too — that can use your help — at the bug
tracker web interface (https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=ccd2cue).
See *note Bug reporting:: for more information.

CCD sheet format specification
     There is a specification of the CCD sheet format in the program
     manual.  That specification is the result of a reverse engineering
     process and is incomplete; pretty much only the fields that affects
     the CUE sheet generation are known.  It would be very nice to
     decipher the entirety of the format, and document it, so we can
     bring into light whether there is room for improvement in the
     conversion process, and to open new possibilities for more
     expressive formats like the TOC sheet.
TOC sheet format
     As the name implies the program GNU ccd2cue is designed to convert
     CCD sheets only to the CUE sheet format.  This format has some well
     know limitations regarding the sub-channel data, which apparently
     can be mitigated by more expressive formats.  There is one sheet
     format called “TOC” that is very common, well documented and
     accessible to free software in the GNU system.  It seems that
     format was designed to handle the sub-channel data that is the
     major flaw of the CUE sheet format.  In fact it seems like a
     super-set of the CUE sheet format.  For that reason we would like
     to have a ccd2toc in complement of the GNU ccd2cue.  But is that
     another project?  If not, we have to change the name.  ;-)

3 Operation
***********

   Firstly, it is important to discern between the various files
involved in the conversion operation accomplished by GNU ccd2cue.  The
whole process consists basically of a conversion of the CCD set of files
into a CUE set of files, whose meaning is, by suffix, described below:

   In the "CCD set" all files have the same base-name and the respective
suffixes are mandatory.  It is composed by:
‘.img’
     Audio/data raw image (hereafter called "image file");
‘.sub’
     Sub-channel data (hereafter called "sub-channel file");
‘.ccd’
     Layout description (hereafter called "CCD sheet file");

   In the "CUE set" not all files have necessarily the same base-name
and the respective suffixes are just an optional default.  It is
composed by:
‘.bin’
     The same image file as above with the traditional suffix;
‘.cdt’
     CD-Text meta-data file (hereafter called "CD-Text file");
‘.cue’
     Layout description (hereafter called "CUE sheet file");

   The GNU ccd2cue program never touches any of the files in the CCD
set; not even to rename the image file to use the traditional ‘.bin’
suffix.  However it will still work with other software because the
image file is explicitly referenced inside the CUE sheet file.  The idea
is to take the less intrusive approach, e.g., to have both sets of files
simultaneously without any interfering with each other.  Although we are
against the use and development of any proprietary program, including
those which can handle CCD sheets(1), it can be useful to have the
original CCD sheet for reference, in case the conversion process is
improved in a subsequent release; or more expressive destination
formats(2) become supported; or just for debugging.

   The GNU ccd2cue program has just one non-trivial operation: the
conversion and only rely on the information contained inside the CCD
sheet file to generate the equivalent CUE sheet file.  Thus, GNU ccd2cue
does not enforce, and actually does not even check, if you have the
sub-channel file, or even more important, the actual image file.
Therefore, although it is possible to generate seamlessly a CUE sheet
file from a lone CCD sheet file, it is a must to have also, at least,
the correspondent image file when burning the disc.

   While the image file is not used by GNU ccd2cue but is referenced in
the produced CUE sheet file, the sub-channel file is not used nor
referenced at all in the CUE sheet file.  The CUE sheet format was not
designed to describe the information found in the sub-channel file and
most optical disc authoring software seems to ignore it when guided by a
CUE sheet file.  Therefore, does not expect to obtain an exact copy, at
sub-channel level, using the CUE sheet file to guide your burning
software.  Nevertheless, for the vast majority of practical uses the
extra sub-channel data contained in the sub-channel file can be fully
ignored producing yet usable discs for the intended application.  Notice
however that that does not mean CUE sheet format is incapable of
describing any sub-channel data; in fact it describes the most
remarkable ones.  Hence all that data is available for GNU ccd2cue not
inside the sub-channel file but rather in the CCD sheet file itself; the
CD-Text meta-data is such a case — the CD-Text file is produced from
decoded sub-channel information available inside the CCD sheet file.

   (1) Actually I’m really sorry those programs came into existence in
the first place.  I wish I never had to write a program like GNU
ccd2cue.  I would then be contributing to society in a way that directly
advances the social good, not just alleviating the wrong doing of others
that immersed in their own egoism and blindness desire to subjugate
their neighbors for their own benefit.

4 Tutorial
**********

   The most ordinary use case is when you have a CCD set of files and
just want to generate a CUE sheet file in order to burn or otherwise
access the data inside the image file.  Supposing your CCD sheet file is
called free-as-in-freedom.ccd, you are done with the command:

     ccd2cue -o free-as-in-freedom.cue free-as-in-freedom.ccd

   Remember that if your CCD sheet file name has spaces or unusual
characters, like ‘$’, you are better quoting the whole name with ‘'’.
Naturally the CUE sheet file don’t need to have the same base name as
the CCD sheet file.  You can give an adequate CUE sheet output file
name, at your discretion, to the ‘-o’ (‘--output’) option.  If you omit
the ‘-o’ option entirely as in

     ccd2cue free-as-in-freedom.ccd

the result is that the yielding CUE sheet is written to the standard
output, giving you the chance to pipe it out to another command or to
use the shell to redirect it to a file, as you would do without it using
the ‘-o’ option.  The same thing is accomplished passing ‘-’ as an
argument to option ‘-o’.

   May you guess what happens if we omit the CCD sheet input file
specification as well?  If you answered that GNU ccd2cue will read the
CCD sheet input from standard input and write the correspondent CUE
sheet output to standard output, unfortunately you are wrong.  It would
be nice if it behaved that way, but there is an inherent design
drawback: the CUE sheet need to reference an image file and possibly a
CD-Text file; that way how can it have any clue about those file names?
For that reason it is always necessary to supply at least one file name
in an option or non-option argument, that way GNU ccd2cue can deduce the
remaining file names needed.  The deduction algorithm is very simple:
get the file name supplied, in the following preference order:

  1. CCD sheet input file name (non-option argument);
  2. CUE sheet output file name (‘-o’, ‘--output’);
  3. Image file name (‘-i’, ‘--image’);
  4. CD-Text file name (‘-c’, ‘--cd-text’);

conserve only its base name and concatenate the canonical suffix.
Therefore, if you want to read the CCD sheet input from standard input
and write the CCD sheet output to standard output, it is enough to just
make explicit the name of a image name, possibly with a nonstandard
suffix, regardless of the actual existence of the image file, like in

     ccd2cue -i free-as-in-free-speech.img

being ‘free-as-in-free-speech.img’ the demanded image file name.  On the
other hand, you can use the ‘-i’ (‘--image’) in conjunction with the CCD
sheet file name and/or CUE sheet file name just to override the image
file name deduction.  As expected, the argument ‘-’ in place of the CCD
sheet file name, will also make GNU ccd2cue read its CCD sheet input
from standard input.

   If, for some weird reason, you want to move the CUE sheet file around
while keeping the image file in its original place and yet be able to
normally use this pair as if they were in the same directory, you can
use the option ‘-a’ (‘--absolute-file-name’).  That option will make the
file name deduction algorithm explained above to conserve the absolute
directory name for each file; however, as a consequence of this
approach, it will only work for file names not directly supplied, but
deduced by the program.

   When GNU ccd2cue detects CD-Text data information inside the CCD
sheet, it outputs a CD-Text file, whose name is determined by the same
file name deduction rules just described, unless overridden by the
option ‘-c’ (‘--cd-text’).  It is not possible to output the binary
CD-Text data to standard output, however.

5 Invocation
************

   The command ‘ccd2cue’ is used to convert CCD sheet files in CUE sheet
files.  It is invoked as follow:

     ccd2cue [OPTION…] [CCD-FILE]

   The input file, referred as ‘CCD-FILE’, must exist.  If ‘CCD-FILE’ is
‘-’, or omitted, standard input is used.

_Output_ options:
‘-c’
‘--cd-text=CDT-FILE’
     Write CD-Text data to ‘CDT-FILE’.
‘-o’
‘--output=CUE-FILE’
     Write output to ‘CUE-FILE’.

   While the main output file ‘CUE-FILE’ is always generated, the
‘CDT-FILE’ is created only when there is CD-Text info.  If ‘CUE-FILE’ is
‘-’, or ‘--output’ is omitted, standard output is used.

_Conversion_ options:
‘-a’
‘--absolute-file-name’
     Use absolute file name deduction.
‘-i’
‘--image=IMG-FILE’
     Reference ‘IMG-FILE’ as the image file.

   The ‘IMG-FILE’ is a reference to a data file required only in burning
time and thus its existence is not enforced in conversion stage.

_Help_ options:
‘-?’
‘--help’
     Give a help list.
‘--usage’
     Give a short usage message.
‘-V’
‘--version’
     Print program version.

   Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or
optional for any corresponding short options.

6 Burning
*********

                             *READ THIS!*

   If you are willing to burn or already burned a CD from a CUE sheet
produced by this program and all audio tracks became only senseless
static noise, you may need to ask your burning software to swap the byte
order of all samples sent to the CD-recorder when writing audio tracks.
For instance, that can be accomplished with the ‘--swap’ option when
using the cdrdao program.  Be warned that at least for mixed-mode discs,
by author’s own experience, the rule is to use that option; if you fail
to specify it when burning, you almost certainly will pointless waste
your CD.

   Supposing you want to burn a CD using the cdrdao program and a CUE
sheet file named ‘gnu.cue’, and wisely want to ensure the correct
behavior of your burnt disc, use the command:

     cdrdao write --swap --speed 1 --eject gnu.cue

That way ‘cdrdao’ will swap the byte order of audio samples, cautiously
burning in the smallest possible speed and will eject your CD when it is
done.

Appendix B CCD sheet format
***************************

     Warning: This appendix describes the CCD sheet format.  This
     description is the result of observation, deduction and tests.
     Although there is quite uncertainty about the semantic of a number
     of elements, it is expected that every applicable entry, or
     otherwise relevant element — for the production of the
     correspondent CUE sheet — is well understood.  Due to its
     proprietary nature, no authoritative, free and public available
     reference of the CCD sheet format do exist.  Whereas the
     information contained herein is thought to be accurate, there is no
     guarantee of its correctness.

   The CCD sheet format is an instance of the _INI format_(1); a simple
text file with a basic structure composed of _sections_ and
_properties_.  The following syntactic rules apply to CCD sheets:

  1. Every section has a name in square brackets that appears on a line
     by itself (like in ‘[CDText]’).
  2. Every property has a name and a value (in the form ‘NAME=VALUE’ —
     there is no space around ‘=’) and belongs exclusively to one
     section: the nearest upward section.
  3. There is no explicit end-of-section delimiter (sections end at the
     next section declaration or end-of-file) and sections cannot be
     nested.
  4. A ‘ ’ (space) can occur in a "indexed" section (resp.  property)
     name followed by a number (like in ‘[Session 3]’ (resp.  ‘INDEX
     0=17524’)).
  5. Each non-indexed section (resp.  property) come out only once per
     file (resp.  section).
  6. Indexes of sections and properties starts at the minimum value
     allowed and increments sequentially.

   Each following manual section corresponds to a CCD sheet _section_,
and each subsection within to a valid _property_ of its parent section.
The sequence in which sections should be declared in the CCD sheet is
the same given below.  For each section and property is explained its
meaning, and for properties is made explicit its value type.  A ‘(?)’
indicates the correspondent property value is not more than believed to
be right or is a guess against which no counter example do exist so far.
In the end of each section description is presented a code example of
that section using each available property just described.  Indexed
sections and properties are those whose syntax references ‘INDEX’.
Unless otherwise noted, each section and property are mandatory.  The
correlation with CUE sheet format is expressed by means of cross
references to the relevant CUE commands.

Appendix C CUE sheet format
***************************

   The CUE sheet format is a simple text file composed solely of CUE
commands, its respective arguments, blank spaces and lines.  The
following syntactic rules apply to CCD sheets:

  1. Each command take one, and only one, entire line.
  2. Commands are case insensitive.
  3. Commands can be indented at will.
  4. Blank lines are ignored.

   There are three contexts in a CUE sheet file: "None", "File" and
"Track".  The first of them is not introduced by any command, and the
last two are introduced by ‘FILE’ and ‘TRACK’ commands, respectively.
The only commands that pertains to more than one context, namely None
and Track, are the CD-Text related commands ‘TITLE’, ‘PERFORMER’ and
‘SONGWRITER’.  The only commands that can appear multiple times within
its contexts are ‘FILE’, ‘TRACK’, ‘INDEX’ and ‘REM’.

The valid positions of a command are determined by the following rules:
  1. A command can only appear after the introduction of the context it
     pertains to.
  2. Within that context the position of a command is determined by its
     specific positioning rules.

   Each following manual section corresponds to a CUE command.  For each
of them is explained its meaning, context structure and positioning
rules.  In the end of each section is given an example of use and is
made a reference to the correlated CCD sheet format element, if there is
any.

The meaning of the context tables is:
Parents
     The contexts to which this command pertains; "None" here names the
     context introduced by no command.
Multiple
     Whether is allowed multiple instances of this command within a
     single instance of its context; "Yes" or "No" answer.
Children
     The commands that pertains to the context introduced by this
     command; "None" if there is not one.

The meaning of the positioning tables is:
After
     This command must appear after the commands listed here, if they
     are present.  The expression "None" means nothing.
Before
     This command must appear before the commands listed here, if they
     are present.  The expression "None" means nothing.

C.6 ‘FILE’
==========

 -- CUE Command: FILE file-name file-type
     Declare file FILE-NAME of type FILE-TYPE as the one whose data will
     be used in the following ‘TRACK’ command contexts by ‘INDEX’
     commands.  If FILE-NAME contains any space, it must be enclosed in
     quotation marks.

     There are a total of 5 types FILE-TYPE can take: two types for raw
     data and three for audio.  The raw data types are _BINARY_ and
     _MOTOROLA_, and they differ only in endianness — little and big
     endian respectively.  The audio types are _AIFF_, _WAVE_ and _MP3_
     and the correspondent files must be setup to 44.1 KHz, 16 bits and
     stereo.  The following table summarizes it:

     ‘BINARY’
          Intel binary raw data _Little-endian_(1) — least significant
          byte first).
     ‘MOTOROLA’
          Motorola binary raw data _Big-endian_(2) — most significant
          byte first).
     ‘AIFF’
          Audio data in _AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format)_(3).
     ‘WAVE’
          Audio data in _WAVE (Waveform Audio File Format)_(4).
     ‘MP3’
          Audio data in _MP3 (MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III)_(5).

CCD sheet
---------

   Since the CCD sheet file is not meant to be composed from scratch by
an user or authoring software, rather created to mimic an existing disc
layout, it is assumed that the source of data are the CCD image and
sub-channel files, which have predefined formats and names.  Thus there
is no related explicit element in the CCD sheet format.

   Among the CCD set files, is presumed that the source of audio/data is
a file with the same base name of the CCD sheet file, but with a
different extension, to indicate its specific purpose, namely ‘.img’.
This file is always assumed as having type ‘BINARY’.

C.7 ‘TRACK’
===========

 -- CUE Command: TRACK number data-type
     Define the NUMBERth track, whose type is DATA-TYPE.  The value
     NUMBER is a strictly positive integer and must be one greater than
     the last one supplied to a previous ‘TRACK’ command,
     notwithstanding NUMBER can be greater than ‘1’ in the first
     occurrence of ‘TRACK’ command; however it cannot exceed ‘99’ in any
     case.  Usually NUMBER is padded with a ‘0’ on the left when smaller
     than ‘10’, in order to keep track numbers two digit wide uniformly
     throughout the CUE sheet.  The DATA-TYPE argument is one of those
     described at *note MODE (Compact Disc fields)::.

     This command should appear at least once in the CUE sheet file.

C.11 ‘INDEX’
============

 -- CUE Command: INDEX number mm:ss:ff
     If NUMBER is ‘0’, then consider the time specified by the next
     ‘INDEX’ command as the track pre-gap length present in the file
     declared by the current ‘FILE’ command context.

     If NUMBER is ‘1’, then define the starting time of the index of
     this track as MM minutes plus SS seconds plus FF frames.  This
     index specify the starting time of track data and is the only
     stored in the table-of-contents of the disc.

     If NUMBER is ‘2’ or more, then define the starting time of the
     (NUMBER-1)th sub-index within this track as MM minutes plus SS
     seconds plus FF frames.

     If this is the first ‘INDEX’ command of the current ‘TRACK’ command
     context, then it must start at ‘00:00:00’ and NUMBER must be either
     ‘0’ or ‘1’.

     If this is not the first ‘INDEX’ command of the current ‘TRACK’
     command context, then NUMBER must be one greater than that of the
     last ‘TRACK’ command.

     The value NUMBER cannot be greater than ‘99’ and is usually padded
     with a ‘0’ on the left when smaller than ‘10’, in order to keep
     index and sub-index numbers two digit wide uniformly throughout the
     CUE sheet.

     The time ‘mm:ss:ff’ is an offset relative to the beginning of the
     file specified by the current ‘FILE’ command context.

     The values MM, SS and FF must be non-negative integers.

     There are 75 frames per second.

This document is part of GNU philosophy, the GNU Project’s exhaustive
collection of articles and essays about free software and related
matters.

     notice is preserved.

0. PREAMBLE
-----------

   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure
everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or
without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

   This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
designed for free software.

   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software
does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be
used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is
published as a printed book.  We recommend this License principally for
works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
--------------------------------

   This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The “Document”, below, refers
to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and
is addressed as “you”.  You accept the license if you copy, modify or
distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

   A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

   A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

   The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that
says that the Document is released under this License.  If a section
does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to
be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero Invariant
Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then
there are none.

   The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may be
at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

   A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly
with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic
paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor,
and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format
is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy
that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

   The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in formats
which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means the text
near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the
beginning of the body of the text.

   The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

   A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)  To “Preserve the Title”
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.

   The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
which states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING
-------------------

   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
----------------------

   If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present the full title
with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited
to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
respects.

   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
computer-network location from which the general network-using public
has access to download using public-standard network protocols a
complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.  If
you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when
you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.

4. MODIFICATIONS
----------------

   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

  A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
     from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
     (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
     of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
     if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

  B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
     responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
     Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of
     the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than
     five), unless they release you from this requirement.

  C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
     Version, as the publisher.

  D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

  E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent
     to the other copyright notices.

  F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
     giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
     terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

  G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
     Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license
     notice.

  H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

  I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and
     add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,
     and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.
     If there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create
     one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document
     as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the
     Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.

  J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
     public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
     the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
     it was based on.  These may be placed in the “History” section.
     You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
     least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
     publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

  K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
     Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
     the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
     and/or dedications given therein.

  L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
     their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent
     are not considered part of the section titles.

  M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section may not
     be included in the Modified Version.

  N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements”
     or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

  O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

   You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—for
example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by
an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and
a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of Front-Cover
Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements
made by) any one entity.  If the Document already includes a cover text
for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by
the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another;
but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the
previous publisher that added the old one.

   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
----------------------

   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding
at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or
publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.  Make the
same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections
in the license notice of the combined work.

   In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History”
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
“History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You must delete all sections
Entitled “Endorsements.”

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
---------------------------

   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies
of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is
included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this
License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other
respects.

   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
-------------------------------------

   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright resulting
from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the
compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit.  When the
Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the
other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works
of the Document.

   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers
that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic
equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.  Otherwise
they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

8. TRANSLATION
--------------

   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between the
translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

   If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

9. TERMINATION
--------------

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise
to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.

   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your
receipt of the notice.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
------------------------------------

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies
that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be
used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version
permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

11. RELICENSING
---------------

   “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A public
wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A “Massive
Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the site means any
set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

   “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

   “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

   An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

   The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

     Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
     Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
     under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or
     any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with
     no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
     A copy of the license is included in the section entitled
     ``GNU Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with…Texts.” line with this:

     with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
     Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
     being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.

Appendix E The GNU Manifesto
****************************

The GNU Manifesto was written by Richard Stallman at the beginning of
the GNU Project, to ask for participation and support.  For the first
few years, it was updated in minor ways to account for developments, but
now it seems best to leave it unchanged as most people have seen it.
Since that time, we have learned about certain common misunderstandings
that different wording could help avoid.  Footnotes added since 1993
help clarify these points.  For up-to-date information about the
available GNU software, please see the information available on our web
server, in particular our list of software.  For how to contribute, see
<http://gnu.org/help>.  “The GNU Manifesto” was originally published in
‘Dr. Dobb’s Journal,’ vol. 10, n. 3 (March 1985).

This document is part of GNU philosophy, the GNU Project’s exhaustive
collection of articles and essays about free software and related
matters.

What’s GNU? Gnu’s Not Unix!
---------------------------

   GNU, which stands for Gnu’s Not Unix, is the name for the complete
Unix-compatible software system which I am writing so that I can give it
away free to everyone who can use it.(1)  Several other volunteers are
helping me.  Contributions of time, money, programs and equipment are
greatly needed.

   So far we have an Emacs text editor with Lisp for writing editor
commands, a source level debugger, a yacc-compatible parser generator, a
linker, and around 35 utilities.  A shell (command interpreter) is
nearly completed.  A new portable optimizing C compiler has compiled
itself and may be released this year.  An initial kernel exists but many
more features are needed to emulate Unix.  When the kernel and compiler
are finished, it will be possible to distribute a GNU system suitable
for program development.  We will use TeX as our text formatter, but an
nroff is being worked on.  We will use the free, portable X window
system as well.  After this we will add a portable Common Lisp, an
Empire game, a spreadsheet, and hundreds of other things, plus online
documentation.  We hope to supply, eventually, everything useful that
normally comes with a Unix system, and more.

   GNU will be able to run Unix programs, but will not be identical to
Unix.  We will make all improvements that are convenient, based on our
experience with other operating systems.  In particular, we plan to have
longer file names, file version numbers, a crashproof file system, file
name completion perhaps, terminal-independent display support, and
perhaps eventually a Lisp-based window system through which several Lisp
programs and ordinary Unix programs can share a screen.  Both C and Lisp
will be available as system programming languages.  We will try to
support UUCP, MIT Chaosnet, and Internet protocols for communication.

   GNU is aimed initially at machines in the 68000/16000 class with
virtual memory, because they are the easiest machines to make it run on.
The extra effort to make it run on smaller machines will be left to
someone who wants to use it on them.

   To avoid horrible confusion, please pronounce the _g_ in the word
“GNU” when it is the name of this project.

Why I Must Write GNU
--------------------

   I consider that the Golden Rule requires that if I like a program I
must share it with other people who like it.  Software sellers want to
divide the users and conquer them, making each user agree not to share
with others.  I refuse to break solidarity with other users in this way.
I cannot in good conscience sign a nondisclosure agreement or a software
license agreement.  For years I worked within the Artificial
Intelligence Lab to resist such tendencies and other inhospitalities,
but eventually they had gone too far: I could not remain in an
institution where such things are done for me against my will.

   So that I can continue to use computers without dishonor, I have
decided to put together a sufficient body of free software so that I
will be able to get along without any software that is not free.  I have
resigned from the AI Lab to deny MIT any legal excuse to prevent me from
giving GNU away.(2)

Why GNU Will Be Compatible with Unix
------------------------------------

   Unix is not my ideal system, but it is not too bad.  The essential
features of Unix seem to be good ones, and I think I can fill in what
Unix lacks without spoiling them.  And a system compatible with Unix
would be convenient for many other people to adopt.

How GNU Will Be Available
-------------------------

   GNU is not in the public domain.  Everyone will be permitted to
modify and redistribute GNU, but no distributor will be allowed to
restrict its further redistribution.  That is to say, proprietary
modifications will not be allowed.  I want to make sure that all
versions of GNU remain free.

Why Many Other Programmers Want to Help
---------------------------------------

   I have found many other programmers who are excited about GNU and
want to help.  Many programmers are unhappy about the commercialization
of system software.  It may enable them to make more money, but it
requires them to feel in conflict with other programmers in general
rather than feel as comrades.  The fundamental act of friendship among
programmers is the sharing of programs; marketing arrangements now
typically used essentially forbid programmers to treat others as
friends.  The purchaser of software must choose between friendship and
obeying the law.  Naturally, many decide that friendship is more
important.  But those who believe in law often do not feel at ease with
either choice.  They become cynical and think that programming is just a
way of making money.

   By working on and using GNU rather than proprietary programs, we can
be hospitable to everyone and obey the law.  In addition, GNU serves as
an example to inspire and a banner to rally others to join us in
sharing.  This can give us a feeling of harmony which is impossible if
we use software that is not free.  For about half the programmers I talk
to, this is an important happiness that money cannot replace.

How You Can Contribute
----------------------

   I am asking computer manufacturers for donations of machines and
money.  I’m asking individuals for donations of programs and work.(3)

   One consequence you can expect if you donate machines is that GNU
will run on them at an early date.  The machines should be complete,
ready to use systems, approved for use in a residential area, and not in
need of sophisticated cooling or power.

   I have found very many programmers eager to contribute part-time work
for GNU.  For most projects, such part-time distributed work would be
very hard to coordinate; the independently written parts would not work
together.  But for the particular task of replacing Unix, this problem
is absent.  A complete Unix system contains hundreds of utility
programs, each of which is documented separately.  Most interface
specifications are fixed by Unix compatibility.  If each contributor can
write a compatible replacement for a single Unix utility, and make it
work properly in place of the original on a Unix system, then these
utilities will work right when put together.  Even allowing for Murphy
to create a few unexpected problems, assembling these components will be
a feasible task.  (The kernel will require closer communication and will
be worked on by a small, tight group.)

   If I get donations of money, I may be able to hire a few people full
or part time.  The salary won’t be high by programmers’ standards, but
I’m looking for people for whom building community spirit is as
important as making money.  I view this as a way of enabling dedicated
people to devote their full energies to working on GNU by sparing them
the need to make a living in another way.

Why All Computer Users Will Benefit
-----------------------------------

   Once GNU is written, everyone will be able to obtain good system
software free, just like air.(4)

   This means much more than just saving everyone the price of a Unix
license.  It means that much wasteful duplication of system programming
effort will be avoided.  This effort can go instead into advancing the
state of the art.

   Complete system sources will be available to everyone.  As a result,
a user who needs changes in the system will always be free to make them
himself, or hire any available programmer or company to make them for
him.  Users will no longer be at the mercy of one programmer or company
which owns the sources and is in sole position to make changes.

   Schools will be able to provide a much more educational environment
by encouraging all students to study and improve the system code.
Harvard’s computer lab used to have the policy that no program could be
installed on the system if its sources were not on public display, and
upheld it by actually refusing to install certain programs.  I was very
much inspired by this.

   Finally, the overhead of considering who owns the system software and
what one is or is not entitled to do with it will be lifted.

   Arrangements to make people pay for using a program, including
licensing of copies, always incur a tremendous cost to society through
the cumbersome mechanisms necessary to figure out how much (that is,
which programs) a person must pay for.  And only a police state can
force everyone to obey them.  Consider a space station where air must be
manufactured at great cost: charging each breather per liter of air may
be fair, but wearing the metered gas mask all day and all night is
intolerable even if everyone can afford to pay the air bill.  And the TV
cameras everywhere to see if you ever take the mask off are outrageous.
It’s better to support the air plant with a head tax and chuck the
masks.

   Copying all or parts of a program is as natural to a programmer as
breathing, and as productive.  It ought to be as free.

Some Easily Rebutted Objections to GNU’s Goals
----------------------------------------------

*“Nobody will use it if it is free, because that means they can’t rely
on any support.”*

*“You have to charge for the program to pay for providing the support.”*

   If people would rather pay for GNU plus service than get GNU free
without service, a company to provide just service to people who have
obtained GNU free ought to be profitable.(5)

   We must distinguish between support in the form of real programming
work and mere handholding.  The former is something one cannot rely on
from a software vendor.  If your problem is not shared by enough people,
the vendor will tell you to get lost.

   If your business needs to be able to rely on support, the only way is
to have all the necessary sources and tools.  Then you can hire any
available person to fix your problem; you are not at the mercy of any
individual.  With Unix, the price of sources puts this out of
consideration for most businesses.  With GNU this will be easy.  It is
still possible for there to be no available competent person, but this
problem cannot be blamed on distribution arrangements.  GNU does not
eliminate all the world’s problems, only some of them.

   Meanwhile, the users who know nothing about computers need
handholding: doing things for them which they could easily do themselves
but don’t know how.

   Such services could be provided by companies that sell just
handholding and repair service.  If it is true that users would rather
spend money and get a product with service, they will also be willing to
buy the service having got the product free.  The service companies will
compete in quality and price; users will not be tied to any particular
one.  Meanwhile, those of us who don’t need the service should be able
to use the program without paying for the service.

*“You cannot reach many people without advertising, and you must charge
for the program to support that.”*
*“It’s no use advertising a program people can get free.”*

   There are various forms of free or very cheap publicity that can be
used to inform numbers of computer users about something like GNU.  But
it may be true that one can reach more microcomputer users with
advertising.  If this is really so, a business which advertises the
service of copying and mailing GNU for a fee ought to be successful
enough to pay for its advertising and more.  This way, only the users
who benefit from the advertising pay for it.

   On the other hand, if many people get GNU from their friends, and
such companies don’t succeed, this will show that advertising was not
really necessary to spread GNU.  Why is it that free market advocates
don’t want to let the free market decide this?(6)

*“My company needs a proprietary operating system to get a competitive
edge.”*

   GNU will remove operating system software from the realm of
competition.  You will not be able to get an edge in this area, but
neither will your competitors be able to get an edge over you.  You and
they will compete in other areas, while benefiting mutually in this one.
If your business is selling an operating system, you will not like GNU,
but that’s tough on you.  If your business is something else, GNU can
save you from being pushed into the expensive business of selling
operating systems.

   I would like to see GNU development supported by gifts from many
manufacturers and users, reducing the cost to each.(7)

*“Don’t programmers deserve a reward for their creativity?”*

   If anything deserves a reward, it is social contribution.  Creativity
can be a social contribution, but only in so far as society is free to
use the results.  If programmers deserve to be rewarded for creating
innovative programs, by the same token they deserve to be punished if
they restrict the use of these programs.

*“Shouldn’t a programmer be able to ask for a reward for his
creativity?”*

   There is nothing wrong with wanting pay for work, or seeking to
maximize one’s income, as long as one does not use means that are
destructive.  But the means customary in the field of software today are
based on destruction.

   Extracting money from users of a program by restricting their use of
it is destructive because the restrictions reduce the amount and the
ways that the program can be used.  This reduces the amount of wealth
that humanity derives from the program.  When there is a deliberate
choice to restrict, the harmful consequences are deliberate destruction.

   The reason a good citizen does not use such destructive means to
become wealthier is that, if everyone did so, we would all become poorer
from the mutual destructiveness.  This is Kantian ethics; or, the Golden
Rule.  Since I do not like the consequences that result if everyone
hoards information, I am required to consider it wrong for one to do so.
Specifically, the desire to be rewarded for one’s creativity does not
justify depriving the world in general of all or part of that
creativity.

*“Won’t programmers starve?”*

   I could answer that nobody is forced to be a programmer.  Most of us
cannot manage to get any money for standing on the street and making
faces.  But we are not, as a result, condemned to spend our lives
standing on the street making faces, and starving.  We do something
else.

   But that is the wrong answer because it accepts the questioner’s
implicit assumption: that without ownership of software, programmers
cannot possibly be paid a cent.  Supposedly it is all or nothing.

   The real reason programmers will not starve is that it will still be
possible for them to get paid for programming; just not paid as much as
now.

   Restricting copying is not the only basis for business in software.
It is the most common basis(8) because it brings in the most money.  If
it were prohibited, or rejected by the customer, software business would
move to other bases of organization which are now used less often.
There are always numerous ways to organize any kind of business.

   Probably programming will not be as lucrative on the new basis as it
is now.  But that is not an argument against the change.  It is not
considered an injustice that sales clerks make the salaries that they
now do.  If programmers made the same, that would not be an injustice
either.  (In practice they would still make considerably more than
that.)

*“Don’t people have a right to control how their creativity is used?”*

   “Control over the use of one’s ideas” really constitutes control over
other people’s lives; and it is usually used to make their lives more
difficult.

   People who have studied the issue of intellectual property rights(9)
carefully (such as lawyers) say that there is no intrinsic right to
intellectual property.  The kinds of supposed intellectual property
rights that the government recognizes were created by specific acts of
legislation for specific purposes.

   For example, the patent system was established to encourage inventors
to disclose the details of their inventions.  Its purpose was to help
society rather than to help inventors.  At the time, the life span of 17
years for a patent was short compared with the rate of advance of the
state of the art.  Since patents are an issue only among manufacturers,
for whom the cost and effort of a license agreement are small compared
with setting up production, the patents often do not do much harm.  They
do not obstruct most individuals who use patented products.

   The idea of copyright did not exist in ancient times, when authors
frequently copied other authors at length in works of nonfiction.  This
practice was useful, and is the only way many authors’ works have
survived even in part.  The copyright system was created expressly for
the purpose of encouraging authorship.  In the domain for which it was
invented—books, which could be copied economically only on a printing
press—it did little harm, and did not obstruct most of the individuals
who read the books.

   All intellectual property rights are just licenses granted by society
because it was thought, rightly or wrongly, that society as a whole
would benefit by granting them.  But in any particular situation, we
have to ask: are we really better off granting such license?  What kind
of act are we licensing a person to do?

   The case of programs today is very different from that of books a
hundred years ago.  The fact that the easiest way to copy a program is
from one neighbor to another, the fact that a program has both source
code and object code which are distinct, and the fact that a program is
used rather than read and enjoyed, combine to create a situation in
which a person who enforces a copyright is harming society as a whole
both materially and spiritually; in which a person should not do so
regardless of whether the law enables him to.

*“Competition makes things get done better.”*

   The paradigm of competition is a race: by rewarding the winner, we
encourage everyone to run faster.  When capitalism really works this
way, it does a good job; but its defenders are wrong in assuming it
always works this way.  If the runners forget why the reward is offered
and become intent on winning, no matter how, they may find other
strategies—such as, attacking other runners.  If the runners get into a
fist fight, they will all finish late.

   Proprietary and secret software is the moral equivalent of runners in
a fist fight.  Sad to say, the only referee we’ve got does not seem to
object to fights; he just regulates them (“For every ten yards you run,
you can fire one shot”).  He really ought to break them up, and penalize
runners for even trying to fight.

*“Won’t everyone stop programming without a monetary incentive?”*

   Actually, many people will program with absolutely no monetary
incentive.  Programming has an irresistible fascination for some people,
usually the people who are best at it.  There is no shortage of
professional musicians who keep at it even though they have no hope of
making a living that way.

   But really this question, though commonly asked, is not appropriate
to the situation.  Pay for programmers will not disappear, only become
less.  So the right question is, will anyone program with a reduced
monetary incentive?  My experience shows that they will.

   For more than ten years, many of the world’s best programmers worked
at the Artificial Intelligence Lab for far less money than they could
have had anywhere else.  They got many kinds of nonmonetary rewards:
fame and appreciation, for example.  And creativity is also fun, a
reward in itself.

   Then most of them left when offered a chance to do the same
interesting work for a lot of money.

   What the facts show is that people will program for reasons other
than riches; but if given a chance to make a lot of money as well, they
will come to expect and demand it.  Low-paying organizations do poorly
in competition with high-paying ones, but they do not have to do badly
if the high-paying ones are banned.

*“We need the programmers desperately.  If they demand that we stop
helping our neighbors, we have to obey.”*

   You’re never so desperate that you have to obey this sort of demand.
Remember: millions for defense, but not a cent for tribute!

*“Programmers need to make a living somehow.”*

   In the short run, this is true.  However, there are plenty of ways
that programmers could make a living without selling the right to use a
program.  This way is customary now because it brings programmers and
businessmen the most money, not because it is the only way to make a
living.  It is easy to find other ways if you want to find them.  Here
are a number of examples.

   A manufacturer introducing a new computer will pay for the porting of
operating systems onto the new hardware.

   The sale of teaching, handholding and maintenance services could also
employ programmers.

   People with new ideas could distribute programs as freeware,(10)
asking for donations from satisfied users, or selling handholding
services.  I have met people who are already working this way
successfully.

   Users with related needs can form users’ groups, and pay dues.  A
group would contract with programming companies to write programs that
the group’s members would like to use.

   All sorts of development can be funded with a Software Tax:

   Suppose everyone who buys a computer has to pay _x_ percent of the
price as a software tax.  The government gives this to an agency like
the NSF to spend on software development.

   But if the computer buyer makes a donation to software development
himself, he can take a credit against the tax.  He can donate to the
project of his own choosing—often, chosen because he hopes to use the
results when it is done.  He can take a credit for any amount of
donation up to the total tax he had to pay.

   The total tax rate could be decided by a vote of the payers of the
tax, weighted according to the amount they will be taxed on.

   The consequences:

   • The computer-using community supports software development.

   • This community decides what level of support is needed.

   • Users who care which projects their share is spent on can choose
     this for themselves.

   In the long run, making programs free is a step toward the
postscarcity world, where nobody will have to work very hard just to
make a living.  People will be free to devote themselves to activities
that are fun, such as programming, after spending the necessary ten
hours a week on required tasks such as legislation, family counseling,
robot repair and asteroid prospecting.  There will be no need to be able
to make a living from programming.

   We have already greatly reduced the amount of work that the whole
society must do for its actual productivity, but only a little of this
has translated itself into leisure for workers because much
nonproductive activity is required to accompany productive activity.
The main causes of this are bureaucracy and isometric struggles against
competition.  Free software will greatly reduce these drains in the area
of software production.  We must do this, in order for technical gains
in productivity to translate into less work for us.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The wording here was careless.  The intention was that nobody
would have to pay for _permission_ to use the GNU system.  But the words
don’t make this clear, and people often interpret them as saying that
copies of GNU should always be distributed at little or no charge.  That
was never the intent; later on, the manifesto mentions the possibility
of companies providing the service of distribution for a profit.
Subsequently I have learned to distinguish carefully between “free” in
the sense of freedom and “free” in the sense of price.  Free software is
software that users have the freedom to distribute and change.  Some
users may obtain copies at no charge, while others pay to obtain
copies—and if the funds help support improving the software, so much the
better.  The important thing is that everyone who has a copy has the
freedom to cooperate with others in using it.

   (2) The expression “give away” is another indication that I had not
yet clearly separated the issue of price from that of freedom.  We now
recommend avoiding this expression when talking about free software.
See ‘Words to Avoid (or Use with Care) Because They Are Loaded or
Confusing’ (*note it:

Projects list, at <http://fsf.org/campaigns/priority-projects/>, and the
GNU Help Wanted list, the general task list for GNU software packages,
at <http://savannah.gnu.org/people/?type_id=1>.  For other ways to help,
see <http://gnu.org/help/help.html>.

   (4) This is another place I failed to distinguish carefully between
the two different meanings of “free.” The statement as it stands is not
false—you can get copies of GNU software at no charge, from your friends
or over the net.  But it does suggest the wrong idea.

   (5) Several such companies now exist.

   (6) Although it is a charity rather than a company, the Free Software
Foundation for 10 years raised most of its funds from its distribution
service.  You can order things from the FSF to support its work.

   (7) A group of computer companies pooled funds around 1991 to support
maintenance of the GNU C Compiler.

   (8) I think I was mistaken in saying that proprietary software was
the most common basis for making money in software.  It seems that
actually the most common business model was and is development of custom
software.  That does not offer the possibility of collecting rents, so
the business has to keep doing real work in order to keep getting
income.  The custom software business would continue to exist, more or
less unchanged, in a free software world.  Therefore, I no longer expect
that most paid programmers would earn less in a free software world.

   (9) In the 1980s I had not yet realized how confusing it was to speak
of “the issue” of “intellectual property.” That term is obviously
biased; more subtle is the fact that it lumps together various disparate
laws which raise very different issues.  Nowadays I urge people to
reject the term “intellectual property” entirely, lest it lead others to
suppose that those laws form one coherent issue.  The way to be clear is
to discuss patents, copyrights, and trademarks separately.  See ‘Did You
Say “Intellectual Property”? It’s a Seductive Mirage’ (*note it:
(did-you-say-intellectual-property-its-a-seductive-mirage).) for further
explanation of how this term spreads confusion and bias.

   (10) Subsequently we learned to distinguish between “free software”
and “freeware.” The term “freeware” means software you are free to
redistribute, but usually you are not free to study and change the
source code, so most of it is not free software.  See ‘Words to Avoid
(or Use with Care) Because They Are Loaded or Confusing’ (*note it:

The First Software-Sharing Community
------------------------------------

   When I started working at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab in
1971, I became part of a software-sharing community that had existed for
many years.  Sharing of software was not limited to our particular
community; it is as old as computers, just as sharing of recipes is as
old as cooking.  But we did it more than most.

   The AI Lab used a timesharing operating system called ITS (the
Incompatible Timesharing System) that the lab’s staff hackers(1) had
designed and written in assembler language for the Digital PDP-10, one
of the large computers of the era.  As a member of this community, an AI
Lab staff system hacker, my job was to improve this system.

   We did not call our software “free software,” because that term did
not yet exist; but that is what it was.  Whenever people from another
university or a company wanted to port and use a program, we gladly let
them.  If you saw someone using an unfamiliar and interesting program,
you could always ask to see the source code, so that you could read it,
change it, or cannibalize parts of it to make a new program.

The Collapse of the Community
-----------------------------

   The situation changed drastically in the early 1980s when Digital
discontinued the PDP-10 series.  Its architecture, elegant and powerful
in the 60s, could not extend naturally to the larger address spaces that
were becoming feasible in the 80s.  This meant that nearly all of the
programs composing ITS were obsolete.

   The AI Lab hacker community had already collapsed, not long before.
In 1981, the spin-off company Symbolics had hired away nearly all of the
hackers from the AI Lab, and the depopulated community was unable to
maintain itself.  (The book ‘Hackers,’ by Steve Levy, describes these
events, as well as giving a clear picture of this community in its
prime.)  When the AI Lab bought a new PDP-10 in 1982, its administrators
decided to use Digital’s nonfree timesharing system instead of ITS.

   The modern computers of the era, such as the VAX or the 68020, had
their own operating systems, but none of them were free software: you
had to sign a nondisclosure agreement even to get an executable copy.

   This meant that the first step in using a computer was to promise not
to help your neighbor.  A cooperating community was forbidden.  The rule
made by the owners of proprietary software was, “If you share with your
neighbor, you are a pirate.  If you want any changes, beg us to make
them.”

   The idea that the proprietary software social system—the system that
says you are not allowed to share or change software—is antisocial, that
it is unethical, that it is simply wrong, may come as a surprise to some
readers.  But what else could we say about a system based on dividing
the public and keeping users helpless?  Readers who find the idea
surprising may have taken the proprietary software social system as a
given, or judged it on the terms suggested by proprietary software
businesses.  Software publishers have worked long and hard to convince
people that there is only one way to look at the issue.

   When software publishers talk about “enforcing” their “rights” or
“stopping piracy,” what they actually _say_ is secondary.  The real
message of these statements is in the unstated assumptions they take for
granted, which the public is asked to accept without examination.  Let’s
therefore examine them.

   One assumption is that software companies have an unquestionable
natural right to own software and thus have power over all its users.
(If this were a natural right, then no matter how much harm it does to
the public, we could not object.)  Interestingly, the US Constitution
and legal tradition reject this view; copyright is not a natural right,
but an artificial government-imposed monopoly that limits the users’
natural right to copy.

   Another unstated assumption is that the only important thing about
software is what jobs it allows you to do—that we computer users should
not care what kind of society we are allowed to have.

   A third assumption is that we would have no usable software (or would
never have a program to do this or that particular job) if we did not
offer a company power over the users of the program.  This assumption
may have seemed plausible, before the free software movement
demonstrated that we can make plenty of useful software without putting
chains on it.

   If we decline to accept these assumptions, and judge these issues
based on ordinary commonsense morality while placing the users first, we
arrive at very different conclusions.  Computer users should be free to
modify programs to fit their needs, and free to share software, because
helping other people is the basis of society.

   There is no room here for an extensive statement of the reasoning
behind this conclusion, so I refer the reader to the article ‘Why
Software Should Not Have Owners’ (*note it:
(why-software-should-not-have-owners).).

A Stark Moral Choice
--------------------

   With my community gone, to continue as before was impossible.
Instead, I faced a stark moral choice.

   The easy choice was to join the proprietary software world, signing
nondisclosure agreements and promising not to help my fellow hacker.
Most likely I would also be developing software that was released under
nondisclosure agreements, thus adding to the pressure on other people to
betray their fellows too.

   I could have made money this way, and perhaps amused myself writing
code.  But I knew that at the end of my career, I would look back on
years of building walls to divide people, and feel I had spent my life
making the world a worse place.

   I had already experienced being on the receiving end of a
nondisclosure agreement, when someone refused to give me and the MIT AI
Lab the source code for the control program for our printer.  (The lack
of certain features in this program made use of the printer extremely
frustrating.)  So I could not tell myself that nondisclosure agreements
were innocent.  I was very angry when he refused to share with us; I
could not turn around and do the same thing to everyone else.

   Another choice, straightforward but unpleasant, was to leave the
computer field.  That way my skills would not be misused, but they would
still be wasted.  I would not be culpable for dividing and restricting
computer users, but it would happen nonetheless.

   So I looked for a way that a programmer could do something for the
good.  I asked myself, was there a program or programs that I could
write, so as to make a community possible once again?

   The answer was clear: what was needed first was an operating system.
That is the crucial software for starting to use a computer.  With an
operating system, you can do many things; without one, you cannot run
the computer at all.  With a free operating system, we could again have
a community of cooperating hackers—and invite anyone to join.  And
anyone would be able to use a computer without starting out by
conspiring to deprive his or her friends.

   As an operating system developer, I had the right skills for this
job.  So even though I could not take success for granted, I realized
that I was elected to do the job.  I chose to make the system compatible
with Unix so that it would be portable, and so that Unix users could
easily switch to it.  The name GNU was chosen, following a hacker
tradition, as a recursive acronym for “GNU’s Not Unix.”

   An operating system does not mean just a kernel, barely enough to run
other programs.  In the 1970s, every operating system worthy of the name
included command processors, assemblers, compilers, interpreters,
debuggers, text editors, mailers, and much more.  ITS had them, Multics
had them, VMS had them, and Unix had them.  The GNU operating system
would include them too.

   Later I heard these words, attributed to Hillel:(2)

     If I am not for myself, who will be for me?
     If I am only for myself, what am I?
     If not now, when?

   The decision to start the GNU Project was based on a similar spirit.

Free as in Freedom
------------------

   The term “free software” is sometimes misunderstood—it has nothing to
do with price.  It is about freedom.  Here, therefore, is the definition
of free software.

   A program is free software, for you, a particular user, if:

   • You have the freedom to run the program as you wish, for any
     purpose.

   • You have the freedom to modify the program to suit your needs.  (To
     make this freedom effective in practice, you must have access to
     the source code, since making changes in a program without having
     the source code is exceedingly difficult.)

   • You have the freedom to redistribute copies, either gratis or for a
     fee.

   • You have the freedom to distribute modified versions of the
     program, so that the community can benefit from your improvements.

   Since “free” refers to freedom, not to price, there is no
contradiction between selling copies and free software.  In fact, the
freedom to sell copies is crucial: collections of free software sold on
CD-ROMs are important for the community, and selling them is an
important way to raise funds for free software development.  Therefore,
a program which people are not free to include on these collections is
not free software.

   Because of the ambiguity of “free,” people have long looked for
alternatives, but no one has found a better term.  The English language
has more words and nuances than any other, but it lacks a simple,
unambiguous, word that means “free,” as in freedom—“unfettered” being
the word that comes closest in meaning.  Such alternatives as
“liberated,” “freedom,” and “open” have either the wrong meaning or some
other disadvantage.

GNU Software and the GNU System
-------------------------------

   Developing a whole system is a very large project.  To bring it into
reach, I decided to adapt and use existing pieces of free software
wherever that was possible.  For example, I decided at the very
beginning to use TeX as the principal text formatter; a few years later,
I decided to use the X Window System rather than writing another window
system for GNU.

   Because of this decision, the GNU system is not the same as the
collection of all GNU software.  The GNU system includes programs that
are not GNU software, programs that were developed by other people and
projects for their own purposes, but which we can use because they are
free software.

Commencing the Project
----------------------

   In January 1984 I quit my job at MIT and began writing GNU software.
Leaving MIT was necessary so that MIT would not be able to interfere
with distributing GNU as free software.  If I had remained on the staff,
MIT could have claimed to own the work, and could have imposed their own
distribution terms, or even turned the work into a proprietary software
package.  I had no intention of doing a large amount of work only to see
it become useless for its intended purpose: creating a new
software-sharing community.

   However, Professor Winston, then the head of the MIT AI Lab, kindly
invited me to keep using the lab’s facilities.

The First Steps
---------------

   Shortly before beginning the GNU Project, I heard about the Free
University Compiler Kit, also known as VUCK.  (The Dutch word for “free”
is written with a _v._)  This was a compiler designed to handle multiple
languages, including C and Pascal, and to support multiple target
machines.  I wrote to its author asking if GNU could use it.

   He responded derisively, stating that the university was free but the
compiler was not.  I therefore decided that my first program for the GNU
Project would be a multilanguage, multiplatform compiler.

   Hoping to avoid the need to write the whole compiler myself, I
obtained the source code for the Pastel compiler, which was a
multiplatform compiler developed at Lawrence Livermore Lab.  It
supported, and was written in, an extended version of Pascal, designed
to be a system-programming language.  I added a C front end, and began
porting it to the Motorola 68000 computer.  But I had to give that up
when I discovered that the compiler needed many megabytes of stack
space, while the available 68000 Unix system would only allow 64k.

   I then realized that the Pastel compiler functioned by parsing the
entire input file into a syntax tree, converting the whole syntax tree
into a chain of “instructions,” and then generating the whole output
file, without ever freeing any storage.  At this point, I concluded I
would have to write a new compiler from scratch.  That new compiler is
now known as GCC; none of the Pastel compiler is used in it, but I
managed to adapt and use the C front end that I had written.  But that
was some years later; first, I worked on GNU Emacs.

GNU Emacs
---------

   I began work on GNU Emacs in September 1984, and in early 1985 it was
beginning to be usable.  This enabled me to begin using Unix systems to
do editing; having no interest in learning to use vi or ed, I had done
my editing on other kinds of machines until then.

   At this point, people began wanting to use GNU Emacs, which raised
the question of how to distribute it.  Of course, I put it on the
anonymous ftp server on the MIT computer that I used.  (This computer,
‘prep.ai.mit.edu’, thus became the principal GNU ftp distribution site;
when it was decommissioned a few years later, we transferred the name to
our new ftp server.)  But at that time, many of the interested people
were not on the Internet and could not get a copy by ftp.  So the
question was, what would I say to them?

   I could have said, “Find a friend who is on the net and who will make
a copy for you.” Or I could have done what I did with the original
PDP-10 Emacs: tell them, “Mail me a tape and a SASE (self-addressed
stamped envelope), and I will mail it back with Emacs on it.” But I had
no job, and I was looking for ways to make money from free software.  So
I announced that I would mail a tape to whoever wanted one, for a fee of
$150.  In this way, I started a free software distribution business, the
precursor of the companies that today distribute entire Linux-based GNU
systems.

Is a Program Free for Every User?
---------------------------------

   If a program is free software when it leaves the hands of its author,
this does not necessarily mean it will be free software for everyone who
has a copy of it.  For example, public domain software (software that is
not copyrighted) is free software; but anyone can make a proprietary
modified version of it.  Likewise, many free programs are copyrighted
but distributed under simple permissive licenses which allow proprietary
modified versions.

   The paradigmatic example of this problem is the X Window System.
Developed at MIT, and released as free software with a permissive
license, it was soon adopted by various computer companies.  They added
X to their proprietary Unix systems, in binary form only, and covered by
the same nondisclosure agreement.  These copies of X were no more free
software than Unix was.

   The developers of the X Window System did not consider this a
problem—they expected and intended this to happen.  Their goal was not
freedom, just “success,” defined as “having many users.” They did not
care whether these users had freedom, only about having many of them.

   This led to a paradoxical situation where two different ways of
counting the amount of freedom gave different answers to the question,
“Is this program free?” If you judged based on the freedom provided by
the distribution terms of the MIT release, you would say that X was free
software.  But if you measured the freedom of the average user of X, you
would have to say it was proprietary software.  Most X users were
running the proprietary versions that came with Unix systems, not the
free version.

Copyleft and the GNU GPL
------------------------

   The goal of GNU was to give users freedom, not just to be popular.
So we needed to use distribution terms that would prevent GNU software
from being turned into proprietary software.  The method we use is
called “copyleft.”(3)

   Copyleft uses copyright law, but flips it over to serve the opposite
of its usual purpose: instead of a means for restricting a program, it
becomes a means for keeping the program free.

   The central idea of copyleft is that we give everyone permission to
run the program, copy the program, modify the program, and distribute
modified versions—but not permission to add restrictions of their own.
Thus, the crucial freedoms that define “free software” are guaranteed to
everyone who has a copy; they become inalienable rights.

   For an effective copyleft, modified versions must also be free.  This
ensures that work based on ours becomes available to our community if it
is published.  When programmers who have jobs as programmers volunteer
to improve GNU software, it is copyleft that prevents their employers
from saying, “You can’t share those changes, because we are going to use
them to make our proprietary version of the program.”

   The requirement that changes must be free is essential if we want to
ensure freedom for every user of the program.  The companies that
privatized the X Window System usually made some changes to port it to
their systems and hardware.  These changes were small compared with the
great extent of X, but they were not trivial.  If making changes were an
excuse to deny the users freedom, it would be easy for anyone to take
advantage of the excuse.

   A related issue concerns combining a free program with nonfree code.
Such a combination would inevitably be nonfree; whichever freedoms are
lacking for the nonfree part would be lacking for the whole as well.  To
permit such combinations would open a hole big enough to sink a ship.
Therefore, a crucial requirement for copyleft is to plug this hole:
anything added to or combined with a copylefted program must be such
that the larger combined version is also free and copylefted.

   The specific implementation of copyleft that we use for most GNU
software is the GNU General Public License, or GNU GPL for short.  We
have other kinds of copyleft that are used in specific circumstances.
GNU manuals are copylefted also, but use a much simpler kind of
copyleft, because the complexity of the GNU GPL is not necessary for
manuals.(4)

The Free Software Foundation
----------------------------

   As interest in using Emacs was growing, other people became involved
in the GNU Project, and we decided that it was time to seek funding once
again.  So in 1985 we created the Free Software Foundation (FSF), a
tax-exempt charity for free software development.  The FSF also took
over the Emacs tape distribution business; later it extended this by
adding other free software (both GNU and non-GNU) to the tape, and by
selling free manuals as well.

   Most of the FSF’s income used to come from sales of copies of free
software and of other related services (CD-ROMs of source code, CD-ROMs
with binaries, nicely printed manuals, all with the freedom to
redistribute and modify), and Deluxe Distributions (distributions for
which we built the whole collection of software for the customer’s
choice of platform).  Today the FSF still sells manuals and other gear,
but it gets the bulk of its funding from members’ dues.  You can join
the FSF at <http://fsf.org/join>.

   Free Software Foundation employees have written and maintained a
number of GNU software packages.  Two notable ones are the C library and
the shell.  The GNU C library is what every program running on a
GNU/Linux system uses to communicate with Linux.  It was developed by a
member of the Free Software Foundation staff, Roland McGrath.  The shell
used on most GNU/Linux systems is BASH, the Bourne Again Shell,(5) which
was developed by FSF employee Brian Fox.

   We funded development of these programs because the GNU Project was
not just about tools or a development environment.  Our goal was a
complete operating system, and these programs were needed for that goal.

Free Software Support
---------------------

   The free software philosophy rejects a specific widespread business
practice, but it is not against business.  When businesses respect the
users’ freedom, we wish them success.

   Selling copies of Emacs demonstrates one kind of free software
business.  When the FSF took over that business, I needed another way to
make a living.  I found it in selling services relating to the free
software I had developed.  This included teaching, for subjects such as
how to program GNU Emacs and how to customize GCC, and software
development, mostly porting GCC to new platforms.

   Today each of these kinds of free software business is practiced by a
number of corporations.  Some distribute free software collections on
CD-ROM; others sell support at levels ranging from answering user
questions, to fixing bugs, to adding major new features.  We are even
beginning to see free software companies based on launching new free
software products.

   Watch out, though—a number of companies that associate themselves
with the term “open source” actually base their business on nonfree
software that works with free software.  These are not free software
companies, they are proprietary software companies whose products tempt
users away from freedom.  They call these programs “value-added
packages,” which shows the values they would like us to adopt:
convenience above freedom.  If we value freedom more, we should call
them “freedom-subtracted” packages.

Technical Goals
---------------

   The principal goal of GNU is to be free software.  Even if GNU had no
technical advantage over Unix, it would have a social advantage,
allowing users to cooperate, and an ethical advantage, respecting the
user’s freedom.

   But it was natural to apply the known standards of good practice to
the work—for example, dynamically allocating data structures to avoid
arbitrary fixed size limits, and handling all the possible 8-bit codes
wherever that made sense.

   In addition, we rejected the Unix focus on small memory size, by
deciding not to support 16-bit machines (it was clear that 32-bit
machines would be the norm by the time the GNU system was finished), and
to make no effort to reduce memory usage unless it exceeded a megabyte.
In programs for which handling very large files was not crucial, we
encouraged programmers to read an entire input file into core, then scan
its contents without having to worry about I/O.

   These decisions enabled many GNU programs to surpass their Unix
counterparts in reliability and speed.

Donated Computers
-----------------

   As the GNU Project’s reputation grew, people began offering to donate
machines running Unix to the project.  These were very useful, because
the easiest way to develop components of GNU was to do it on a Unix
system, and replace the components of that system one by one.  But they
raised an ethical issue: whether it was right for us to have a copy of
Unix at all.

   Unix was (and is) proprietary software, and the GNU Project’s
philosophy said that we should not use proprietary software.  But,
applying the same reasoning that leads to the conclusion that violence
in self defense is justified, I concluded that it was legitimate to use
a proprietary package when that was crucial for developing a free
replacement that would help others stop using the proprietary package.

   But, even if this was a justifiable evil, it was still an evil.
Today we no longer have any copies of Unix, because we have replaced
them with free operating systems.  If we could not replace a machine’s
operating system with a free one, we replaced the machine instead.

The GNU Task List
-----------------

   As the GNU Project proceeded, and increasing numbers of system
components were found or developed, eventually it became useful to make
a list of the remaining gaps.  We used it to recruit developers to write
the missing pieces.  This list became known as the GNU Task List.  In
addition to missing Unix components, we listed various other useful
software and documentation projects that, we thought, a truly complete
system ought to have.

   Today,(6) hardly any Unix components are left in the GNU Task
List—those jobs had been done, aside from a few inessential ones.  But
the list is full of projects that some might call “applications.” Any
program that appeals to more than a narrow class of users would be a
useful thing to add to an operating system.

   Even games are included in the task list—and have been since the
beginning.  Unix included games, so naturally GNU should too.  But
compatibility was not an issue for games, so we did not follow the list
of games that Unix had.  Instead, we listed a spectrum of different
kinds of games that users might like.

The GNU Library GPL
-------------------

   The GNU C library uses a special kind of copyleft called the GNU
Library General Public License,(7) which gives permission to link
proprietary software with the library.  Why make this exception?

   It is not a matter of principle; there is no principle that says
proprietary software products are entitled to include our code.  (Why
contribute to a project predicated on refusing to share with us?)  Using
the LGPL for the C library, or for any library, is a matter of strategy.

   The C library does a generic job; every proprietary system or
compiler comes with a C library.  Therefore, to make our C library
available only to free software would not have given free software any
advantage—it would only have discouraged use of our library.

   One system is an exception to this: on the GNU system (and this
includes GNU/Linux), the GNU C library is the only C library.  So the
distribution terms of the GNU C library determine whether it is possible
to compile a proprietary program for the GNU system.  There is no
ethical reason to allow proprietary applications on the GNU system, but
strategically it seems that disallowing them would do more to discourage
use of the GNU system than to encourage development of free
applications.  That is why using the Library GPL is a good strategy for
the C library.

   For other libraries, the strategic decision needs to be considered on
a case-by-case basis.  When a library does a special job that can help
write certain kinds of programs, then releasing it under the GPL,
limiting it to free programs only, is a way of helping other free
software developers, giving them an advantage against proprietary
software.

   Consider GNU Readline, a library that was developed to provide
command-line editing for BASH.  Readline is released under the ordinary
GNU GPL, not the Library GPL.  This probably does reduce the amount
Readline is used, but that is no loss for us.  Meanwhile, at least one
useful application has been made free software specifically so it could
use Readline, and that is a real gain for the community.

   Proprietary software developers have the advantages money provides;
free software developers need to make advantages for each other.  I hope
some day we will have a large collection of GPL-covered libraries that
have no parallel available to proprietary software, providing useful
modules to serve as building blocks in new free software, and adding up
to a major advantage for further free software development.

Scratching an Itch?
-------------------

   Eric Raymond(8) says that “Every good work of software starts by
scratching a developer’s personal itch.”(9) Maybe that happens
sometimes, but many essential pieces of GNU software were developed in
order to have a complete free operating system.  They come from a vision
and a plan, not from impulse.

   For example, we developed the GNU C library because a Unix-like
system needs a C library, BASH because a Unix-like system needs a shell,
and GNU tar because a Unix-like system needs a tar program.  The same is
true for my own programs—the GNU C compiler, GNU Emacs, GDB and GNU
Make.

   Some GNU programs were developed to cope with specific threats to our
freedom.  Thus, we developed gzip to replace the Compress program, which
had been lost to the community because of the LZW patents.  We found
people to develop LessTif, and more recently started GNOME and Harmony,
to address the problems caused by certain proprietary libraries (see
below).  We are developing the GNU Privacy Guard to replace popular
nonfree encryption software, because users should not have to choose
between privacy and freedom.

   Of course, the people writing these programs became interested in the
work, and many features were added to them by various people for the
sake of their own needs and interests.  But that is not why the programs
exist.

Unexpected Developments
-----------------------

   At the beginning of the GNU Project, I imagined that we would develop
the whole GNU system, then release it as a whole.  That is not how it
happened.

   Since each component of the GNU system was implemented on a Unix
system, each component could run on Unix systems long before a complete
GNU system existed.  Some of these programs became popular, and users
began extending them and porting them—to the various incompatible
versions of Unix, and sometimes to other systems as well.

   The process made these programs much more powerful, and attracted
both funds and contributors to the GNU Project.  But it probably also
delayed completion of a minimal working system by several years, as GNU
developers’ time was put into maintaining these ports and adding
features to the existing components, rather than moving on to write one
missing component after another.

The GNU Hurd
------------

   By 1990, the GNU system was almost complete; the only major missing
component was the kernel.  We had decided to implement our kernel as a
collection of server processes running on top of Mach.  Mach is a
microkernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University and then at the
University of Utah; the GNU Hurd is a collection of servers (i.e., a
herd of GNUs) that run on top of Mach, and do the various jobs of the
Unix kernel.  The start of development was delayed as we waited for Mach
to be released as free software, as had been promised.

   One reason for choosing this design was to avoid what seemed to be
the hardest part of the job: debugging a kernel program without a
source-level debugger to do it with.  This part of the job had been done
already, in Mach, and we expected to debug the Hurd servers as user
programs, with GDB.  But it took a long time to make that possible, and
the multithreaded servers that send messages to each other have turned
out to be very hard to debug.  Making the Hurd work solidly has
stretched on for many years.

Alix
----

   The GNU kernel was not originally supposed to be called the Hurd.
Its original name was Alix—named after the woman who was my sweetheart
at the time.  She, a Unix system administrator, had pointed out how her
name would fit a common naming pattern for Unix system versions; as a
joke, she told her friends, “Someone should name a kernel after me.” I
said nothing, but decided to surprise her with a kernel named Alix.

   It did not stay that way.  Michael (now Thomas) Bushnell, the main
developer of the kernel, preferred the name Hurd, and redefined Alix to
refer to a certain part of the kernel—the part that would trap system
calls and handle them by sending messages to Hurd servers.

   Later, Alix and I broke up, and she changed her name; independently,
the Hurd design was changed so that the C library would send messages
directly to servers, and this made the Alix component disappear from the
design.

   But before these things happened, a friend of hers came across the
name Alix in the Hurd source code, and mentioned it to her.  So she did
have the chance to find a kernel named after her.

Linux and GNU/Linux
-------------------

   The GNU Hurd is not suitable for production use, and we don’t know if
it ever will be.  The capability-based design has problems that result
directly from the flexibility of the design, and it is not clear
solutions exist.

   Fortunately, another kernel is available.  In 1991, Linus Torvalds
developed a Unix-compatible kernel and called it Linux.  In 1992, he
made Linux free software; combining Linux with the not-quite-complete
GNU system resulted in a complete free operating system.  (Combining
them was a substantial job in itself, of course.)  It is due to Linux
that we can actually run a version of the GNU system today.

   We call this system version GNU/Linux, to express its composition as
a combination of the GNU system with Linux as the kernel.

Challenges in Our Future
------------------------

   We have proved our ability to develop a broad spectrum of free
software.  This does not mean we are invincible and unstoppable.
Several challenges make the future of free software uncertain; meeting
them will require steadfast effort and endurance, sometimes lasting for
years.  It will require the kind of determination that people display
when they value their freedom and will not let anyone take it away.

   The following four sections discuss these challenges.

Secret Hardware
---------------

   Hardware manufacturers increasingly tend to keep hardware
specifications secret.  This makes it difficult to write free drivers so
that Linux and XFree86 can support new hardware.  We have complete free
systems today, but we will not have them tomorrow if we cannot support
tomorrow’s computers.

   There are two ways to cope with this problem.  Programmers can do
reverse engineering to figure out how to support the hardware.  The rest
of us can choose the hardware that is supported by free software; as our
numbers increase, secrecy of specifications will become a self-defeating
policy.

   Reverse engineering is a big job; will we have programmers with
sufficient determination to undertake it?  Yes—if we have built up a
strong feeling that free software is a matter of principle, and nonfree
drivers are intolerable.  And will large numbers of us spend extra
money, or even a little extra time, so we can use free drivers?  Yes, if
the determination to have freedom is widespread.

   [2008 note: this issue extends to the BIOS as well.  There is a free
BIOS, coreboot; the problem is getting specs for machines so that
coreboot can support them.]

Nonfree Libraries
-----------------

   A nonfree library that runs on free operating systems acts as a trap
for free software developers.  The library’s attractive features are the
bait; if you use the library, you fall into the trap, because your
program cannot usefully be part of a free operating system.  (Strictly
speaking, we could include your program, but it won’t _run_ with the
library missing.)  Even worse, if a program that uses the proprietary
library becomes popular, it can lure other unsuspecting programmers into
the trap.

   The first instance of this problem was the Motif toolkit, back in the
80s.  Although there were as yet no free operating systems, it was clear
what problem Motif would cause for them later on.  The GNU Project
responded in two ways: by asking individual free software projects to
support the free X Toolkit widgets as well as Motif, and by asking for
someone to write a free replacement for Motif.  The job took many years;
LessTif, developed by the Hungry Programmers, became powerful enough to
support most Motif applications only in 1997.

   Between 1996 and 1998, another nonfree GUI toolkit library, called
Qt, was used in a substantial collection of free software, the desktop
KDE.

   Free GNU/Linux systems were unable to use KDE, because we could not
use the library.  However, some commercial distributors of GNU/Linux
systems who were not strict about sticking with free software added KDE
to their systems—producing a system with more capabilities, but less
freedom.  The KDE group was actively encouraging more programmers to use
Qt, and millions of new “Linux users” had never been exposed to the idea
that there was a problem in this.  The situation appeared grim.

   The free software community responded to the problem in two ways:
GNOME and Harmony.

   GNOME, the GNU Network Object Model Environment, is GNU’s desktop
project.  Started in 1997 by Miguel de Icaza, and developed with the
support of Red Hat Software, GNOME set out to provide similar desktop
facilities, but using free software exclusively.  It has technical
advantages as well, such as supporting a variety of languages, not just
C++.  But its main purpose was freedom: not to require the use of any
nonfree software.

   Harmony is a compatible replacement library, designed to make it
possible to run KDE software without using Qt.

   In November 1998, the developers of Qt announced a change of license
which, when carried out, should make Qt free software.  There is no way
to be sure, but I think that this was partly due to the community’s firm
response to the problem that Qt posed when it was nonfree.  (The new
license is inconvenient and inequitable, so it remains desirable to
avoid using Qt.)

   [Subsequent note: in September 2000, Qt was rereleased under the GNU
GPL, which essentially solved this problem.]

   How will we respond to the next tempting nonfree library?  Will the
whole community understand the need to stay out of the trap?  Or will
many of us give up freedom for convenience, and produce a major problem?
Our future depends on our philosophy.

Software Patents
----------------

   The worst threat we face comes from software patents, which can put
algorithms and features off limits to free software for up to 20 years.
The LZW compression algorithm patents were applied for in 1983, and we
still cannot release free software to produce proper compressed GIFs.
[As of 2009 they have expired.]  In 1998, a free program to produce MP3
compressed audio was removed from distribution under threat of a patent
suit.

   There are ways to cope with patents: we can search for evidence that
a patent is invalid, and we can look for alternative ways to do a job.
But each of these methods works only sometimes; when both fail, a patent
may force all free software to lack some feature that users want.  What
will we do when this happens?

   Those of us who value free software for freedom’s sake will stay with
free software anyway.  We will manage to get work done without the
patented features.  But those who value free software because they
expect it to be technically superior are likely to call it a failure
when a patent holds it back.  Thus, while it is useful to talk about the
practical effectiveness of the “bazaar” model of development, and the
reliability and power of some free software, we must not stop there.  We
must talk about freedom and principle.

Free Documentation
------------------

   The biggest deficiency in our free operating systems is not in the
software—it is the lack of good free manuals that we can include in our
systems.  Documentation is an essential part of any software package;
when an important free software package does not come with a good free
manual, that is a major gap.  We have many such gaps today.

   Free documentation, like free software, is a matter of freedom, not
price.  The criterion for a free manual is pretty much the same as for
free software: it is a matter of giving all users certain freedoms.
Redistribution (including commercial sale) must be permitted, online and
on paper, so that the manual can accompany every copy of the program.

   Permission for modification is crucial too.  As a general rule, I
don’t believe that it is essential for people to have permission to
modify all sorts of articles and books.  For example, I don’t think you
or I are obliged to give permission to modify articles like this one,
which describe our actions and our views.

   But there is a particular reason why the freedom to modify is crucial
for documentation for free software.  When people exercise their right
to modify the software, and add or change its features, if they are
conscientious they will change the manual, too—so they can provide
accurate and usable documentation with the modified program.  A nonfree
manual, which does not allow programmers to be conscientious and finish
the job, does not fill our community’s needs.

   Some kinds of limits on how modifications are done pose no problem.
For example, requirements to preserve the original author’s copyright
notice, the distribution terms, or the list of authors, are OK. It is
also no problem to require modified versions to include notice that they
were modified, even to have entire sections that may not be deleted or
changed, as long as these sections deal with nontechnical topics.  These
kinds of restrictions are not a problem because they don’t stop the
conscientious programmer from adapting the manual to fit the modified
program.  In other words, they don’t block the free software community
from making full use of the manual.

   However, it must be possible to modify all the _technical_ content of
the manual, and then distribute the result in all the usual media,
through all the usual channels; otherwise, the restrictions do obstruct
the community, the manual is not free, and we need another manual.

   Will free software developers have the awareness and determination to
produce a full spectrum of free manuals?  Once again, our future depends
on philosophy.

We Must Talk about Freedom
--------------------------

   Estimates today are that there are ten million users of GNU/Linux
systems such as Debian GNU/Linux and Red Hat “Linux.” Free software has
developed such practical advantages that users are flocking to it for
purely practical reasons.

   The good consequences of this are evident: more interest in
developing free software, more customers for free software businesses,
and more ability to encourage companies to develop commercial free
software instead of proprietary software products.

   But interest in the software is growing faster than awareness of the
philosophy it is based on, and this leads to trouble.  Our ability to
meet the challenges and threats described above depends on the will to
stand firm for freedom.  To make sure our community has this will, we
need to spread the idea to the new users as they come into the
community.

   But we are failing to do so: the efforts to attract new users into
our community are far outstripping the efforts to teach them the civics
of our community.  We need to do both, and we need to keep the two
efforts in balance.

“Open Source”
-------------

   Teaching new users about freedom became more difficult in 1998, when
a part of the community decided to stop using the term “free software”
and say “open source software” instead.

   Some who favored this term aimed to avoid the confusion of “free”
with “gratis”—a valid goal.  Others, however, aimed to set aside the
spirit of principle that had motivated the free software movement and
the GNU Project, and to appeal instead to executives and business users,
many of whom hold an ideology that places profit above freedom, above
community, above principle.  Thus, the rhetoric of “open source” focuses
on the potential to make high-quality, powerful software, but shuns the
ideas of freedom, community, and principle.

   The “Linux” magazines are a clear example of this—they are filled
with advertisements for proprietary software that works with GNU/Linux.
When the next Motif or Qt appears, will these magazines warn programmers
to stay away from it, or will they run ads for it?

   The support of business can contribute to the community in many ways;
all else being equal, it is useful.  But winning their support by
speaking even less about freedom and principle can be disastrous; it
makes the previous imbalance between outreach and civics education even
worse.

   “Free software” and “open source” describe the same category of
software, more or less, but say different things about the software, and
about values.  The GNU Project continues to use the term “free
software,” to express the idea that freedom, not just technology, is
important.

Try!
----

   Yoda’s aphorism (“There is no ‘try’”) sounds neat, but it doesn’t
work for me.  I have done most of my work while anxious about whether I
could do the job, and unsure that it would be enough to achieve the goal
if I did.  But I tried anyway, because there was no one but me between
the enemy and my city.  Surprising myself, I have sometimes succeeded.

   Sometimes I failed; some of my cities have fallen.  Then I found
another threatened city, and got ready for another battle.  Over time,
I’ve learned to look for threats and put myself between them and my
city, calling on other hackers to come and join me.

   Nowadays, often I’m not the only one.  It is a relief and a joy when
I see a regiment of hackers digging in to hold the line, and I realize,
this city may survive—for now.  But the dangers are greater each year,
and now Microsoft has explicitly targeted our community.  We can’t take
the future of freedom for granted.  Don’t take it for granted!  If you
want to keep your freedom, you must be prepared to defend it.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The use of “hacker” to mean “security breaker” is a confusion on
the part of the mass media.  We hackers refuse to recognize that

the two.  See my article, “On Hacking,” at

people to write.

Appendix G Linux and the GNU system

collection of articles and essays about free software and related
matters.

   The GNU project started in 1984 with the goal of developing a
complete free Unix-like operating system: GNU.  “Free” refers to
freedom, not price; it means you are free to run, copy, distribute,
study, change, and improve the software.

   A Unix-like system consists of many different programs.  We found
some components already available as free software—for example, X
Windows and TeX.  We obtained other components by helping to convince
their developers to make them free—for example, the Berkeley network
utilities.  This left many missing components that we had to write in
order to produce GNU—for example, GNU Emacs, the GNU C compiler, the GNU
C library, Bash, and Ghostscript.  The GNU system consists of all these
components together.

   The GNU project is not just about developing and distributing some
useful free software.  The heart of the GNU project is an idea: that
software should be free, that software users should have freedom to
participate in a community.  To run your computer, you need an operating
system; if it is not free, your freedom has been denied.  To have
freedom, you need a free operating system.  We therefore set out to
write one.

   In the long run, though, we cannot expect to keep the free operating
system free unless the users are aware of the freedom it gives them, and
value that freedom.  People who do not appreciate their freedom will not
keep it long.  If we want to make freedom last, we need to spread
awareness of the freedoms they have in free software.

   The GNU project’s method is that free software and the idea of users’
freedom support each other.  We develop GNU software, and as people
encounter GNU programs or the GNU system and start to use them, they
also think about the GNU idea.  The software shows that the idea can
work in practice.  Some of these people come to agree with the idea, and
then they are more likely to write additional free software.  Thus, the
software embodies the idea, spreads the idea, and grows from the idea.

   Early on in the development of GNU, various parts of it became
popular even though users needed proprietary systems to run them on.
Porting the system to many systems and maintaining them required a lot
of work.  After that work, most GNU software is easily configured for a
variety of different platforms.

   By 1991, we had found or written all of the essential major
components of the system except the kernel, which we were writing.(1)

   That was the situation when Linux came into being.  Linux is a
kernel, like the kernel of Unix; it was written by Linus Torvalds, who
released it under the GNU General Public License.  He did not write this
kernel for GNU, but it fit into the gap in GNU.  The combination of GNU
and Linux included all the major essential components of a
Unix-compatible operating system.  Other people, with some work made the
combination into a usable system.  The principal use of Linux, the
kernel, is as part of this combination.

   The popularity of the GNU/Linux combination is success, in the sense
of popularity, for GNU.  Ironically, the popularity of GNU/Linux
undermines our method of communicating the ideas of GNU to people who
use GNU.

   When GNU programs were only usable individually on top of another
operating system, installing and using them meant knowing and
appreciating these programs, and thus being aware of GNU, which led
people to think about the philosophical base of GNU.  Now users can
install a unified operating system which is basically GNU, but they
usually think these are “Linux systems”.  At first impression, a “Linux
system” sounds like something completely distinct from the “GNU system,”
and that is what most users think.

   This leads many users to identify themselves as a separate community
of “Linux users”, distinct from the GNU user community.  They use more
than just some GNU programs, they use almost all of the GNU system, but
they don’t think of themselves as GNU users.  Often they never hear
about the GNU idea; if they do, they may not think it relates to them.

   Most introductions to the “Linux system” acknowledge that GNU
software components play a role in it, but they don’t say that the
system as a whole is a modified version of the GNU system that the GNU
project has been developing and compiling since Linus Torvalds was in
junior high school.  They don’t say that the main reason this free
operating exists is that the GNU Project worked persistently to achieve
its goal of freedom.

   As a result, most users don’t know these things.  They believe that
the “Linux system” was developed by Linus Torvalds “just for fun”, and
that their freedom is a matter of good fortune rather than the dedicated
pursuit of freedom.  This creates a danger that they will leave the
survival of free software to fortune as well.

   Since human beings tend to correct their first impressions less than
called for by additional information they learn later, these users will
tend to continue to underestimate their connection to GNU even if they
do learn the facts.

   When we began trying to support the GNU/Linux system, we found this
widespread misinformation led to a practical problem—it hampered
cooperation on software maintenance.  Normally when users change a GNU
program to make it work better on a particular system, they send the
change to the maintainer of that program; then they work with the
maintainer, explaining the change, arguing for it, and sometimes
rewriting it for the sake of the overall coherence and maintainability
of the package, to get the patch installed.  But people who thought of
themselves as “Linux users” showed a tendency to release a forked
“Linux-only” version of the GNU program and consider the job done.  In
some cases we had to redo their work in order to make GNU programs run
as released in GNU/Linux systems.

   How should the GNU project encourage its users to cooperate?  How
should we spread the idea that freedom for computer users is important?

   We must continue to talk about the freedom to share and change
software—and to teach other users to value these freedoms.  If we value
having a free operating system, it makes sense to think about preserving
those freedoms for the long term.  If we value having a variety of free
software, it makes sense to think about encouraging others to write free
software, instead of proprietary software.

   However, it is not enough just to talk about freedom; we must also
make sure people know the reasons it is worth listening to what we say.

   Long explanations such as our philosophical articles are one way of
informing the public, but you may not want to spend so much time on the
matter.  The most effective way you can help with a small amount of work
is simply by using the terms “Linux-based GNU system” or “GNU/Linux
system”, instead of “Linux system,” when you write about or mention such
a system.  Seeing these terms will show many people the reason to pay
attention to our philosophical articles.

   The system as a whole is more GNU than Linux; the name “GNU/Linux” is
fair.  When you are choosing the name of a distribution or a user group,
a name with “GNU/Linux” will reflect both roots of the combined system,
and will bring users into connection with both—including the spirit of
freedom and community that is the basis and purpose of GNU.

The first test release was made in 1996.  Now, in 2002, it is running
well, and Hurd-based GNU systems are starting to be used.

Digital information technology contributes to the world by making it
easier to copy and modify information.  Computers promise to make this
easier for all of us.

   Not everyone wants it to be easier.  The system of copyright gives
software programs “owners,” most of whom aim to withhold software’s
potential benefit from the rest of the public.  They would like to be
the only ones who can copy and modify the software that we use.

   The copyright system grew up with printing—a technology for
mass-production copying.  Copyright fit in well with this technology
because it restricted only the mass producers of copies.  It did not
take freedom away from readers of books.  An ordinary reader, who did
not own a printing press, could copy books only with pen and ink, and
few readers were sued for that.

   Digital technology is more flexible than the printing press: when
information has digital form, you can easily copy it to share it with
others.  This very flexibility makes a bad fit with a system like
copyright.  That’s the reason for the increasingly nasty and draconian
measures now used to enforce software copyright.  Consider these four
practices of the Software Publishers Association (SPA):

   • Massive propaganda saying it is wrong to disobey the owners to help
     your friend.

   • Solicitation for stool pigeons to inform on their coworkers and
     colleagues.

   • Raids (with police help) on offices and schools, in which people
     are told they must prove they are innocent of illegal copying.

   • Prosecution (by the US government, at the SPA’s request) of people
     such as MIT’s David LaMacchia, not for copying software (he is not
     accused of copying any), but merely for leaving copying facilities
     unguarded and failing to censor their use.(1)

   All four practices resemble those used in the former Soviet Union,
where every copying machine had a guard to prevent forbidden copying,
and where individuals had to copy information secretly and pass it from
hand to hand as samizdat.  There is of course a difference: the motive
for information control in the Soviet Union was political; in the US the
motive is profit.  But it is the actions that affect us, not the motive.
Any attempt to block the sharing of information, no matter why, leads to
the same methods and the same harshness.

   Owners make several kinds of arguments for giving them the power to
control how we use information:

Name Calling
------------

   Owners use smear words such as “piracy” and “theft,” as well as
expert terminology such as “intellectual property” and “damage,” to
suggest a certain line of thinking to the public—a simplistic analogy
between programs and physical objects.

   Our ideas and intuitions about property for material objects are
about whether it is right to _take an object away_ from someone else.
They don’t directly apply to _making a copy_ of something.  But the
owners ask us to apply them anyway.

Exaggeration
------------

   Owners say that they suffer “harm” or “economic loss” when users copy
programs themselves.  But the copying has no direct effect on the owner,
and it harms no one.  The owner can lose only if the person who made the
copy would otherwise have paid for one from the owner.

   A little thought shows that most such people would not have bought
copies.  Yet the owners compute their “losses” as if each and every one
would have bought a copy.  That is exaggeration—to put it kindly.

The Law
-------

   Owners often describe the current state of the law, and the harsh
penalties they can threaten us with.  Implicit in this approach is the
suggestion that today’s law reflects an unquestionable view of
morality—yet at the same time, we are urged to regard these penalties as
facts of nature that can’t be blamed on anyone.

   This line of persuasion isn’t designed to stand up to critical
thinking; it’s intended to reinforce a habitual mental pathway.

   It’s elementary that laws don’t decide right and wrong.  Every
American should know that, in the 1950s, it was against the law in many
states for a black person to sit in the front of a bus; but only racists
would say sitting there was wrong.

Natural Rights
--------------

   Authors often claim a special connection with programs they have
written, and go on to assert that, as a result, their desires and
interests concerning the program simply outweigh those of anyone else—or
even those of the whole rest of the world.  (Typically companies, not
authors, hold the copyrights on software, but we are expected to ignore
this discrepancy.)

   To those who propose this as an ethical axiom—the author is more
important than you—I can only say that I, a notable software author
myself, call it bunk.

   But people in general are only likely to feel any sympathy with the
natural rights claims for two reasons.

   One reason is an overstretched analogy with material objects.  When I
cook spaghetti, I do object if someone else eats it, because then I
cannot eat it.  His action hurts me exactly as much as it benefits him;
only one of us can eat the spaghetti, so the question is, which one?
The smallest distinction between us is enough to tip the ethical
balance.

   But whether you run or change a program I wrote affects you directly
and me only indirectly.  Whether you give a copy to your friend affects
you and your friend much more than it affects me.  I shouldn’t have the
power to tell you not to do these things.  No one should.

   The second reason is that people have been told that natural rights
for authors is the accepted and unquestioned tradition of our society.

   As a matter of history, the opposite is true.  The idea of natural
rights of authors was proposed and decisively rejected when the US
Constitution was drawn up.  That’s why the Constitution only _permits_ a
system of copyright and does not _require_ one; that’s why it says that
copyright must be temporary.  It also states that the purpose of
copyright is to promote progress—not to reward authors.  Copyright does
reward authors somewhat, and publishers more, but that is intended as a
means of modifying their behavior.

   The real established tradition of our society is that copyright cuts
into the natural rights of the public—and that this can only be
justified for the public’s sake.

Economics
---------

   The final argument made for having owners of software is that this
leads to production of more software.

   Unlike the others, this argument at least takes a legitimate approach
to the subject.  It is based on a valid goal—satisfying the users of
software.  And it is empirically clear that people will produce more of
something if they are well paid for doing so.

   But the economic argument has a flaw: it is based on the assumption
that the difference is only a matter of how much money we have to pay.
It assumes that _production of software_ is what we want, whether the
software has owners or not.

   People readily accept this assumption because it accords with our
experiences with material objects.  Consider a sandwich, for instance.
You might well be able to get an equivalent sandwich either gratis or
for a price.  If so, the amount you pay is the only difference.  Whether
or not you have to buy it, the sandwich has the same taste, the same
nutritional value, and in either case you can only eat it once.  Whether
you get the sandwich from an owner or not cannot directly affect
anything but the amount of money you have afterwards.

   This is true for any kind of material object—whether or not it has an
owner does not directly affect what it _is,_ or what you can do with it
if you acquire it.

   But if a program has an owner, this very much affects what it is, and
what you can do with a copy if you buy one.  The difference is not just
a matter of money.  The system of owners of software encourages software
owners to produce something—but not what society really needs.  And it
causes intangible ethical pollution that affects us all.


   What does society need?  It needs information that is truly available
to its citizens—for example, programs that people can read, fix, adapt,
and improve, not just operate.  But what software owners typically
deliver is a black box that we can’t study or change.

   Society also needs freedom.  When a program has an owner, the users
lose freedom to control part of their own lives.

   And, above all, society needs to encourage the spirit of voluntary
cooperation in its citizens.  When software owners tell us that helping
our neighbors in a natural way is “piracy,” they pollute our society’s
civic spirit.

   This is why we say that free software is a matter of freedom, not
price.

   The economic argument for owners is erroneous, but the economic issue
is real.  Some people write useful software for the pleasure of writing
it or for admiration and love; but if we want more software than those
people write, we need to raise funds.

   Since the 1980s, free software developers have tried various methods
of finding funds, with some success.  There’s no need to make anyone
rich; a typical income is plenty of incentive to do many jobs that are
less satisfying than programming.

   For years, until a fellowship made it unnecessary, I made a living
from custom enhancements of the free software I had written.  Each
enhancement was added to the standard released version and thus
eventually became available to the general public.  Clients paid me so
that I would work on the enhancements they wanted, rather than on the
features I would otherwise have considered highest priority.

   Some free software developers make money by selling support services.
In 1994, Cygnus Support, with around 50 employees, estimated that about
15 percent of its staff activity was free software development—a
respectable percentage for a software company.

   In the early 1990s, companies including Intel, Motorola, Analog
Devices Texas Instruments and Analog Devices combined to fund the
continued development of the GNU C compiler.  Most GCC development is
still done by paid developers.  The GNU compiler for the Ada language
was funded in the 90s by the US Air Force, and continued since then by a
company formed specifically for the purpose.

   The free software movement is still small, but the example of
listener-supported radio in the US shows it’s possible to support a
large activity without forcing each user to pay.

   As a computer user today, you may find yourself using a proprietary
program.  If your friend asks to make a copy, it would be wrong to
refuse.  Cooperation is more important than copyright.  But underground,
closet cooperation does not make for a good society.  A person should
aspire to live an upright life openly with pride, and this means saying
no to proprietary software.

   You deserve to be able to cooperate openly and freely with other
people who use software.  You deserve to be able to learn how the
software works, and to teach your students with it.  You deserve to be
able to hire your favorite programmer to fix it when it breaks.

   *You deserve free software.*

Appendix I Why Free Software Needs Free Documentation

The biggest deficiency in free operating systems is not in the
software—it is the lack of good free manuals that we can include in
these systems.  Many of our most important programs do not come with
full manuals.  Documentation is an essential part of any software
package; when an important free software package does not come with a
free manual, that is a major gap.  We have many such gaps today.

   Once upon a time, many years ago, I thought I would learn Perl.  I
got a copy of a free manual, but I found it hard to read.  When I asked
Perl users about alternatives, they told me that there were better
introductory manuals—but those were not free.

   Why was this?  The authors of the good manuals had written them for
O’Reilly Associates, which published them with restrictive terms—no
copying, no modification, source files not available—which exclude them
from the free software community.

   That wasn’t the first time this sort of thing has happened, and (to
our community’s great loss) it was far from the last.  Proprietary
manual publishers have enticed a great many authors to restrict their
manuals since then.  Many times I have heard a GNU user eagerly tell me
about a manual that he is writing, with which he expects to help the GNU
Project—and then had my hopes dashed, as he proceeded to explain that he
had signed a contract with a publisher that would restrict it so that we
cannot use it.

   Given that writing good English is a rare skill among programmers, we
can ill afford to lose manuals this way.

   Free documentation, like free software, is a matter of freedom, not
price.  The problem with these manuals was not that O’Reilly Associates
charged a price for printed copies—that in itself is fine.  (The Free
Software Foundation sells printed copies of free GNU manuals, too.)  But
GNU manuals are available in source code form, while these manuals are
available only on paper.  GNU manuals come with permission to copy and
modify; the Perl manuals do not.  These restrictions are the problems.

   The criterion for a free manual is pretty much the same as for free
software: it is a matter of giving all users certain freedoms.
Redistribution (including commercial redistribution) must be permitted,
so that the manual can accompany every copy of the program, on line or
on paper.  Permission for modification is crucial too.

   As a general rule, I don’t believe that it is essential for people to
have permission to modify all sorts of articles and books.  The issues
for writings are not necessarily the same as those for software.  For
example, I don’t think you or I are obliged to give permission to modify
articles like this one, which describe our actions and our views.

   But there is a particular reason why the freedom to modify is crucial
for documentation for free software.  When people exercise their right
to modify the software, and add or change its features, if they are
conscientious they will change the manual too—so they can provide
accurate and usable documentation with the modified program.  A manual
which forbids programmers from being conscientious and finishing the
job, or more precisely requires them to write a new manual from scratch
if they change the program, does not fill our community’s needs.

   While a blanket prohibition on modification is unacceptable, some
kinds of limits on the method of modification pose no problem.  For
example, requirements to preserve the original author’s copyright
notice, the distribution terms, or the list of authors, are OK.  It is
also no problem to require modified versions to include notice that they
were modified, even to have entire sections that may not be deleted or
changed, as long as these sections deal with nontechnical topics.  (Some
GNU manuals have them.)

   These kinds of restrictions are not a problem because, as a practical
matter, they don’t stop the conscientious programmer from adapting the
manual to fit the modified program.  In other words, they don’t block
the free software community from making full use of the manual.

   However, it must be possible to modify all the _technical_ content of
the manual, and then distribute the result through all the usual media,
through all the usual channels; otherwise, the restrictions do block the
community, the manual is not free, and so we need another manual.

   Unfortunately, it is often hard to find someone to write another
manual when a proprietary manual exists.  The obstacle is that many
users think that a proprietary manual is good enough—so they don’t see
the need to write a free manual.  They do not see that the free
operating system has a gap that needs filling.

   Why do users think that proprietary manuals are good enough?  Some
have not considered the issue.  I hope this article will do something to
change that.

   Other users consider proprietary manuals acceptable for the same
reason so many people consider proprietary software acceptable: they
judge in purely practical terms, not using freedom as a criterion.
These people are entitled to their opinions, but since those opinions
spring from values which do not include freedom, they are no guide for
those of us who do value freedom.

   Please spread the word about this issue.  We continue to lose manuals
to proprietary publishing.  If we spread the word that proprietary
manuals are not sufficient, perhaps the next person who wants to help
GNU by writing documentation will realize, before it is too late, that
he must above all make it free.

   We can also encourage commercial publishers to sell free, copylefted
manuals instead of proprietary ones.  One way you can help this is to
check the distribution terms of a manual before you buy it, and prefer
copylefted manuals to noncopylefted ones.

Note: We maintain a page that lists free books available from other
publishers.
