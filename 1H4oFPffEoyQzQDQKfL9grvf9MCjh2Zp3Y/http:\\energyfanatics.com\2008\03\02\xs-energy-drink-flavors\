Available Size:</strong> 8.4 fl. oz.</p>
<p>XS energy drink is manufactured by Logic Nutrition, a company based in California, but is distributed and sold by Quixtar/Amway. According to Quixtar/Amway IBOs (independent business owners), XS energy drink is the number 1 produced energy drink in the United States and number 2 in sales volume worldwide, just behind Red Bull. These are impressive numbers but I think they are misleading.</p>
<p>Most XS energy drinks are sold to and consumed by Quixtar/Amway IBOs, which are the sellers of XS. According to my research and from talking with IBOs, I could tell that only a small percentage of XS products are sold to customers. Therefore, their claims above are misleading.</p>
<p>XS currently has 11 different flavors plus 3 caffeine-free versions, which adds up to 14 different types. All its energy drinks are low in carbs and sugar, and loaded with B-vitamins. Too bad its B-vitamins are synthetic, making them less effective. Some of its energy drinks have no carbs, no sugar, and no caffeine. One thing that concerned me about XS energy drinks is their high levels of synthetic vitamin B12. Most of them have 4,900 percent of the percent daily value. XS Gold has 8,000 percent.</p>
<p>All of the XS energy drink flavors contain sucralose, an artificial sweetener known by independent researchers as a neurotoxin. Sucralose was accidentally discovered by a scientist who was trying to create a new insecticide, which is why sucralose has similar insecticide properties.</p>
<p>As described at <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/artificial_sweeteners/page9.htm" target="_blank">MedicineNet.com</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The most misunderstood fact about sucralose is that it is nothing like sugar even though the marketing implies that it is. Sucralose was actually discovered while trying to create a new insecticide. It may have started out as sugar, but the final product is anything but sugar. According to the book Sweet Deception, sucralose is made when sugar is treated with trityl chloride, acetic anhydride, hydrogen chlorine, thionyl chloride, and methanol in the presence of dimethylformamide, 4-methylmorpholine, toluene, methyl isobutyl ketone, acetic acid, benzyltriethlyammonium chloride, and sodium methoxide, making it unlike anything found in nature. If you read the fine print on the Splenda web site, it states that &#8220;although sucralose has a structure like sugar and a sugar-like taste, it is not natural.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Sucralose is used to replace sugar because it is many times sweeter than sugar and has very little calories. To be on the safe side, you should limit one XS per day or less. If you are health conscious stay away from XS, drink <a href="http://energyfanatics.com/2008/05/31/guru-energy-drink-review/" target="_blank">GURU</a> energy drink instead.</p>
<p>Reflecting back to my reviews, most of XS energy drinks had good energy boost. Their energy was not as strong as Bawls, Rockstar, and Snake Eyes, but had no major bad side effects. Some of the minor side effects I experienced were light headaches and stomachaches.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you everyone for all your comments</strong></p>
<p>This article has generated a good amount of comments relating to the health benefits of XS energy drinks; therefore, I decided to add more information on this topic. If you do not care about your health and are drinking XS because you like it, this information is probably not for you. If you are drinking XS because you think it is healthy or someone told you it was healthy, you may want to pay really close attention to the following information.</p>
<p>XS energy drink, like most energy drinks on the market, contains artificial sweetener (sugar-free versions) and synthetic vitamins. Some of these ingredients are created through the use of genetically modified organisms, such as genetically modified bacteria. If you are interested in how genetically modified food affects your health, please read <a href="http://www.actionbioscience.org/biotech/pusztai.html" target="_blank">this article</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the people who commented below believe that synthetic vitamins and natural vitamins are the same, and there is no health hazard of consuming synthetic vitamins. This type of belief is based on misguided information and a lack of knowledge, because there is an abundance of information showing that synthetic vitamins are not the same as natural vitamins. Below is an excellent quote from <a href="http://www.drheise.com/bvitamin.htm" target="_blank">Robert J Thiel</a>, Ph.D., N.D. about the differences between natural and synthetic vitamins.</p>
<blockquote><p>United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) synthetic vitamin B isolates are not food, even though they are often called &#8220;natural&#8221; and are sometimes added to foods—they are synthesized, standardized chemical isolates. In nature, vitamins are never isolated: they are always present in the form of food vitamin-complexes.</p>
<p>Vitamin B1, Thiamin The free vitamin B1 (called thiamin) is a base. When it is synthesized it becomes a solid salt such as thiamin hydrochloride or thiamin mononitrate. Synthetically thiamin is usually marketed as thiamin hydrochloride or thiamin mononitrate and is a made from Grewe diamine (a coal tar derivative) processed with ammonia and other chemicals. No thiamin hydrochloride (often listed as thiamin HCL) or thiamin mononitrate is naturally found in food or the body (thiamin pyrophosphate is the predominant form in the body. Yeast and legumes are excellent food sources of natural thiamin.</p></blockquote>
<p>People who believe natural and synthetic vitamins are the same and that they have the same health benefits, lack the knowledge of how vitamins and nature work. Vitamins found in nature are always accompanied by other vitamins, minerals, co-vitamin helpers, and other synergistic components. These extra components are needed to assist the body in utilizing the vitamins and prevent them from breaking down into toxic chemicals. This is why refined sugar is not good for you and natural sugar found in fruits is good for you.</p>
<p>Most energy drink causes your blood to become acidic. <a href="http://energyfanatics.com/2011/12/14/acidic-blood-five-ways-to-prevent-it/" target="_blank">Acidic blood</a> reduces the functions of your cells and creates an environment for harmful microorganisms and cancer to thrive in. It also drains your body of energy and nutrients and weakens your bones.</p>
<p>The people who work in the top levels of energy drink companies know about the hidden dangers in energy drinks, but they decided not tell their consumers because of greed and ignorance. In other words, they care more about money than your life and think you are too dumb to know. How sad is that? When you see an energy drink or any drink with the advertisements zero carbs, zero sugar, sugar-free, low calories, do not fall for their marketing tricks.</p>

		<p>yea, but studies have shown too much of a good thing can also be toxic. </p>
<p>Toxicity of Vitamin B12</p>
<p>A heavy dosage of vitamin B12 is mostly considered harmless because it is soluble in water . Therefore, the part of unabsorbed vitamin B12 can be thrown out of the body through the colon. However, if there is substantial increase in the amount of vitamin B12 present in the body, it could increase the possibility of different types of cancers and other ailments.</p>
<p>There is a link between cancer and vitamin B12. This is because, intake of Vitamin B12 as a supplement activates cell division. However, it fails to identify healthy and unhealthy cells. Thus, it adversely facilitates the growth of cancerous cells. Patients using vitamin B12 to treat pernicious anemia may develop leukemia. Rise in level of vitamin B12 in our body can increase the risk of developing prostrate cancer. If intake of vitamin B12 is accompanied by high cholesterol diet and animal protein, then stomach and esophagus cancer may occur.</p>
<p>It can also lead to excessive growth red blood cells as well as overall volume of blood, which is known as polycythemia vera. Vitamin B12 can lead to some diseases related to blood and blood vessels. Vitamin B12 can cause clotting of blood inside the blood vessels. When vitamin B12 is administered for the treatment of megaloblastic anemia, it has led to fatal conditions like hypokalemia and gout in some patients. </p>
<p>The chances of intake of vitamin B12 in excess quantity often occur due to the fact that there is no definite upper limit of vitamin B12 consumption. Therefore, it is advisable to take this vitamin in moderate amounts only, and importantly in consultation with your doctor.</p>

		<p>Megan,  it is prostate cancer, not prostrate.  I am always skeptical when people refer to &#8220;studies shown&#8221;.  No one ever seems to take the time or space to cite these studies, which many state &#8211; may, could, it is possible, etc.  I am a 58 yr old male and have been using these XS drinks in consultation with an homeopathic physician.  It has improved my health and gives me the energy boost I need in a grueling schedule.  I guard my health because I refuse to accept the fact I&#8217;m  &#8220;old&#8221; .  We need to be sensible though;  one 8.5 oz can is enough per day.  It is never a good idea to have too much of a good thing.</p>

		<p>my brother is an amway IBO.  he had been treating my father&#8217;s alzheimers disease with the x-s energy drink plus a few other supplements like ginko,omega  and others,  he said the B vitamins in the drink would help my dad.  he would take the drink along to doctor appointments and show it.  neither of the 2 alzheimers doctors said my father should not have it.  it was not until my father went into assisted living that the director there contacted my fathers doctor and from then on he was not taking the x-s anymore.  I had always felt that my brother was trying to profit from selling the drink and supplements to my parents.</p>

		<p>This energy drink is by far the best and healthiest on the market. i would be interested to know where he got the information on synthetic b vitamins. as far as i know they use all natural vitamins. As far as the high b12 content. He needs to do his research before he says things he knows nothing about. Heres a link to a health website that states there are no adverse affects of too much b12. <a href="http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12.asp" rel="nofollow">http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12.asp</a></p>

		<p>The vitamins come from ginseng, a natural herb. I have no idea where he got this from. I would rather drink XS than any other energy drink. It is also the healthiest. If I drink any other energy drink, I feel sick from the sugar and caffeine. XS is great, don&#8217;t diss it because you don&#8217;t understand amway. Oh, and by the way, I&#8217;m not an IBO. I just love the drinks.</p>

		<p>Hello Trae, the B-vitamins in XS energy drinks are synthetic because they contained only a section of the many synergistic components that make B-vitamins natural. In other words, they have been isolated from their natural state or are created in labs.</p>
<p>All you have to do is look at the ingredients section of XS and you will see the synthetic vitamins. For example, ascorbic acid is considered synthetic vitamin C because it only contain a small part of the many chemical components that makes up vitamin C. Another example is cyanocobalamin, this is the synthetic version of vitamin B12. Natural vitamin B12 is easily secreted by the body because it is water-soluble. Consuming a lot of it is probably not harmful but synthetic vitamin B12 is another story. </p>
<p>Natural vitamin are very complex in nature, they contained many components, such as rutin, bioflavonoids, factor k, j, p, tyrosinase, etc. Extracting all these components are very expensive. This is why vitamin manufacturers don&#8217;t take this route. In order for the body to use vitamins effectively, they need to have all these components.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t believe me, then do your own research and come up with your conclusion. Even if the B-vitamins in XS are natural, they are useless because natural B-vitamins are water-soluble and will dissolve quickly in liquid. </p>
<p>Most energy drinks have synthetic vitamins in them to save money. XS is one of the worst because it contains a lot of synthetic vitamins. <strong>It is not healthy for you</strong>. If you are worried about your health, stay away from XS energy drinks. </p>
<p>For more information about vitamins visit the link below. This article explains in details on how to tell the difference between synthetic and natural vitamins.</p>

		<p>Thank you for your response but i feel that you have not even done the least bit of research on this drink. I have actually gone through the ingredients list of XS Cranberry grape blast and researched them. All of the b vitamins are natural except for cyanocobalamin, which is also known as B12, and it is not natural at all, period. There is no natural b12 at all. But even with that, the FDA website still concludes that cyanocobalamin is water-soluble and excess will just get excreted AND that it is possible to crystalize for use in liquids that doctors give for vitamin deficiency and that it is not harmful. I would challenge you to actually look at an XS and possibly try it and then research it to tell me something specific about it that makes it worse than any energy drink out there.</p>

		<p>There are many controversy about natural vitamins and synthetic vitamins. Scientists have argued about this for decades and they haven&#8217;t come to an agreement. To explain which one is better can take a whole book so I&#8217;ll keep it short. If you want to know more about natural and synthetic vitamins visit the two links at the middle of this comment. I don&#8217;t recommend relying on the FDA for information because like many government agencies, it is highly influenced by lobbyists (people who influence legislators or public officials to benefit their lobby, usually with money). The FDA is not the same as it used to be.</p>
<p><strong>Natural and synthetic vitamins as described by Elson M. Haas, M.D.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Natural. Vitamins are considered natural when they are extracted exclusively from food sources and contain the specific mix of nutrients found in nature. Often this mix includes other enzymes, catalysts, or minerals to aid the body&#8217;s use of the vitamins.</p>
<p>Synthetic. When vitamins are made chemically in the laboratory, rather than extracted from foods, they are termed synthetic (Elson M. Haas, M.D. <em>Staying Healthy With Nutrition</em>. Celestial Arts. pg. 87).</p></blockquote>
<p>The B-vitamins in XS (maybe not all of them) are synthetic because they only contain a small portion of the whole chemical structure that make up each B-vitamin. Some synthetic B-vitamins are water-soluble so they can be excreted by the body easier. Examples of B-vitamins found in XS: <strong>niacin</strong> (B3), <strong>pyrodoxine HCL</strong> (B6), <strong>cyanocobalamin</strong> (B12). To find the synthetic names, you have to dig a little deeper. Some of them are located in the ingredients section on the back of each XS. There are some synthetic vitamins that are very similar, maybe even chemically identical with their natural version. An example of this is vitamin C. The synthetic version of vitamin C is ascorbic acid (found in XS). Certain scientists claimed that it is identical. It may be identical to a certain point but it is still missing many of the synergistic components that make vitamin C effective. </p>
<p>The way your body utilize vitamins is very complex. To explain it will take a few pages. If you want to know more about it, I recommend reading the two articles that I linked to below. They are written by vitamin experts who have studied vitamins for decades.</p>
<p><a href="http://content.bandzoogle.com/users/cippianhotmail/files/Dangers_of_Synthetic_Unnatural_Vitamins.pdf" rel="nofollow">Serious Dangers of Synthetic &#038; Unnatural Vitamins<a></a><br />
</a><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=yuaSJvZr3ikC&#038;pg=PA87&#038;lpg=PA87&#038;dq=definition+of+natural+vitamins&#038;source=bl&#038;ots=qf_n_FB0nT&#038;sig=DZkLyIlF88fcIrtAsH6hcjUqyng&#038;hl=en&#038;ei=JEr-Sen_E5jGM_DE2a0E&#038;sa=X&#038;oi=book_result&#038;ct=result&#038;resnum=7#PPA88,M1" rel="nofollow">Staying Healthy With Nutrition</a></p>
<p>All water-soluble vitamins (B-vitamins and vitamin C), when extracted from their natural source, are unstable and will dissolve quickly, especially in liquid. This is one of the reasons why energy drink manufacturers used synthetic vitamins because they are usually more stable. </p>
<p>Like synthetic vitamins, natural vitamins can be misleading too. Many of them are extracted from inorganic sources instead of organic sources. Many of them are also dried with high heat which destroyed the vitamins. If you are concerned about your health, stick with organic foods and health drinks, such as tea and organic juice. If you are not concerned about your health, then keep on drinking XS or any other energy drink. It&#8217;s your decision, I have no control over that. My only interest is to educate my readers with as much honesty as possible without the influence of money. This is why I don&#8217;t take compensations for my reviews. </p>
<p>You don&#8217;t really need to rely on experts to know that most energy drinks are not healthy, just listen to your body. If you end up getting side effects after drinking XS or any other energy drink, be cautious. These are signs from your body telling you that the energy drink you are drinking is not good for you. You can also do a simple experiment. Go on an energy drink diet for a few days, <strong>all your calories should only be from energy drink</strong>. After a few days, you will feel its negative effects and will probably end up being very sick. <strong>I don&#8217;t recommend doing this experiment</strong>. </p>
<p>Most energy drinks are high in sugar and contained little nutrients. The sugar-free energy drinks are the worst because they contained artificial sweetener. I believed all XS energy drinks contained artificial sweetener. If you want to know more about the danger of artificial sweetener read <a href="http://energyfanatics.com/2009/01/24/the-danger-of-equal/" rel="nofollow">The Danger of Equal Sweetener</a>.</p>
<p>I have tried all of the 11 different flavors of XS, most of them do taste good, my favorite is the cranberry grape blast. I&#8217;m not trying to attack XS, its energy drink taste just as good as its competitors but to say they are healthy is very misleading. After I learned about synthetic vitamins, I realized that most energy drinks are loaded with them. Because of this, I stopped drinking them and barely review them anymore. </p>
<p>Thanks for the comment Trae, I do appreciate your opinion!</p>

		<p>There is no difference in a synthetic vitamin and a so called natural vitamin other than one comes from the body and the other is slightly structured differently. Buy vitamins at the pharmacy and it is the same thing. They are both healthy for you and there are no health concerns or risks on taking too much vitamins whatever which one it may be. Although I have never tried this drink it is overall the healthiest energy drink I have seen.</p>

		<p>I had reviewed over 100 plus energy drinks and GURU is the healthiest. When it comes to health, XS is one of the worsts because it contains artificial sweetener, a neurotoxin. XS does contain a lot of vitamins but most of its vitamins are water-soluble. In other words, its vitamins dissolve quickly in liquid. You are basically drinking an energy drink with empty calories. Most energy drinks are full of empty calories.</p>
<p>If this is hard for you to believe, go on an energy drink diet for a day. Your calories should come from only energy drink. By the end of the day you may never look at energy drink the same again. I don&#8217;t recommend going on this diet.</p>
<p>If you want an energy drink that taste good with many different flavors, XS may be a good choice. If you are looking for a healthy energy drink, XS is not for you.</p>

		<p>Do you all realize that XS is from the Quixtar/ Amway family which is just a marketing company making generic products from expired patents. That said, they are a triangle marketing company and will say anything in the world to sell their products. The point here is that half the people commenting on the good side of the drink are involved in this scheme as re-sellers of the product itself. The more they sell the more they make!! The truth is what PL Chang mentioned above, XS is nothing but chemical water that does not do your system any good. There are a bunch of these re-sellers who hire within friends to sell by world of mouth and they have access to the net and use it as is clearly visible here. A general search in Google reveals a bunch of websites and reviews &#8211; all by XS people themselves! Stay wary my friends.</p>

		<p>Dude seriously everything you just said makes no sence and has no point to it. lol yeah quixtar/amway is a marketing company but so are any store you go to to buy anything. congrats on knowing your shapes it thows you graduated preschool. Yes they are a triangle but so is our government, schools, church, walmart, mcdonalds, burgerking, along with the place that you work. Congrats again you figured out that if you sell more product then you will make more money. You should go to walmart and tell them that im sure they dont know of that idea. I do agree that its not good to drink a ton of xs but neither is takin too much protein or spending too much money or eating too much candy but that goes for everything. You have to balance your daily eating habits along with everything else. So what if its synthetic a lot of things people consume are or have some trace of a synthetic in it. Congrats again amway does rely mostly on word of mouth cause this is making people money. And with the whole google research thing is that it will bring up a lot of stuff that isnt credible. I mean if you searched your name and it said that you were gay or of a different race or nationality does that mean that it is true. I think you for posting your opinion with a few facts  <img src="http://energyfanatics.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

		<p>Chang, who cares. You people eat dogs and monkey brains for vitamins. Divy, you have nothing constructive to say other than slamming Amway. I would be real careful about slandering a billion dollar company. They have teams and teams of lawyers, and people on the net have been sued for saying much less.</p>
<p>I am not a fan of Amway as a business, but these drinks are a viable product and people like them and compared to major energy drinks that dominate the market like Red Bull, they are a much healthier alternative. If you want the healthiest drink in the world, stick to distilled water. If you like energy drinks, then these sound worth trying.</p>

		<p>Because I&#8217;m a understanding person, I will take your comment as a compliment. I usually don&#8217;t approve these types of comment, but your comment is just so strange that it may help people decide if they want to try XS or not.</p>

		<p>Neither am I. Not a fan of Amway at all, respect the business model though and the people who do it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to see one article on a product like XS that DOESN&#8217;T reference the word &#8216;Amway&#8217;in it. On the other foot I&#8217;m sick of seeing idiot IBO&#8217;s jumping on here when someone like PJ Chang puts forward a viable argument with some decent facts and getting all defensive and hurt, which is where divy has a little bit of a point.</p>
<p>Some people like me just want to look at all these energy drinks and compare and forget all about whether it came from 7-11 or word of mouth ITS NOT RELEVANT! But that&#8217;s just going to be impossible isn&#8217;t it you pillocks!</p>

		<p>To Mr. P.L. Chang,</p>
<p>I have been trying to find a legitimate site that states how much XS does in sales.  You state &#8220;XS energy drink is the number 1 produced energy drink in the United States and number 2 in sales volume worldwide.&#8221;  Where did you get this information?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

		<p>I got the information from a few Quixtar independent business owners (IBOs). According to David Vanderveen, co-founder of the XS, in 2003 XS energy drink ranked number 2 in sales in North America. You can read more about it by visiting the link below. </p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XS_Energy_Drink" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XS_Energy_Drink</a></p>
<p>Looking back at this review and the claims made by Quixtar IBOs, the sales number looked misleading. Most XS energy drinks are sold to and consumed by Quixtar IBOs which are the sellers of XS. According my research and from talking with IBOs, only a small percentage of Quixtar products are sold to customers. I will have to update this page to reflect this.</p>

		<p>Amway Global and XS have numerous scientists review each product for safety and top quality. I must have missed it somewhere, where exactly did you state you got your degree to give you any credibility to dis-credit the makers of the amazing Energy Drink ?</p>

		<p>Why would you need a degree to tell if energy drinks are good or bad for you? All you need to do is read the nutrition facts and ingredients list and do some research. Even a middle school drop out can tell you that energy drinks are bad for you. </p>
<p>I have studied Eastern and Western medicine long enough to know that energy drinks are not good for you. Also, from hanging around and talking with health experts, I&#8217;m have more knowledge about health than the average people. Does this make me better than anyone else? No!</p>
<p>Quixtar/Amway have numerous scientists testing their XS energy drinks but that doesn&#8217;t mean that the scientists are free to give out all the facts.<br />
Most people don’t realized that the scientists doing these tests on XS energy drink are sponsored by the manufacturer of XS. Therefore, these scientists can’t say any or too many negative things about XS. If they do, they are risking their job or sponsorship. Give XS to independent researchers to do the tests and the result will be different. Why? Because they are not influenced by money. I’m very aware of this which is why I don’t take compensation for my reviews.</p>
<p>You don’t need to rely on experts to know that most energy drinks are not healthy, just listen to your body. Your body will give you signs, such as stomachaches, headaches, etc. </p>
<p>You can also do a simple experiment. Go on an energy drink diet for a day or two, all your calories should only be from energy drink. After a day or two, you will feel its negative effects and will be begging for food. I don’t recommend doing this experiment.</p>

		<p> <img src="http://energyfanatics.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" class="wp-smiley" />  &#8230;. YOU WIN Mr PL Chang. After all, you &#8220;read cans&#8221;&#8230; Of course&#8230;.How come I did&#8217;nt think of that. That is by far where the education should come from. So now why stop here on this rediculous website where the lies are now piling through the roof and has no credibility whatsoever. You should call the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Being that they played a major role in the development of this Amazing product.<br />
(by Doctors and scientists not IBO&#8217;s. just so you know). Here is their number: 212-639-2000.<br />
You can even write them at 1275 York Avenue New York, NY 10065. I would even give you the name of a Dr but of course you will find some lie to say trying to discredit him so that ain&#8217;t happening. Please let them know that you have &#8220;read the cans&#8221; and that you don&#8217;t believe that the 500mg of Glutamine in XS does what it says. They claim it helps to regulate the heart beat, helps in muscle development, helps cell membrane stability, helps brain function (you need this) They claim that the B12 in XS promotes cell growth and development, helps maintain normal nerve activity, aids folic acid in the regulation of red blood cell formation,<br />
is needed for the synthesis of protein&#8230;<br />
They also claim that the B3 in XS plays a critical role in the energy production pathways within our cells. They claim the B5 in XS helps in supporting the activity of the adrenal glands. They claim the B9 in XS helps in the production and maintenance of new cells and promotes hearth health. I could go on and on and on&#8230;. But what&#8217;s the point, of course you already know all of this because you &#8220;read the cans&#8221; I don&#8217;t really know why you would clearly lie about and bash a drink that even a &#8220;middle school drop out&#8221; can see is the healthiest energy drink out there (of course only for those who actually do propper research and not only read cans) So go ahead and try to persuade the un-educated&#8230;&#8230; I for one do real reasearch before making any claims. So to all the ladies and gentlemen who reads this, you now have a choice, do the propper reasearch from credible sources like Experts in this field (not only can readers) or listen to this dude who has clearly stated he is not.</p>

		<p>You must be a Quixtar/Amway IBO right? That doesn&#8217;t surprise me. Every time I write a review on XS energy drinks I always get IBOs spamming my comment section with links or attacking me about my reviews. I thought IBOs were supposed to be professional. I guess I was wrong.</p>
<p>You said that you do real research right? Then why do you concentrate only on the positives. To understand something in its totality you need to look at different angles. You only look at XS from one view point which is preventing you from seeing the big picture. </p>
<p>I know why you only concentrate on the positives. You true intention is to sell XS, not to educate people about it.  </p>
<p>The information about B-vitamins you mentioned above is pretty good. I do agree with most of it. Unfortunately, B-vitamins are water-soluble so they will dissolve in liquid and become useless (synthetic B-vitamins may last longer). Therefore, when you drink energy drink, you are drinking mostly empty calories.</p>
<p>You mentioned that I have no credibility because I read the nutrition facts of XS. This is very childish. Any person who studied food nutrition long enough will know that food labels are very important because they show the type of ingredients that is in the food. By just reading the nutrition facts of XS, I can tell that XS is full of synthetic vitamins and other synthetic chemicals. To discredit me because I read can label is ignorance. Any person who is an expert in nutrition will look at your comment and discredit you.</p>
<p>You seem like a smart person but you are easy to manipulate. Because of this, you have been brainwashed by your uplines and Quixtar/Amway&#8217;s executives to believe that XS energy drink is healthy. XS energy drink does taste good, don&#8217;t give me wrong, but to say it is healthy is where you are out of line. This is where I have to step in to protect my readers which is why I&#8217;m being a little harsh. </p>
<p>Because you went through the trouble of finding my blog and taking the time to comment, I want to tell you a secret that even your diamonds are not aware of. The Quixtar/Amway MLM business is going to dramatically deteriorate, either by the end of the year, or in the next few years. When this happens, Quixtar&#8217;s executives and diamonds will run off leaving their IBOs lost and confused. It would be wise for you to get out as soon as possible. Invest your money into something else that is going to help you in the future, like commodities that are essential for survival. Good luck!</p>

		<p>PL Chang,</p>
<p>Love your other articles, very informative.</p>
<p>It took Amway 50 years to generate more than 11 billion dollars worth of sales globally. As of recent, it took Amway a year to generate more than 11 billion dollars globally.</p>
<p>Where is this assumption you made in 2009 that Amway is going to deteriorate rapidly in the next few years?</p>
<p>You shot yourself in the foot by being overly emotional and irrational arguing with Raja.</p>
<p>I am an IBO and I agree that sucralose may not be safe; complicity of lobbyist with the FDA. I switched to drinking XS everyday from coffee. Your blog is very informative I think I&#8217;ll start cutting down on drinknig XS everyday. However, to suggest that Amway will go bankrupt, lolol you&#8217;re hilarious wo de peng you.</p>

		<p>PL Chang, i will say this right of the bat. I am an Amway distributor. And i have to say that you are right in the fact Amway scientist are sponsored and therefore may omit or twist the truth about XS in order to keep their jobs.  However, As an Amway IBO, i do know that Amway has allowed both its XS Line and its Nutrilife line to be examined and tested by third parties upon request, both in the past and today.  So i would ask that you search for any independent studies done on the products, XS or Nutrilife, to see whether they are any good or not.</p>
<p>And of course anything taking excessively, will harm your health, but i doubt that 1 can every few days will harm you.  At least thats how I take XS.</p>

		<p>Thank you for sharing your thoughts. </p>
<p>I have done enough research to know that most energy drinks are not good for you. The fact that XS contains sucralose, an artificial sweetener, and synthetic vitamins already tells me that it is not good for you.</p>
<p>Below is a short excerpt from <a href="http://www.drheise.com/ascorbicacid.htm" rel="nofollow">drheise.com</a> about the differences between natural and synthetic vitamins.</p>
<blockquote><p>Vitamins are not individual molecular compounds. Vitamins are biological complexes. They are multi-step biochemical interactions whose action is dependent upon a number of variables within the biological terrain.</p>
<p>Vitamins cannot be isolated from their complexes and still perform their specific life functions within the cells. When isolated into artificial commercial forms, like ascorbic acid, these purified synthetics act as drugs in the body. They are no longer vitamins, and to call them such is inaccurate.</p>
<p>OK, natural vs. synthetic. Let’s start with vitamin C. Most sources equate vitamin C with ascorbic acid, as though they were the same thing. They’re not. Ascorbic acid is an isolate, a fraction, a distillate of naturally occurring vitamin C. In addition to ascorbic acid, vitamin C must include rutin, bioflavonoids, Factor K, Factor J, Factor P, tyrosinase, ascorbinogen, and other components.</p>
<p>In addition, mineral co-factors must be available in proper amounts.</p>
<p>If any of these parts are missing, there is no vitamin C, no vitamin activity. When some of them are present, the body will draw on its own stores to make up the differences, so that the whole vitamin may be present. Only then will vitamin activity take place, provided that all other conditions and co-factors are present.</p></blockquote>
<p>The vitamins found in energy drinks are isolated; therefore, they are not good for you. Drinking a few energy drinks per weeks is not going to harm your health that much. It is when you drink it on a regular basis is when it will harm your health.</p>
<p>Some of the XS energy drinks do taste good but they are not healthy.</p>

		<p>And by the way, to even recommend that someone should go on an energy drink diet for a day or two means to me that you have more problems than just the obvious. But I assure you that if I ever have a reason to, I am glad to have access to the healthiest energy drink on the market and not that crap you&#8217;re selling. XS energy drink is still the best, it does not matter how much you argue and rant rave and lie&#8230;&#8230; at the end of it all&#8230;.. IT WILL STILL BE THE BEST</p>

		<p>If you read my comments thoroughly, you will find out that I don&#8217;t recommend anyone going on an energy drink diet. I only mentioned it to you to help wake you up about how unhealthy energy drinks are. If you like drinking XS and don&#8217;t care about its negative effects, drink as much as you want. It doesn&#8217;t matter to me because it is your life. Just don&#8217;t manipulate others to drink it because you claimed that it is healthy.</p>

		<p>All I can say is Red Bull has one flavor, and XS has 14 flavors and taste much better and cheaper too!! Regardless I am sure Mr. PL Chang reads all the cans of everything just like I am sure he believe DeerPark Water is really spring water from a mountain, !!! lol</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m well aware that reading cans can be misleading. For example, many energy drinks claimed they used &#8220;all natural&#8221; flavors but this is not 100 percent true. The front can labels are usually misleading. Food and drink manufacturers don’t have to go through a verification process to use the term natural on their products. This means that they can add synthetic vitamins, minerals and preservatives and still claim that their products are natural. As for the term organic, they have to go through a verification process.</p>
<p>An example of this is hydrogenated oil. Manufacturers that used hydrogenated oil in their product can claim that it is natural. This is very misleading. There are certain properties of hydrogenated oil that are found in nature but many of its properties are altered by using heat, hydrogen and high pressure. This creates a more stable version of oil which is good for business but bad for health.</p>
<p>This is why you need to look at the ingredient lists section, and not the front of drink cans which are full of misleading advertisements. One misleading advertising tag lines that XS used on the front of their XS cans are &#8220;0 carbs 0 sugar.&#8221; This creates an illusion which tricks people to think that it is healthy. The reason why XS is low in sugar and carbs is because it used sucralose, an artificial sweetener known to have toxic side effects. In order to find out that XS contained sucralose you need to read the ingredient lists. Visit the link below for detail information on how to read ingredient lists.</p>

<p>As for bottled water, I&#8217;m well aware of its misleading advertisements. About half bottled water used filter tap water. Visit the link below for more information about the dangers of bottled water.</p>

		<p>Mr. Chang &#8211;<br />
Thank you for taking the time to actually sample our product. The fact that you tried it means that you are an open minded person that seeks to find facts rather than relying on hearsay for your wonderful reviews. I appreciate your review, and I am glad that you said that you like the flavor of our product. It means a lot to me.</p>
<p>I am an Amway Global IBO. Yes, my business is successful because of the sale of products on my website, in much the same way that someone&#8217;s job would be secure from the sale of whatever product their company produces. That being said, there should be nothing wrong with categorizing IBO&#8217;s buying their own products as legitimate customers. In much the same way that Pepsi employees, Kraft employees, etcetera do purchase their companies&#8217; products out of loyalty; they are still legitimate purchases by pleased customers. You get the picture.</p>
<p>There are a few things, I think, from which we all could benefit in this line of conversation. </p>
<p>1. Business is business &#8211; when you have a product or service, the idea in business is to sell it. In the Free Enterprise system, if someone has a product that people want, they will succeed. If not, they will be out of business. We have done over 8 billion dollars in business and have experienced a growth of 15% during the 2008 fiscal year. We are succeeding because our customers and we IBO&#8217;s love our product. By the way, we are required by our contracts to have a certain number of retail customers. This is a legitimate PROFITABLE business when done correctly. </p>
<p>2. Because IBO&#8217;s are business men and women, there is a tendency to be excited about their products; and well they should be. However, because we are INDEPENDENT Business Owners, there is no way for any of us to be held responsible for the others&#8217; actions. Let&#8217;s face it; some people just need a little more &#8220;Home Trainin&#8217;&#8221;.</p>
<p>Just please understand that you should probably not hold anything against the wonderful Amway Global Corporation, or any other IBO&#8217;s because of the lack of class or discretion shown by one or two individuals, any more than we should hold anything against you for something for which you are not responsible. You seem to be mature enough to understand this line of thinking. </p>
<p>Again, I appreciate your comments.</p>
<p>Continued success to you my friend,</p>
<p>James C. Wade II<br />

		<p>Thanks for the comment. You are one of the few IBOs who don&#8217;t attack my reviews. I do agree with some of your views about the world of business. The thing I don&#8217;t like about the world of business is that it valued money more than people. Therefore, products are designed mostly for profits rarely for the benefit of the public. An example of this is free energy. Free energy, such as zero-point energy, can free humanity from poverty. Unfortunately, the world energy corporations don&#8217;t want this because they will lose a lot of money. It&#8217;s mostly about greed and control.</p>
<p>If you are a truly honest person, you will admit that most, if not all, Quixtar/Amway products have misleading health claims. This also imply to most health and beauty companies out there. I know this because I&#8217;m well aware of the world of business and have a lot of knowledge about health. Unfortunately, being truly honest in the world of business during this century usually means failure. This is why Quixtar/Amway can&#8217;t tell all the facts to their IBOs. If we judge Quixtar/Amway products at the surface, it would have some of the top products in the world. If we judge Quixtar/Amway products below the surface, it would be just average because its claims are misleading, especially its health claims. I hope you don&#8217;t take this the wrong way. I&#8217;m just a person who cares a lot about the world and its inhabitants, which is why I&#8217;m not afraid to expose the truth. </p>
<p>My goal with this blog is to educate people with as much honesty as possible. This is why I include both side of the story with most of my reviews. Not just the side of Quixtar/Amway and its researchers. My number one priority is the health of my readers not money. This is why I don&#8217;t take compensation for my reviews. </p>
<p>You seem like a very smart and nice person. I wish you the best. Sorry for removing your links. This is necessary because I get too many people spamming my comment with links to their products.</p>

		<p> <img src="http://energyfanatics.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" class="wp-smiley" />  Yeah the XS energy drinks are the best energy drinks ever. I drink and sell energy drinks daily, and I can tell you that you could drink more than one a day. I&#8217;ve had a 12 pack in a day with no problems at all.<br />
Back in the days I used to drink another brand which I&#8217;m not going to mention, and I would probably have 2 the most a day. Well after couple months I started feeling real bad with a pain in my stomach, the reason those energy drinks.<br />
I love XS, try the new Classic.</p>

		<p>I Laughed out loud when you said &#8220;Go on an energy drink diet for a day or two, all your calories should only be from energy drink. After a day or two, you will feel its negative effects and will be begging for food.&#8221; </p>
<p>Thats like saying i&#8217;m only going to drink water and expect not to get hungry   <img src="http://energyfanatics.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":-P" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

		<p>If you get all your calories from energy drink or water you will get very hungry. The difference between water and energy drink is that you may feel the negative effects from energy drink after a day or so, such as migraines, dehydration, nausea, jitters, irregular heartbeat, etc. As for water, you will only experience hunger after a day unless the water is contaminated. Side effects are your body&#8217;s way of telling you that something is wrong so you should pay attention to them.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m an IBO with an unbiased opinion.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m no doctor but do a lot of research about ingredients and so forth. I&#8217;ve drank almost every energy drink on the market and XS by far has the best tasting drinks. Are XS energy drinks the healthiest out there, absolutely not but it has some good benefits that I&#8217;ll explain.</p>
<p>The ingredients I am not excited about are the artificial sweeteners ACESULFAME POTASSIUM in combination with SUCRALOSE,SODIUM BENZOATE(preservative), POTASSIUM<br />
SORBATE(preservative), and the food coloring.  </p>
<p>What I was very impressed with in XS is the Adaptogenic blend which I have not seen any other energy drink come close to. It includes (ELUTHEROCOCCUS SENTICOSUS, PANAX<br />
GINSENG, PANAX QUINQUEFOLIUM, SCHISANDRA, ASTRAGALUS, AND REISHI). The 1st three are different types of ginseng which are great for the body. The last 3 have extremely powerful anti-inflammatory and anti-stress properties. I am surprised this was never pointed out. Although synthetic, the high amount of B-vitamin content is greatly appreciated for energy production.</p>
<p>Overall, XS by ingredient listing and content, is one of the better energy drinks on the market. They&#8217;ve done a great job with the taste of the product combined with nutrient content. I feel they could have used a better sweetener(like Stevia or Xyitol), use natural colors, and leave out the preservatives. Again the Adaptogenic blend is very impressive along with B12 levels. As with anything, moderation should be used when consuming this.</p>

		<p>I am an IBO and I agree with you PL CHANG.<br />
thank you very much for this review.<br />
and remember guys if it sounds to good to be true. It&#8217;s pretty much not true.Btw&#8230; I am going to lay off the XS. Maybe once in a blue moon. But I&#8217;m going to try not to drink it at all.<br />
Thanks again.</p>

		<p>I like honest people. I am lost for words right now actually. XS is a decent product, but if anyone thinks drinking 4 a day is wise they are seriously deluded. There is no chance of a carbonated beverage being healthy, that&#8217;s the stupidist thing I&#8217;ve ever heard. If you want a healthy drink get some freshly squeezed organic orange juice and put it in a bottle for when you go and exercise.</p>

		<p>I just wanted to let ya&#8217;s know that sucralose only has side-effects when consumed in overdose. to find out the safe dose of sucralose: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucralose#Health.2C_safety.2C_and_regulation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucralose#Health.2C_safety.2C_and_regulation</a></p>
<p>Also synthetic vitamins are a little detrimental to your health but not as much as this article suggests.<br />
To get real facts, ask your local GP.</p>
<p>One more thing, when I read this article I thought holey moley they are saying XS is really unhealthy but in fact it is rated on this site as the 5th most healthy energy drink. </p>
<p>Just wanted to clarify <img src="http://energyfanatics.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

		<p>By the way people, stop using this poor guy&#8217;s review as a flame war for and against amway.</p>
<p>i mean jeeeeeze, people. surely you&#8217;ve realised that haters are gonna hate and lovers are gonna love? </p>
<p>Its a free friggen world and if Chang wants to express his opinion and expose some truth, let him lol. IBOs should thank him because if he gets Amway&#8217;s attention they might consider improving the product, thus improving IBO sales.</p>
<p>My personal opinion on XS is yes, like all energy drinks, there&#8217;s some danger. As long as you limit to 2 or 3 a day you should be fine and if you experience any side effects you should see a doctor. Chances are you have other health problems that are causing this or you have an intolerance to one of the ingredients. Not unheard of, believe me. XS is the only energy drink i can consume without cringing from the taste and that earns it some stars. If i had the choice at a store between xs and any other main stream drink, i&#8217;d choose xs.</p>
<p>Yes its true that most xs sales are from IBOs. That&#8217;s how the business works, really. its perfectly fine to claim IBO sales as customer sales because every IBO is a customer of Amway <img src="http://energyfanatics.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

		<p>Whether or not XS is the best energy drink or not, Amway is still a poor business opportunity.</p>
<p>Amway&#8217;s own information proves it.</p>
<p>Average IBO income (not coungint inactive IBOs) = $115/mo.</p>
<p>.5% (one half of one percent) of IBOs reach the Gold/Platinum level.</p>

		<p>This is just stupid and doesn&#8217;t add to the discussion. No-one asked if Amway was a good business opportunity, they want to know about the drink. </p>
<p>By the way how do you know the stats you just said even support your argument? Do you know how many people go through and get churned out by Amway? Literally people sign up and quit the day after, 4 days after, 20 days after, 1 year later when they forgot they signed up and the membership expired (Because they keep you there against your will lol). There are millions of people who do that not to mention the 50 or 60 % who love Amway but prefer to just be a wholesale shopper and those are included in the stats pegging the &#8216;successful&#8217; ones down to .5% or whatever you said. How many people are gonna get sucked in by these ridiculous statistics about it being bad? And before you say I must be an IBO I&#8217;ve never been part of the Amway business and most likely never will be. I&#8217;ve also never believed in witchcraft or the tooth fairy or 2012 being the end though.</p>

		<p>Let me clarify something. First of all, you can&#8217;t call it Quikstar anymore. It is now just Amway Global. Second of all, the IBO&#8217;s you interviewed are obviously not growing their business right. Most of the XS that goes through my business is sales, not to myself. People always gives Amway a bad rep because they don&#8217;t understand it or their upline is doing something wrong.</p>

		<p>I am also an amway IBO. When I first joined, I was working at the Vitamin Shoppe. I compared and contrasted most of the energy drinks sold by Vitamin Shoppe to XS. What I found out was they were all very similar as far as the sweeteners. The price was pretty competitive to those of the Vitamin Shoppes prices. When it comes to XS, the reason why I think its such a great product is because it tastes great and there are over 15 different flavors to chose from. No other energy drink company has the available. That&#8217;s why I feel it is a great drink. Yes I do agree it is not the healthiest, but at the same time, either is any of the big name drinks out there like red bull, monster, amp, etc. I market this product to people who already drink those products. So I am going after a market of people that clearly do not care about the ingredients as much as they do about the taste and effects of the products. I do not see anything wrong in that. And if I do try and market it to someone who is health conscious, I encourage them to read the label and if they don&#8217;t like any of the ingredients they see, they don&#8217;t need to try it. I do find that it makes my metabolism faster, and I market it as a great workout/ weight lost assistance drink because of my personal experience and that of other. I always allow the customer to make the decision though and I never get offended if they say no. Amway is a great company, unfortunately some bad Amway IBO&#8217;s give it a bad name.</p>

		<p>PL Chang<br />
As a very fresh Amway IBO, who really only got involved for the savings i get on stuff like Telstra and Harvey Norman&#8230; I am investigating their products so I can market them efficiently and well.  </p>
<p>This review is very helpful, although some of the &#8216;anti Amway&#8217; and &#8216;pro Amway&#8217; replays were a little oblivious and annoying&#8230; Last I saw this was a review of an energy drink&#8230;</p>
<p>Just to clarify, what your saying is that as a &#8216;health drink&#8217; its misleading. But as an energy drink its the lesser of evils?<br />
Because the way I have always seen it is that energy drinks are bad for you&#8230;<br />
Like seriously, anything with 26.4g of sugar in one 250ml can can not be good for you&#8230; (This is red bull)&#8230;<br />
But if your going to drink energy drinks, wouldn&#8217;t you advise them do drink the ones with the lowest amount of sugars? Or is it like real coke is better than diet coke?</p>
<p>Again, Thankyou for reviewing the energy drink, and not going &#8220;this is another Amway scam&#8221;&#8230; Very good to read.</p>

		<p>You are welcome Alex. The problem with sugar free drinks is that their sugar are replaced with artificial sweeteners. Aspartame and sucralose (not to be confused with sucrose) are the most common artificial sweeteners for replacing table sugar (refined sugar). These two artificial sweeteners are just as bad or may even be worse than refined sugar.</p>
<p>Drinking a few any drinks per week is not going to cause major health problems. However, in the long-run they could help cause certain health problems. The older you are, the less you should drink energy drinks.</p>

<p>XS drinks are exactly what diabetics have been looking for. With zero sugar,</p>
<p>Caffeine in XS Energy Drinks?<br />
Caffeine &#8211; doesn&#8217;t it make you jittery? &#8211; Amway.<br />
There are 83 milligrams of caffeine in a 8.4 oz can of XS Energy Drink. 3 cans in a day.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine</a><br />
Consumption of large amounts of caffeine – usually more than 250 mg per day – can lead to a condition known as caffeinism. Caffeinism usually combines caffeine dependency with a wide range of unpleasant physical and mental conditions including nervousness, irritability, restlessness, insomnia, headaches, and heart palpitations after caffeine use.[</p>

		<p>I am researching the XS product because I will be a future IBO and wanted to find out information on the ingredients in it. One of my friends said they are not healthy, and my partner exclaims they are healthy hence my being here. I have read both sides and can honestly say that I would not mind selling these products. Although I would not say they are &#8220;healthy&#8221; for you, but according from what everyone else is saying&#8230;its an energy drink, and it gives you energy. Mission accomplished. I personally would rather drink these energy drinks as opposed to other ones like &#8220;full throttle, red bull, monster&#8221; etc. Mainly because they just taste better, and I actually notice an increase in energy, and that is all I need to know. I would not assume that ANY energy drink is healthy. If you want some REAL ALL NATURAL ENERGY, go chew on some ginseng root. But if you like a good tasting energy drink then I don&#8217;t see a problem with these. Compared to other companies, these drinks taste better and does what its supposed to do and that&#8217;s give you energy. You can&#8217;t eat anything from a store now a days that doesn&#8217;t have supplements in some form that are not good for you. By the way PL Change I study Taoism and I am not an IBO as of yet, just putting in my 2 cents from a spectators point of view.</p>
