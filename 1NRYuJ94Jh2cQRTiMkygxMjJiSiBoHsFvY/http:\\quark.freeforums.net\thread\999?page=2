They dropped the big three: Bitcoin, Litecoin and Quark! Good long term investments. we need to buy whilst America sleeps. It's a realy shame there is no fiat exchange, now would be the time to get the newbiew invested.Hey, I’m in the US and I’m not asleep! QRK QTcHPADR6H8R6PMbc1G3TPFqkg4FeZw6rd

Here's the Keiser Report link for everyone w/ Bill Still and Quark... rt.com/shows/keiser-report/episode-538-max-keiser-443/Just to recap,1.) Max Kesier asked Bill Still questions about Quark, spending much more airtime on Quark than I and others anticipated.2.) Bill Still highlighted Quark's advantages as being "security and stability".3.) Bill did "alright", but more importantly he represented Quark to a potentially new level/crowd of crypto-currency buyer/investor.I liked how they talked about NSA spy tech./programs and how Quark could not be broken/hacked in "real-time". I also liked Bill's explanation of the pre-mine giving Quark potential stability over BTC and other cyrpto's. Those were the two major points I got from the report. Anyone else?

Thought it was very important that Bill Still sold Quark on the basis of it being a people's currency which preserves freedom, as this concept is what will attract new adopters. This is why I submitted a design idea for the Quark logo which embodied this concept. I think it would resonate with many and get the message across well. Here it is, I posted it on the branding forum.qrk.cc/post/6351it's important for the future to get the branding right, and the branding should reflect the core values of the coin.

Great discussion and Bill was smiling!!! I think that Quark will do well as time goes by and governments firm up their acceptance of cryptos. It will just be a bumpy ride for awhile. Buy on the dips for sure.

I think this is great news! Bill makes a great point that once the quarks are all mined , it will be less of a potential bubble and alot more stable. I could see a future where your buying your morning coffee using quarks at the drive through.

I'm sure Bill did a ton of reading so he could talk cohesively about crytpos and QRK. Otherwise you look like a shill fool. Kudos Bill to being well informed.
