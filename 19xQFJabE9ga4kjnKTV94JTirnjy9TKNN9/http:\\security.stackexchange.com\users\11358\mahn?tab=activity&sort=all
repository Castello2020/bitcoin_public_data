Currently building a web app. I'm at SO/SE sites with the goal of learning something new every day.
Things I like/use include:
camelCase, OOP, HTML(5), CSS(3), PHP(5), (My)SQL, PDO, xdebug, APC, XHPRof, Javascript, jQuery + jQuery UI, JSON, redis, Git, PHPUnit, node.js, Twitter Boostrap, Modernizr, Common sense
Things I dislike/don't use include: under_scores, XML, spaghetti code, gotos, architecture astronauts, etc
I also used to do: VB6, VB.NET, C/C++, x86 Assembly, Motorola 68K Assembly; but I forgot most of it since I haven't touched them in years.
Like my stuff? A couple of mBTCs are always welcome: 19xQFJabE9ga4kjnKTV94JTirnjy9TKNN9

How can I punish a hacker?
although no damage was done <- so what's the point in seeking punishment? pride? personally I'd be happy if someone broke onto my servers but did no damage — I can patch the vulnerability before someone else does cause damage thanks to him.

In the light of recent information about RarVM, can we still trust RAR files?
The same implementation is being used by pretty much any compressing application with RAR support, isn't it? if this is the case whatever is broken "in" WinRAR will be broken in other compressors that handle RAR files.

From a technical standpoint, how does the zero-day Internet Explorer vulnerability discovered in September 2012 work?
@Chad nevermind to what I wrote before, I see your point.

Great answer! one thing missing is how exactly does the memory related to the event get overwritten between DeleteCommandTarget and Exec, which apparently is done through Javascript, this article has a good summary on that part: theregister.co.uk/2012/09/19/zero_day_ie

How does hacking work?
(This is also one of the reasons why PHP has such a bad rep among more experienced devs)

How does hacking work?
For example, if you visit the feed of questions of the PHP label at Stack Exchange at any given point, and this is very real, some 40 to 50% of the new questions on the first page will contain a php+mysql combination that is vulnerable to sql injections — and it's not rare for this kind of code to be found in small/medium sized businesses (until it breaks, of course)

How does hacking work?
I realize the discussion is several months old, but @Pacerier I'm pretty sure a large % of what's on the internet is not written by experienced developers. That's why sql injection is still a reality, it's trivial to take care of if you know what you are doing, but there are lots of people who don't.
