Red Hat Does $1 Billion in Revenue
Submitted by thebearmaster2 on Tue, 2012-04-17 04:12 | g+ Linux is everywhere. Linux is free. I can hear the fat cats at the "closed source" software companies cringe. Open Source is supposed to be for fools and hippies. How can a company famous for their Linux distro hit $1 billion in revenue?

Depends on how you look at it. Subscriptions costs and gives you the privilege to get help when needed and so forth but you can download for free at site linked below.https://access.redhat.com/downloads(hope the link works properly cause have had struggles with "https everywhere" not properly linking)I think, though, that you need to evaluate the OS every 30, 60 or 90 days when you choose free download.Edit:Sorry, my bad, I think you have to register and buy a subscription to download the whole thing. You might be right that it costs to use. But doesn't that take away the GNU rights and make it a normal (pricy) OS rather than a open source or Linux OS?	cooperman (Online) posts, joined: #7

Thanks but no need for it. I looked around a little and saw that instead of saying that Red Hat is free, they try to say that it's good that it's not free and that I would actually benefit from it when it costs. I don't see why they say it's an opensource OS when you have to pay for it. They say CentOS is just a project made by a group who take the redhat packages and make them work with CentOS and that they don't belong to the Red Hat company. Why is Red Hat a Open source Linux OS when it doesn't follow the GNU/Linux rights? Have I missed something?	cooperman (Online) posts, joined: #9

It isent thats the point it's some smart arse's makeing extortionate amounts of money out of you for free softwhere and packing it up as a virus free vershon to windows.Not like apple isent doing the same thing selling you free bsd as mac osx but then stinging you with hardwhere cost's because its coded to run on there out of date shit that costs you a huge premium.Redhat is the WORST direction for linux and a slap in the face to the thousands of coders that make linux possible.

Take free work of thousands, add own logo and call it a distro. Get money for support, cause only we know what parts we've put into it. Still I will not use linux on daily basis.	brennanriddell (Offline) posts, joined: #12

I am a huge fan of RedHat; Fedora is my go-to desktop distro, and RedHat is my go-to server distro. I don't personally own a RedHat server, but I did help my local 3M plant decide to use RedHat on their new servers.	Tek Syndicate recommends using a VPN:
