Agreed. Logan would be a bad-ass Prime Minister. I don't know if Logan was just being funny, or being confused, but they do call the trunk the boot in the UK, and I don't know of any place in Canada where it isn't called a trunk. I call it a boot sometimes, but that's just because I'm weird.	Cyberdemon531 (Offline) posts, joined: #8

No need to cut to the girl behind the keyboard and then pan to the screen. Keep things real and classy, I've seen plenty other sites go down bad paths :P administrator Logan (Offline) posts, joined: #14

I'm sorry you think "that" is what we were doing. Would you have said the same thing if we showed a dude playing the games? As far as we are concerned she is not a male or female gamer; she is just a gamer and a member of our team. I have zero respect for websites that use sex to sell. As to why we are showing behind the scenes footage... She did the benchmarks for us. Some viewers complained that we weren't doing the benchmarks ourselves... so we show that we truly are. I think the behind the scenes stuff is more organic anyway when compared to just slapping some fraps footage on the screen. Devov (Offline) posts, joined: #15

You guys haven't done anything to cause me to worry, but I still do. Just coming off watching a bunch of Starcraft2 (specifically NASL) and have been appauled at some of the shit they've pulled. It is an unfair reaction from me, but it was in the forefront of my mind. I mainly just watch "The Tek". I'm not used to a camera panning around behind the scenes. I found it distracting, but I appear to be alone, so I'm probably just jaded.	Ace2020boyd (Offline) posts, joined: #16

i've built a mini itx pc last year and i am loving it. i used the silverstone sg07 case, which is really great to work with and has an excellent power supply built in.only downside so far was that i had to cut around the case a little bit to fit my asus gtx 670 direct-cu2 and that the air flow is a bit inferior compared to a more spacious case. it just gets a bit tight in there, especially with a big aftermarket cpu cooler as well.but all in all it runs great. could probably even overclock the cpu without problems. not the gpu though - bit too hot. and it really is extremely quiet.specs : silverstone sg07 case with 600w psi5-2500 with samurai scythe cpu coolerasus gtx 670 directcu2 2gb- very happy with this one, as it is a lot more quiet than the zotag gtx 570 i used to have8gb gskill rammotherboard : asus p8h67-i128 gb ssd + 500gb hdi can really recommend a tiny and quit pc if you need somehing low profile or just small (like me, as i live in a caravan :). especially cause you don't even need compromise on gaming power.rock on!
