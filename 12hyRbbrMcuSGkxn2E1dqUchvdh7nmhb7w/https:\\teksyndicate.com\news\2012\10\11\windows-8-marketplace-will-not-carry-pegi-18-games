Windows 8 Marketplace Will Not Carry PEGI 18+ Games
Submitted by LittleViking on Thu, 2012-10-11 13:07 | g+ I can't quite fathom why Microsoft would've made this decision, but apparently they will not be selling any 'Mature' or 'Pegi 18+' games through the Windows digital store. Windows 8 will still run these games--it's not like Microsoft is disallowing the execution of these games. Rather, they're opting out of selling them through their digital store.
Does anyone have any idea why they would make such a decision? It seems like they're simply shooting themselves in the foot. After all, a large number of game sales are of games that fall within the 'M' or 'Pegi 18+' rating.
Let me know if you can think of any reasons why them might possibly make such a decision.

They are isolating Steam as the "go to" place for those brand of games.Also, they want to present themselves as a "family" company. There was a very LONG time where Nintendo refused to allow Mature games on their platform. ORIt could be this is a way to villify either Steam, or mature games in general.It has put steam in a decent position though. Unless someone comes along and starts a smear campaign against Steam. Saying that if your kids want to use steam.. they are desiring to play violent mature games they shouldn't be playing. Of course that reminds me of the whole "if your kid uses linux, they are an evil criminal hacker: Look for the warning signs."	Sgt. Stinger (Offline) posts, joined: #3

No big loss, only metro apps allowed in the store, and I'm certainly NOT using metro. I use a nifty little app called Classic Start Menu. It emulates the good old start menu, and makes Metro obsolete. I NEVER use Metro. Ever.	administrator Logan (Online) posts, joined: #4

I don't think this will vilify Steam. The pegi 18 games are no more mature than half the junk that is on TV these days. It's just a terrible move. It is obvious that Steam is going to be the real gaming platform... What we should be talking about is how terrible the decisions have been from MS recently. They seriously decided to do this... just think about that. DeusQain (Offline) posts, joined: #5

I wasn't suggesting that not carrying them would vilify steam. I'm suggesting that M$ is playing a different game than they have been for the last twenty years. The logo change, the push for more "Cloud" products, Windows8 being universal across the platforms. (probably on Xbox 720 too) They will be in a position to push forward with a new ideology.There are many who are agressive against Win8, because we are running with the idea that they are looking to keep us on as users. If we are all going to continue using Windows7. Why would they cater to us. They need to get the new generation, to adopt the new software, and in turn render us into dinosaurs. I say that this move could lead to the vilification of Steam as the provider of violent and "Mature" games.The future of broadcasting isn't television unless you count internet connected TVs. Meaning the crap on TV is going to slowly die as well, as the advertisers shift their purchases to online video ads.My point with Steam, is they will be the big kid on the block in providing violent content, and that's the spin that will get placed on it when some zealot decieds to start some anti violent games crap again.

Seems a bit silly IMO.They could easily have a show adult option hidden in a corner somewhere.And TMK we have to create official accounts for marketplaces no? SO why not have a link card to account option as proff of age and once this is done adult content would be shown to that account.	an (Offline) posts, joined: #8

All of my why. Although it's not like any gamers were going to switch from Steam to the Windows marketplace anyway.	mod Destroyed007 (Offline) posts, joined: #10

Hang on a minute, if Microsoft wants to make this a family marketplace, why are they still allowing R16 games?	DeusQain (Offline) posts, joined: #11

What I'm saying, is this could be much bigger on the scope of M$ than just the games they carry on the platform.	SteelValor (Offline) posts, joined: #12

Indeed. Apparently they are also cleaning up the Zune Marketplace as well. I just did a search for MSN OnIt WP7 app and it's gone. Now if they could only get that 'fake bewbz banning' algorythm working I might actually wander back into the wallpaper section.	ChaosBlades (Offline) posts, joined: #13

Only reason I would ever upgrade to W8 at this point is if some clever person created a patch to remove metro completely and somehow patch in the W7 start menu parts AND LOGIN SCREEN or perhaps manually put the parts back into W8 that they removed when they removed the start button during beta testing.

I think Windows 8 supports Audio hardware acceleration. If it's true thats a plus, but as you say the features we like in 7 now need to be a option at install.	CosmicMonster (Offline) posts, joined: #15

Windows 8 is going to flop. MS has always been through a pattern for some reason lol. Windows 98 was good, 2000 flopped. XP was good, Vista flopped. Win 7 is good, Win 8? Most liikely flop...	mc11731 (Offline) posts, joined: #21

This is one of the stupidest ideas you can do for a game marketplace.	Tek Syndicate recommends using a VPN:
