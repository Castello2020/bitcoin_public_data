 </li><li itemprop="text">Note to the Btc Pioneers:
I think we can all agree that Bitcoin is in it's infancy. There's also no question that it has
the power to catalyze fundamental changes in the world economy as well as shift the
balance of power. If Bitcoin takes hold and moves into the main stream then the power
that governments hold over money and thereby over people, will will no longer be
absolute.
In other words, by democratizing money, power shifts. By eliminating the monopoly
governments hold over money it also eliminates their authoritarian power over people.
Of course this has far reaching implications.
That being said, it is also obvious that there are many who will do everything in their
power to prevent this from happening. We see evidence of this this every day. When
mainstream media reluctantly mentions bitcoin it always seems to find an alarming
angle. The headlines read &quot;Bitcoin Crashes as Predicted&quot;. But a look at the graph shows
merely a spike followed by a normalization. The 30,000 foot view consistently shows a
climb. Articles abound about how bitcoin can easily be stolen. Or how it is only used for
nefarious purposes. Whether it is an intentional smear campaign or simply the normal
workings of the media, the end result is the same. Fear.
With so much propaganda spreading fear of bitcoin, there needs to be a counter measure.
A way of educating the public. A leaflet dropped into the digital world. A way of
dispelling the fear.
That is the purpose of this guide. It is a freely distributable guide in which we have
gathered experts in various specialized knowledge areas. Experts who have contributed
their knowledge in order to educate. Because:
Knowledge Dispels Fear
As detailed as this guide currently is, there is still much to cover. Bitcoin is ever
evolving. As it evolves there is still much need for experts. If you have expertise in the
area of bitcoin and feel capable of contributing your knowledge, then we invite you to
apply as a contributor. Submit your application here:

 </li><li itemprop="text">Introduction
Understanding the fundamentals of Bitcoin is quite simple. However to fully understand
it's possibilities and safe and efficient use of it we need to call upon experts from various
fields. That is the purpose of this guide. To compile the necessary expertise to fully
understand bitcoin in an easily understood document.
If you have followed bitcoin at all, you have seen outbursts from the media designed to
create uncertainty and fear around bitcoin. And of course this is expected.
You may have even panicked from some of them yourself. It's alright. They are pretty
good at triggering emotions. It's what they do. Their business model requires it.
The only answer to that is education. To educate yourself and to help educate others.
That is the purpose of this free ebook. That being said, you are free to distribute this
wherever you see fit. On your website. In social media. Print it out and give it to a
friend. Every new person that reads it is one more person that can speak intelligently
about it. And as more and more people can speak intelligently about it, the darkness
fades. The fear mongering media weakens. And the free market will be left to do what it
will do. And that just might turn out to be an amazing thing.
So. You may freely distribute this document but you may not alter it.

 </li><li itemprop="text">Many Experts
The subject of bitcoin is vast. It's not just about money. It's a lot about freedom. It's
about cryptography. It's about economics. It's about business. No one person can be an
expert in all these things. Which is why we've brought together a team to create this. Our
goal is to have the top experts in all the necessary related fields contribute what is
necessary to help people understand bitcoin. Maybe you can help?

It's More Like Money Than Money

Money - V1.0
Money = A medium of exchange
It's a simple concept. But it does rely on one thing. Agreement. Agreement between
individuals within society. But at it's core. That's all that money really is.
Throughout history we've used sea shells, beads, even rocks. And it has worked for
eons. This, of course, is the simplest form of money. Any medium works. Although
there are some obvious downfalls to some mediums. Attributes such as easy
reproduction, loss of utility (for items that have utility), or impermanence can all lead to
potential problems.

Money V2.0
Then there is a second form of money. That is commodity based money. In commodity
based money precious metals, rice, precious spices. All kinds of things have been used.
That has worked out okay. But with a few hindrances. Portability can be an issue. If
cows are your medium of exchange it becomes a slightly difficult endeavor to pay your
utility bill. Loss of utility is certainly an issue. Impermanence can be an issue. The value
of the commodities utility versus the value of the money can be an issue.

 </li><li itemprop="text">Money V3.0
So the third form of money is creating notes which then represent the commodity. It
solves the portability issue. But it creates it's own set of problems. Counterfeiting.
Double selling. Oh and then you have to keep all that commodity lying around in case it
gets called due. At which time that commodity is doing no useful thing. It's just taking
up space and creating an expense in protecting it.
Money V4.0
Fourth is yet another form of money. Fiat money. Fiat money is money because
someone else said it is. Not society. But instead government. It is dictated to be money.
The term fiat is latin and it means &quot;It shall be&quot;. It is money by decree.
Isn't that the same as the first form? Well no. Actually not at all. It is very different
indeed. In the first form WE agree upon the medium of exchange. The you's and I's
agree. It is our mutual agreement that makes money money. Therefor we have control
over what money is. In fiat money, a third party (a government) has control over what
money is. As we have seen, that control, that ability to define what money is. Is an
amazingly powerful thing. It puts almost limitless power in the hands of that third party.
And power corrupts!
I'm going to take a wild guess and say that that third party is not going to give up that
power without a fight.
Money V1.1
Bitcoin is that simple first form of money. It is simply a medium of exchange. It's value
is defined simply by our mutual agreement. It has no outside forces that can control it by
printing more of it. Or by giving it out to their special friends. It is controlled only by the
marketplace and our mutual agreement to be a part of that marketplace.
Small difference? I don't think so.
Bitcoin has many advantages over the early mediums of exchange. This guide will cover
those. But there are two that are amazingly important.

 </li><li itemprop="text">1) It's finite. Yes it can be mined but only a finite amount of it. So unlike sea shells and
beads no one can just go out and get more and introduce it into the system.
2) It's infinitely divisible. Which solves the problem of there not being enough to do all
the transactions. If the value of a bitcoin gets to high we just drop down a couple
decimal places and give it a name for convenience. Actually that's been done. It's called
a Satoshi or 1/100,000,000 of a btc.
It's Not Like A Credit Card
Because bitcoin is digital many make the comparison to credit cards. To transferring
money around like we do with credit cards online. Well kind of. But not really.
When we transfer money with credit cards or a paypal account we are transferring a
digital representation of money. A digital representation of fiat money. Or in other
words a digital representation of something somebody else says is money.
Whoa, stop. That's a deep rabbit hole. We best not go down there lest we be here all
day.
All kinds of creative things can be done with this digital representation of fiat. Putting
lag times in between transfers (So I can send a text message to the other side of the
world in under a second but my bank transfer, which is a digital representation only,
takes days? Hhhmmm) Double spending. Where is that money while it's so long in
transit. But that is another deep rabbit hole. Let's jump over that one too.
Bitcoin is not a digital representation of money. It is the money. When it transfers to you
it's there. Not in account somewhere (unless you purposely structure it that way). It's
where you put it.
So that makes it a lot more like paper money than a credit card or a paypal account. And
that has some pluses and some minuses.
The pluses. Well it takes all that possibility of manipulation away. All the games the
banks play. Well, they can't be played.
The minuses. Well if someone steals your paper money it's gone. Same thing for bitcoin.
Transfers are final. It's more like a thing than a representation of a thing. Even though
it's digital. So when a thing gets stolen it's gone. When a representation of a thing gets
stolen then.... well actually I don't know.

 </li><li itemprop="text">But don't let that worry you too much. Because thee are many ways to secure bitcoin.
And many mediums to do it in. Yep you can store it in:
1) A wallet on your phone.
2) A wallet on your hard drive.
3) A wallet on the web.
4) You can even store it on a piece of paper.
Or better yet.
5)You can even store it in your brain.
Yep, really, In your brain. Who said you can't take it with you.
The real power of security comes in when you figure out how to store it in a
combination of places. No, not copies of it here and there. Remember it's more like a
thing. But passcodes that take 2 out of three to work. So when you store that 75 million
on your hard drive and your wife decides to throw that hard drive in the trash you still
have a way to recover your 75 million.
Getting confused? Don't be. You get used to it really quickly. Once you Grok it. Give it
a little time.
There are some really great security methods. We'll get into all that. The thing is just
don't think about it like a credit card or debit card. It's not.
So yes. Security for bitcoin can be pretty powerful. It is based on cryptography you
know. Duh!
So when you hear the media cries about security issues. Now you'll know. Yes, if you
are foolish with it, sure it can be stolen. But then so can anything. If you leave it lying
around.

 </li><li itemprop="text">Buying Bits
One thing to keep in mind. If you try to transfer money from a credit or debit card to
bitcoin you probably can't.
Bitcoin to debit card? No Problem. Debit card to bitcoin? Yes you'll have a problem.
But it's not bitcoins fault. It's actually a security problem created by the credit card. Not
the bitcoin. You see, all credit card holders can issue chargebacks. You can call your
credit card company and deny a charge. They'll believe you and retrieve the money
(remember it was only a virtual representation so they can do this). Unfortunately this
little aspect of credit cards enables a whole category of crime. Because of the whole
&quot;digital representation of money thing.
Criminals can buy things and then charge them back. Or use a stolen credit card and the
original owner charges back. They get the items and the merchant loses out. No matter
what the scenario it's the merchant that loses. Not the credit card issuer. No they don't
guarantee the card to the merchant. The merchant accepts it with the inherent risks.
It happens all the time. The merchant not only loses the goods but also probably paid to
ship them. Then he has to spend a bunch of time filling out paperwork for the credit card
companies. Then he usually has to pay a fee on top of all that. It's horrible and it's
rampant. But it's how credit card companies work. Heck they still got their fees and
made a little extra on the side. No biggie to them.
So pretty early on the criminals bought bitcoin with credit cards. Or even with stolen
credit cards. That became a pretty big problem. Because bitcoin transfers are final.
Credit card transfers are not. They bought bitcoin and the card got charged back. The
bitcoin was long gone. The seller of the bitcoin simply lost out. A fast and easy crime.
So you probably can't buy bitcoin with credit cards for this reason. Just remember. It's
not a problem with bitcoin. It's a problem with the credit cards.
By the way, if you ever did have a need to make a bitcoin transfer not final. And it will
come up. There's a solution for that too. It's very simple to setup an escrow system.
Bitcoins have that covered too.
So anyway, just think about bitcoin more like real money and you'll understand it faster.

 </li><li itemprop="text">It's Volatile! For Now!
We've seen bitcoin (btc) prices all over the place. It's been on an amazingly fast upward
trend. But along with that fast upward trend has been some crashes.
Actually I'd hardly call them crashes. If you look at the trends long term what you see is
spikes and normalizations. But we'll leave that discussion for the economists. It's really
not the point right now.
What is important is to realize that in this early stage that is completely normal and
should be expected.
Why?
Because bitcoin is mostly being treated as an investment right now. It's so new that the
heavy usage is all by investors. And because of that you are going to see wild
fluctuations. It's like stocks on steroids. Anytime there is something big in the news you
are going to see some wild variations. Anytime a major government steps in and tries to
regulate it you are going to see an effect.
This probably won't level out for a very long time. Not until the majority of the activity
is actually market activity. Consumers buying goods and services. As btc is used more
and more for buying things, those the fluctuations should stabilize. Because at that point
it will be millions or billions of tiny transactions that dominate. The invisible hand of the
market will take over. The influence of the news will lesson because it will become less
and less of a commodity and more and more of a currency.
How long will that take? Who knows. For now the forces that don't like it will do all
they can to prevent it becoming a currency. They can do that through regulation and fear
mongering. But that is all they can do. Despite their great power they can probably do
nothing more than slow down it's progression. Simply delay the inevitable. But not stop
it.
We shall see.

 </li><li itemprop="text">You Can't Regulate it Away
So what happens when a government cracks down with regulations?
It's very difficult for anyone to regulate it. Because:
1) It's highly portable. Very fast and easy to move.
2) It's peer to peer. So pretty hard to shut down.
3) It's anonymous (Unless you somehow attach identifying information to it) so therefor
very difficult to track.
That all makes it very difficult to regulate.
What governments can regulate is the in points and the out points, that are under
their control.
What has happened so far is that when one government regulates it, the activity just
moves elsewhere. As long as there is one place in the world that the in points and out
points are not regulated then people are free to transfer their dollars or euros or yen or
whatever into bitcoin.
Regulation does not stop bitcoin transfers. So transfers for goods, services, or gifts is
very difficult for anyone to stop.
I'm sure that someone somewhere is looking into it. It's not looking good for them.
Can the System be Hacked?
Well actually yes. It's not all that hard. But it doesn't actually do much if it happens. The
ledger is reproduced over the peer to peer network. There are a large number of copies
of the ledger. So if a copy gets hacked and doesn't match up to the numerous other
copies it just gets ignored.
Theoretically someone could create enough computing power to gain control over a
majority of nodes. That is a possibility. But definitely an improbability. We'll leave it up
to the mathematicians to calculate how much computing power that would take. But
from all accounts it appears that we're pretty safe from that theoretical possibility.

Cryptographic concepts

To understand the principles of Bitcoin, we also need to understand certain
cryptographic concepts. Cryptography is the art and science of keeping messages
confidential and secure. In addition to that, cryptography is also able to provide
authentication, integrity and non-repudiation of messages. In this context, these words
have the following meanings:
• Authentication. It should be possible for the receiver of a message to
ascertain its origin; an intruder should not be able to masquerade as someone
else.
• Integrity. It should be possible for the receiver of a message to verify that it
has not been modified in transit; an intruder should not be able to substitute a
false message for a legitimate one.
• Non-repudiation. A sender should not be able to falsely deny later that he
sent a message.
Cryptography has multiple means of achieving the above-mentioned goals, and we
describe some of them that are needed to understand Bitcoin.
If two parties want to send messages securely, they may use encryption to hide the
actual contents of the messages (plaintext) and transform them to ciphertext, i. e., to
make them unreadable by anyone else. The receiving party can perform decryption to
recover the plaintext. Usually, the algorithms for encryption and decryption are well© www.bitriches.com 2014

The Ultimate Guide to Bitcoin

Author: Farm Boy

Page 16

 </li><li itemprop="text">known, and only the encryption/decryption keys are maintained secret. If both parties
use the same key for encryption and decryption, they use a symmetric encryption
algorithm. Symmetric algorithms alone provide confidentiality, but to achieve the other
goals, we need other techniques, such as hash functions.

The Ultimate Guide to Bitcoin

Author: Farm Boy

Page 17

 </li><li itemprop="text">The output of a hash function is not dependent on input in any distinguishable way.
These properties give us the possibility to use hash functions to verify integrity of
messages. Someone having the hash of a message can determine whether the message
is intact. This method is used, for example, in BitTorrent protocol: the .torrent file has
hashes of the pieces of data, and the data is checked to verify that it has the same
hashes after it is downloaded from the peers. If the hash of a downloaded piece of data
does not match the one in the .torrent file, such piece is rejected and later downloaded
from someone else. As a result, peers are unable to send fake data and force the
downloader to accept it.
Digital Signatures
When a digital message provides authentication, integrity and non-repudiation together,
we say it has a digital signature, similar to a paper document with a handwritten
signature [8]. Although it is possible to create digital signatures by using symmetric
algorithms, hash functions and a trusted third party, as described in [8], this solution is
inefficient.
If we give out our public key, anyone is able to send us messages encrypted with it,
and those messages could not be read by a third party.
Public-key cryptography could also be used for digital signing. We can find the
hash of the message and encrypt it with the private key,

thus forming a digital

signature. If someone who has the public key receives the message with the digital
signature, it is possible for him/her to verify both the authenticity and integrity of the
message by decrypting the signature with the public key and comparing the result to the
hash of the message.

 </li><li itemprop="text">The signed message also has the property of non-repudiation, that is, the sender is not
able to falsely deny sending the message.
There are many public-key algorithms. The RSA algorithm is the most widely used.
There is also another family of public-key algorithms, known as Elliptic Curve
Cryptography (ECC).

Bitcoin Overview

Since the introduction of public-key cryptography, various proposals have been made
to make a monetary system based on it.

Examples are David Chaum’s &quot;Blind

signatures for untraceable payments&quot; and Ian Grigg's &quot;Triple Entry Accounting&quot; [6].
David Chaum
Chaum’s paper suggests a system where payments are done anonymously and securely.
Though a trusted third party is still needed.David Chaum also founded DigiCash BV,
the first company to provide a cryptographic digital currency. Even though DigiCash
became rather well-known in the payment industry in the 1990’s, the company went
bankrupt in 1998 [7].

 </li><li itemprop="text">Ian Grigg
In Ian Grigg's paper, when two willing parties transact, the payer (Alice) creates a
receipt which includes:
1) The payer's and payee's (Bob) names
2) The amount of money to be sent
3) The digital signature of the whole receipt.
The digital signature is made with the payer's private key. This receipt, together with
the current date and time, is signed by issuer of the money (Ivan). This is illustrated in
Figure 1. From this moment, as Ian Grigg says, &quot;The Receipt is the Transaction&quot; [6],
which means that we do not need to keep a whole history of all transactions, but only
the latest receipts.
Ian Grigg claims that this system was implemented for internal money in a company,
and proved to be more efficient than old-style accounting [6].

The electronic currencies mentioned previously have the following common property:

someone named Satoshi Nakomoto [1]. The real identity of that person is not known.

 </li><li itemprop="text">money being spent was not spent before (also known as double-spending). Bitcoin, on
the other hand, makes all transactions public, so that everybody is aware of all
transactions and is able to verify the chain of ownership and the non-existence of
double-spending attempts. This idea, as a theoretical concept, was first described in
Wei Dai's essay &quot;B-money&quot; [9].
Bitcoin relies on a peer-to-peer overlay network, built on top of the Internet, commonly
referred to as Bitcoin network. This peer-to-peer overlay network is a special kind of
network which differs a lot from how computer networks are usually constructed.
Overlay network is “an application layer virtual or logical network in which end
points are addressable and that provides connectivity, routing, and messaging between
end points” [43]. Bitcoin network provides a communication channel to broadcast
transactions and send other information between users (nodes). As of November
2013, there are approximately 18000 nodes in the network even though the number
varies with time [10]. Typically, Bitcoin nodes connect to 10-100 other nodes
simultaneously.

Bitcoin's unique feature is the method for accepting/denying transactions and agreeing
on a single history of transactions by the network. Due to propagation delays and
connectivity issues, it is impossible to make everyone aware of all transactions at all
times, and this can be abused by double-spending the money. Someone could spend the
same money twice before the first transaction propagates far enough, so there must
be a way to determine which transaction is valid.
One obvious solution is to make those transactions that most people agree with valid.
On the Internet people are represented by the software applications they are running
and their respective IP addresses. If the validity of a transaction were determined by

Page 22

 </li><li itemprop="text">the majority of nodes, i.e. the majority of IP addresses, the system could be cheated
by someone able to allocate many IPs. That is why Bitcoin uses a different way of
determining transaction validity. This technology is called proof-of-work and was
originally suggested in Adam Back's Hashcash [11] as a measure to prevent email
spam.
Proof of Work
We provide a brief explanation of the principle of proof-of-work. For many
cryptographic hash functions, the number of attempts to find an input whose hash
begins with a certain substring can be probabilistically estimated, since the most
efficient way to search for such an input is to brute-force by trying consecutive inputs
[11]. An input that produces a hash with a certain leading substring is also called
&quot;partial hash collision&quot;, and the process of finding suitable input is called mining [12].
For example, if we need a certain 32-bit long leading substring in the binary
representation of the hash, the expected number of inputs that we need to try is 232,
which is more than 4 billion. In Bitcoin, finding partial hash collisions serves as a
proof that a certain amount of computation has been performed, this is why it is called
proof-of-work.
Proof-of-work is used in Bitcoin for two purposes: the first is that proof-of-work is a
means of “voting” about transaction history, where the more work one performs, the
more voting power one has. The second purpose is the creation of money. Wei Dai
writes:
Finding partial hash collisions exactly fits this definition: it is easy to determine
how much computing effort it took to find a given collision, and the collision does not
have any other value. In Bitcoin, when a partial hash collision is found, it serves as a

Page 23

 </li><li itemprop="text">“vote” for certain transactions to be included in the history and provides a reward for
the miner (participant engaged in Bitcoin mining).
Another important concept of Bitcoin is that every proof-of-work is based on some
previous proof-of-work. This is implemented by including the hash from the previous
proof-of-work into the input of the current proof-of-work, thus forming a chain, as
shown in Figure 2. Input data for computing proof-of-work is combined into blocks,
and all blocks together form a block chain.

Figure 2. Chain of blocks [1]
As each block includes the hash of some previous block, we say that each block is built
on top of some previous block and extends it. The “voting” happens when miners
choose the block they wish to extend. Choosing a certain block implies agreement with
all transactions in that block and all previous blocks relative to that block. If a group of
miners works on a different block than others, the block chain may diverge, resulting in
two or more competing sub-chains. The chain in which more computing power is
invested will eventually become longer, and other Bitcoin nodes will prefer the longest
sub-chain, discarding all other sub-chains [1]. As a result, the block chain includes only
those transactions that the majority of processing power agrees with. In Figure 3, an
example of chain divergence is shown, but the black chain is the longest and is
preferred by Bitcoin nodes.

 </li><li itemprop="text">Figure 3. Block chain diverges, black
chain wins
The block chain should not be confused with the coins themselves, which are chains of
digital signatures. The block chain interconnects blocks, whereas chains of digital
signatures interconnect transactions.
If a node follows the above rules, we consider it to be honest. An important condition
which must be held for successful operation of Bitcoin network is that honest nodes
altogether always have more processing power than any attacker, and no attacker (or
cooperating group of attackers) is able outperform all honest nodes together. While this
condition is held, an honest block chain will always be longer than any of the attackers’
chains, and will be preferred by other Bitcoin nodes [1].

 </li><li itemprop="text">Bitcoin Implementation Details

Though describing all implementation details of Bitcoin is beyond the scope of this
thesis, some details should be examined to understand the features of Bitcoin clients.
Every block consists of a block header and the actual content, i. e. transactions. The
block header contains the following information:
Table 1. Block header structure
Field

Version

Previous hash

Merkle root

Timestamp

Bits

Nonce

Bytes

4

32

32

Version is the same in all blocks
Previous hash – hash of the previous block header
Merkle root – hash which verifies the integrity of transactions in the block.
Timestamp – time when block was generated, as a UNIX timestamp (number
of seconds passed since 01.01.1970 00:00:00 UTC)
Bits – compact representation of the target, which designates the difficulty
required for proof-of-work (1)
Nonce – value to be changed when mining in order to find partial hash
collision.

Page 26

 </li><li itemprop="text">Instead of storing transactions themselves in the block header, only the Merkle root is
put there, which is the root hash of the Merkle tree computed from all the
transactions to be included in the block. Merkle tree is generated by the following
procedure. First, hashes of transactions are calculated. Then, these hashes are put
pair wise and hashed again, producing a new, smaller set of hashes. This step is
repeated multiple times until only one hash remains. Finally, this hash, which is
called root hash, or Merkle root, is put into the block header. The exact procedure for
calculating the Merkle tree can be found in the source code of Bitcoin clients [13].
As a result, every block header has a fixed size of 80 bytes, and a possibility
exists to verify transactions without having the full block chain, but only the headers.
Figure 4 illustrates the structure of the actual block #183301 of the Bitcoin block chain.
Only five transactions are shown for simplicity,

though the actual number of

transactions is 432. Tx1 to Tx5 are transactions, H1 to H5 are hashes of transactions,
Hash12, Hash34, Hash55 and Hash1234 are hashes of previous hashes. The previous
block hash starts with 13 zeros in hexadecimal representation, which means 52 zeros
in binary representation. Finding this proof-of-work requires 252 attempts on average.

Since it is impractical to transfer individual monetary units (&quot;coins&quot;) separately, Bitcoin
provides a way to split and merge &quot;coins&quot; in transactions. Each transaction has &quot;inputs&quot;
and &quot;outputs&quot;, where each output identifies the address of the receiver of coins and the
amount received by him/her, and each input provides a reference to an earlier output
that is being spent and a digital signature of the payer with the corresponding public
key. An address in Bitcoin is a hash of the address owner’s public key. When verifying
a transaction, the actual public key found in the input is hashed and compared to the
address specified in the referenced earlier output. There are also &quot;generation
transactions&quot;,

which give a reward to someone who finds a block,

and these

transactions have empty input. The digital signature algorithm used to sign transactions
is ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), which has several advantages

Full clients are the ones which implement the full Bitcoin protocol and hold a full copy
of the block chain. This includes discovering and communicating with other nodes,
sending and receiving transactions and blocks, saving all valid blocks locally,
verifying all transactions received and broadcasting all legitimate transactions. In
addition to those, full Bitcoin clients also provide services for the user. These services
are: storing one's transaction history, private keys for the &quot;wallet&quot; and providing a
Graphical User Interface (GUI), command-line interface or an Application
Programming Interface (API) for viewing current balance, transaction history and
initiating new transactions.

Full Clients
Some examples of full Bitcoin clients are: Original Bitcoin client [16], Armory [36],
and Libbitcoin [37]. We will look more closely at the operation of the Original Bitcoin
client, also known as the Satoshi client. When Bitcoin was initially created, it was the
only software that could be used for dealing with Bitcoin, hence the name. The Satoshi
client keeps the block chain, nodes’ addresses and the wallet file in the client’s data
folder. The wallet file contains the wallet owner's transaction history, address book and

Starting from version 0.4.0 the Satoshi client has a wallet encryption feature.
Since the early days of Bitcoin, and until version 0.3.22, the original client had a
mining capability [17], which was removed because specialized mining clients are
much more efficient. Figure 5 shows the interface of the Satoshi client. The overview
screen has information about the current balance and most recent transactions. A
transaction is said to be unconfirmed if it was sent but not included in a block yet.

0.5.0

Using a full Bitcoin client has some drawbacks. One of them is excessive network and
file system usage: a full client has to have a full copy of the block chain locally, which
occupies 2 gigabytes as of November 2013 and which will only grow in the future.

 </li><li itemprop="text">Full clients have to be aware of all transactions, so they receive and send transactions
and blocks all the time and consume network bandwidth.
On the other hand, operating a full client makes the Bitcoin network stronger and more
difficult to attack.

Headers Only Clients
For some users it may be difficult to store block chain data on their devices. For
example, on mobile phones. Fortunately for such users, there are headers-only clients
which don’t require that much storage space. BitcoinJ software library [18] and clients
based on it (e. g. Multibit [38]) do not download and store the full block chain but
only the block headers, which occupy only 14 megabytes as of November 2013 and
could be kept in memory even on mobile devices [18]. BitcoinJ downloads full blocks
only sometimes, when it expects incoming transactions and when it searches the
block chain for keys that are in the wallet. Even though headers-only clients are not
able to verify transactions against the full block chain, they are not less secure than
full clients if some of these precautions are taken:
• Waiting for multiple blocks (usually 6) before considering the payment complete
• Receiving a copy of the transaction in question from a node trusted to be
running a full Bitcoin client
• Receiving the transaction in question from multiple nodes [19]

 </li><li itemprop="text">Signing-only Clients
BitcoinJ author Mike Hearn suggests a procedure for proving inclusion of a transaction
in a block without having to download the whole block, but only the transaction
itself and the corresponding Merkle branch [19]. Having this information is enough to
verify that the transaction was included in a particular block. This procedure is known
as Simplified Payment Verification and was also described in the original Bitcoin paper
[1]. Using this procedure can save a lot of bandwidth and provide even greater security,
but unfortunately, it has not been implemented in either BitcoinJ or any of the full
clients.
The name signing-only clients means that they only sign transactions, but do not
deal with block chain or even block headers. Instead, these clients request data about
certain transactions from the server. If a transaction happens in the Bitcoin network that
involves one of the connected clients’ wallets, the server may also push such
information to a particular client that is interested in it. Signing-only clients send
out only their own transactions. Consequently, the overhead of running such a client
is much lower than that of full or headers-only clients, as the file system is used only
for our own keys and transactions, and we only send and receive transactions that
concern us.

 </li><li itemprop="text">Signing-only clients do not require much storage, network bandwidth and computing
power, and therefore can be implemented in various ways: as a desktop application
(Electrum [20]), mobile application (BitcoinSpinner [21]) or as a Web application
(BlockChain.info [22]). In Web-based signing-only clients, cryptographic features are
implemented in JavaScript and are executed in the Web browser, so the private keys of
the wallet are never sent to servers unencrypted. A certain level of trust is required in
the server we are connecting to, because the server will know all our transaction
history, and it is possible for the server operators to send us false transactions and trick
us into thinking that we have more or less money than we actually do. This kind of
attack is not dangerous and is not profitable for the server operators, because it is not
possible for them to trick us into signing transactions against our will. In addition, this
attack can be mitigated by connecting to multiple servers or to our own server, which
can be set up with open-source software [20, 23].

 </li><li itemprop="text">Thin Bitcoin Clients
Thin Bitcoin clients (also called eWallets or browser-based wallets) are the ones which
do not hold private keys and do not sign transactions themselves. Instead, they send
commands to a remote server to perform these operations. The remote server acts in a
similar way to a bank, providing financial services to customers. The most important
advantage of thin clients over other types of clients is that the user does not have to
worry about backing up private keys and keeping them safe at the same time, as these
operations are performed on server-side on behalf of thin clients. Another benefit is that
thin clients are the easiest to set up: one only needs to visit the eWallet website and set
up an account. It takes about one minute.

Some examples of thin Bitcoin clients are: MyBitcoin (Now defunct) [24],
Instawallet ( N o w D e f u n c t ) [25], and MtGox [26].
Instawallet did not even require registration. When visiting the page for the first time, a
new account is created automatically [25]. Figure 7 is a screenshot of Instawallet’s
transaction creation dialogue, which is very simple and straightforward.

The high usability of thin Bitcoin clients does not come without a price. Ultimate trust
is required in the eWallet provider, since it not only knows the users’ transaction
history, but also has control over the users’ money. There is no obvious way to ensure
that the provider has the amount shown as the balance is backed by actual Bitcoins
stored in reserve. Finally, the provider can become a victim of loss or theft of Bitcoins,
or of a malicious takeover, which can result in a loss of customers’ funds. This has
happened to multiple wallets including Instawallet.

 </li><li itemprop="text">Bitcoin Mining Clients
Bitcoin mining clients, or simply miners, are specialized clients that are not used to
send or receive Bitcoins. Their only usage is mining. Initially, the only mining client
was the original Bitcoin client, which implemented mining on a CPU (Central
Processing Unit, I.E. the processor in your computer). As time went on, more people
learned about Bitcoin and became involved in mining. This, by design, raised the
difficulty level of mining.
At the end of 2010 the difficulty of finding blocks rose to such levels that it would
take 1 year on average to generate a block and get the 50 bitcoins reward if mining is
done on a single computer with the original client [28]. This was due to the fact that
specialized mining clients were created to perform mining on graphics card’s GPU
(Graphicval Processing Unit, typically used by gamers), and these clients turned out to
be 100 times more efficient than the original Bitcoin client, which still used CPU
mining [27]. As a result, the built-in mining capability of the original client became
obsolete and was removed in June 2011 [17]. GPU still remains to be the most popular
mining hardware [27] A GPU can be used not only for mining, but also for playing
games and using other software applications that require a lot of computational
resources. Some examples of Bitcoin mining clients that implement GPU mining are:
Phoenix [39], CGMiner [40].

Even with a GPU, it took a few days on average to generate a block and get a reward.
If someone was unlucky, he would not get a reward for weeks, because the rewards
were too volatile. On 27th of November, 2010 forum member Slush suggested pooled
mining (initially it was called cooperative mining) to combine the power of

Page 37

 </li><li itemprop="text">multiple miners to work on the same block [28]. Instead of getting a large reward once
in a long time, miners started to get smaller rewards more frequently. Pooled mining
became very popular and now accounts for more than a half of all Bitcoin mining [29].

Backing Up Wallets
Some Bitcoin clients, including the Satoshi client and Multibit, generate cryptographic
keys randomly. After initialization, the Satoshi client generates the wallet file with 100
keypairs in it [30], which correspond to 100 Bitcoin addresses. Since it is encouraged to
use a different address for every payment, 100 addresses will be used up quickly. If
that happens, the Satoshi client generates new keys when necessary. This way of
operation makes backing up the wallet difficult. To ensure that all keys are safe, we
need to do the backup after every transaction. If such backup is not done, a loss of the
original wallet will result in a loss of Bitcoins belonging to the newly-generated
address. The Satoshi client does not have any built-in backup functionality, and
implementing frequent and secure backups is not an easy task for those not involved in
IT.
Deterministic Wallets
Fortunately, deterministic wallets provide a solution to this problem.
Some of the Bitcoin clients, for example, Electrum and Armory, generate keypairs and,
consequently, addresses deterministically. Deterministic generation means that any
number of cryptographic keys is generated from a relatively small seed. A known
deterministic algorithm produces a keypair from two arguments: seed and a sequence
number. If the same seed and number are later supplied to that algorithm, it will always
© www.bitriches.com 2014

The Ultimate Guide to Bitcoin

Author: Farm Boy

Page 38

 </li><li itemprop="text">produce the same keypair [31]. As a result, when using a client with a deterministic
wallet, we only need to backup the seed, and it has to be done only once. If we have to
restore the wallet later, we will supply the seed to the client, and the client will restore
all keys from the seed and the history of transactions from the block chain [20].
Brain Wallets
The concept of a brainwallet is closely related to deterministic wallets. At the current
level of computing technology, randomly-generated numbers of 128 bits “can
guarantee uniqueness across space and time” [32]. After generating a random number
of 128 bits we can be sure that no one else in the universe is able to generate the same
number independently. This number can be used as a seed for a deterministic wallet. At
the same time, we can also convert this number to a human-readable form and
memorize it. 128 bits can be represented as 128 zeros and ones, or as 32 hexadecimal
characters, or as 24 characters in Base64 encoding [33].
However, the most efficient way of memorizing a random number is to convert it to a
mnemonic code. We choose a list of common English words and agree that each word
represents a certain sequence of bits. By using this method, a 128 bit number can be
represented by 12 English words, which are easy to memorize.
Someone may put some money in a deterministic wallet, remember the seed and
remove the original wallet from the hard drive.

After these actions have been

performed, it is not possible to recover the keys and the money in any way other than
to generate the keys from the seed. As the seed does not exist on any physical media,
the information on how to access the money is now in the person’s mind (brain) and
nowhere else. The wallet becomes a brainwallet.

 </li><li itemprop="text">Malware and Bitcoin
The threat of malicious software is very prominent nowadays, and any computer can
be compromised by viruses, Trojan horses and other types of malware. After Bitcoin
became more valuable, cybercriminals created malware that steals the wallet.dat file,
which holds the private keys for the Satoshi client [34]. Possession of this file enables
the attacker to steal all Bitcoins from the addresses in the wallet. If the wallet file is
backed up to some location which later becomes accessible by an attacker, it is also
possible for him to steal the money.

To mitigate these threats, original Bitcoin client developers introduced wallet
encryption in version 0.4.0 [35]. Other clients implemented a similar feature. Users
may choose a passphrase, which encrypts the private keys in the wallet, and
unencrypted private keys are never written to disk. Figure 11 shows the interface for
setting a passphrase in the Satoshi client. If an attacker gains access to an encrypted
wallet, it is not possible for them to steal any money from it, assuming the passphrase
is not compromised. On the other hand, it is still possible for malware to steal the
money, if the malware runs on the same computer and under the same privileges as the
Bitcoin client itself.

For merchants, both online and offline, who accept payments from the public, it may be
dangerous to keep the wallet with the private keys on a computer that is exposed to the
public, such as an Internet server or a computer in a shop. Such computers can
become targets of cybercriminals and, if they succeed in infecting these computers with
malware, the merchants may have their funds stolen. Publicly exposed computers are
more vulnerable to malware infestations than other machines which are not publicly

 </li><li itemprop="text">known. Fortunately for merchants, the Bitcoin protocol provides a possibility to accept
and track payments without having access to private keys.
Watch Only Wallets
The Armory client [36], the Electrum client [31] and some Web-based services such as
BitcoinMonitor (now defunct) [41] provide watch-only wallets. These wallets have
neither private keys nor any information, such as a seed, on how to obtain them.
Instead, watch-only wallets have only the public keys and the corresponding Bitcoin
addresses. This information is enough to watch the block chain for transactions
involving given addresses, but not enough to initiate transactions with them.
Consequently, if an attacker gains access to a computer running a watch-only wallet,
they will not be able to steal any money. The only useful information an attacker will
learn is that certain addresses belong to the same person.

Watch-only wallets can be either randomly-generated or deterministic.
The implementation of randomly-generated watch-only wallets is relatively
straightforward: the block chain is watched for given addresses. The drawback here is
that we need to either store a large reserve of public keys or send new public keys
when they are needed.
The digital signature algorithm used in Bitcoin, the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
Algorithm, provides a possibility to generate an infinite number of public keys
deterministically from a master public key, which in turn is derived from the seed [42].
Merchants can use the following procedure. First, a seed is generated and stored on a
© www.bitriches.com 2014

The Ultimate Guide to Bitcoin

Author: Farm Boy

Page 41

 </li><li itemprop="text">private, secure computer. A master public key is derived from the seed and copied to
the public-facing computer. The Bitcoin client on the public-facing computer uses the
master public key to generate new addresses when they are needed. After an address is
given to a customer for making a payment, the block chain is watched for transactions
involving this address. If the public-facing computer is compromised, no money will
be stolen because no private keys can be derived from the master public key [42].
Paper Wallets
There may be reasons to make a backup copy of a Bitcoin wallet not on digital media,
but on plain paper instead. Some Bitcoin users prefer to keep their long-term savings
on paper to ensure greater security. If the Bitcoin client uses a deterministic wallet, the
seed can be printed on paper and put into a safe place. The Armory client [36] is the
only one that has paper backup functionality built-in. Figure 8 shows an example
paper backup made with the Armory client. The QR code is provided for convenience
to avoid having to type letters manually when restoring the wallet from a backup. The
Electrum client doesn’t have a built-in printing feature, but its wallet could also be
easily backed up on paper by printing the seed manually.

Backing up wallets with randomly-generated keys is more complicated. Such wallets
may have hundreds of keypairs which would occupy multiple pages. Restoring from
such a backup would be a long and tedious process. One of the solutions to backing up
non-deterministic wallets is to transfer the money to be backed up to one address and
print out the corresponding private key. Another approach is to transfer the money to a
deterministic wallet and perform the backup as described earlier.

 </li><li itemprop="text">Accepting Bitcoin with QR Codes
There are other uses of papers with QR codes in Bitcoin than backups. Papers with
printed QR codes of Bitcoin addresses can be used to accept payments. A poster with a
Bitcoin address and some text encouraging donations can be put on a wall in a public
place to raise funds. BitcoinSpinner [21] has the ability to scan QR codes with the
phone’s built-in camera and, if the scanned code is a Bitcoin address, send money to it.
You can try it out by sending Bitcoin to the QR code below (Much appreciated!)

A paper with a private key printed on it can be used as a means of payment by itself.
The person receiving the payment can scan the code, sign a transaction by using the
scanned private key and transfer the money to his/her own wallet.

Merchants can show a Bitcoin address as a QR code on a screen to accept payments
from customers at the point of sale. In this setup, a watch-only wallet described is very
useful as it allows confirming the receipt of the money immediately after it is sent
while keeping these Bitcoins inaccessible by anyone at the point of sale.

 </li><li itemprop="text">Bitcoin URI
When using a Web browser, we open new pages and download files by clicking on
links. Every link on the Web has a URI in it, which tells the browser how to access
certain content [46]. Links greatly simplify Web browsing, as entering URIs manually
takes much longer time than clicking. To simplify Bitcoin payments and to avoid
having to type addresses and amounts manually, the Bitcoin URI scheme was
introduced.
As World Wide Web creator Tim Berners-Lee suggested, a URI consists of a scheme
and a path, which are separated by a colon. A path describes the resource itself, and a
scheme denotes the namespace for that resource [46]. There are many URI schemes
nowadays, and the most popular one is HTTP, which is used to access Web pages. In
the recent years, links with the MAGNET URI scheme became a popular way to
identify resources in Bit Torrent network by their hash [47]. In a similar way, the
Bitcoin URI scheme is used to identify addresses and (optional) amounts to be paid.

Several Bitcoin clients, including Electrum [31] and Armory [36] support Bitcoin
URIs and fill in the money sending form with the data from the URI when the link is
clicked on. Mobile clients, such as BitcoinSpinner [21], can recognize Bitcoin
URIs in QR codes and help the user to avoid typing the address and amount manually.

 </li><li itemprop="text">Future enhancements

After the introduction of wallet encryption and watch-only wallets, security of Bitcoin
clients improved dramatically, but still remains to be a valid concern. During 2011 and
the first half of 2012, there have been several large-scale security breaches and heists
whose victims were mining pools, Bitcoin exchanges and their customers [48, 49, 50].
The reasons for these unfortunate events were not only negligence and disregard of
security practices, but also inherent weaknesses in the current Bitcoin protocol.

These weaknesses stem from the fact that the possession of the private key for a certain
address gives ultimate control over all money belonging to that address, and the
private key is always needed for signing transactions. To improve security, we may try
to implement some multi-factor authentication procedure, as was done by
BlockChain.info wallet service: Web-based Bitcoin client requests you to confirm
transactions on a mobile phone [22]. Even though this procedure may improve security,
in the very end, the benefits of any multi-factor authentication procedure are lost when
one of the parties receives the private key to perform signing. If this party is
compromised, all security is lost.

Multi-Signature Transactions for Stronger Security
The solution to overcome these problems is to use multi-signature transactions. These
transactions require multiple signatures to be completed instead of one. We may think
of a multi-signature transaction as a transaction that has more than one recipient
address, and several signatures are needed to spend this money further. Gavin
Andresen, the main developer of Bitcoin, proposed two new types of transactions: 2-of© www.bitriches.com 2014

The Ultimate Guide to Bitcoin

Author: Farm Boy

Page 46

 </li><li itemprop="text">2 and 2-of-3 [51]. In a 2-of-2 transaction, money is sent to 2 addresses, and signatures
from owners of both addresses are needed to spend this money. In a 2-of-3 transaction,
money is sent to 3 addresses, and signatures from any 2 of them are enough to spend
the money. The actual implementation is more sophisticated and is described in [52].
To initiate a multi-signature transaction, money is sent to an address which is a hash of
2 or 3 public keys of receiving parties. This address is recorded in the output part of
the transaction. To spend this transaction later, 2 signatures must be supplied in the
input part of the next transaction.
The process of constructing multi-signature transactions is more complex than normal
transactions and involves negotiation between several parties. The exact procedures are
not defined as of November 2013. In a 2-of-2 transaction, receiving parties need to
collaborate to construct the receiving address. One of the possible procedures may
include exchanging public keys first, creating the receiving address independently and
verifying that the same address was created. When sending this address to the payer,
both receiving parties need to be sure that the same address was sent.

The security of Bitcoin wallets can be greatly improved with the use of 2-of-2
transactions. We may store one of the private keys on a computer and another one on a
mobile phone. After public keys have been exchanged between the computer and the
wallet, we may generate the common receiving address and send money there from a
normal wallet. From this moment, if we want to spend the money on the common
address, we need signatures from both the computer and the phone. If either the
computer or the phone is compromised by an attacker, the money will not be stolen. At
the same time, if either the computer or the phone is lost and we do not have the
backup of the data, the money on the common address will be lost. But, fortunately,
this drawback can be overcome with 2-of-3 transactions.

 </li><li itemprop="text">A third-party service can be used to hold the third private key in a 2-of-3 transaction. In
normal circumstances, we may use the same computer and phone, since 2 signatures
are enough to spend the transaction. If one of the devices breaks, we may ask the
third-party service to sign our transaction. It should be noted that for better security,
any authentication credentials for the third-party service should not be entered on
either the computer or the phone, as they may become compromised together with an
additional private key. Instead, they should be entered on a completely different device.
This procedure ensures both security and availability of Bitcoins in case of a failure.

Bitcoin Escrows
Another application for 2-of-3 transaction is three-party escrow. If the Buyer purchases
certain goods from the Seller, they may choose the Arbiter, trusted by both the Buyer
and the Seller to resolve disputes. Before the shipping of goods, a 2-of-3 transaction is
initiated. The Buyer sends money to the common address constructed from the public
keys of the Buyer, the Seller and the Arbiter. If the purchase runs smoothly and the
Buyer is satisfied, he/she gives the signature to the Seller, who adds his/her own
signature and gets the money. If the Buyer is not satisfied, the Arbiter has to decide
whether the Seller fulfilled the conditions of the purchase. Depending on the Arbiter’s
decision, he/she gives his/her signature to either the Buyer or the Seller.

Multi-signature transactions also have certain drawbacks. They require sophisticated
protocols to be created and occupy a few times more space in the block chain than
normal transactions. Deterministic wallets are not usable

 </li><li itemprop="text">wallet seeds. In these cases, we need to save copies of public keys involved in those
transactions after they happen. This deprives deterministic wallets of their advantages
over randomly-generated ones.
Multi-signature transactions have only been implemented in the original Bitcoin client,
and only in its command-line interface [54]. Even though some proposals for
negotiating multi-signature transactions exist [53], a lot of work needs to be done to
ensure compatibility and correct operation of the protocol.
Scalability
At the current (November 2013) level of 20 000 transactions in Bitcoin network per day
[56], a normal desktop computer is powerful enough to be a full Bitcoin node and to do
all activities associated with it. If the popularity of Bitcoin grows further and the
number of transactions per day increases, at some point normal home computers will
not cope with increased load. A well-known security researcher Dan Kaminsky
criticised Bitcoin for lack of scalability [55]. To make Bitcoin more scalable, several
optimizations have been proposed.

The author of the BitcoinJ client Mike Hearn suggests using the Simplified Payment
Verification procedure, which allows clients to perform verification of transactions
without having a full copy of the block chain [19]. Implementing this procedure may
significantly decrease the amount of disk space required for full clients to operate.
Another way to improve storage efficiency is to remove all transactions that are already
spent from the block chain. It has been calculated that doing so reduces the size of the
block chain by 71 percent [57].

 </li><li itemprop="text">Conclusion (From a
Computer Science position)

Even though Dan Kaminsky characterized Bitcoin as “a really strange use of
cryptography” [55], it serves its purpose quite well. Creating an account is as easy as
installing a software application. Sending and receiving payments is simple and does
not require submitting any documents anywhere. The Bitcoin network is very
reliable and as of November 2013 has had only one major disruption since its inception
in 2009.

The growth rate of the Bitcoin ecosystem and the underlying technology is tremendous.
Bitcoin was first described in 2008 and started operating in 2009. During 2010, GPU
mining clients were being developed, and miners gradually switched from CPU
mining to GPU mining. In the late 2010, pooled mining was introduced and quickly
became the dominant form of mining. After Bitcoin was featured in mass media in
2011, the Bitcoin community and the price of Bitcoins started growing even faster.
Unfortunately, the sudden growth of Bitcoin’s popularity led to a series of robberies
and data leaks. These severely impacted the public’s trust in Bitcoin and the price of it.
One of the reasons for these events was a lack of security features in Bitcoin clients. In
the beginning of 2011 wallet encryption and watch-only wallets did not exist.
However, a lot of talented software developers joined the Bitcoin community in 2011..
Some technologies, such as proof-of-work and deterministic generation of public keys,
were used on a large scale for the first time in Bitcoin clients.

Wallet encryption, watch-only wallets and paper backups enhance security of Bitcoin

Bitcoin is still in its infancy, and its impact on the world’s economics is negligible. We
expect both the economics and the technology behind Bitcoin to evolve and expand.
Multi-signature transactions, when they are implemented, will provide a vast array of
innovative usages of this currency. Since Bitcoin ecosystem develops so fast, it is
impossible to predict what will happen to it in the next year. We are looking forward to

Perspective

What is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is an experimental decentralized digital currency used as a mode of instant
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world by using peer-to-peer technology without
any central authority. Managing transactions and issuing money are carried out
collectively by the network.
Bitcoin is referred as a crypto-currency because it is decentralized and uses
cryptography to secure and control the transactions and prevent double-spending (a
problem for digital currencies).
Brief history of Bitcoin
Bitcoin is the first achievement of a concept called &quot;crypto-currency&quot;, which was first
described in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list. He suggested the idea of
a new form of money that uses cryptography to control its creation and transactions
rather than a central authority. The first Bitcoin specification and proof of concept was
published in 2009 in a cryptography mailing list by Satoshi Nakamoto.

mobile device based, paper based, or even stored in the owners mind. Some issuers have
even created physical coin based bitcoins. Be cautios when purchasing these as they can
be based upon a given hashtag which actually carries the bitcoin or they can be simply a
representation of a bitcoin stored elsewhere. The latter depends upon the credibility of
the issuer.
Block Chain:
All transactions are routed through block chain (basically ledger of transactions). It is a
share public ledger and everyone of Bitcoin network relies on this block chain. There are
copies of the blockchain (ledger) spread out across the entire network. This large
number of copies is what makes the ledger safe from hacking. A hacked copy would
simply be disregarded by the network if it did not match the other copies.
To compromise the network a hacker would need to have under his control enough
computing power to affect more than half of the network. As of November 2013 the
computing power of the network is 64 exaFlops. To put that in perspective, the
combined computing power of the worlds top 500 supercomputers is .25 exaflops. So
the bitcoin network is approximately 256 times more powerful than the combined power
of the worlds top 500 supercomputers.
This creates a great deal of assurance that the ledger can not be maliciously attacked.

 </li><li itemprop="text">Encryption Techniques
For security and integrity, Bitcoin uses encryption techniques. When Bitcoin address is
created, a cryptographic key pair generated having a public key and a private key.
Private Key
In block chain each transactions is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets. A secret
piece of data which is used to authenticate or sign the transactions is called a private
key. This encryption prevents the transaction from being altered once it has been issued.
All transactions are displayed publicly among users. The network will confirm
transaction across nodes. Confirmation across the network generally takes about 10
minutes. Transactions offering higher transaction fees will generally be confirmed first.
Mining
It is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm the transaction. For
protecting the neutrally of network, mining enforces chronological order in the block
chain.
Explanation of mining
Similar to gold, Bitcoins are made by mining. But gold is mined from the ground by
bulldozers, while Bitcoins are mined by computers solving complex mathematical
equations. Each time you get a correct answer, you unlock a coin which can then enter
the Bitcoin economy.
You can install Bitcoin mining software which uses your computer's processing power
to carry out intensive calculations. Many people might be working on the same unit of
work. Work is a computationally complicated problem. The aim is to find a certain
sequence of data, called a &quot;block”, which produces a particular pattern when the Bitcoin
&quot;hash&quot; algorithm is applied to the data. The miner that manages to do that will win
bitcoins.
When it started out, it was relatively easy to mine bitcoins, but as the network of people
increases, it's become computationally much more challenging. CPU mining gave way
to GPU mining. GPU mining has since given way to Asic mining (Application Specific

 </li><li itemprop="text">Integrated Circuit). Currently Asic Miners are typically on back order. For this reason it
is not uncommon for brand new machines to sell on ebay at costs 30% or higher than the
retail cost of the machine.
Bitcoin resembles with the development phase that TCP/IP was back then. Instead of IP
addresses and websites, Bitcoin has unique strings that represent money and a
mechanism is defined to send these strings securely and safely wherever you want. It is a
protocol that is allowing money to flow around the world much like TCP/IP allows
information to flow.
At the time of this writing there are slightly more than 12 million Bitcoins in existence
today. That number will continue to rise as more are mined. However over time mining
becomes more difficult and the total number will cap out at 21 million bitcoins.

How to Buy / Get Bitcoin?
How to acquire bitcoins is one of the most commonly asked questions by new users of
Bitcoin. Although the process may seem confusing at first it is not as difficult as it might
appear initially.
1. Create a wallet - A bitcoin wallet is website / program though which you
can store bitcoins and make transactions. This website offers a free wallet
service, sign up takes a few seconds and all you need is a password.
2. Locate Your Address - When you created a bitcoin wallet login and click
receive money / coins. This page will have a &quot;bitcoin address&quot; which is 34 36 character long and starts with 1. This address is all you need to receive
payments.
3. Buy With Cash - There are various ways to buy bitcoins with cash. There
are local exchanges where you can meet someone and exchange cash for
bitcoin. There are online equivalents of the same thing. Many online
wallets offer or are tied to exchanges.
4. Bitcoin Exchange - A Bitcoin exchange is a place where people buy and
sell bitcoins for other currencies.
5. Through Mining - Earn Bitcoin through competitive mining.

 </li><li itemprop="text">Why Invest in Bitcoin
When an investor wants to invest his/her money, he / she anticipates the expected return
of his/her investment along with considering the risk associated with investment. The
more risk, the more an investor should expect to gain. Here we discuss the benefits of
bitcoins as well as risks attached with Bitcoin for making an investment decision.
Investment Benefits of Bitcoin
Low Risk of Collapse:
Regular currencies occasionally fail as they are dependent on governments. These types
of events can occur due to hyperinflation or a complete collapse of a currency. This
catastrophic event can devastate the savings of a people. On the other hand Bitcoin is not
regulated by any government. It's a virtual global currency that has low risk of collapse.
Low fees:
Bitcoin payments are processed with either no fees or extremely small fees. Priority
processing of transactions requires small fees. Offering a fee results in faster
confirmation of transactions by the network.
Additionally, merchant processors exist to assist merchants in processing transactions.
These processors convert bitcoins to fiat currency and deposit funds directly into
merchants' bank accounts daily. These services, processing of transactions, converting
bitcoins to fiat currency and depositing funds directly into merchants' bank accounts are
typically offered fat much lower fees than with PayPal or credit card networks.
Safe and simple:
From a seller’s point of view traditional online transactions through Credit cards, PayPal
and other online payment systems allow buyers to claim their money back. But with
Bitcoin, buyers cannot take the money back (chargeback). The seller can safely ship the
product or perform the service that the client purchased.
From the buyer's point of view, sending money between accounts is simpler and cheaper
because it is peer-to-peer rather than done through some intermediary.

 </li><li itemprop="text">Freedom to make payments:
You can send and receive any amount of money anywhere in the world at any time.
There is no bank holidays, no borders, no limits imposed on transactions. You have full
control of your money any time and anywhere.
Low inflation risk:
One of the major problems associated with traditional currencies is inflation. With
inflation the currencies lose purchasing power due to printing of more money by the
government. You don't have this problem with bitcoins because the system is designed
in such a way that Bitcoins are finite. Only 21 million Bitcoins will ever be released
(mined). The release of new Bitcoins is slowing down and it will stop completely within
a few decades.
Ease to carry:
You can’t carry a billion dollars cash or gold but you can carry a billion dollars worth of
Bitcoins on a memory stick in your pocket. Or in your mind for that matter. So it is not
only easy to carry but also nearly impossible to prevent movement of it.
Neutral, transparent and predictable:
All information regarding Bitcoin is available on Block Chain for anybody to verify and
use in real time. It is cryptographically secure, no individual or organization can
control / manipulate the Bitcoin protocol. So the bitcoins are neutral, transparent and
predictable.
Low risk for merchants:
Bitcoin transactions are secure and untraceable as these transactions do not contain
customers’ information. This feature of Bitcoin protects merchants from losses caused
by fraud or fraudulent chargebacks. New markets can be expanded where credit cards
are not available or fraud rates are unacceptably high.

 </li><li itemprop="text">Investment Risks / Disadvantage of Bitcoin
Volatility:
The price of Bitcoin is currently very volatile; the prices are currently rising at amazing
rates. Currently the price is going up so fast a shop have to adjust their prices almost
daily to accept Bitcoins. Expect the currency to vary wildly in value. Currently
governments are making major decisions around bitcoin regulation. While regulating
bitcoin itself is nearly impossible, governments can regulate it's citizens ability to
convert their currency into bitcoin. These wild fluctuations are to be expected until
bitcoin becomes more of a currency than an investment. Keep in mind that reacting to
the market is a signal that bitcoin is a true investment medium.
This is one of the major risks associated with Bitcoin as at one moment you may be a
millionaire while a short time later you have nothing in your pocket. And of course the
opposite is true. Stories abound of extreme wealth made through bitcoin. In one case a
forgotten $27 investment turned into over a million USD.
Untraceable:
Bitcoin transactions don’t contain the users identity. This feature of Bitcoin attracts
crime. People can buy and sell drugs and other illegal items, It is very difficult for
authorities to trace these people.
Low Acceptance:
Bitcoin is not yet any where near mainstream acceptance. Although acceptance of
Bitcoin is improving day by day the numbers are still comparatively very small. At the
time of this writing (December 2013) the total value of all Bitcoin in circulation is just
under 8 Billion USD. This number can vary wildy. Greater acceptance still needs to
happen in order to get benefit from network effects.
Risk of Loss:
If you lose Bitcoin you lose it for good. There is no mechanism or technique to recover
lost / stolen Bitcoins. If somebody hacks your wallet where you store Bitcoin they are
gone forever. They are not like a credit card. If a credit card is lost or stolen, there is a
good chance that you will not lose any money as your bank will cover the stolen money.
There are very secure methods of storage and you must be prudent and use them when
dealing with large sums of money.

 </li><li itemprop="text">Developing Phase:
Bitcoin is only a few years old. We don’t have decades of history to look at. Therefore,
it is still in the process of maturing. New tools, features and services are being
developed to make Bitcoin more secure and accessible to users. Some of these features
are still not ready for mass consumption. Most Bitcoin businesses are very new and do
not offer any insurance.
Difficult to trade:
Buying and selling of bitcoins has restrictions in some countries. In the US exchanges
fall under money exchange laws which can make them difficult to operate. At the time
of this writing China has banned it's conversions of it's currency into Bitcoin.
However due to the portability of Bitcoin most people can use exchanges anywhere in
the world. So when one country regulates it's exchanges the services can be found
elsewhere. Of course it is possible for governments to establish laws which make it
completely illegal to trade in Bitcoin but these laws would be very difficult to enforce.
Due to regulations it can be difficult to exchange bitcoin from popular services such as
paypal. There are many startups around bitcoin exchange and we expect to see a large
number of offerings with various security features as time goes on.
Factors affect the value of Bitcoin:
The value of Bitcoin is considered as unpredictable as it rate of change is extreme. It has
seen one month 600$ climbs and 50% drops overnight. It's highly volatile nature must
be considered. While investing in Bitcoin we must know the following factors that affect
the value of Bitcoin:
i.

Supply of Bitcoin:

Like other conventional currencies, Bitcoin also follows the law of supply and demand.
Supply of Bitcoins has been controlled as number of Bitcoins in existence will never
exceed 21 million. Owing to this limited supply there have been speculations that its
price will increase dramatically over time.

Page 59

 </li><li itemprop="text">ii.

Demand of people:

There is positive relationship between demand of people and value of Bitcoin. If more
and more people utilize Bitcoin, the demand will rise and its value also increases
because of limited supply. Obviously the value of Bitcoins will decrease with decrease
of demand of people due to negative speculations, regulations, and uncertainty. Recent
drastic drops in value were prompted by strong regulations enacted by China.
iii.

Transferability:

As far as the transferability is concerned the Bitcoin is better than physical currency.
Value can be transferred anywhere there is internet.. So this factor will increase its
demand and value.
iv.

Acceptance:

Bitcoin is not good as far as acceptance is concerned as many feel reluctant to use it as
medium of exchange. However acceptance is growing daily and very large well known
companies now accept bitcoin as payment.
v.

Cost:

Storage and transfer costs are involved in physical currency while Bitcoin is free or very
low cost. This factor has increased its demand.
vi.

Stability of the network:

The stability of Bitcoin network is one of the major concerns. Some claim it is merely an
economic bubble and it has no inherit value. If majority of people stopped using the
bitcoins then this bubble will burst and its value will reduce to zero. But Bitcoin network
has existed for over four years. This run has improved confidence in the security of the
network.
Recommendation
Opinions on the stability of bitcoin are extremely polarized. Some claim it to be a
temporary phenomena. Others claim it to be the future of money. The benefits and risks
associated with Bitcoin must be assessed by the individual investor. We recommend
investors to be vigilant while making any investment in Bitcoin. Fortunes could be made
or lost.
