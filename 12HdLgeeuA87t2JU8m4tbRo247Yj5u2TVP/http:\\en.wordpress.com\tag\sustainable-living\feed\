<p>In this video Luke Rudkowski talks to Eco Designer João Tomaz in Lisbon Portugal. João realized good environmental design must have a stronger role in today&#8217;s society. His work is studying and developing eco design objects and structures for the last 10 years and was soon recognized as a unique eye when it came to the new and the innovative. He is currently inventing a platform to combine his love for eco design, sustainability and Mother Earth!</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a note that some of us had written some years ago, kind of sharing it again to set the context on why, what and how of healthy food. We used to share it at the Organic Collective with Guru, Vanaja and Shirish in Pune, where we used to do workshops at people’s homes.<br />
<a href="https://courageouscommunication.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/564256_579187492092598_1178923807_n.jpg"><img src="http://courageouscommunication.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/564256_579187492092598_1178923807_n.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="564256_579187492092598_1178923807_n" width="300" height="200" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-585" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Conscious Kitchen</strong></p>
<p>You are what you eat. The carrot that you just ate will soon become a part of your heart, your brain, your emotions and YOU. Our Body is a temple which houses our soul, and nutrition is a delicate process wherein one life form transforms into another. So the carrot becomes you. Only a living form can give nutrition to another living form. Our attempt in this food is to keep it alive and wholesome. For this reason, we go for the least treatment, processing and cooking of food. </p>
<p><strong>Why Raw and Steamed? </strong><br />
Enzymes are present in food, and they are very important for triggering off the digestion process. So food is best when raw. For warm food, instead of boiling, we steam veggies. It’s too much for the enzymes and vitamins to withstand the temperatures of boiling.  In the end, then the food is half dead. When the body receives half-dead food, it sees it at as toxins and intends to throw it out. Worse, the body has to work more to produce the enzymes for the digestion process. The enzymes for digesting a particular food are partly available in the raw form but we destroy them with cooking. So lets try to save enzymes in our food.<br />

RAMBUTAN AND TREE TOMATO FROM BELIPOLA(<a href="http://www.belipola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.belipola.com/</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Why not sugar and instead gur or dry fruits as sweeteners? </strong>Processed sugar raises our blood sugar level to abnormal heights, so the body has to release insulin to neutralize it. It also uses some vitamins, especially thiamine which helps cool our nerves. A lack of these vitamins causes anxiety and a manic sugar rush. It is said that the body can make glucose (which is body fuel) out of almost everything that we eat except sugar. We use Organic Gur which goes through much less processing than sugar and is rich in minerals. Even dates can be made into a syrup and used as a sweetener.<a href="http://courageouscommunication.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/5556_579774502033897_288857256_n.jpg"><img src="http://courageouscommunication.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/5556_579774502033897_288857256_n.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="5556_579774502033897_288857256_n" width="300" height="200" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-578" /></a><br />
<strong>Dessert with Sweet Potato, Jaggery, Coconut Milk and Cinnamon. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Millets in place of wheat</strong>. Earlier, we ate many diverse grains, but now we are consuming more and more wheat, as the government has been promoting it in a big way over the last 50 years. Wheat, however, contains Gluten, a protein which gives the grain a peculiar stickiness and makes it difficult for the body to digest. Anything that stays in our system too long putrefies and leaves toxins, which causes various diseases. Asthma is known to be one of them.<a href="http://courageouscommunication.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/ragi-bread-for-sandwich-with-cashew-nut-cream.jpg"><img src="http://courageouscommunication.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/ragi-bread-for-sandwich-with-cashew-nut-cream.jpg?w=300&#038;h=169" alt="Ragi Bread for sandwich with Cashew nut cream." width="300" height="169" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-580" /></a><br />
<strong>Ragi Bread with Cashew Cream as instead of Cheese</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why not dairy?</strong> I believe that when the baby weans the milk stops coming  from the mother so we are designed to have milk until a certain age only. That’s my common sense way of doing it. Besides we tie the calves the whole day and they keep crying, will we want our babies to be denied of their mothers milk then why do we do this to the cows. Not just that they have to be tied away so the baby and mother gets no touch and licking and kissing from each other. <a href="http://courageouscommunication.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/dairy-free-banana-icecream-with-choclate-sauce-made-of-ragi-cocoa-powder-and-jaggery.jpg"><img src="http://courageouscommunication.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/dairy-free-banana-icecream-with-choclate-sauce-made-of-ragi-cocoa-powder-and-jaggery.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="Dairy free Banana icecream with choclate sauce made of Ragi, Cocoa Powder and Jaggery." width="300" height="200" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-579" /></a> <strong>Dairy Free Banana Icecream with Cholcalate Sauce made with Ragi, Jaggery and Coaoa Powder.</strong></p>
<p> Milk is a wholesome food for the calf (which doubles its weight in 47 days from the day of birth) and not for the human baby (which takes 180 days to do the same). In order for the calves to grow quickly, milk has proteins and growth hormones, but these are too difficult for us to digest. In the process, they leave acidic residues. Our body is alkaline, and any acids in our blood need to be neutralized by calcium, which is then leached out from our bones. It has been found that there is always a net loss of calcium with milk, often leading to kidney stones. Did you ever think that if cows and horses can make calcium from the grass they eat, then we can also get calcium from fruits and veggies? If you need a substitute, you can make great-tasting milks and curds using nuts. We have some recipes if you are interested!</p>
<p>LESS polished rice. MORE Whole Grain Unpolished Rice. Polishing of rice removes the outer coat, which is full of fiber and nutrients. We cook with unpolished rice instead.</p>
<p>Nuts and Oilseeds instead of Oil. Oilseeds have enzymes which aid in the digestion of fatty acids and other nutrients. While making oil, unfortunately, these seeds are subjected to high temperatures which destroy the enzymes. Frying veggies in oil destroys the enzymes of the veggies too. We have learned ways of making delicious food even without oil. <a href="https://courageouscommunication.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/dsc00300.jpg"><img src="http://courageouscommunication.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/dsc00300.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="DSC00300" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-582" /></a></p>
<p>A healthy diet is also good for the planet. It means much less waste, much less greenhouse gases (in terms of petrol and coal needed for packaging, transportation, refrigeration, etc.), much less deforestation, much less chemical farming, much less animal slaughter, much less chemicals – and a much healthier, more vibrant and balanced world.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For months I&#8217;ve been obsessed with the idea of living sustainably on what we can grow, gather, barter and hunt. It has become an almost permanent topic of my conversation, and my boyfriend&#8217;s eyes become distant whenever my mouth opens&#8230;</p>
<p>We bought a house together last year. It&#8217;s a sweet little white brick semi on a long and narrow block in the unknown Sydney suburb of Bardwell Valley. North facing with a pool and a granny flat, and a few sandy garden beds situated around the pool. There isn&#8217;t much space, so the previous owners turned the side access way into their veggie patch by building raised containers down it. In hindsight, I think I wanted us to buy this house purely because I could see myself digging around in these cute little corrugated iron beds, and then cooling off in the pool.</p>
<p>We moved in last November, missing the spring planting season. Our bounty through summer was a legacy of self-sown cherry tomatoes, thriving parsley, a giant basil plant, and a prolifically fruiting chilli bush. By planting quick-growing snow peas and a zucchini we were able to harvest many meals over summer from the garden, with a little assistance from the local butcher. The taste was so fresh, so much more flavoursome than food bought from the shops, that I began to dream of always eating food so good. Could it be done with such a small space to work with?</p>
<p>This summer, we hope to find out. Our plan is to live for ten whole days on food grown in our garden, foraged in local parks and bushland, bartered with neighbours, or caught ourselves. From this starting point I hope we can go on to incorporate this style of living into our every day life, and have it be a rarity, rather than the norm, for us to hunt and gather at the supermarket. It sounds like such a simple plan, but discussions with friends and family have already raised many curly questions.</p>
<p>I invite you to follow my blog as we embark on this adventure. Could you live like this for ten whole days? Let&#8217;s see if we can.</p>

<p>Today I was fortunate enough to get to walk through one of the most biodiverse areas in the world second to the Amazon: Periyar Tiger Reserve.</p>
<p>I understand why people travel from all of the world to experience this place. In the United States, we are very proud of our national parks for their diversity and beauty. However, this park feels more untouched than the ones I have been to in the states. It kind of absorbs you. The paths in the forest seem less traveled. Honestly, it feels less touristy and more wild. We only trekked on the periphery of the jungle really. The center of the jungle truly is preserved and only certain people are able to go deep inside.</p>

<p>Our guide, who is part of the groups indigenous to this area, was very knowledgeable and has worked there for 15 years. Groups indigenous to this area are also able to fish there. I was really glad to see that element of social sustainability in place.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_453" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://nancytaylorrobson.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/purple-pod-pea-vines-and-blooms.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-453" src="http://nancytaylorrobson.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/purple-pod-pea-vines-and-blooms.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Purple pod pea vines and blooms" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Purple pod pea vines and blooms</p></div>
<p>It’s been a while since I managed to download photos, especially food photos since I have to remind myself to take them in the first place. Unfortunately, once I cook, I’m so focused on actually EATING, that I never think to record things until we’re stuffing the empty plates into the sink. But I did manage to photo one plate of purple-podded shell peas from start to finish sometime in June.</p>
<p>The rabbits had decimated my early-seeded veggies including the snow peas that I poked into the ground in about mid-April. I don’t mind tithing to the critters but I go ballistic when they only leave me a tenth or less! So before I put the purple-podded pea plants that I had started in the greenhouse into the ground, I set up camouflage in the form of row cover pinned to the trellis. It worked; the rabbits by-passed them, and I ended up with beautiful vining peas covered in purple pods (also a fair number of green pods that apparently didn’t get the purple memo). At any rate, they were glorious, and I had several meals of peas done a couple of different ways.</p>
<div id="attachment_454" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://nancytaylorrobson.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/purple-peas-and-scapes-on-bd.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-454" src="http://nancytaylorrobson.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/purple-peas-and-scapes-on-bd.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Purple peas (and some green) and garlic scapes on cutting board" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Purple peas (and some green) and garlic scapes on cutting board</p></div>
<p>When they finally gave out, we clipped the vines at the ground and laid them behind the cabbages and purple kohlrabi that I had bought at Kingstown Farm Home and Garden. The kohlrabi had been marked ‘red cabbage,’ which appeared to be truth in advertising when it had only a couple of leaves on it. But instead of red cabbage it turned into beautiful purple globes that I turned into slaw and ate with fish tacos. (So much for warm red cabbage salad with garlic, toasted walnuts and feta, but the slaw was lovely).</p>
<p>But I digress.<br />
The peas, as I’m sure you suspect, are finished. We’re now picking haricots verts, herbs, the first Sungold cherry tomatoes (today!), serranos and lemon peppers, but I’m still thinking ‘PEAS’ because it’s now time to put in a second planting of them. And bless my husband’s soul, he’s prepped a bed that I can stick them into in hopes of having more this fall.</p>
<div id="attachment_455" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://nancytaylorrobson.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/purple-pea-pods-opened.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-455" src="http://nancytaylorrobson.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/purple-pea-pods-opened.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Purple pea pods opened" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Purple pea pods blurry but opened</p></div>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>This year was the first that I tried the purple podded variety, and would do it again happily, though I’d make the trellis higher next time. Instead of 4.5 feet, they got to be about seven feet tall and drooped over the too-short support I had put up. Their flavor (always a critical point with me) is really good-sweet, not mealy or starchy if you get them before they swell the pods too much. They’re prolific, and because most of the pods are actually a burgundy-purple, they’re much easier to find and pick than the green pods we usually have.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>I shelled them while watching the news and stir-fried them in olive oil with a chopped shallot and a couple of slices of prosciutto. Delicious. To make them go a little farther the second time around, I added them to al dente whole grain pasta then mixed in some grated Asiago cheese and just a splash of cream. We ate it with a glass of wine. I love eating at this time of year! (Who&#8217;m I kidding? I love to eat!)</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So here&#8217;s a little encouragement to anyone thinking of planting a tree or two&#8230;Three years ago, we planted a tiny &#8216;copse&#8217; of about 50 bare-root saplings, most only about 60cm high. Most of them are now taller than me (not that hard, I&#8217;m not very tall!), but this summer, the first trees grew taller than H (who is 6&#8217;3). This little bare corner of a field is becoming a place, to us. The trees now cast just enough shade for a smallish child to sit under on a sunny day.</p>

<p>We planted the copse with the aim of growing at least some of our own firewood, to feed the woodburner that keeps the older part of the house warm (well, warmer) in the winter. With that in mind, we put in fast-growing species that can be coppiced every 15 years or so, including plenty of alder and ash (of course!) There&#8217;s also wild cherry, bird cherry, two types of birch, and some willows that we were given as unrooted &#8216;setts&#8217; about 5&#8242; long. My little boy Os and I planted those bare willow sticks one chilly winters day last year, and here they are now.</p>

<p>In permaculture terms, this mini-wood is part of our &#8216;zone 4&#8242; &#8211; that is, an area you visit sometimes, and take a harvest from once in a while, but don&#8217;t use intensively. So we placed it in the far corner of the fields, as we don&#8217;t need to go there regularly (although we do visit pretty often, just to admire the little trees and see how they&#8217;re getting on.) We did water the saplings a few times in their first year, and tried to keep the grass down around them. Apart from that, they&#8217;ve not needed any real looking after, just occasional checks that their rabbit guards are still in place. (We have a giant rabbit warren running along this field, and despite our efforts to control numbers, it&#8217;s pretty much Rabbit City.)</p>
<p>This is one of my favourites &#8211; its a little Common Alder (<em>Alnus Glutinosa). </em>I&#8217;ve been watching this one extra-closely, as its the tree I&#8217;m &#8216;following&#8217; for <a href="http://looseandleafy.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Loose and Leafy&#8217;s Tree Following project</a>. Today, it&#8217;s in full leaf, with the fruits that look like little cones swelling in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Now I know we are incredibly lucky to have the space to do this sort of thing. I&#8217;ve also heard of people putting in one or two willows or hazels on an allotment, to grow their own poles for plant supports &#8211; saves having to buy in bamboo canes shipped half way round the world. I like that idea &#8211; in permaculture terms, its a simple way of &#8216;closing a loop&#8217; by growing or making something you need for your garden or home, rather than having to buy it in. In the old days, this was the norm, and woods and woodsmen were an amazing resource for their communities, creating firewood, charcoal, fencing hurdles, furniture, bowls, spoons &#8211; and on and on. It feels nice, in a very tiny way, to be part of that tradition.</p>
<p>Gardening &#8211; and particularly planting trees  - is a long game. As my mother-in-law says, you don&#8217;t plant trees for yourself, you plant them for the next generation. It&#8217;s a bitter-sweet feeling &#8211; the trees we&#8217;ve planted will probably long outlive me. I won&#8217;t get to see them at their full height. But for the next while (a good long while, if I have my way!), I can enjoy watching them season-by-season. I can be be warmed by them once we start to harvest them. And I&#8217;ll always remember planting them &#8211; with both Granny and then Grandma visiting over a long weekend to play with the children while we worked, Grandpa toiling away helping to dig the holes for the new trees. If I&#8217;m lucky, perhaps I&#8217;ll get to watch my own Grandkids sit in their shade one day.</p>
<p>So go on, plant a tree today!   If you&#8217;ve no room at home, I came across the lovely <a href="http://www.mybabytree.org/" target="_blank">My Baby Tree</a> project run by World Wildlife Fund Indonesia. For a US$15  donation, they will raise a seedling and plant it in one of their forest reserves on various Indonesian islands, aiming to undo the destruction to Indonesia&#8217;s forests one tree at a time. If you pay for a sapling to be planted, they will send you its location on Google Earth, so you can see your tree (well, the area it is in, at least). How cool is that?</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;ve got the tree-planting bug, here are a few more tree-planting projects I&#8217;ve come across:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.treesforcities.org/about-us/big-tree-plant/" target="_blank">Trees for Cities &#8211; Big Tree Plant</a> - They have funding for community tree-planting projects, deadline is August 30th!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.woodlandtrustshop.com/products/219-dedicate-a-tree.aspx" target="_blank">Woodland Trust &#8211; Dedicate a Tree</a> - You can dedicate a tree to commemorate a loved one or celebrate a special day.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.treesforlife.org.uk/index.html" target="_blank">Trees for Life</a> - Restoring Scotland&#8217;s Caledonian Forest to a 1,000 acre &#8216;wild forest&#8217; managed for wildlife, not logging.</p>
<p>Have you ever planted a tree, or been involved in any great tree-planting projects?</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our Tennessee trip didn&#8217;t do much for my low-carb communting miles for June. Our mountaintop condo was accessible only by steep switchbacks with no sidewalks and scary drop-offs, so there were no walks to the local convenience store for milk and bread.</p>
<p>Total miles that replaced driving remained stuck at what I last reported on June 23: 53 on the bike and 6 walking for a total of 59.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the trip also helped set a ridiculous monthly baseline for miles driven: 2,596. That ought to be easy to beat &#8212; except for the fact that half of the 1,000 miles driven on this trip go down in July&#8217;s total.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Soooooo&#8230;.the whole sauerkraut thing. It went splendidly up until life became relatively difficult and hectic. If you recall, I was supposed to check the jar on Friday night to give it a taste test to see if it was ready. Well, I didn&#8217;t get to give it a check until Sunday, after which I discovered this -</p>
<p><a href="https://theveryhungryblonde.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/20140707_120721.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-434" src="http://theveryhungryblonde.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/20140707_120721.jpg?w=167&#038;h=300" alt="20140707_120721"   /></a></p>
<p>Yep, a lovely batch of white-blue mold had begun to grow. I think if I had checked it on Friday night, it would have been fine, but the extra time messed it up. So I did a trouble-shooting search and this is what I found (brought to you by Food Renegade and Kristin Michaelis):</p>
<p>&#8220;Oxygen is the enemy when it comes to ferments. LABs prefer an anaerobic (oxygen-less) environment, and our goal is to keep those little guys happy, right? Aerobically (with oxygen) the yeasts in your ferment can be oxidized to form acetic acid (vinegar), which is not what we’re making here. Yes, you want some tang, but you can achieve tang without vinegar. The candida-preventing yeast <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> has the ability to shift from fermentative to oxidative depending on the level of oxygen available. Keep the oxygen out, and this friendly yeast can help your guts heal. <strong>So how do you know if your jar is keeping out enough oxygen? </strong>There are a few red flags that can tell us: browned cabbage, yeasty odor, pink cabbage, slime, and mold (we’ll come back to mold in a bit)&#8230; I know, I know. It’s “normal” to get mold. It’s “normal” to scrape it away and eat it and not die on the spot. But is it safe? Before you remind me that mold on cheese is safe, let me remind you that moldy cheese is created in purpose. Certain cheeses, such as gorgonzola or blue cheese, have been cultured to create a safe mold. Moldy cheddar cheese isn’t even acceptable, and certainly mold is unacceptable in your ferment. Mold can make you sick, very sick. Some people show symptoms right away; others end up with mold sensitivities or other gut issues that evolve over time. It’s just not a risk I am willing to take. If you’re saying, “But, Lea, I am not eating it, I am scraping it off!” I have to respond with this: mold has roots. Far before you can see the mold on the top of your kraut, the spoilage has begun. I have experienced this myself — spoilage in the brine samples before I saw them with my eyes. In fact, Jar #3, Water Baggy, had just a couple of decaying cabbage pieces on the top of the jar, trapped between the baggy and the glass. At the end of my sauerkraut experiment I removed the baggy and the decaying cabbage (which just had a little bit of white fuzz) and I took a sample of the brine from the very bottom of the 1/2 gallon jar. Guess what? There was mold. Now visually, it looked great. The cabbage was beautiful-looking, and even smelled fine. So my point is, once you get to the point of seeing mold with your eyes, it’s already too late.&#8221;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How to be happy here?  How to live on earth in peace?  Where to start?</p>
<p>&#8220;Nature is not good or bad.  Nature just is.&#8221;</p>
<p>A couple of inspirational clips showing Satish Kumar explaining a new way of educating our children and our societies in general, explaining a more sustainable approach to a life in greater harmony with nature, respecting our great diversity which only highlights union, be who we are, embody our experience, be the change, become the leaders in a brighter future…….together we can change the world and we can start by caring for our planet, nurturing the soil, feeding our bodies, feeding our souls, then feeding our minds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are all related, we are one, lets us celebrate that diversity!&#8221;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Great things are happening in Germany these days. They have acheived a milestone of producing <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/technology/germany-now-produces-half-its-energy-using-solar" target="_blank">enough solar energy to power HALF of their energy needs</a> and continue to innovate with social projects such as Original Unverpackt.</p>
<p><a href="https://karmacollectivela.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/original_unverpackt1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-358 aligncenter" src="http://karmacollectivela.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/original_unverpackt1.jpg?w=336&#038;h=195" alt="original_unverpackt" width="336" height="195" /></a>The concept is extremely simple. No disposable packaging. Bring your own containers, have the ability to buy as much of something as you would like. I am a fan, and I wish this Bold Business the best of success!</p>
<p>The Zero Waste movement is gaining steam as more cities and businesses realize the incredible potential for zero waste. Even WalMart sees the benefit of diverting waste from landfills and through their program have been able to save $231 million dollars. Nevermind what they&#8217;ve done with those wonderful funds (probably not increase their wages to above poverty level&#8230;) but what is important is that the viability of this concept has been proven! Original Unverpakt takes the concept to the next level &#8211; instead of creating waste and diverting it into recycling and composting, they allow on the store level for zero waste creation. HUGE.</p>
<p>Check out the translated web page for OU <a href="http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&#38;sl=de&#38;u=http://original-unverpackt.de/&#38;prev=/search%3Fq%3Doriginal%2Bunverpakt%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3DfId%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26channel%3Dsb" target="_blank">here</a>.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every day brings with it a bounty of wonder, experience, and flavor.  Though some days may feel and appear like others that have come before, no day is ever the same.  I am confident in my simple knowing that we all wish to enjoy our days here on Earth while we live them.  This afternoon as the sun shines outside and the birds chirp I find it easy to enjoy my experience without too much effort.  Yet some days, though sunny and bright, can bring with them flavors that are bitter and hard to swallow.  It is on the hard to swallow days that a bit more attention is required to enjoy ones embodiment and the experiences that make up the memories of the short minutes one truly has on this beautiful planet.</p>
<p>No matter what the literal and figurative weather may bring, we can brighten each and every day with gratitude.  Rather than perceiving what we don&#8217;t have, or wish we had, or appear to have lost, we can simply offer gratitude for what is.  Gratitude for life, gratitude for breath, gratitude for the opportunity to have the experience whatever the flavor may be.  Offering gratitude when you wake up in the morning and when you go to bed in the evening will color any and all of your days with a hue of brightness that will resonate throughout your heart, in a vibrant, though maybe sometimes subtle, sound of joy.</p>
<p>A practice of gratitude is some of the best yoga any of us can do, and the best medicine we can offer our ailing heart, body, or mind.</p>
<p>With gratitude and love in the joy of sharing this wondrous life,<br />
Genevieve</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How to make a millet Paisam. Boil the millet in water till soft and cooked.  Make some jaggery syrup by boiling jaggery in water to a honey consistency. Add the jaggery syrup t the cooked millet. Take out some coconut milk from fresh coconut and add to the dish when its little cool. Add cardamon powder, some nuts of your choice.<br />
Advantage of Millets over wheat is that it doesnt have gluten, besides millets are very strudy crops grow with less water and dont need dams to be made for them. Also rich in minerals. Its also fun to have diversity in life.

<description><![CDATA[Some ski homes high on the mountain have beautiful views down the valley. Others near the base lodge]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://thebuildingcycle.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/tedford-elevation1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-638 size-large" style="margin:7px;" src="http://thebuildingcycle.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/tedford-elevation1.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=492" alt="Tedford Elevation"   /></a>Some ski homes high on the mountain have beautiful views down the valley. Others near the base lodge typically have great views up the slopes. This timberframe home at <strong><a href="http://www.sundayriverliving.com/properties/newdevelopments/theglades.html">The Glades at Ridge Run</a></strong>, a new slopeside residential neighborhood at <strong><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/">Sunday River Resort</a></strong> in Newry, Maine, captures both.</p>
<p>Situated in the western mountains of Maine just three hours from Boston, Sunday River Resort has long been one of New England’s most popular four-season playgrounds, but what is so special about the property that owners Meredith and Jamie found here is that it sits uniquely midway up the mountain with expansive views above and below.</p>
<p>Though Meredith and Jamie had just completed an extensive renovation on another home and weren’t anxious to begin a new construction, this was the first time a ski-on, ski-off home opportunity was available at Sunday River, so the couple knew they had to jump on it. They were also motivated to replace an old beloved, but small, ski lodge they had outgrown. Sensitive to the feeling of transplanting their relatives away from a getaway that had been in the family for years, they wanted an open concept floor plan with the feel of a true home. They also wanted to maximize family interaction, and minimize the size of the house to facilitate that function—as well as for aesthetic and environmental impact motives.</p>
<p><a href="http://thebuildingcycle.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/east.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-580 size-medium" style="margin:7px;" src="http://thebuildingcycle.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/east.jpg?w=300&#038;h=214" alt="sunday river family ski lodge rendering" width="300" height="214" /></a>Past renovations had taught Meredith and Jamie to be flexible but decisive, which helped in this first new house project. They also knew from experience that “design by committee” was something to be avoided, rather it was better to create a team dynamic between client and architect that respected roles and responsibilities, but also valued input from all parties. The mutual trust that developed allowed changes to be made fluidly and without conflict.</p>
<p>The <strong><a title="Bensonwood website" href="http://www.bensonwood.com/" target="_blank">Bensonwood</a> </strong>design team of Randall Walter, Curtis Fanti and Dave Levasseur, all avid skiers in their own right, were excited to create this special place from a perspective of years spent skiing and snowboarding. Their personal insights proved invaluable in informing practical aspects of the design.</p>
<p>The architectural review process at the resort and the corresponding design standards requires development that complements the surrounding natural setting; minimizing the impact on the landscape while allowing for individual freedom of design to suit the needs of each homeowner. A common theme, described as a Northeast Cottage with Adirondack and Shingle Style influences, dictates the use of building materials, colors, landscaping and building style at the resort. The style is best illustrated in <strong><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Summer-Cottages-White-Mountains-Architecture/dp/0874519535/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;qid=1403102501&#38;sr=1-1&#38;keywords=summer+cottages+of+the+white+mountains">Summer Cottages in the White Mountains</a></em></strong> by Bryant F. Tolles, Jr. (2000), in which the use of native materials blended with natural colors provides an effective link to both the local environment and the great cottage architecture of the early 20th century.</p>
<p><a href="http://thebuildingcycle.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/drive-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-582 size-large" style="margin:7px;" src="http://thebuildingcycle.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/drive-1.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=428" alt="Sunday river ski lodge"   /></a>Working closely with the clients, the resort, the civil engineering firm <strong><a href="http://www.main-landdevelopment.com/">Main-Land Development Consultants, Inc</a>.</strong>, and the town zoning board, Randall was able to design the energy-efficient home into a challenging site with steep terrain and protected wetlands. He was able to navigate the regulations and arrive at the design—a traditional Adirondack timber lodge style with a modern twist on the gables to accommodate the views—in a way that pleased all the parties involved. In the end, the review board process was easy and the owners got a home that fit their needs and respectfully fit the mountain landscape.</p>
<p>Another welcome test for <strong><a href="http://bensonwood.com/">Bensonwood</a> </strong>is the truncated construction timeline. With designs finalized this past spring, the owners wanted to ski from the home this coming winter. Anxious to prove that even a custom 3,900 SF mountain home on an undeveloped site could go up in record time with our Open-Built<sup>®</sup> systems and offsite fabrication, the Bensonwood team embraced the challenge. Rapid onsite assembly will also help cut build times in half over conventional construction, effectively giving the homeowners an entire extra season to enjoy the resort.</p>
<p><a href="http://thebuildingcycle.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/ski-deck2.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-637 size-medium" style="margin:7px;" src="http://thebuildingcycle.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/ski-deck2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="ski deck" width="300" height="200" /></a>Like many of <strong><a href="http://bensonwood.com/gallery/">Bensonwood’s mountain and shore homes</a></strong>, the house features gable roof lines, with one important distinction: these gables, dormers and bump outs will have asymmetric rooflines that permit both mountain and valley vistas as well as views of arriving and departing skiers. These roof angles, along with the heavy, rough sawn, red cedar clapboards, work to give the exterior its distinctive look: at the same time both traditional and contemporary, while the property’s southern exposure allows for plenty of natural daylighting and passive solar gain.</p>
<p>On the inside every detail of the sanctuary, which will accommodate three generations of family, has been strategically planned. The owners wanted to maximize the use of space, and that included the kids’ space on the ground level, with the fun feel of a ski resort locker area. The ground floor has a rustic lumberjack-inspired kids zone, with a mud room off the garage, an open play area, a game room, a guest bedroom, a bunkroom with three beds, and facing his and hers bathrooms.</p>
<p>The first floor has a large open space plan with cathedral ceiling and a gathering area across from the kitchen/pantry and adjacent to the dining area. The dining room will have a long, farmhouse-style table with benches accommodating 10 or more. The second floor plan has three bedroom suites, each with their own bath, and a balcony open to the gathering area below.</p>
<p><a href="http://thebuildingcycle.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/front.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-636 size-medium" style="margin:7px;" src="http://thebuildingcycle.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/front.jpg?w=300&#038;h=164" alt="sunday river ski lodge rendering" width="300" height="164" /></a>Perhaps the most unique feature of the project, however, is a very innovative ski-on, ski-off deck. The custom deck required Randall to create a multi-functional outdoor living space with views up and down the mountain in a style that also satisfied design review board restrictions. His solution was adjust the roof pitch and angles so skiers on the deck will still be able to enjoy the views, as he had done on the main house.</p>
<p>Mindful of the homeowners’ sensitivities to limiting the home’s size, he placed the deck atop the garage so skiers will have easy to the home’s bathrooms and kitchen on the main floor when they ski home at lunchtime. Unique features include a hot tub—not tucked away in a secluded spot as is often seen—but in the open air on the sheltered ski deck so all guests have ready access. There are also ski and snowboard racks, overhead heating elements, a fireplace and a hot tub on the deck.</p>
<p><a href="http://thebuildingcycle.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/sunday-river-floorplan.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-675 size-large" style="margin:7px;" src="http://thebuildingcycle.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/sunday-river-floorplan.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=609" alt="FLOORPLAN"   /></a>One of the most creative elements of the home is one the clients devised. Rather than the traditional guest book for visitors to sign, the couple will immortalize them with a round timber into which they can carve their names and the dates they stay, creating a family legacy crafted in wood that will last for generations—just like the home.</p>
<p>Architect Randall Walter predicts that, like many vacation homes Bensonwood has crafted over the past 40 years, this house will be used much more than originally intended, because families often discover they enjoy spending time in them so much more than in their primary residence.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://fernwoodnursery.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/picture-1028.jpg"><img src="http://fernwoodnursery.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/picture-1028.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=767" alt="Picture 1028"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1578" /></a>What else are we doing here at Fernwood with all the early chinese cabbage and bok choi? We&#8217;re making kimchi. Kimchi is Korean in origin and involves fermenting cabbage, carrots, daikon radish, scallions and other vegetables in a ginger, garlic, and red chili pepper paste. Very yummy and very good for you.<br />
Lots of things are fermented&#8230;..sourdough bread, yogurt, sauerkraut, and pickles to name a few. Fermentation is one of the very oldest forms of food preservation. There are many different ways to ferment food, and various ingredients that will help the process along; salt, whey, alcohol, wild yeast, and vinegar, can all be used to preserve and ferment foods. Aside from being a tasty way to preserve your harvest, fermented foods have terrific health benefits. Fermentation helps with digestion, promotes probiotic functions, and helps to release antinutrients ( compounds found in nuts, grains, and seeds that interfere with the absorption of nutrients) in the foods you eat.<br />
This weekend, lots of food was fermented in the kitchen here at Fernwood. In addition to the jars of kimchi, we made our weekly supply of yogurt, a batch of cheese ( mozzarella, riccota, and a soft Bondon), as well as some sourdough bread. Now, we&#8217;ll wait a few days for the kimchi to ripen. Once it&#8217;s ready, we&#8217;ll slice some sourdough bread, top that with some homemade cheese, and finish it off with a healthy spoonfull of spicy kimchi. Yum! <a href="http://fernwoodnursery.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/picture-1029.jpg"><img src="http://fernwoodnursery.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/picture-1029.jpg?w=769&#038;h=1024" alt="Picture 1029"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1579" /></a>  </p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love giving and receiving beautifully-wrapped gifts. It&#8217;s a thoughtful gesture that is making a creative comeback. I have figured out a simple, sustainable, and scientific way for me to wrap an aesthetically pleasing gift quickly. 1) neutral wrapping paper is a safe bet 2) Layer tchotchkes in different textures and prints to make it fun 3) Add a sprig of something living to make it come alive!</p>
<p><strong>Materials</strong></p>
<p>- roll of brown kraft paper or a paper bag (recyclable materials!)</p>
<p>- decorative washi tape (optional)</p>
<p>- sprig of something living, or some tschotkes you have laying around (once I planted a sprig someone had used on my gift, and had it for over a year!)</p>
<p>- twine or cloth ribbon (I save ribbon people use to giftwrap my gifts)</p>
<p>- a gift!</p>
<p>Directions: It&#8217;s easy, just wrap it and bling it out!</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"> By Barrie Lewis</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:large;">Proper utilisation of our water resources is becoming increasingly important. Whether it’s the quality of that water, or the price, or water at any price, like it or not, water is an important issue facing us all. </span></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:large;">Seeing how the Dutch built underground reservoirs in their gardens for their water was the first prod, making me realise there are other ways of doing things. The second was a serious leak in the ancient pipe that supplies our suburb. A look down the lumen of the pipe shocked me; the water trickles through a curtain of asbestos fibres from the decaying pipe. Whether we breathe it in, or ingest it, asbestos causes one of the most serious incurable cancers. Mesothelioma; prevention is the only option.</span></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:large;">Water tanks are an option, but talking to folk I soon realised the plastic tanks have a very limited lifespan; and, above ground, the water becomes very warm making a perfect breeding ground for E. Coli and other bugs. </span></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:large;">Building your own water supply reservoir comes in several phases:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:large;">A series of 110mm underground pipes to collect the water from your downpipes. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:large;">Digging a large hole in the ground for the reservoir. <a href="https://sustainabilityforum.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/reservoir-the-hole.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3851" src="http://sustainabilityforum.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/reservoir-the-hole.jpg?w=320&#038;h=240" alt="Reservoir-the-hole" width="320" height="240" /></a></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:large;">Concreting the bottom, preferably with some reinforcing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:large;">Building a double brick wall, with a length of galvanised 8 gauge wire between every course. Plastering the wall.<a href="http://sustainabilityforum.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/reservoir-brickwork.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3842" src="http://sustainabilityforum.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/reservoir-brickwork.jpg?w=320&#038;h=240" alt="Reservoir-brickwork" width="320" height="240" /></a></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:large;">Building on a sump into which the rainwater drains, to remove any solids from the roof. <a href="https://sustainabilityforum.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/reservoir-sump.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3846" src="http://sustainabilityforum.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/reservoir-sump.jpg?w=320&#038;h=240" alt="Reservoir-sump" width="320" height="240" /></a></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:large;">Designing and building a roof of gum poles and IBR sheeting. <a href="https://sustainabilityforum.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/reservoir-roof.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3847" src="http://sustainabilityforum.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/reservoir-roof.jpg?w=320&#038;h=240" alt="Reservoir-roof" width="320" height="240" /></a></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:large;">Purchasing a self priming pump and doing all the connections to house and garden. Use 25mm polycop piping only. Provision of electricity for the pump. <a href="https://sustainabilityforum.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/reservoir-pump-filter.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3845" src="http://sustainabilityforum.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/reservoir-pump-filter.jpg?w=320&#038;h=240" alt="Reservoir-pump-filter" width="320" height="240" /></a></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:large;">If the lie of the land is suitable, purchase of a fibreglass tank and erecting it on a stand. </span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:large;">It’s not rocket science, but each stage needs to be carefully and thoughtfully done. </span></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:large;">The total cost of our 25,000 litre reservoir and pump was about R20,000 two years ago. But we made one serious mistake; somehow either insufficient waterproofing was used in the plaster mix, or the builder never followed instructions. We have no visible cracks, and the water was adequate in the first year, but this winter we ran dry. Clearly we had a leak necessitating a fibreglassing of the reservoir which was not cheap. R14.000.<a href="https://sustainabilityforum.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/reservoir-fibreglass.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3844" src="http://sustainabilityforum.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/reservoir-fibreglass.jpg?w=320&#038;h=240" alt="Reservoir-fibreglass" width="320" height="240" /></a></span></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:large;">We used the water initially only for the garden, toilets and showers but gradually began to cautiously drink it; after an E. coli test. To our surprise it was delightful and caused no collywobbles despite the hadedas that frequent our roof. In fact, since going back onto mains when the reservoir ran dry, our tums have been less than happy. </span></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:large;">Nothing gives me more pleasure than a high pressure shower with the largest, most generous head, supplied with unlimited solar heated water once or twice every day; the ultimate indulgence. </span></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:large;">We don’t actually use water; it either runs directly from the roof into the ground, or it goes via this system into the septic tank, and hence back to Mother Earth. </span></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:large;">You’re welcome to come and see it. </span></p>

<description><![CDATA[Sitting on the grass in a child infested playground several days ago, I was approached by two adults]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://earthelixiroflife.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/grass-and-feet.jpg"><img class="wp-image-321 alignright" src="http://earthelixiroflife.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/grass-and-feet.jpg?w=255&#038;h=169" alt="grass and feet" width="255" height="169" /></a></p>
<p>Sitting on the grass in a child infested playground several days ago, I was approached by two adults who wanted to share the green territory I had claimed for myself. An oasis of earthen comfort amongst the plastic and concrete, I happily moved my food basket to accommodate their request. I assumed they were not from this area. Their energy was a little more intense, clothes stunningly cool but not overdressed and they asked where the toilet was. Dead give away.</p>
<p>The conversation flowed. Did we realise we were of the same tribe or was it my initial willingness to share? Either way the next hour found us moving into each others soul and hearts.</p>
<p>They were from Newtown, Sydney &#8211; we were from the forest lands. They were working 50-60 hours a week &#8211; we were definitely not. They wanted a different way of life &#8211; we had already found it.</p>
<p>The comparisons continued and the questions (from Dave and Gabrielle) sparked my mind to wonder&#8230;&#8230;what stops people from taking a leap of faith? So many people want to get out of the vicious mortgage cycle but simply don&#8217;t do it.</p>
<p>Daves&#8217; question &#8221; Is it worth dropping out?&#8221;</p>
<p>My reply &#8220;Only if you find what we found&#8221;</p>
<p>So what did we find? A place to call home, a place that my heart longs for when I&#8217;m not here. I found freedom and the time to pursue our passions. I found myself and I discovered a love with my husband. I have the time to develop an honest relationship with my children whilst still nurturing their growth and development. We found a spiritual connection with the land, previously lost to us. I found myself and an awareness that cannot be closed off anymore. We found more, so much more than we thought possible and I would never go back to clock watching, child minding, stressful days.</p>

<p>For people wishing to drop out, break the habitual patterns of consumerism, remove the stress of social conformity or downsize their properties, cars and wardrobes&#8230;&#8230;..I need to say&#8230;&#8230;. be realistic.</p>
<p>Make a list of what needs to happen, sure, It wont happen until you are ready, inside and out though. Practically, we all know what needs to happen; sell the 4 and 1/2 bedroom, 3 cars and multiple televisions. Buy somewhere, check for schools, employment&#8230;.the list goes on.</p>
<p>Here is a list that you might not have read.</p>
<p>Prepare to be exhausted with limitless potential.                                 Know that things will get tough, sometimes real tough (hasn&#8217;t it been anyway if you are thinking about a change)                                            Unless your loaded, don&#8217;t expect to buy clothes and shoes weekly.    Just because you dropped out doesn&#8217;t mean you will automatically grow dreads  and turn vegan.                                                                                You will start to enjoy the simple things, really.                                      More and more you will hear your intuition calling you and you&#8217;ll learn to trust it.                                                                                                                      You will know your neighbour and most likely the whole community. Holidays to Canada might take years to save for but your heart probably wont want to leave anyway.                                                                 Chooks become your friends and suppliers.                                                  The flow of seasons affects your emotions, whether you want them to or not.                                                                                                                                          Life makes you happy and you want to share it with anyone.</p>
<p>When your at your wits end and laughing becomes a chore, don&#8217;t wait and hesitate on fears; how will we send our kids to college, what if someone needs medical assistance or how could we manage with only 3 bedrooms or a tin shed. Stop questioning your own sanity and listen to yourself&#8230;&#8230;.you will manage. Many beliefs and ideals are broken down and re-birthed when we allow ourselves the opportunity to change and the things that made us happy or sad previously&#8230;.no longer affect us.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Thankyou Dave and Gabrielle from Newtown, I wished I had passed on my contact details&#8230;&#8230;.one day I may find you again. You would have dropped out by then.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, there are things that I come across that force me to examine my life. A week or so ago, I put <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2450264/?ref_=nv_sr_2" target="_blank">Tiny: A Story About Living Small</a> on my Netflix list. I have to say, it caught me by surprise. I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect. Basically, it&#8217;s the story about how a guy starts a project to build a tiny house. A tiny house is a house that&#8217;s around 100-400 square feet. Minimalist living in the extreme. Below are some examples of this. Generally, tiny houses are built on flat bed trailers because it&#8217;s illegal in many places to build a home under a certain number of square feet. All images found on Google.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://honeyandchocolate.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/texas-victorian-tiny-house-stairs.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-97" src="http://honeyandchocolate.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/texas-victorian-tiny-house-stairs.jpg?w=300&#038;h=201" alt="Texas-Victorian-Tiny-House-stairs" width="300" height="201" /></a> <a href="https://honeyandchocolate.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/tiny-house-pano_low.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-98" src="http://honeyandchocolate.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/tiny-house-pano_low.jpg?w=300&#038;h=253" alt="Tiny House Pano_low" width="300" height="253" /></a> <a href="https://honeyandchocolate.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/tiny-house.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-99" src="http://honeyandchocolate.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/tiny-house.jpg?w=300&#038;h=173" alt="tiny-house" width="300" height="173" /></a> <a href="https://honeyandchocolate.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/tmth.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-100" src="http://honeyandchocolate.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/tmth.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="tmth" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It takes the space you have, and uses every inch as efficiently as possible. Many times, there&#8217;s a living space below, and a loft type of situation on the top, above the bathroom and/or kitchen for sleeping, just enough space to sit up in bed, which looks like just a mattress up there.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It was inspirational to me. I am in debt because I&#8217;ve spent more money than I&#8217;ve made on things like books, movies, and other junk. I have so much crap. I have a storage unit I&#8217;m paying for because of all my books. I wonder how I can downsize my things. It&#8217;s always been my dream to have a library of all my books whenever I can afford to buy a house. Which is the opposite of a tiny house. I don&#8217;t think I could have a tiny house, because of the amount of materials and supplies I have for Savory Scents. Nonetheless, it forces me to think about how I can lead a lifestyle less in the consumer space. How I can save space. For instance, owning digital copies of games, movies, and music instead of physical copies (yes, I know, that&#8217;s still consumerism, but these are my forms of entertainment and escapism). Even digital copies of books. I love my Nook. I read from it nearly every day.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I&#8217;m starting to think how I can save money for my own place if I just don&#8217;t buy things. Maybe I can make a larger tiny house some day. I&#8217;ve started thinking about all the crap I can sell. I won&#8217;t sell my books unless I absolutely have to. I already see some things on my desk I can throw away or sell. I just need to do it, and not worry about whether or not I&#8217;ll need it someday. If I haven&#8217;t used it, it&#8217;s time to get rid of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">If you&#8217;re interested, <a href="http://thetinylife.com/what-is-the-tiny-house-movement/" target="_blank">here&#8217;s a resource for learning more about tiny houses</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_10885" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/p6274122.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-10885" src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/p6274122.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" alt="Home sweet home at a trailhead in Idaho"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Home sweet home at a trailhead in Idaho.</p></div>
<p>I’ve been getting so many lovely, thoughtful, inquisitive emails from people and I’m sorry to say it’s become impossible for me to answer all of them. Most of you want to hit the road – for a long weekend, for a few weeks or months and some of you want to go full nomad. I’d love to help each and every one of you set yourselves free, but if I spent that much time at the keyboard answering emails, I wouldn’t be living the kind of life I want to be living. Selfish, yes, but therein lies part of the secret to my free living success.</p>
<div id="attachment_10882" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/p6183661.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-10882" src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/p6183661.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=766" alt="Teardrop Self Portrait "   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Teardrop Self Portrait</p></div>
<p>My solution to this ridiculously flattering conundrum is to start answering some of these queries on the Blonde Coyote: <em>I have been wanting to travel the U.S. with my medium size dog. Of course, the first thing is that I&#8217;m nervous about traveling alone (besides my dog) and I also just don&#8217;t know if I could do what you do by tenting it or should I get a van/little trailer. So many things I&#8217;m worried about: traveling alone, meeting up with weirdos (safety concerns), bathroom situation, wild animals to name a few. Rereading these worries doesn&#8217;t seem all that scary but they&#8217;re holding me back. </em></p>
<div id="attachment_10897" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/p6284214.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-10897" src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/p6284214.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" alt="A wild animal! "   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A wild animal!</p></div>
<p>And this one:</p>
<p><em>It seems like you&#8217;ve never encountered any problems with other people, and personally, I&#8217;m not too worried about it myself, but my family is scared that I&#8217;m going to encounter trouble from other people, presumably because I am female.  My friend of the family thought I should bring a shotgun with me (uh, no) and I&#8217;ll have a knife for practical purposes but I really don&#8217;t want to try it out for defense.  I&#8217;ll have pepper spray, too, but I know that&#8217;s not ideal either.  I was thinking of bringing a baseball bat (?), but do you have any suggestions?  Like I said, I highly doubt that we&#8217;ll find anyone looking to give us trouble; we&#8217;re both pretty good at reading people and won&#8217;t likely find ourselves running into the wrong crowd.  But I thought I&#8217;d ask you since I&#8217;m sure you have plenty of experience. <span class='wp-smiley emoji emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></em></p>
<div id="attachment_10888" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/p6294218.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-10888" src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/p6294218.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" alt="Hiking up Paris Peak in southeast Idaho"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hiking up Paris Peak in southeast Idaho</p></div>
<div>
<div>Ah yes, the fear factor. If you&#8217;re going to enjoy traveling, especially solo, you need to get a handle on all those anxieties that can paralyze you during the day and keep you awake at night. Honestly, the most dangerous part of road tripping is driving. I&#8217;ve met some weird people and some creepy people, but never once in all my travels have I ever been threatened by anybody. Maybe it&#8217;s because I travel with two large dogs (though I&#8217;ve been to South America twice and Europe thrice and plenty of places around the US without them) or maybe it&#8217;s in the way I carry myself, or maybe I&#8217;ve just been lucky, but after nine psycho-free years, I&#8217;d like to think I&#8217;m doing something right.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div id="attachment_10886" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/p6284156.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-10886" src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/p6284156.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=766" alt="Southern Idaho from the Highline Trail"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Southern Idaho from the Highline Trail</p></div>
</div>
<div>The key, of course, is confidence. There are predators in this world, but they are generally looking to prey on the weak and unaware. Everywhere I go, I pay attention and everybody I cross paths with I meet with a level gaze. Making eye contact says &#8220;I see you too&#8221; and that&#8217;s often enough to stop a predator in its tracks. Just recently I ran into five drunk dudes at Bloomington Lake in Idaho who wanted me to come swimming with them. They were rowdy and leering and too friendly but I kept calm and said no thank you and made eye contact with each of them and when they saw I was not afraid they went on their way and left me alone.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div id="attachment_10881" style="width: 732px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/bl2-panorama.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-10881" src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/bl2-panorama.jpg?w=722&#038;h=1024" alt="At Bloomington Lake. "   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Spring hailstorm at Bloomington Lake</p></div>
</div>
<div>I am not fearful and I am not fearless; fear is an asset and I pay attention to it. I pay attention to my dogs, to my surroundings, to my exits, to my gut. I don&#8217;t waste my energy worrying about all the scary scenarios that might happen; I pay attention to what is happening in front of me and deal with situations as they unfold.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div id="attachment_10898" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/imgp0427.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-10898" src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/imgp0427.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=575" alt="Storm descending on Bloomington Lake. Good thing I pack rain gear in the mountains! "   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Storm descending on Bloomington Lake. Good thing I pack rain gear in the mountains!</p></div>
</div>
<div>I think one of the best things I have going for me in the fear department is that I don&#8217;t watch television. I didn&#8217;t have a TV for most of my childhood and I&#8217;ve never lived with one as an adult. Every time I catch a glimpse or see a show, I am disgusted and often downright appalled. Whether it&#8217;s the news or the newest must-see TV or the incessant commercials, to my eyes it&#8217;s all ugly and violent and invasive and absurd and I can&#8217;t understand how anybody functions with all that terrible shit in their heads. I quit watching scary movies while I was living <a title="A Place That I Used To Know" href="http://theblondecoyote.com/2012/06/27/a-place-that-i-used-to-know/" target="_blank">in a cabin in the Oregon woods</a> by myself with no neighbors and no phone to call for help. If you don&#8217;t want to be thinking about all the terribly dramatic ways things can go wrong, don&#8217;t fill your head with torrid plots for the sake of entertainment.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div id="attachment_10887" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/p6284164.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-10887" src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/p6284164.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" alt="My kind of Mountain Dew"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My kind of Mountain Dew</p></div>
</div>
<div>In general, I try not to worry until I have to. Of course, sometimes things do go wrong. I&#8217;ve never had anybody threaten to physically harm me, but I&#8217;ve had a few unsettling encounters. Dealing with creeps is kind of like dealing with wild animals: there&#8217;s no one right way to handle <a title="The Grizz" href="http://theblondecoyote.com/2011/06/28/the-grizz/" target="_blank">meeting a bear</a> or <a title="Road Closed? Park and Walk! Just Watch Out For Moose…" href="http://theblondecoyote.com/2012/05/08/road-closed-park-and-walk-just-watch-out-for-moose/" target="_blank">a moose</a>. Every situation is different. As a general rule, always try to diffuse, rather than escalate and the best recourse is almost always to physically remove yourself from the situation.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div id="attachment_10889" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/p6294230.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-10889" src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/p6294230.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768" alt="White Buffalo chasing Dio"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">White snow buffalo chasing Dio through spring wildflowers</p></div>
</div>
<div>And now we come to weapons. I&#8217;ve thought hard about getting a firearm or at least a realistic BB gun that I could brandish. I&#8217;m not attracted to guns but I know how to handle one and I&#8217;m a pretty good shot. But after all this time of never encountering a situation where a gun was even remotely necessary, I can&#8217;t help but think that by getting one, I&#8217;ll be inviting that kind of darkness into my life. I am not unarmed, however. <a title="Xmas Ice Axe!" href="http://theblondecoyote.com/2013/01/06/xmas-ice-axe/" target="_blank">My trusty ice axe</a> hangs on the door of the trailer, as a subtle warning to passersby. It looks intimidating as hell and I can wield it as if my life depends on it (<a title="The Suffer Fest" href="http://theblondecoyote.com/2011/07/06/the-suffer-fest/" target="_blank">sometimes, in the mountains, it does</a>). My trailer door locks from the inside and if anybody ever tries to force their way in, they&#8217;ll meet the two-foot long razor sharp machete I keep handy, not to mention my two beastly dogs. Personally, I sleep very well at night.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div id="attachment_10883" style="width: 740px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/p6254019.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-10883" src="http://theblondecoyote.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/p6254019.jpg?w=730&#038;h=1024" alt="My ferocious hounds! They're sweet dogs but they look out for me and if they don't like somebody, I pay attention. "   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">What ferocity!  Look at those teeth! Seriously, they&#8217;re good, sweet dogs but they look out for me.</p></div>
</div>
<div>So, to Cathy: can you sleep safely in a tent? Sure, I did for years <a title="Teardrop Dreams… Coming True!" href="http://theblondecoyote.com/2012/03/21/teardrop-dreams-coming-true/" target="_blank">before I got the Teardrop</a>. But if you&#8217;re skittish, you&#8217;ll probably sleep much more soundly if you have a door you can lock at night. Also, stop worrying about whether you&#8217;ll like traveling and go traveling. Take a few solo day trips and then work your way up to overnights, then weekends, <a title="Hey Blonde Coyote, Will You Plan My Road Trip?" href="http://theblondecoyote.com/2014/06/18/hey-blonde-coyote-will-you-plan-my-road-trip/" target="_blank">and see how far you get.</a> You don&#8217;t have to go full nomad to find out if there&#8217;s a road warrior in you. And Cassie: can a baseball bat work for self-defense? Sure, but if you only get one swing, wouldn&#8217;t you rather be wielding a machete? <span class='wp-smiley emoji emoji-wink' title=';)'>;)</span></div>

<p>I got up around 5:30am wide awake today, for no apparent reason, but it gave me a bit of extra time to get ready for picking up our flatbed trailer from <a href="http://www.longhaultrailersales.com/" target="_blank">Long Haul Trailer Sales</a> in Atwood, Ontario. I got to drive it for the first time, back to our new home at <a href="http://www.twosistersriver.ca/" target="_blank">Two Sisters River</a> in Guelph, ON, a nice 75 km country drive.</p>
<p>It took a bit of organizing, but here it sits now in downtown Guelph, as we prepare to begin our build any day now! We will be posting event days in advance, for anyone interested in helping out or simply coming by to say hello.</p>
<p>The trailer is a deck-between, straight trailer, 8.5&#8242; x 20&#8242;, with tandem 5200lb axles and electric brakes. In place of a wood deck, we had the trailer customized with steel crossbars running across the width every 16 inches. The chassis itself is a 3.5&#8243; steel c-frame, which is a bit thin, width-wise, but was made intentionally so, as the subfloor of our tiny house will be built using 2&#215;4&#8242;s, which are actually 3.5&#8243; wide and not actually 4&#8243;. This means that the subfloor can be dropped into the chassis, resting on the steel crossbars, and will be flush with the chassis itself. The 2&#215;4&#8242;s will be lagged into the trailer frame, meaning we will have to drill through the steel and wood to connect the wood and metal. At that point, the wood and steel will support each other and be of sufficient strength to hold the house.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really happening now&#8230; I guess we have a lot of work to do!</p>
