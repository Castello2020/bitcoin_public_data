Code Geass: Boukoku no Akito First Movie Teaser Streamed
Posted by: Wantei The official website of Code Geass: Boukoku no Akito (コードギアス 亡国のアキト) has started streaming a 10-minute teaser of first part of the movie which had been premiered on August 4. Japanese visitors can view the original teaser on the official website. As for the rest of the world, I’ve embedded a ripped Youtube video below. After the premiere of the first episode of the movie, fans have given good responses. Sadly for us, we have to wait till the release of the DVD of the Blu-Ray. If Pre-Orders are available I will be updating you guys.
The first episode of the movie Code Geass: Boukoku no Akito : Yokuryuu wa Maiorita (コードギアス 亡国のアキト : 翼竜は舞い降りた) had received the 12th place in the Japanese box-office.
