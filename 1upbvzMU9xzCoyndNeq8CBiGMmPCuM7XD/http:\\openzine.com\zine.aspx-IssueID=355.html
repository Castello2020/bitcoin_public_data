HumbyZinehttp://www.ownzee.com/Humby Kiki Valdes Welcome to OpenZine. 4/24/2008 3:45:00 PMHi I’m Humby and I started this with my brother Kiki. He’s the painter dude in your subscribers list. You should check out his artwork. So we created OpenZine so you can create really amazing things and display it with equal quality. You don’t need to know any html or image editing or any of that. All you need is an idea. We’ve invented tools to help you get your ideas out to the world. The best way to describe what OpenZine is by understanding how magazines work. Magazines have a staff of writers, photographers, designers, illustrators and editors that create & contribute. Here at OpenZine you create & contribute on those same principles but your resources are other OpenZine users! Just imagin you’re creating a zine about your vacation to Miami. You need a picture of the beach but you don’t have one. No worries, you can clip your friends With OpenZine you can create with the same soul of a zine but with the legs of the internet. We created all the tools you’ll need and networked it all together so you can share your pictures, writings and videos with everyone you want. How it began all the way back in 19934/24/2008 5:09:00 PM
OpenZine began as an idea in 1993 to create a publication that was open to ideas from different perspectives and multiple sources. As it grew, readers would send in letters, articles & pictures that were often included in issues. OpenZine would later become one of the most acclaimed Zine’s of it’s time. Back then, the heart of OpenZine was heavily based on layout and graphics. Aside from its initial success, OpenZine hit hard times. Then later Kiki went off to college. Humby fell into deep depression thinking his life’s passion was dead. All was lost! OpenZine would never publish another issue, so he thought… Seven years later, on a drive up to Tallahassee to visit Humby’s daughter, lighting hit! Print is dead but OpenZine can live again! In 2008 that original idea from 1993 advanced to allow everyone to create their very own version of OpenZine. Giving users all the possible tools they'll need to discover, create and socially share information. Kiki Valdes The Mood of Lost Time4/26/2008 5:49:00 AMHey, this was written about me, enjoy! Kiki Valdes is a 26 year old painter who's figurative abstractions have attracted the likes of collectors, poets, ivy league college movement groups. Kiki has also created commissioned pieces at over 10 other institutions across the U.S. As Art News art critic and Author of "The End of the Art World" Robert C. Morgan puts it...." Kiki Valdes is a painter whose color captures the mood of lost time, the mythic moment that ascends to the surface, the love and the angst that seek solace within the subtle textures of his compositions." His friends are the ones that promote him best, with a long line of friends ranging from Carlos Slim to Columba Bush. His paintings had the chance in 2006 of being included in an important Latino exhibit at the Florida State Capital, where Kiki Valdes managed to share the exhibition catalog with Latin American Masters Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, Rufino Tamayo and Roberto Matta. Kiki will also be creating a commissioned piece in April at a private art reception by Telefonica for the IDB Collection at Miami's historic Freedom Tower Art Center.
