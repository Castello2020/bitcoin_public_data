Rude Boy Style Guys Who Date Nutty Women2/3/2011 1:54:00 PM You've dated a woman like this. In all likelihood, your friends sounded alarms that you willfully ignored. Looking back, you realize that even you knew it could only end badly. She's the Crazy Girl--the one who made everyone wonder about your sanity and fear for your future. She may have taken the form of the quiet, shy girl, the women who is always the victim or the unhinged bitter baby mama. Whatever her identity, chances are she was intoxicatingly sexy, intense, unstable, and impossible to be at ease around in social settings. She was completely and debilitatingly exhausting. So why the hell was she so compelling?
I have a few reason on why men are atracted to loopy girls, matter of fact my closest friend knew exactly how to pick the ones who should have been in the hospital for evaluation. Personally, I think guys secretly like the drama. Maybe it makes them feel alive or brings some action to their otherwise dull lives. Or, perhaps it reminds them of the chaos of their own family life as a child (wow, how Dr. Phil am I today?) Or, they could just be weak guys who like being dominated and repressed.
1. Men love to be heroes. They love to “fix” things. It makes them feel needed, important, and feeds the male ego. Who makes a better damsel in distress than a poor, defenseless lunachic? Note to guys: a woman is not like a house. Fixer-uppers do not usually turn out to be a wise investment. If you need to fix something, there are plenty of us normal single girls out there who need some light bulbs changed.
2. If she’s crazy day to day, chances are she’s crazy in the sack. But men don’t really care about sex that much, do they? Wait … I think they might.
3.He has mommy issues. If a guy had a dysfunctional mother (or primary family member) he may not actually be aware that his lady’s behavior is NOT normal. There’s no shame in going to therapy and working that stuff out.
4. Need to figure out your future career? Money troubles? Feeling anxious or depressed? Having a GF with problems much worse than your own is a wonderful distraction. Warning: she will only make your problems worse.
5. He is not ready for a real intimate and committed relationship, and we all pick the wrong kind of person when we’re not ready. As soon as he envisions a lifetime of cracked-out antics, chances are he’ll be on the road to Mrs. Rightville, ASAP.
The undeniable fact is that crazy women have a reputation for being fun in the sack. A lot more lose so to speak and have few inhibitions when it comes to pleasing a guy. So the man has this notion that he wants to date this crazy women so that he can have sex with her and have a wild time. The fact is that he probably does have a great time and it is insanely wild, but when he wakes up in the morning is when his life becomes a nightmare. The crazy women are not so sweet in the morning and have gotten his phone number, address and probably some other personal information while he was asleep. For the man who had this crazy woman and is married then he can kiss his marriage goodbye because she will make it her mission to destroy it. Does any of this sound familiar like the move Fatal Attraction? Well it is and the problem being is that we a have a new generation of men that have not seen the movie and are about to make the biggest mistake of their lives.
This is a reminder article to all of you men out there, to stay away from the crazy women and spend your time dating the nice girls, you know the ones that mom would approve of! One night of wild sex is not worth a year of living hell!!

We are really excited for this new one! We are kicking off our new issue with the hot to trot Ms. Lissa Lee. She's new to modeling but we couldn't help adding her after we saw the awesome pinup photo shoot she did with photographer Marilee Caruso. Caruso took the photo that we used for this issue's cover. We feel Lissa has a bright future and we are happy we are introducing her to you all! We will get right to it. Much support to all our friends checking out the issues. If you are interested in advertising with us, please message us! We are starting to get a lot of traffic thanks to all the fans. Enjoy ! I heard you hurt your nose recently, that's awful. What happened?
My boyfriend accidentally kneed me in the face trying to get out of bed. I’ve never broken a bone before and was instantly in tears. He felt so bad! Luckily, it’s just a little bit of cracked cartilage.
Are you a very active person?
I try to be. Idle hands are the devil’s tools. ;-P
How did you get into modeling? How long have you been involved?
A family friend modeled a lot for Ama Lea Photography and I just fell in love with their work. Ama is located in SoCal so when I heard she was coming to NorCal I jumped all over it. My Valentine’s Day Pinup shoot with Ama was my first ever shoot. That was back in January 2009.
I don't want to be stereotypical but your very curvy for an Asian girl, what do you eat? lol
Haha! A lot of junk food and candy. I have a huge sweet tooth. I can easily spend $70 at a candy store. I eat a lot on general. I eat more than some of my guy friends. I LOVE food. Like literally love food. Everyone always jokes that I should be 300 pounds.
Your pinup work really caught our attention, are you going to do a lot more of that?
I hope so! I have a passion for pinup. One of these days I’d like to make a pinup calendar.
What type of photo shoots are your favorite?
Pinups for sure! I find there tends to be more laughs and energy at pinup shoots. I live to laugh.
Do you dream a lot? If so what was the last dream you have that you can remember? What do you think it meant?
I dream A LOT. I always remember them when I first wake up but I forget majority of them about 10 minutes later. The most recent dream I can remember was about a zombie apocalypse in an old western town. It was pretty intense. I think the dream meant…I love zombies and gore…and apparently westerns.
When was the last time you cried for being upset?
When my nose was the target of my boyfriend’s knee. Haha.
When was the last time you cried for being happy?
A week or two ago. I was just so overwhelmed with happiness and love for my boyfriend that it brought me to tears. I’m really cheesy and sentimental. I’ve been told I should write for Hallmark. He really does a lot for me and I’m very lucky to have him in my life. We’re both really lucky we found each other.
If you can describe what kind of guys you like but use a Hollywood actor as an example, who would that be and why?
Hahaha....it’s a very wide spectrum. From Seth Rogen to Johnny Depp. You could even throw in some Jay Baruchel and Danny Trejo. And does Kevin Pereira count as a Hollywood actor? I don’t base guys off of their looks. I base guys on how well they can make me laugh (Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Kevin Pereira)…and I guess I have a thing for tough guys/bad boys (Johnny Depp, Danny Trejo).
What are huge turn on's for you?
Tattoos!! Nerd talk too. I’ll stop at that. Don’t want to get myself in trouble. Haha.
You’re Korean right? I actually live in a huge Korean area right now...and I've heard the food isn't very good. But I've never tried. But other people tell me it's awesome...can you cook? Do you like Korean food?
I’m Korean and Japanese, but don’t know much about either culture. I was adopted from Korea as a baby by a Chinese family. I don’t eat much Korean food but I would highly recommend Korean BBQ. And yes, I can cook! I actually love cooking and baking. I find it very therapeutic. It all ties in with my love for food.
What do you want to do next?
I have a growing list of modeling goals/dreams. I never expected to actually get into modeling. I just wanted to do it for fun. But it’s become a big part of my life now. I’m super excited for an upcoming photo shoot with Roy Varga. I’ve been a fan of his work for such a long time. I never thought I’d get the chance to work with him.
You have a boyfriend, how is your daily relationship like?
I do have a boyfriend. Our daily relationship is filled with...video games, television, movies, joking around, and love :-P We’re huge on movies. We own about 400 DVDs and have Netflix. We watch at least one movie a day. We’re just a couple of moving watching Xbox playing nerds, and I wouldn’t change a thing.
How does he feel about your modeling?
He’s very supportive of my modeling and is proud of me.
Where can new fans find you?
You can find my modeling page on Facebook. http://http://www.facebook.com/pages/Lissa-Lee/144503018927192 Tell us an embarrassing story?
Oh, there are lots of them. I’m a huge klutz and I’m really jumpy so embarrassing things happen to me all the time. The one story that sticks out the most in my head I’m way too embarrassed to tell. Let’s just say it was very unladylike.
Anything you like to say the readers out there?
Thanks for taking the time to read this interview! Hope I didn’t bore anyone ;-P Happy 2011! Wishing everyone health and happiness. Rude Boy Style Crazy Shit That Happen to Black People2/9/2011 11:24:00 PM1. “The Corner Store”. Also known as “The Chinese Store” or “The Ghetto Store.” Unlike a bodega, the corner store only sells Newports, beer, blunts, candy, gum, Chinese food, single-use Tylenol PM, snack foods, soda, 3-pack condoms, and phone cards. Nothing sold here is meant to be used tomorrow – you can ONLY get what you want for TODAY from a corner store. Plus none of it is healthy, premium, worth what it costs, or assumes that you will have any needs in the future. In short, the corner store caters to straight up check-to-check livin’. To top it all off, you usually pay the Korean shop owner through a bulletproof divider – rather dehumanizing. Let’s walk the few extra blocks to a real store from now on. Along the Same Lines: Check Cashing spots.
2. “Talking/Acting White”. After being told I ‘talk white’ for most of my life I now find myself surrounded by other people who have been accused of the same (just ask ill mami). Is that because “white is right”? OBVIOUSLY not! It’s because somehow black folks started believing that speaking standard English, reading, and even extra-curricular activities in high school are for people who ‘act white,’ but these are the same exact people who are now able to contribute something to society besides grunts and lip smacks. I actually spent a fair amount of energy trying to ‘talk black’ around 7th grade just to fit in, all the while listening to Def Leppard on the sly. What a waste.
3. “Bling”. The hottest chain, the hottest car, the hottest brands. We spend a whole lot of time and energy trying to make other people think we have money and in the process stay broke. It makes no sense.
4. “Baby Daddy/Baby Momma”. I’m not going to rant about the decline of the black family (or the decline in my personal dating prospects) and the extent to which single parenthood has become expected in our community. Just as troubling are the terms themselves and people referring to themselves as someone’s “Baby Daddy/Momma.” I once dated an SEBD (Someone Else’s Baby Daddy) whose BM called his office and when the receptionist asked who was calling she replied “Oh, this is his Baby’s Momma,” as if the term is generally accepted. No. Just no.
5. “Cheesy Pan-Africanism”. This includes all things related to Kwanzaa, kente cloth, and cowrie shells. Nothing is inherently wrong with any of these things, it’s the lack of understanding and willy-nilly identification with cultures we know little about that is cheesy. You may think that these X-clan-gear days are behind us but judging by that fresh fake kente cloth boot, they clearly are not. Can us slave descendant black folk just agree that we’re our own squad descended from of mix African slaves, Europeans, and Native American Indians and leave it at that instead of trying to be all randomly African for no good reason?
6. “Nigglature”. Ninjagirrl, an avid reader who coined the term “nigglature”, wrote that its distinguishing characteristics include rampant typos, weakly bound spines, and even weaker plots: a young fatherless girl who wants to get out of the projects turns to her local drug dealer for help and then gets involved in sex, drugs, hip-hop, the church, and/or other Negro things. Not literature. Just nigglature. Published books aren’t supposed to have typos! The next time you have the urge to read a book with a title like “Thong on Fire,” or “Holy Hustler,” get a bag of salt & vinegar potato chips instead. I swear it will be just as satisfying.
7. “Conks and Curls”. The day the first black man to chemically straighten his hair put in that first touch-up black consciousness died a little. Even the more ‘evolved’ conks (Jheri Curls, S-curls, Leisure Curls, and all other ‘taco meat’ hair) turn an attractive black man into a wack dude instantly. And don’t think that combing a little texturizer through it is something we don’t notice, fellas. If all of the energy black men have spent processing their hair in the last 50 years could be somehow gathered and applied to, say, fighting oppression in America, we wouldn’t have to be bothered with Al Sharpton today in more ways than one.
American MuscleCar Goals In Life2/9/2011 11:06:00 PMThese cars are a passion of mine that have been so since before I could drive. During my lifetime I have owned a great many of them. I would very much like to create a business based of buying and selling these cars in order to help promote the vehicles and to introduce them to a new generation of drivers and owners. So much of the American history is reflected in these cars. They were made during a time when 1 out of 5 jobs in America were automotive related. The American car company's drove the United States economy and nearly everyone in America drove an American made car. Those were days that are now long gone. Now over half the cars on the road do not even have American names on them. And while cars today may as a general rule last longer than these hunks of steel and iron, they will not as a rule be collected by anyone in the next 40 or 50 years. What exactly is the thing that people find with these cars and what makes them want to own one?
In my opinion it is a combination of things. First off, there is the raw power they had. How many cars today can say they put out 300 horsepower? Back in 1970, nearly every muscle car not only had 300 horsepower but several claimed 375 to 400 horsepower. Of course they lied back then. One manufacturer that claimed 375 horsepower had a production vehicle dyno'd by an automotive magazine at the time and the horsepower figure was actually 430 horsepower. That is not a typo. The car makers underrated their power figures to try to appease the insurance companies and to not make the upstairs brass overly nervous about the true raw power they were selling to the general public. The hemi powered Dart that Dodge sold to the public in the early 1960's is still running down dragstrips all across America and still unbeaten and setting records over 50 years later. Another thing that makes these cars so in demand is the fact that you can actually work on them. Without anything more than hand tools you can change the heads and perform all the repair work on these motors. No vacuum hose diagrams and serpentine belt diagrams needed to put them back together. No pollution equipment save for the cars from California which had smog pumps to circulate exhaust gas. You could tune up your car with only a timing light and a dwell meter. No engine computor diagnosis machine or Sun machine needed. You set the engine rpm and timing by ear on most of them and they ran like the wind. And then there's the style of these beasts. Front air dams and rear spoilers and hood scoops and real chrome on real metal. If you ran into another car or even a sign it was steel against steel and it never cost 4000 dollars for a complete plastic front facia like today's cars. So I guess the reason so many people love these cars is just simply....why wouldn't you?

It was always me & you, plus two (jontae & corey) You left the same way you came in...alone If only I had known, I would have made you come home. Who knew your silence was screaming. If only I could take back yesterday, maybe I would have found something better to say. Assuring you that everything would be okay.

THE GOOD OLE 80'S-THE BREAKFAST CLUB2/9/2011 11:11:00 PM
Spider Monkey The Breakfast Club2/9/2011 11:09:00 PM John Hughes made an extrodinary film in 1985, about four teenagers with problems who spend a their Saturday in detention.
The thing that I learned most with this movie is that you cannot judge people on their apperence. You need to get to know before you criticize and lable someone for their looks. Molly Ringwald plays a rich yuppy who ditched class to shop. She seems to enjoy doing what she does, but is not happy with her parents rules because they use each other to get back at her. Judd Nelson on the other hand plays the bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks who often spends time in detention for his poor behavior and bad judgement. People just see him as a criminal.
Alley Sheedy plays the girl who is often looked down upon for her quietness and wearing black all the time. They all assume she's the freak of the group and in which she's not she's ignored half the time and by her parents.
Michael Anthony Hall is the nerd who never does anything wrong and gets straight A's. But he failed shop and thought it'd be a good idea to blow his head off with a flare gun. It goes off and he gets detention with the rest of the gang. He's not happy because he's pressured to do very well or else.
Emilio Estevez plays the jock who's father rides him hard. He ends up in detention for putting tape on another guys rump and rips it off causing a major scene and embarresment. He finally learns that it was not funny what he did.
I love this movie because it teaches you, hey it's not cool to judge based on apperence. Really get to know someone. You could really hurt someone's feelings by making fun of someone.
