Description
This upload consists of 2 parts:
1) How to change your WINDOWS 7 STARTER wallpaper
2) 36 great wallpapers for Netbook 1024 x 600 pixel screen (best of collection. Art, Animals, Fantasy, Girls etc)
UPDATED 28.2. 8:10 pm (+2 UTC) Earlier upload today had some issues - fixed now! Download this if problems earlier today - tested and working !
Are you finally tired of staring at the boring 7 Starter wallpaper ? Maybe even getting very angry with Microsoft and asking them rightly: So MS, why am i not allowed to change my Starter wallpaper ?
Here's a very small program (or script) + 36 great wallpapers (no offending pics) to change your wallpaper
in just seconds. Easy to use - info text file included.
NOTE: This might not work if you launch the app (or script) from your desktop. Sometimes it's also best to run it under administrative rights. And don't change the name of the app, because it might stop working after renaming it!
Comment if it works with your Netbook ? We have 2 netbooks, works like a dream on both
(Asus EEE 1015 PN and Acer Aspire One 532H)
Enjoy !
