If you are installing this on a PC, it is recommended that you use Pear PC to install it. This OS WILL run on a PC with only a few limitations reply

I can't get it installed.
I have three seperate disks burned from a Mac.
Will not respond by using the C key to install.
the mac 10.1 wants me to restart to start install and that is as far as it gets.
HELP! reply

They should be able to be burned from a PC if you use a program like ActiveISO burner. That will keep/put it in an ISO format to be recognized by your Mac. reply
