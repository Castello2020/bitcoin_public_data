The Psychology of Success
Learn how to think and act like the most successful and highest paid people in our society. A blueprint for peak performance and high achievement.
(6 CDs, approximately 7 hours long)
Session 1: The Psychology of Success
Brian shares the two steps you must take to achieve greater success. You learn the importance of high self-esteem in creating your own success pattern. Then he reveals 15 thought patterns for success ? concepts that can take you to the very top in record time.
Session 2: The Psychology of Failure
By helping you to thoroughly understand failure and its root causes, Brian helps you to avoid it. You learn the value of delaying gratification. He clearly demonstrates that through self-discipline, you can create a new "comfort zone" ? one that practically guarantees your ultimate success.
Session 3: The Principle of Purpose
In this session, you make a most amazing discovery: how to activate your success mechanism at will and focus it on meaningful goals. And you learn to override your failure mechanism. You free yourself from the devastating gravitational pull of your E-Factor.
Session 4: The Principle of Excellence
True success comes only when you commit to excellence in whatever you do. All that is required is a slight edge over your competitors. And Brian Tracy shows you how to gain that edge. It's a simple formula you can immediately put into action.
Session 5: The Principle of Responsibility
Are you suffering from negative emotions, denial and stress? Brian gives you a tool to eliminate them all. And then shows you how to reuse the same tool to attain peak performance. You learn why high achievers welcome responsibility.
Session 6: The Principle of Service
In this session, Brian Tracy tells you that by giving others more than they ask, you get much more than you expect in return. You hear and begin testing the validity of The Iron Law of Human Destiny and The Law of Service. You'll want to put them to work for you immediately.
Session 7: The Principle of Concentration
By using your powers of concentration and analysis, you notice what needs doing and you do it. You find Brian's distinction between "urgent" work and "important" work quite insightful. You begin focusing on those areas in your life where excellent performance will make an extraordinary difference.
Session 8: The Principle of Cooperation
Discover what most high achievers have found ? no one can become a great success without the aid of others. And on this extraordinary cassette side Brian shares with you the core ideas, tips and pointers that enable you quickly to gain the confidence and help of others.
Session 9: The Principle of Creativity
Because creativity favors the prepared mind, Brian shows you how to ready your mind for an influx of great ideas. He shows you how to capitalize on your intuitive powers. You also gain new ways to stimulate creativity in yourself and others. You learn the seven-step method for problem solving.
Session 10: The Principle of Self-Development
Discover the Law of Accumulation. Put it to work in your life. By devoting just an hour or two a day to your own self-development, you begin to attract not only opportunities, but the right people to help you capitalize on them. These people enter your life at just the right time.
Session 11: The Principle of Integrity
In this session, Brian helps us to understand the many meanings of the word "integrity." You come to understand The Universal Maxim and why you should never compromise your integrity for anyone or anything. Integrity is the keystone that guarantees self-esteem, self-confidence, inner peace and great success.
Session 12: The Principle of Courage
Hear how to conquer your fears and develop your courage, making unshakable commitments to your career, your goals, your relationships and your success. How persistence works hand in hand with courage. And how it works in conjunction with all the principles on this CD program.
