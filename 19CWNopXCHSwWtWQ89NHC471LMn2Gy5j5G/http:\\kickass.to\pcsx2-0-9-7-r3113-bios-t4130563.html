Description
PCSX2 0.9.7 Beta release!!
There it is! Look at these improvements :
# New GUI based on wxWidgets working on a separate thread
# microVU, an all new VU0/VU1/COP2 recompiler
# VIF rewritten and a new Vif Unpack recompiler
# IPU improvements, many more videos now play perfectly
# Stable full screen operation with GSdx
# Alt+Enter Hotkey for real-time fullscreen/window mode switching
# Many new emulation options, complete with tooltips
# New MTGS, much more efficient and compatible
# New BIOS skipping method, more compatible and correct
# New Host File System Support
# Turbo/Slow motion settings for the frame limiter
# On the fly changing of settings and plugins
# Threaded Saving/Loading states, so it does not pause gameplay
# Built in ISO reader with a recently used ISO list
# Suspend / Resume emulation safely and fast
# Simplified plugin configuration dialog, with more options
# Full DVD9 game support (for example God of War, Xenosaga, Gran Turismo 4 etc)
# First time configuration wizard
# Settings stored in your User documents folder by default to prevent Vista / Windows 7 permission issues
# New Game database detects the game you run, displays compatibility info, and auto applies special game fixes/patches if needed
# Cheats are now separate from patches, cheats can be placed in the "cheats" folder and enabled/disabled from pcsx2’s file-menu
# Many important plugin updates, GSdx has many bugs and memory leaks fixed, SPU2-X makes dozens of games boot which never did before
# And a huge amount of improvements and bug fixes which we don’t remember anymore
