• 30 May 2011, 17:27 ENGLISH READERS? ok...Here's how to convert to English..
On the install with Daemon. When autorun runs the install, the first screen you will see is the one with the STARSHIP TROOPERS in the upper left hand corner of the screen. Click the 1st box on the left..next click the 2nd box from the left..The 3rd screen is where you click the middle box to drop down to ENGLISH. Then install like usual. I hope that helps other people, because that was one pain in the ass! All Comments
please, leave only comments related to that torrent

As Ears14U already said, for english language do this during installation:
On the first window (where "STARSHIP TROOPS" is written in big letters on the top, left hand side), 1 click first box
2 click 2nd box from left
3 click middle box which is a drop down menu, select "English"
4 click middle button
5 click middle button
6 click middle button
7 click the only button available
done & done
Oh, and thanks for the game by the way. I attempted the first level five times and failed. It's a bit demotivating to start all the way from the beginning again reply

Hi, I could make it work for me.
My computer specs are:
---------------------------
OS: Windows 7 x64
CPU: Intel i5 2500K (HD3000)
---------------------------
I applied the patch: "Starship Troopers Global Patch 5.24", but the black screen still persisted. Then I found Sharenok's Tip and that made it work. Besides this, here are my in-game-settings:
Video Mode: 1600 x 900
Terrain Shadows: High
Model Shadows: High
Soft Shadows: on
Adaptive Quality: Best Quality
----------------------------------
These settings are grayed out:
Model detail: Low
Effect Quality: Low
----------------------------------
Dynamic Light Quality: Highest
Testure Quality: High
Shader Quality: Medium
HUD Fade: 5
Crosshair Fade: 5 reply
