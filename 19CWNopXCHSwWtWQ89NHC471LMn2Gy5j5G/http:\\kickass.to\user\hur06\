That's fine. Although I don't know jdjackson, I had a PM from him; and I voted for him in a Avatar competition. I did it not for your friend, rather I was convinced that he has a better avatar in comparison to others'. 1

This is not important that Dali said it; rather it is important to know that no intelligence can exist without any ambition. Small or large, this type or that - there must be an ambition in every human being because we represent the most intelligence group on earth.
Other animals have intelligence; that is a different chapter to discuss. 0
