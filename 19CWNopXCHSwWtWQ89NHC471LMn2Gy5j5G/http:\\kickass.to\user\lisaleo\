uploads 68 please like my idea :)... Idea: Cam category sectionI think we need a section we cam copies can go into would give an easier option when finding a movie instead of it being mixed in with all other formats Would keep things in order and easy to see / find
to save confusion here when we change torrent there is no cam cat in the sub categories so we have to put it in just movies i want there to be a cam category so just like with hignes movies it will say movies an then sub cat ..cam
this is basically a tool mods use to put movies in the right place so normal users don't see this in New Category Suggestions30 12 weeks ago updated	3 days ago
