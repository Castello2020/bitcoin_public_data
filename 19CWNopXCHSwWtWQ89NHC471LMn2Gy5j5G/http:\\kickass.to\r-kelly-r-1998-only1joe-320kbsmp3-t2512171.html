Description
R. Kelly - R 1998 only1joe 320kbsMP3
Wikipedia - R. is the third studio and the first double album released by American singer-songwriter R. Kelly in the united States on July 3, 1998 (see 1998 in music). At this point in his career, Kelly had not only become a hitmaker due to his successful solo albums but also a hit-making songwriter and producer for acts such as Aaliyah, Changing Faces, Michael and Janet Jackson, The Isley Brothers, Quincy Jones, Mary J. Blige, Luther Vandross, The Winans, Toni Braxton, Gladys Knight and countless others. This album was his most diverse project and would go on to be his best-selling record to date, selling over 10 million copies in the United States alone.
Amazon.com Review By Rebecca Wallwork - A double disc may seem indulgent after barely a decade in the biz, but after meandering through the commercial minefields of innocent fun (1992's Born into the '90s), pure raunch (1993's 12 Play), and pop crossover (1995's R. Kelly), Kelly has come close to the perfect mix--and if it takes two discs to do so, why not? There are still moments of indulgence (the forced theatrics of "The Opera"), and the occasional venture into mediocrity ("Did You Ever Think?"), but the sheer funk of tracks like "Home Alone" (a head-bobber featuring Keith Murray) and "Dollar Bill" (featuring--surprise!--Foxy Brown) allows you to overlook such cracks in the formula. Other bit players in this star vehicle include Cam'Ron, Noreaga, Jay-Z, Nas, and (yes) Celine Dion.
