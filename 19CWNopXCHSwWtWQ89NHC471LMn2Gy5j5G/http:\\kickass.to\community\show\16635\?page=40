A Few Tips: Before posting in this thread please use the 'Search query' feature and if it's not available here at KAT then proceed to ask, if you need help or just starting out, it's OK to post anyway. * also when you search you then click 'age' to bring up the latest offering/s Peeps who fill requests * No Links To any Hosting Sites (use the PM if you must and let folks know you have filled it here in a comment saying PM'd) * It's OK to provide links to other torrent sites providing it's a torrent site that does not host it's own torrents or promotes a live/dead tracker/s with their site name (Both Torrent/Magnet)
* you can always provide a Hash Code and send them to the thelocalbay.com (thelocalbay.com is not a torrent site but a magnet creator)
* and do say thankyou. If you got any TV show request post it here. And i will see what i can do.
READ FIRST
Don't request two or more shows at the same time please. So basically each members is allowed the request one show at the time and can only request another show when his/her previous request is fulfilled
REQUEST RULES The fullname of the show, season, epsiode, IMDb link.
Before you request be sure you can't find the torrent here on KAT Last edited by Bubanee, 11 months ago quote

about mythbusters s10e8 bouncing bullet:
im wondering aswell, im a big mythbusters fan, but i dont get discovery here, and the national stations are a bit over 4 years behind. assuming that they actually buy the rights for season 10, id still love to see the episode before 2016

Still no sign of EP8 on here or any of the other sites I use.
It was deffinatly shown as I have checked the discovery website, epguide, wiki & TV.com and they all say it aired.
