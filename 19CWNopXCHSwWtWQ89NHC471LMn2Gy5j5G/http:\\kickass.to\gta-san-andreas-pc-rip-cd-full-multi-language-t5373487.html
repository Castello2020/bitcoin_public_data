GTA San Andreas [PC-RIP-CD] MULTI LANGUAGEGE
========================================
Game Info
============
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a sandbox-style action-adventure computer and video game developed by Rockstar North in the United Kingdom. It is the third 3D game in the Grand Theft Auto video game franchise, the fifth original console release and eighth game overall. Originally released for the PlayStation 2 in October 2004,[2] the game has since been released for the Xbox and Microsoft Windows (PC) in June 2005, and has received wide acclaim and high sales figures on all three platforms, and is the best-selling game of all time on PlayStation 2. It was made available on Steam on January 4, 2008.[12] Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was succeeded by Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories and was preceded by Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.
The game is set in the fictional state of San Andreas, which is based on Nevada, California, and Arizona, comprising three metropolitan cities, Los Santos, based on Los Angeles, San Fierro, based on San Francisco and Las Venturas, based on Las Vegas, with deserts, rivers, forests and a mountain separating the cities. Set in late 1992,[13] San Andreas revolves around the gang member Carl "CJ" Johnson returning home from Liberty City to Los Santos, San Andreas, after learning of his mother's murder. Johnson finds his old friends and family in disarray. Over the course of the game, Johnson gradually unravels the plot behind his mother's murder while exploring his own business ventures. Like other games in the series, San Andreas is composed of elements from driving games and third-person shooters, and features "open-world" gameplay that gives the player more control over their playing experience. The game adds a number of features, such as car customization, and character personalization.
Much like the previous and subsequent entries in the Grand Theft Auto series, San Andreas's critical and commercial success has not been without controversy. The most notable controversy was over the explicit "Hot Coffee" sex minigame found on the Microsoft Windows game, which was disabled but left within the game's code. Its discovery led San Andreas to be re-rated in the United States briefly as an adults only game and was taken from retailers' shelves in the US. After the 'Hot Coffee' minigame code was removed, the game was re-rated as M for mature again.
