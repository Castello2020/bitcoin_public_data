Description
Windows Loader v2.1.7
The safe and easy way to activate Windows.
About
This is the loader application that's used by millions of people worldwide, well known for passing Microsoft's WAT (Windows Activation Technologies) and is arguably the safest Windows activation exploit ever created. The application itself injects a SLIC (System Licensed Internal Code) into your system before Windows boots; this is what fools Windows into thinking it's genuine.
The things you might want to know
It works on 32-bit and 64-bit systems
It's compatible with Windows 7 SP1 and all system updates
It's compatible with all system languages
It can be used to pre-activate Windows
It allows you to install custom OEM information
It features application integrity checking
It supports hidden partitions and some complex setups
It can work alongside Linux's GRUB or any other boot manager
It works with VMware, VirtualBox and Hyper-V
It works with most hard drive encryption software e.g. TrueCrypt or BitLocker
It allows you to add your own certificates and serials externally
It will install just the certificate and serial for users with an existing SLIC 2.1
It features automated system profiling (The application matches everything up for you)
It won't modify any system files
It runs before Windows is launched
No extra processes are run so you have nothing eating at your RAM
All key parts of the loader are encrypted with a custom encryption
Every user has a unique version of the loader installed on his or her system

Note: You must be running build 7600 or greater for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.
Note: I don't recommend using any of the Windows 7 E editions.
Note: Windows 7 N editions will only be supported when OEM SLP serials leak.
Application integrity checking?
Hover your mouse over the green, amber or red icon to see detailed application information.
Note: Even if the icon is green someone might have found a way around the protection system so it's worth checking that the applications path is always the same as the location from which you launched the application. You should also check that the MD5 matches the MD5 found online.
Virus scanner results
All virus scanner detection's are a false-positive as long as the MD5 matches. Simply turn off your anti-virus while installing the loader.
MD5: 269632a286f976f8c14873345fd989a6
SHA-1: 3a0fe8b574d685ae9ed5f1ee6ecf50086ddfdd2f
Note: The hashes are for the executable file and not the zip file.
