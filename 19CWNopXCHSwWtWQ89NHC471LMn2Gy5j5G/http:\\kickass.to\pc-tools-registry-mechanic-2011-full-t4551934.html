Optimize your registry and speed up your PC!:
-----------------------------------------------------------
With Registry Mechanic you can safely clean, repair and optimize your Windows® registry with a few simple mouse clicks! Problems with the Windows registry are a common cause of Windows crashes, slow performance and error messages. By regularly using a registry cleaner to fix registry errors your system will be faster, more stable and system performance will improve without expensive hardware upgrades. Learn more about the importance of a clean registry with our registry insight.
Registry Mechanic uses a high-performance detection algorithm to quickly identify missing and invalid references in your Windows registry. Normal daily use, installing and uninstalling software, missing or corrupt hardware drivers, and surfing the Internet can corrupt registry entries – slowing your PC down and even crashing it. With a few easy steps, Registry Mechanic will scan your entire registry for any invalid entries in the Windows registry and provide a detailed list of all registry errors found. You can then choose to selectively clean each item or automatically repair them all. For your convenience and protection, Registry Mechanic makes a backup of any repairs made so that you can easily recover any changes if needed.
NEW! Protect your Internet privacy. Registry Mechanic helps to protect your Internet privacy by ensuring all traces of your online Internet and computer activities are permanently erased and unrecoverable on your PC. Information from every website you visit from your computer is stored and recorded in hidden Windows locations including temporary files, cookies, the system registry and the index.dat file. Web browsers only provide partial privacy protection by allowing some temporary Internet browsing files and cookies to be deleted, but they do not clean data out of all hidden files nor do they delete the history securely. BONUS! Permanently delete files and bleach unused hard disk space. Registry Mechanic now includes secure file shredding to keep all of your personal and sensitive data away from prying eyes. It also bleaches your free hard disk space for extra protection. Just because you emptied your Windows Recycle Bin does not mean your documents and files are gone. Using simple recovery software, anyone can easily restore these previously “deleted” files. Registry Mechanic ensures that your deleted files stay deleted by bleaching your free hard disk space.
1. Install the program, and do not run.
2. Copy the crack to prog dir, i.e."C:Program FilesRegistry Mechanic", and overwrite the original.
3. Run it and register with one of the given serials.
4. DONE!
