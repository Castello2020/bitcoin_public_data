 Detailing Dante's early years and set against a contemporary backdrop,
 DmC Devil May Cry will retain the stylish action, fluid combat and
 self-assured protagonist that have defined the iconic series but
 inject a more brutal and visceral edge.

 The Dante of DmC is a young man who has no respect for authority or
 society in general. Dante knows that he is not human, but also that he
 is not like the demons that have tormented him throughout his life.
 Caught between worlds, he feels like an outcast.

 He is now discovering and coming to terms with what it means to be the
 child of a demon and an angel. This split personality has a real impact
 on gameplay with Dante being able to call upon angel and demon abilities
 at will, transforming his Rebellion sword on the fly to dramatically
 affect both combat and movement.

 - Do it with style - Utilize Dante's Angel and Demon powers to chain
 together ground-based and aerial combos to achieve the best style
 ranking.

 - Who is Dante? - Explore Dante's early years in a gripping narrative
 featuring familiar faces from the series alongside all new characters.

 - Unbridled action - The intense and iconic sword and gun based combat
 returns with the addition of new weapons all designed to dispatch
	the demonic spawn back to hell with style and panache.

 - Retaining the Devil May Cry DNA - Capcom staff, including team members
 from previous Devil May Cry titles, have been assigned to the project
 from the outset to ensure DmC is a true addition to the Devil May Cry
	franchise.

 - Unrivalled production values - Ninja Theory will take advantage of the
 latest performance capture technology to deliver a level of character
 design, story-telling and cinematics that perfectly complements DmC's
	high-octane combat.


 1. Unrar.
 2. Install this update and DLC pack. Be sure to install it into the correct
 path.
 3. Play the game.
 4. Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT!

• 26 Feb 2013, 17:14 For those having the issue regarding loss of costume open your C:Program Files (86)DMC Devil May CryBinariesWin32steam_rld.ini in notepad youll see this:
AppId=220440
DLC001=229080
DLC002=223792
All you have to do is add DLC003=223790 directly under the lines labeled DLC001 & DLC002... Save it and you are good to go. Granted this will give you the costumes so long as you already installed that DLC.
Hope this helps everyone out that lost there costumes after installing this update and DLC All Comments
please, leave only comments related to that torrent
