RELEASE DATE : 24-09-2010  PROTECTION : Steam + CEG
  GAME TYPE : Strategy DISKS: 1 DVD
 

  Release Notes:
 

  The Skid Rowdies are looking new blood to fill up the ranks.
  We're a professional team of dedicated sceners with big mark
  under sceners. We believe on the ground idealism of the root
  of the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and  
  nothing else. We don't earn anything on our hobby, as we do  
  this for the competition and the heart of what got the scene
  started in the mid eighties.

  If you think you got something to offer, then don't hold back
  on contacting us as soon as possible.


  On with the game release information:

  Become Ruler of the World by establishing and leading a
  civilization from the dawn of man into the space age: Wage
  war, conduct diplomacy, discover new technologies, go  
  head-to-head with some of historyÆs greatest leaders and build  
  the most powerful empire the world has ever known.  

  INVITING PRESENTATION: Jump right in and play at your own pace  
  with an intuitive interface that eases new players into the  
  game. Civ veterans will appreciate the depth, detail and  
  control that are highlights of the series.

  BELIEVABLE WORLD: Ultra realistic graphics showcase lush  
  landscapes for you to explore, battle over and claim as your
  own. Art deco influences abound in the menus and icons in the
  most well-designed Civ ever developed.  

  COMMUNITY &amp; MULTIPLAYER: Compete with Civ players all over the  
  world or locally in LAN matches, mod* the game in
  unprecedented ways, and install mods directly from an in-game
  community hub without ever leaving the game. Civilization V  
  brings community to the forefront.

  WIDE SYSTEM COMPATIBILITY: Civilization V operates on many
  different systems, from high end DX11 desktops to many
  laptops. Enjoy unlimited installations on multiple PCs with  
  your Steam account and take your Civ V experience with you
  everywhere you go.

  ALL NEW FEATURES: A new hex-based gameplay grid opens up  
  exciting new combat and build strategies. City States become a  
  new resource in your diplomatic battleground. An improved
  diplomacy system allows you to negotiate with fully
  interactive leaders. Custom music scores and orchestral
  recordings give Civ V the level of polish and quality you
  expect from the series.  

 Install Notes:
 

  2. Mount image or burn it
  3. Install
  4. Copy the content from the SKIDROW folder on the DVD to your  
  installation directory and overwrite
  5. Play the game


  Support the companies, which software you actually enjoy!

• 24 Oct 2010, 22:46 I have read through comments as far back as October 3rd, no matter how many methods I try (I've copied the Skidrow folder and whatnot) I can't seem to get this thing to load. It seems as though it will load, and then a black screen pops up for 2 seconds and disappears. Then, nothing. If there is a fix for this it's be great for someone to lay it out there. 33
