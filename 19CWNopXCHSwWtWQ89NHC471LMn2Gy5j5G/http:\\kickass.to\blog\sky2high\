▼27 comments Is your girlfriend this evil?
0 views posted 07 Sep 2012, 12:54 A bomb hoax in Philadelphia that turned a Dallas-bound flight around and led to a full-scale SWAT response was apparently triggered by a spiteful ex-girlfriend who telephoned authorities to say her former beau was aboard the US Air flight armed with liquid explosives, police told ABC News.
According to authorities, Christopher Shell, a salesman in his 20's who travels between Philadelphia and Dallas, had no explosives and is cooperating with authorities. He appears to have been the victim of a cruel joke.
When asked how Shell reacted when police took him off the plane, Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan said at a news conference, "He was obviously very alarmed as I would be if heavily armed police entered a plane to take me off...he was certainly stunned."
However, in an unlikely coincidence, Shell had been sped through security by a friend at the airport and posted a message to his Facebook page that getting through security had been a breeze.
The note would have been innocuous in any other circumstance, officials said. In the context of the phoned-in threat alarms went off and bomb techs, cops, FBI agents and K-9 dogs descended on the flight and conducted a full search.
The ex-girlfriend and a man believed to be a current boyfriend are now in custody, sources said. According to sources, they appear to have perpetrated the hoax bomb threat and are being questioned by federal authorities in Philadelphia. Neither the FBI nor the U.S. Attorney in Philadelphia would comment. No charges have been brought against anyone at this time, sources say.
"This is no joke," Sullivan said. "These will be federal charges...they're going to be very serious charges."
He said authorities did not yet have a motive for the hoax. "It's just an incredibly foolish and irresponsible thing to do," he added. "And bottom line, it's criminal."
Passenger Kurt Weber, 54, was sitting in seat 4D when the incident unfolded. Before the plane turned around, Weber said a pilot came over the intercom and said they were having "trouble with instruments" and needed to turn around. Weber is a consultant for the Archery Trade Association and was on his way to a trade show,
Upon landing, Weber saw several emergency and police vehicles racing out. The girl sitting next to him said, "I'm sure glad we are not going where those guys are going." Moments later, the plane taxied near the emergency vehicles and authorities boarded the plane.
"It was like Seal Team Six," Weber said. "The SWAT team from Philly, they were pretty awesome."
"These guys entered from the rear of the plane," he said. "Next thing I know, it almost sounded like a stampede. Here are four Philadelphia SWAT guys, all in black with laser sights on their weapons, weapons drawn and focused on this guy."
Weber said that the team had the man handcuffed and on the ground "in seconds." "Then the bomb techs got on the plane and the SWAT team took positions throughout the plane and authorities explained clearly to the passengers what had happened that led to the raid," he said. "The pilot was calm, the flight attendants were calm and helpful."
Philadelphia police received a call around 7 a.m. from a person stating that a specific individual had explosive liquid on him and was attempting to get it past TSA and onto the Dallas flight.
Authorities later discovered that the person implicated on the tip call was on the flight to Dallas that had departed at 7:39 a.m. and ordered it to return, according to ABC News' Philadelphia affiliate WPVI. The man was being questioned, his luggage was searched and no explosives were found. No explosives were found on the plane.
All 69 passengers and five crew members on flight 1267 are safe. "As soon as we had the situation on the plane secure, I did speak to all the passengers and they were briefed as to what was going on," Sullivan said. "All the passengers were extremely cooperative and very understanding, despite the fact that they were all shaken up."
Philadelphia police officers, FBI bomb technicians and SWAT officers boarded the plane once it had landed and was moved to a safe location. The flight was deemed safe and able to depart for its destination.
"It was a hoax all the way through," one official involved in the investigation told ABC News.

▼31 comments Bike without pedals?
0 views posted 06 Sep 2012, 21:08 The latest in modern bicycle innovation takes some cues from the fictional mode of transportation used in the "Flintstones" cartoon.
A new bicycle designed by German engineers does away with pedals and instead requires the rider to run or walk to generate speed.
Dubbed the "Fliz Bike," it is actually based on the world's first bicycle, the "Laufrad," which also operated without pedals and was created by German inventor Karl Drais in 1817.
"The prior aim of developing FLIZ was to bring a completely new driving experience to everyone," designers Tom Hambrock and Juri Spetter write on their website. "Its laminated, innovative frame with 5 point belt system provides a comfortable, ergonomic ride between running and biking."
Riders of the Fliz must strap themselves into a harness (the "5 point belt system"). After building up enough speed, they lift their legs onto footrests located near the bike's rear wheel.
"The frame integrates the rider and due to its construction it works both like a suspension and like a top carrier whereas the belt replaces the saddle and adjusts your position," the designers write.
Hambrock and Spetter explain that their goal is to create a more environmentally friendly transport for crowded urban settings. It's unclear how the prototype is an improvement over conventional bicycles, which also do not generate pollution and are less physically demanding than the Fliz. However, Hambrock and Spetter say creating a healthier mode of transportation is also part of their vision for the Fliz

▼21 comments No more spankings
0 views posted 06 Sep 2012, 19:54 Canada's top medical journal has called for the repeal of the country's 120-year-old "spanking law," which allows corporal punishment. In a strongly worded editorial published on September 4, John Fletcher, the editor-in-chief of the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ), called physical punishment an "anachronistic excuse for poor parenting." The editorial accompanies a meta-analysis of 20 years of research about the ill effects of spanking, conducted by Joan Durant PhD of the University of Manitoba, first published in February and reprinted in the current volume of the CMAJ.
An estimated fifty percent of Canadian parents spank their children, and Canada, like the United States, protects parents' right to physically discipline kids. Section 43 of the Canadian Criminal Code states, "A parent is justified in using force by way of correction…if the force does not exceed what is reasonable under the circumstances." Worldwide, more than 30 countries prohibit corporal punishment in the home including Austria, New Zealand, and Sweden.
Fletcher and Durant argue that current research shows spanking is an ineffective tool and that there is substantial evidence linking it to mental health issues including depression and substance abuse as well as to increased aggressive behavior. "Surely any bias should be toward protecting children, who are the most vulnerable," writes Fletcher. "To have a specific code excusing parents is to suggest that assault by a parent is a normal and accepted part of bringing up children. It is not. While section 43 stands, it is a constant excuse for parents to cling to an ineffective method of child discipline when better approaches are available."
Spanking is a controversial issue in Canada, and Section 43 been contested a number of times. Most recently, in 2004, the Supreme Court upheld it in a 6-3 ruling. A United Nations panel on children's rights has called on the country to repeal the law. In response to the CMAJ, a spokesperson for Minister of Justice Rob Nicholson told the National Post, "Parents are in the best position to raise their children. We believe it is up to them, not the government, to decide what is best for their children so long as it is within reason."
Spanking is also a hotly contested topic in the United States. While more than 70 percent of mothers admit to having hit their kids at least once, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) discourages the practice. A July report by the Journal Pediatrics, which backs up the CMAJ's findings, concluded, "Harsh physical punishment in the absence of child maltreatment is associated with mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance abuse/dependence, and personality disorders in a general population sample."
In his editorial, Fletcher asserts that, "Parents need to be re-educated as to how to discipline their children." Durant, who is also the author of popular free online parenting guide, 'Positive Discipline,' says she hopes doctors will look at spanking as a medical issue and do more to advise parents on alternatives. "If we had two or three studies that showed that if you took 500 mg of vitamin C a day you could reduce cancer risk," she said in a statement emphasizing the breadth and depth of scientific research on the negative effects of physical punishment, "we would all be taking 500 mg of vitamin C a day."
Would you support your country if they put ban on spanking?
▼39 comments Crazy Bank Robbers
0 views posted 06 Sep 2012, 02:23 THIS IS NOT A BASHING THREAD IF YOU ARE TO BASH ON COUNTRIES YOUR COMMENT WILL BE DELETED
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A Los Angeles bank manager was strapped to what appeared to be a bomb on Wednesday and sent into her bank to take out money for two thieves who escaped with the cash, in a scene reminiscent of a Hollywood movie, authorities said.
Officials believe the two suspects, who confronted the manager at her home on Tuesday night and forced her to participate in the robbery, fled with the money, Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman, Steve Whitmore, said.
"The two men took her to her bank on Wednesday morning, telling her that she had to wear this explosive device," he said. "They strapped on what appeared to be pipe bomb."
Following the robbery, a sheriff's arson and explosives team removed the device from the woman and rendered it safe, Whitmore said. Officials did not identify the bank manager.
Whitmore said the woman entered the Bank of America branch in east Los Angeles at mid-morning and told her colleagues what was happening before she took the money and threw it out the front doors.
The suspects were thought to have taken the money from outside the bank before fleeing in a car described as possibly a white Kia, Whitmore said. He did not say how much money the robbers may have taken.
The bank manager, who was described as frantic and crying, was being questioned by detectives.
Whitmore said authorities had no further information. He could not provide a description of the suspects. Explosives experts were trying to determine if the device strapped to the bank manager was in fact a bomb.
▼28 comments Do you need a hug this bad?
0 views posted 04 Sep 2012, 19:19 Here is the perfect parka for the long, dark, and lonely days of winter. "Everybody needs love, don't they?" asks emerging menswear designer Si Chan on his blog. Chan says he designed his eccentric kelly green puffer jacket, which features a row of clasped hands running up the front, to make the wearer feel "warm and hugged."
While Chan, who recently graduated with top honors from London's College of Fashion, purposely exaggerated the padding to resemble a kids' stuffed toy in order to emphasize the warm and fuzzy vibe of the jacket, there's also something a little creepy about it and some of the other touchy-feely items in his collection of six outfits. The grabbing hands conjure up straight jacket from a future planet or tree branches-turned-arms from a child's nightmare.
Chan explains that hugging hands are a symbol of what makes it possible for humans to "express love" and "depart from loneliness" and he insists his vision is sweet, not sinister. A photo from his blog titled "Inspiration" bears that out. It's a sun-washed snapshot of him as a giggling toddler being given a loving squeeze by his older brother. If only a jacket could make one feel that good.
The "Hug Me Jacket" is a prototype but the designer tells Yahoo! Shine he would like to produce it for sale online this winter. The cost would be about £800.
Would you wear the "Hug Me Jacket?"
▼25 comments England's Largest Nude Land Sculpture Unveiled
0 views posted 04 Sep 2012, 05:07 Northumberlandia, which is being called the world's largest human landform, will officially open today. Also know as "The Lady of the North," the land sculpture of a reclining lady will be unveiled by Princess Anne.
The sculpture is part of a 46-acre park with four miles of footpaths open to the public. Northumberlandia is a unique sculpture that was made from the land in the park.
"Far from being a rigid manicured art form Northumberlandia is a living part of the countryside that will mature over time and change with the seasons," the website says. "What you see when you visit is only the start of something that will evolve through generations."
Made of 1.5 million tons of rock, clay and soil, The Lady of the North is 100 ft. high and a quarter of a mile long. She is the masterpiece of Charles Jenks, an American-born architect who has come to fame in England.
The concept was born in 2004 and building began in 2010 by The Banks Group as part of the restoration of the nearby Shotton surface coal mine. The land was donated by Blagdon Estate.
The project is in line with the "restoration first" concept, which involves "taking an extra piece of land donated by the landowner, the Blagdon Estate, adjacent to the mine and providing a new landscape for the community to enjoy while the mine is still operational."
Work on Northumberlandia began two years ago when soil and clay from the surrounding areas were formed into the shape of a reclining lady. Next, grass seed was strategically placed to create the outlines of the woman.
The project cost 3 million euro and will be maintained by independent charity The Land Trust.
▼26 comments R.I.P Michael Clarke Duncan
0 views posted 04 Sep 2012, 00:52 Michael Clarke Duncan -- best known for his Oscar-nominated role as a death row inmate who possessed magical healing powers in the 1999 film "The Green Mile" -- died on Monday at the age of 54, according to his fiancee Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth.
Duncan had been in a Los Angeles hospital since July 13 following a heart attack and died on Monday morning after close to two months of treatment.
At 6-feet, 5-inches tall and approximately 300 pounds, Duncan was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for his role as gentle giant prisoner John Coffey in "The Green Mile," also starring Tom Hanks. Duncan won the role, in part, due to a recommendation by Bruce Willis, who he worked with on 1998's "Armageddon." Duncan went on to appear with Willis in three more films -- "Breakfast of Champions," "The Whole Nine Yards" and "Sin City."
Before he broke into acting, Duncan worked as a bodyguard for stars including Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, Jamie Foxx, LL Cool J, and The Notorious B.I.G. -- whose 1997 death prompted him to quit that line of work.
Duncan's career spanned three decades and included roles in other television and film titles including "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," "Married with Children," "The Jamie Foxx Show," "Living Single," "Bulworth," "Arli$$," "A Night at the Roxbury," "Sister, Sister," "Planet of the Apes," "CSI: NY," "Talladega Nights," "Two and a Half Men," "Bones," and most recently "The Challenger," which is yet to be released.
Duncan was a prolific voice-over actor as well, lending his rumbling baritone to animated characters in "Kung Fu Panda," "King of the Hill," "Family Guy," "Green Lantern," and many others. The African American actor also played The Kingpin in 2003's "Daredevil," starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner -- a notable achievement seeing as the character in the original comics, on which the film is based, was always depicted as being white.
"The Green Mile" was nominated for four Oscars in 2000 and won 15 other awards including best supporting actor trophies for Duncan from the Black Reel Awards and the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards.
Born and raised on Chicago's South Side and brought up by a single mother, Duncan is said to have resisted temptations of drugs and alcohol, instead focusing on school and acting. He worked digging ditches after attending community college, according to his biography on IMDb.com, then quit his job and moved to Hollywood, launching his acting career while in his thirties. More than three years ago, Duncan is said to have become a vegetarian, and appeared in a video for animal rights organization PETA earlier this year
▼37 comments Apple being trolled
0 views posted 30 Aug 2012, 14:05 NOT TRUE! Just loved the idea
Apple trolled by samsung.. hahahaha..This is EPIC!!
The joke was on you apple. Apparently you dint see it comin!
A payment you cant refuse.....
SAMSUNG PAYS APPLE $1 BILLION SENDING 30 TRUCKS FULL OF 5 CENTS COINS
This morning more than 30 trucks filled up with coins of 5 cents arrived at Apple’s headquarters in California. Initially, the security company that protects the facility said it was diverted to the wrong place, but minutes later, Tim Cook (Apple CEO) received a call from Samsung CEO explaining that they will pay $1 billion dollars for the fine recently ruled against the South Korean company in this way.
the funny part is that the signed document does not specify a single payment method, so Samsung is entitled to send him to the creators of the iPhone its billion dollars as they deem best.
This dirty but genius geek troll play is a new headache to Apple executives in the sense of the method that they need to apply for counting all that money, check if it is complete and try to deposit it crossing fingers to hope a bank will accept to receive that.
Lee Kun-hee, Chairman of Samsung Electronics, told the media that his company is not going to be intimidated by a group of “geeks with style” and that if they want to play dirty, they also know how to do it.
You can use your coins to buy refreshments at the little machine for life or melt the coins to make computers, that’s not my problem, I already paid them and fulfilled the law.
A total of 20 billion coins, deliver hope to finish this week.
