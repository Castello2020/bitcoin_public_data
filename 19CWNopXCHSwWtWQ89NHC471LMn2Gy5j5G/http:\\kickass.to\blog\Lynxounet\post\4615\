How we will see in the future (?)
0 views posted 03 Aug 2012, 21:51 Hey fellas,
I just read something interesting, about what our view might look like in the future (not an affirmation, just an assumption) Here is the link. It's like an improved reality and would work as a medley between Google glasses and standard contact lenses : it's called Sight, created by two Israeli students. What is your opinion about it ? Going to / Not going to happen ? Good / Bad thing ?
IMO, at first sight, it looks pretty good and cool, but is it really what we need ? I sometimes wonder why humans want so much technology in their lifes... Also, if you're keen on such things, I recommend you the English miniserie Black Mirror, a must see (only 3 episodes, so give it a try) :)

• 04 Aug 2012, 03:00 Augmented reality already exists and it is only a matter of time before it does indeed switch from our phones and into our brains. I doubt that contact lenses will be how this technology is implemented however, since the use of lenses would seriously restrict the power of the tech. It will much more likely involve neural implants and will bypass the optic nerve all together and interact with the visual cortex. It would still work alongside normal vision though and would allow an overlay of data on top of the visually perceived world. We would believe we were seeing this overlay with our eyes but it would all take place in the brain.
The potential for misuse for this kind of tech is very great however because if you could hack into some ones visual cortex you could quite literally make them see whatever you wanted, and connectivity of the implant would be necessary for updating with new data. 2

In the future i might need some augmentation as the water is polluted the fish are dead and the worms have turned into godzilla's 0

First: They simply ripped off the Matrix movies.
Second: That's an art/design project, not a tech project. I'm assuming it's a contact lens type of tech they're playing with (they don't say in the video, but it's implied).
Third: A similar technology has already been developed, tried, and abandoned because during testing it made everyone that used it physically ill. Direct brain stimulation is the only way this idea would work.
Last: Why would you want such a system if someone can hack into it and either see what you see or take control your body? I'm not a conspiracy nut by any stretch of the imagination, but unless the tech is modem-free (rendering it relatively useless), I don't see any sane person getting one.
Technology is supposed to be making our lives easier. That's its purpose. I'm waiting to see what kind of mental/physical disorders result from the massive information overload we now have available. Funny thing is we do it to ourselves, claiming it somehow enriches our lives.
Also, most people can't even drive without trying to text and/or call someone at the same time and look how many people that combination of activities kills each year.
Interesting, if not quite original, art project, but if getting a call is gonna hijack my vision while I'm in the middle of a bullfight, uhhhh. . . you can keep it. 1

you guys should really watch the Continuum sci-fi series. It actually portrays exactly the technology being discussed... What is it about sci-fi series and games being actual precursors to future tech? ▼ Show More
