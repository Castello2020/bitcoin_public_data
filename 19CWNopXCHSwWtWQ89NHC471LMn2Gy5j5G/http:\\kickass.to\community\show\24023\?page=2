This thread is for z-rated, b-rated, and so bad they are good films like Ed Woods Plan 9 From Outer Space and Troma's Toxic Avenger series.

Yep Roger Corman films. He has released around 8 in the past year I think: Mega octopus, Sharkoctopus, Mega Gator Versus something. They all hit SyFy channel then went to dvd. This one ^ is not a Corman film but it is watchable and the cg is good. Also a SyFy release.
