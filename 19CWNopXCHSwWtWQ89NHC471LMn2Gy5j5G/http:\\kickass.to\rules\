					<h1>User Rules</h1>
	<h3>General</h3>
	<p>By becoming a registered user at KickassTorrents you automatically agree to the following rules. If you break any of the rules you will either receive a warning, get muted (blocked from commenting and posting) or get banned. In a number of situations the punishment is much more serious, for example if you posted advertising or uploaded child porn - your profile will be removed and your IP will be banned. You have the right to appeal the ban if you think the mods have misjudged your situation. But you have to include a reason or explanation in the appeal! Appeals without a reason or explanation will be rejected. </p>
	<p>Nevertheless we are always open for communication, so if you feel that your comment/torrent/profile was removed for no reason, due to a mistake or personal conflict - feel free to contact the <a href="/people/">Mod Team or Staff Members</a> by PM. </p>
<br/>
	<h3>Site</h3>
	<p>KickassTorrents is not just a neat design with a whole bunch of code under it. Thousands of people have spent many hours to make this site welcoming and comfortable, so when you use it keep that in mind and have some respect for the work done by other people.</p>
	<ul class="textcontent">
		<li>Do not leave any comments that are obscene, racist, hateful, threatening, or otherwise violative of any laws. All comments that are left on torrent files should only contain information about the torrent. Multi commenting is not allowed.</li>
		<li>Any type of advertising and spam in comments, avatars, usernames, walls, torrents and over personal messages is not welcome. If you are interested in cooperation with KickassTorrents please contact the administration.</li>
		<li>Any type of outside links are forbidden in the torrent comments, excluding links to subtitle-providing sites. The sites in question and the subtitle files have to be virus-free.</li>
		<li>Please do not rate torrents that you personally have not downloaded. Rating or giving feedback to a torrent more than three times is also not allowed. If you rated one or two torrents by mistake, you won't be punished for this, but better notify a Mod about this.</li>
		<li>Any kind of reputation point system abuse will be regarded as a serious violation.</li>
		<li>KickassTorrents allows you to report torrents, comment, blog posts and messages that violate the rules of the website. But please use this function wisely! Reporting torrents without adding evidence will most likely result in the report getting removed. If finding a fake torrent, report it with valid reasons. Do not comment or give it feedback as this is rep abuse.</li>
		<li>Asking for any kind of serial keys, hacks or cracks is forbidden in comments, forum threads, blog posts, statuses and walls!</li>
		<li>If you discover a serious or a critical issue with KAT (for example a problem with security) you can bypass the Mod Team and contact our Staff members directly! But only in case of a really serious issue!</li>
		<li>When you engage into discussion in our Community please stick to the local Netiquette. Respect the people that you communicate with, don’t post tons of meaningless messages and keep the discussion normal even if you are provoked into some conflict (better leave it to the Mods).</li>
		<li>KAT has no religious priorities whatsoever, we support the freedom of choice in what concerns religion and therefore are not entitled to remove religious content that may appear abusive to followers of any of the existing religions. Nevertheless we leave the right to remove any religious content if we consider it generally extremist or harmful.</li>
		<li>KAT has nothing against LGBT people and any abuses based on the sexual preferences of the other person will be classified as common abuse and punished by the mods.</li>
		<li>If you for some reason skipped the rules, you will still be punished for violating them! Our Mod Team is really busy with various tasks, so they might have no time for understanding your unique "I was unaware of the rules" reason.</li>
		<li>We are not very friendly toward the use of bots, so if we get too much bot requests from a certain IP - we might block it. </li>
		<li>If you contact a moderator, don’t expect them to respond immediately. Moderators, Staff members and Administrators are very busy individuals, and it might take a while for them to respond to your message.</li>
		<li><b>The Bloves Rule.</b> If a user is unable to understand our rules or cooperate with the mods in solving the rule violation issue, he will fall under the <b>the Bloves Rule</b> and declared a persona non grata. Any of his further established accounts will be removed after a first serious violation and the staff will refuse to cooperate with this user in order to solve this problem.</li>
		<li>We are open to any improvement ideas from our users and have a special <a href="/ideabox/">IdeaBox</a> for this. As soon as you get 500 reputation points you will be able to add your ideas there. Before suggesting an idea please read the short notice on the suggestion page. A user who continuously ignores this notice will get a 500 reputation penalty.</li>
	</ul>
<br/>
	<p>
		<h3>Words or phrases that need further explanation</h3>
		<ul class="textcontent">
		<li>Reputation abuse - Executing reputation gaining actions repetedly to get a higher reputation count.</li>
		<li>Fake torrent - A torrent file that spreads malware on your computer/asks you to do certain things before you can access the content (this includes filling in surveys for passwords).</li>
		<li>Retagger - An uploader that has removed the respective uploader/encoder from the torrent title and/or description and taken the credit for himself.</li>

	<br/>
	<h3>For Uploaders</h3>
	<p>Following things are forbidden in all types of torrents (description, torrent files, torrent name):
			<ul class="textcontent">
				<li>Spam or advertising;</li>
				<li>Promotion of other torrent sites;</li>
				<li>Foul language or insults (if it is not originally in the torrents name);</li>
				<li>Statements, images or any other type of content, that can provoke violence or hatred, or are discriminative;</li>
			</ul><br />
		</p>
		<ul class="textcontent">
		<li>Any torrent that you upload can be removed due to legal issues. We are interested in keeping the site online and filled with content, but we are also obliged to remove content if we are contacted directly by the copyright owner.</li>
		<li>If you have uploaded a torrent you have to seed it. Uploaders that don't seed their torrents will receive a warning and the torrents might be removed. If you are unable to seed for some reason please notify any of the Mods by PM or just leave a message in your status.</li>
		<li>Before you upload a torrent make sure that it is real and working. If you uploaded a fake or non-working torrent by mistake remove it at once.</li>
		<li>Copying torrents from other users is not welcome. Before you upload anything - check if the torrent is not already on the website. If the version that you are uploading is different from the existing ones - mention it in the description.</li>
		<li>Faking the seed count is forbidden!</li>
		<li>Rating and promoting your own torrent with comments on the torrent is forbidden, this also counts for leaving anonymous comments. Leaving comments on your torrent is possible only if you answer users' questions.</li>
		<li>After you have uploaded 20 torrents and been an active uploader at the site for at least one month, you can apply to become a verified uploader. This entitles you to upload without captcha, and all your torrents will be verified by the system automatically and you’ll be listed on KAT’s upload page. The mod team serves the right to decline your application if they feel you’re not ready.</li>
		<li> A good title is a must. For example for a movie the title must include such things as name of the movie, year of release and quality. It is not allowed putting any links in the title, but of course there is no problem with adding the name of your release group.</li>
		<li>Adding screenshots, trailer and a sample is not mandatory, but is greatly appreciated.</li>
		<li>If the contents of the torrent are password protected the password must be included in the torrent as a text file or in the description!</li>
		<li>The uploaded torrent must be 100% virus and malware free. This is very important, because uploading an infected torrent will probably be the last thing you do as a verified uploader.</li>
		<li>As soon as you become a verified uploader you automatically become more responsible for everything you upload, so there are a number of things that you need to keep track of, when you upload a torrent.</li>
		<li>You are allowed to ask for donations as a compensation for your work, but you can do it only on your blog or profile (no comments or torrent description)!</li>
		<li>Please do not dump torrents from major uploaders (like EZTV)! They have their accounts here and you're simply creating duplicates and filling the website with garbage. Following uploader group names are restricted to the groups only and can't be used in torrent names or description: SKIDROW, Reloaded, eztv, Maxspeed, NOGRP, SPARKS.</li>
		<li>It is not allowed to retag a torrent (changing the original uploader/releaser/encoder/ripper in the torrent title).</li>
	</ul>
<br/>

Please specify the studio or website that released the content and all related info like i.e. year. An additional screenshot/picture preview list is a must.

<b>1)</b> You <span style="color:red">MUST</span> be a member of KAT for at least one month in order to prove you can follow site rules.<br />
<span style="color:blue">~</span><br />
<b>2)</b> You <span style="color:red">MUST</span> have a minimum of 20 uploaded torrents and can show to us that you can keep them seeded. Do you need help getting more seeds? Try the <a rel="nofollow" href="/community/0/"><span style="color:red">Adopt an Uploader program</span>.</a><br />
<span style="color:blue">~</span><br />
<b>3)</b> All of your torrents <span style="color:red">MUST</span> have a seed count even if its a count of 1 or they will not be considered, this is to show that you can create torrents that work with our system and can track properly. We have a 10 tracker limit so please do not use more or the extras will be removed, KAT also adds trackers that we know work well so you should try to use these if possible, i would suggest at least this one should be included:<br />
<br />
http://fr33dom.h33t.com:3310/announce<br />
<span style="color:blue">~</span><br />
<b>4)</b> All your uploads <span style="color:red">MUST</span> have correct descriptions, you should try to include covers, screen shots, and media info such as language, subs and bit rates. Its in your own interest to include as much detail as possible, the more detail you can give the more likely other members are going to download from you. KAT also has the new 100% completion system, when you fill out the descriptions section you have the opportunity to gain a rep bonus of 5 points if you can get the completion bar to 100%.<br />
<br />
However you must remember you can only use direct links to images hosted outside of KAT, links to images via adf.ly or any other money making sites are <span style="color:red">BANNED</span> here!<br />
<span style="color:blue">~</span><br />
<b>5)</b> Some of your uploads should have feedback from other users, this is to show that you are creating good quality uploads that others are happy with, if no feedback is present one of our mods will check 2 or 3 or your torrents to ensure they are correct.<br />
<span style="color:blue">~</span><br />
<b>6)</b> You should be posting torrents that you have created yourself, this can be scene, P2P or your own work but you should be creating the torrent and uploading yourself. You <span style="color:red">CAN</span> post torrents from other sites that you have not created, however these will <span style="color:red">NOT</span> be taken into consideration when requesting verified status if you are not also uploading your own torrents, and yes we can tell the difference! <br />
<br />
Please remember that if you are going to post other peoples work your <span style="color:red">NOT</span> allowed to change the titles (to include your own name etc...), this is classed as retagging and rather than be verified you'll most likely be muted and told to fix what you've done!<br />
<span style="color:blue">~</span><br />
<b>7)</b> Your recent account history will be taken into consideration, if you've been in trouble for a rule violation within the last week or two more time will be given so you can learn from your mistake, read the <a rel="nofollow" href="/rules/"><span style="color:red">RULES!</span></a><br />
<span style="color:blue">~</span><br />
<b>8)</b> Your upload history will be looked at, to gain verified status you should have a steady stream of uploads. Torrents that were posted 5, 6, 7 months ago will not be considered if you've since stopped posting, you will be asked to upload fresh torrents in order to gain status.<br />
<span style="color:blue">~</span><br />
<b>9)</b> By requesting verified status you are agreeing that you intend to regularly upload to KAT, if you do not upload for a period of 5 months you will be in danger of having status removed! You'll be sent a pm by a member of the mod team giving you 1 month in which to rectify the problem, if nothing is done by the end of the 6 month period your status will be removed and you'll need to start uploading again in order for it to be returned.<br />
<br />
To go along with this a new achievement is to be created, any user / group with 300+ uploads will be awarded 'VUL for life', as long as there has been some account activity with in two years this will mean these accounts are safe from the inactivity policy. This new achievement will also be awarded to any user / group who have uploads posted here by other users but still make a significant contribution to the torrenting world.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:150%">Think you qualify for verified status? You can put in a request from your profile page, good luck!</span></p>

					<h1>The Official Guide for KickassTorrents Translation Interface</h1>
<div class="textcontent">
	<p>First of all thank you for participating in our translation! We appreciate your contribution and hope that together we will be able to make KickassTorrents more available and easier to use for all people on this planet!</p>
	<h2>The Guide</h2>
	<p>The translation panel can be found <a href="/lang/">here</a><br />
		When you enter the panel you will be offered to select a language from the drop-box, select you language and you will be redirected to the translation page.<br />
		The language page shows six columns <strong>id</strong>, <strong>description</strong>, <strong>plural</strong>, <strong>original</strong>, <strong>versions</strong> and <strong>comments</strong>.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Id</strong> is the code of the item, it can be used to make search easier or sent to other translators instead of the phrase;</li>
		<li><strong>Description</strong> points to the original position of the item (f.e. community/addforum means that the text is located on the add forum page in the community), can also contain a screenshot of the phrase on the website, example of the phrase on the website or a small clarification of the special symbols (%1, %2, etc.);</li>
		<li><strong>Plural</strong> indicates if the item requires more than one translation for certain phrase depending on the number used in the phrase;</li>
		<li><strong>Original</strong> is the original English phrase;</li>
		<li><strong>Versions</strong> is for translation text;</li>
		<li><strong>Comments</strong> for discussing the translation with other translators.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Above the translation you can see if the language is finished (the percentage) and you can see other translators who are working on this language. The translators are generated automatically by choosing all people who took part in the selected translation. <strong>It is important that you avoid translating phrases in other languages and stick to your language only,</strong> so that other translators won't be confused by a large number of volunteers on their language.<br />
		To translate a word click on the Arrow sign between the Original and Versions columns and you will be offered a box where you can enter your text. After that save the text and your translation will appear in the versions column and after the overall confirmation on the website. The pencil allows editing the translation and the red cross allows to delete a translation.<br />
		If you have some doubts about a translation please leave a message in the comment field (the last column) by pushing on the comment icon. If you can't come to some compromise or the other translators are not replying to the comment, please notify [userid=4].<br />
		If the word has no translation in your language (f.e. api, seed, leech, etc.) please copy the English word. The percentage is calculated from the number of filled version fields, so it is important to fill them all.<br />
		Phrases can hold special symbols like %1 or parts of the code. Please <strong>make sure that you stick to the initial spelling and translate only the words outside the code.</strong>
	<p> <img src="//kastatic.com/images/rulesExample1.png" /> </p>
	<p>If you have doubts about a phrase please alert [userid=4] via PM. You can also check the Russian version and see how it was translated there (you can easily distinguish the Cyrillic symbols from the inner code).</p>
	</p>
	<p>If you encounter a link in the translation please ignore the text within the html code.</p>
	<blockquote>&lt;a href='text'&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;<br />%1 </blockquote>
	<p>There is no need to translate this text!</p>
	<p>Some phrases have plural forms, so if you see a yes in the plural column it means that you will need to enter two or more forms of translation depending on the language. It will be easy for each native speaker because he knows the numbers span that needs a different translation word. For example most of the Cyrillic languages have this change at number 5 (2-4 has one word and 5-999999 another).</p>
	<p> <img src="//kastatic.com/images/rulesExample2.png" /> </p>
	<p>Notice that the second translation has a different word. Enter the translations in numeric order f.e: first version for the 2-4 span, second version for the 5-999999 span, etc. If you have doubts about a phrase please alert [userid=4] via PM.</p>
	<p>Due to the volunteer nature of this work all changes can be made by all translators, which means that you can correct and delete the versions of other translators. To avoid possible conflicts or vandalism, please be in touch with other translators and discuss the changes. It is important that we all work as a team and see our goal only as the overall benefit of KAT and not as someoneís nickname under all the versions.</p>
	<p>The current version is still a beta so in case of any problems just refresh the page in the browser and missing things like the posting date will appear in the versions column.</p>
	<p>While you translate stick to following rules:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If it is possible - try to make the translated phrase not longer than the original. If the phrase turns out to be too big and there is no way to shorten it and please notify [userid=4] and we will change the design for the specific language.</li>
		<li>Make sure that the phrase fits the context and check the description field and the original website.</li>
		<li>Synchronize all terms like username, userpic, community, etc. with other translators. Be sure that you use the same term in the whole translation.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Rules</h2>
	<p>From now on you receive the translator status, which gives you the access to the translation panel (but no additional powers). The Translator Status makes you a member of the Kickass People, still you are obliged to follow all the website rules and have no power over other users.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Please make sure that you stick within your language/languages and donít try to edit the ones that you donít know or haven't learned.</li>
		<li>There might be more than one translator for each language and for some phrases each translator might offer his own translation. In this case you can discuss the versions in comment section attached as a small symbol on the right of each translation. All comments must be in English only, so that I can understand the issue and give final judgment in case of a draw. (The best arguments for such issues are similar translations used on other websites)</li>
		<li>In all discussions please try not to insult other translators and keep everything professional. We don't have special rules for translators, but if you tend to create conflict situations you might loose the access to the translation web interface and the Translator status.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<p>[userid=4] is responsible for the whole translation part, so in case of rudeness, insults or other translation issues please notify him over personal messages.</p>
