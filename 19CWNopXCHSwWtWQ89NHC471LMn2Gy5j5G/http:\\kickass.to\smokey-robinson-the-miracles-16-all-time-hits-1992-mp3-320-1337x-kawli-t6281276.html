Description
The Miracles are an American rhythm and blues group, notable as the first successful act for Berry Gordy's Motown Record Corporation. Their 1960 song, "Shop Around" became Motown's first million-selling hit record, and the group went on to become one Motown's "signature acts" of the 1960's. Formed in 1955 by William "Smokey" Robinson and Ronald "Ronnie" White, the most consistent lineup of the act was that of Robinson, White, Bobby Rogers, Warren "Pete" Moore, Claudette Robinson and Marvin "Marv" Tarplin.
Referred to as Motown's "soul supergroup", The Miracles are multiple Grammy Hall of Fame Inductees, and inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, The Doo-Wop Hall of Fame,The Vocal Group Hall of Fame, and received a star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame. They have charted over 50 hit singles between 1959 and 1978,including 26 Top Ten Billboard R&B Hits, with 4 R&B # 1's. Sixteen of their songs reached the Top Twenty of the Billboard Hot 100, with 7 songs reaching the Top Ten, and two,1970's The Tears of A Clown, and 1975's Love Machine reaching number one.
In 2004, and again in 2011, Rolling Stone magazine ranked Smokey Robinson & the Miracles #32 on their list of "The Immortals: The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time." After not being recognized for 26 years, The Miracles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on February 9, 2012. http://youtu.be/k2kxlZDOHeQ
