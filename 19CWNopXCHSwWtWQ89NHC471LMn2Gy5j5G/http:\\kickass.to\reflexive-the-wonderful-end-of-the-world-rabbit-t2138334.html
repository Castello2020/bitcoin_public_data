Description
The Wonderful End of the World
The world is being eaten, and you're here to do what you can! Scramble to rescue its greatness, absorbing all you touch, growing larger with every object. At first, rats kick you around and golden retrievers threaten to stomp you to pieces... eventually, you'll grow large enough to have fire engines for arms and the ability to absorb entire buildings!p.s.Not the usual installer because it's not working, not know why..... so manually chose the install directory and make a shortcut icon for the game, sorry .)
