ok, i get you have your own opinion about this movie based mostly on the "2nd actor". that's ok. but that "2nd actor" happens to be "Kevin Heart", a pretty well known stand-up comedian. you should go to youtube and check out some of his comedy. the guy is funny as crap. but, the reason Kevin Heart is so good in this movie is they took his real life personality, and through him in a movie. he still has to "act" out the parts, but he's really just being himself which is why this movie is so funny. Kevin Heart, to me, is what makes this movie a hit. yes, ice cube is in it, but him being a good actor is a given. everybody knows who ice cube is, but who's this new little naturally funny guy?!?! just awesome :)

that is from "directx 9 run time" you probably have a newer version and since there are enough differences from version to version, you need to install directx 9. you have to install that from the off line installer. it's 90 some mb. if you try and install directx from the windows site, it might error out because you probably have a newer version. That's what worked for me but unfortunately this game crashed on me in the begining of play time. i cannot play this on windows 8 64bit core2duo 4gig ram 256mb video. good luck to everyone else that was able to play this.

are you installing this on an HP by any chance? i only ask because for some reason some OS's "see" an HP machine as a special type so it can inject the key for you. i remember in the days of XP i could install XP on an HP without a key but the same disc would call for a key on any other kind. weird i know, but it could be the reason. maybe the disc is trying to inject the key a different way before the "Custom Activation" has a chance to do it's thing. Good luck :)

don't know but the uploader said this:
-Added ei.cfg to sources directory. You *HAVE* to extract the iso and
delete the file if you want to upgrade from a previous version of
Windows. Use the win81-pkeys.txt on the ISO for install keys.

i dont know what you said, but if i was to take a guess and chose the best answer... yes it's an ISO file. now, whether you want to call that a windows file or not is up to you because mac, linux and windows can all read ISO ;) P.S. sometimes you have to install 3rd party software.

i googled that and it seems to be pointing to not having the system requirements to install this or hard disk corruption. im thinking it could be a bad burn also. Good luck :)

from earlier post:
Thanks uploader. I too had a problem on first install. i cant remember exactly what it said but i think it was something relating to reading a file or something. i really wish i could remember but the good news is, (and this probably did nothing to fix the issue) I turned off the laptop, took a Q-Tip and cleaned the DVD laser lens because the error said something about having trouble reading a file, or files. When i tried a second time; doing exactly what i did on the first try ('cause i really wanted WMC :) everything went as if nothing had ever been wrong in the first place. So, VMware (per your description) or HDD Install, it seems to have this issue (on rare occasions of course) I'm not saying to anyone that the cleaning the dvd lensthing took any part in fixing the issue. The uploader states that a reboot was done and everything worked, so if anyone gets stuck at whatever %, just try it again using the same installation perameters as before. Good luck!

i would say install one that's pre-activated or else you will probably need to enter a key. or, if you did chose an activated one and you can finally get to your desktop, do not change any system settings. you should be good to go.

if your computer is restarting, something is wrong with your computer. i say this because why would an operating system cause a computer to reboot every 2 hours? i guess if the OS is jacked up lol that's not the case here i assure you. it seems to be working as it should ;)
