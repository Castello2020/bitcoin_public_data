Description
Okay, all this is is the Mac OS X Lion Retail .dmg converted to .iso to either be used by Windows users to burn to a disc etc. or to create a virtual machine on Windows. Should the latter be your aim, then there's a URL shortcut in the torrent which will direct you to a tutorial.
Cheers, and don't forget to seed.

• 24 Aug 2011, 23:27 Not sure about this one guys, know Uploader knows what he's doing but lacking on the explanation department though. It's good if your familiar with VMware. 0

• 22 Jul 2011, 09:43 I can only assume you found this torrent by looking for it yourself, and since you downloaded Motion 5 and iLife from here, you may want to stop being so hypocritical. 4

Thx for this upload, managed to do a fresh install on my parents' imac 5,1 after upgrading it from 2x512MB to 1x512MB + 1x2GB RAM and it works perfectly.
This was the highest version I could upgrade to, but alas an upgrade was not possible and I had to do a fresh install. Did a quick backup using time machine first to a SATA drive in a dock and restored users after installation..
Worked perfectly, actually kind of impressed with that, considering I'm a Linux/Windows man my self ;) reply
