Description
Please SEED for others to Enjoy!
Cheers, Bubanee
Pendulum made one of the biggest breakthroughs of the 2000s with their hit album In Silico. Having sold over one million records worldwide, the band completed a sell out Academy tour in 2008 and went on to smash the international festival circuit in summer 2009 with killer appearances at Glastonbury, Download, V and Global Gathering to name a few. Both Pendulum studio albums to date-In Silico and the band's debut Hold Your Colour-have gone Platinum.
Immersion's lead single "Watercolour" heralds a glorious evolution in the Pendulum sound. Now utilising a richer sonic tapestry than ever before, Watercolour" finds Rob Swire's vocals alternating between eerie distortion and full-blooded energy amidst flourishes of horns and an atmospheric, tension building breakdown. The track's progressive structure highlight's Pendulum's continuing development in constructing contrasting dynamics.
