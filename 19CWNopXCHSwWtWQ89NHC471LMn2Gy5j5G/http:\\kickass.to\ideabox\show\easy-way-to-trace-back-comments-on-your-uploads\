Easy way to trace back comments on your uploads...
in General Enhancements
You have to go thru all my uploads to see which upload had a new comment, but the only thing you see in your main screen is that you have a new comment. You should get an option that when you get a comment on one of your uploads, that you can trace back wich upload that is.

It's weird, because it worked like a week and then it got broken already, just about the same time when the massive and annoying idea comments notifications stopped... :S That was like two or three months ago now!
I want this feature back... It was so much time waiting and so few days enjoying it... 3
