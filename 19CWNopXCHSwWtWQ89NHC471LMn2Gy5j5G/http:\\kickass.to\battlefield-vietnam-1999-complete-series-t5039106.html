Description
The best video documentary I've seen of the war to date. It's a full sweep from the reason the U.S. got involved right through to the end of South Vietnam. I watched the series with my father (USAF Col.) and father in law (ARVN Col.), both of whom fought in the war. In fact, the latter started as a French Lt. when it was called Indochina. Both validated the overall accuracy of the show, with the unavoidable minor technical errors only someone having been there would spot.
A good closing to the entire story can be on the U.S. Navy website: http://www.navytv.org/channel.cfm?c=784&s=115
30,000 refugees aboard the South Vietnam's remaining naval vessels made the long trek to Subic Bay. There, the last flag flying over sovereign Republic of Vietnam territory was lowered.
This is the complete 6-disc collection, from two 3-disc sets:
"From Dien Bien Phu to Peace with Honor"
"Tet!"
They should be viewed in the sequence given by their file names.
There's another torrent of this out there but I wanted a hard copy. This is my own higher bitrate version of the collection.
