• 10 Aug 2013, 03:02 So it's ok for Exophase to put some bullshit t&c in their description about only using legitimately obtained BIOS files and legitimately flashed ROM's, but in reality of course they know that the people who buy it will be using free ROM's and free BIOS files, they are stealing money from nintendo.

Ok so drastic started running but it is a bit different than DEMO version. The worst thing is that it does not find my ds roms which worked perfectly on the demo version of drastic. reply

As for whoever anonymous is...
There's some rumors that the devs of this app made their product specifically closed source to monopolize the DS emulator market, so perhaps they deserve this?
And you're also on this site so clearly you googled it also lol... reply
