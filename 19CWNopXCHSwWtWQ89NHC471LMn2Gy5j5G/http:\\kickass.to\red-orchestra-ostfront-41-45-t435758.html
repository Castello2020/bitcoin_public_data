works for me. Windows 8 64 bit. Follow june 1rst 2013 instructions for steam issue. Don't use shortcut if you move the folder after downloading, use RedOrchestra.exe in "system" folder. Viola. reply

This didn't work at first for me (wouldn't load) but here's what I did to make it work............................................-(1)- make sure you have "steam" installed ...........................................-(2)- locate the file "steam.dll" from your steam installation and copy it (default location of steam installation is in your program files folder) -.......................................(3)- paste that steam.dll file into the installed game folder: "Red OrchestraSystem" ...........................................-(4)- In that same folder ("Red OrchestraSystem") locate the file: "RedOrchestra.exe", click on properties and set it to "run as administrator" (I also set it to run in XP SP3 compatibility mode but this may be unnecessary)........................................-(5)- start the game using that file "RedOrchestra.exe" (or create a new shortcut to it) rather than using the shortcut given in the instructions.....................................................................................................-[NOTES]- I am using Windows 7 (32 bit)..................the steam.dll file I copied is from 2012 so I don't think the version of that file is terribly important....................................Hope this helps someone. reply

To clarify: the folder above is "System" within the "Red Orchestra" folder. The forum removed my backslashes from post above. reply
