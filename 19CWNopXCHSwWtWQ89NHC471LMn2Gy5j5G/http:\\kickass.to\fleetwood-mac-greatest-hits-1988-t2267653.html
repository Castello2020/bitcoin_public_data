Description
Greatest Hits is a 1988 compilation album by British-American band Fleetwood Mac. It covers the period of the band's greatest commercial success, from the mid 1970s to the late 1980s.
The album has proven to be a major success since the time of its release. Although it only peaked at #14 in the US album chart, it sold steadily and has to date sold in excess of 8 million copies there. In the UK it reached 3# upon release, but has returned several times to the UK album chart - as recently as October 2006 (re-entering at #24).
The album contains two new tracks, "As Long As You Follow" (which was released as a single to promote the album), and "No Questions Asked". The track listing for the US release differs slightly from that of other territories. It includes the 1975 track "Over My Head" but omits the 1987 track "Seven Wonders" (despite it being a top 20 hit in the US) as well as the 1982 track "Oh Diane" (which was never released as a single there at all).
A number of sources state that this album was the last to be commercially released as an 8 track tape by a major label.
