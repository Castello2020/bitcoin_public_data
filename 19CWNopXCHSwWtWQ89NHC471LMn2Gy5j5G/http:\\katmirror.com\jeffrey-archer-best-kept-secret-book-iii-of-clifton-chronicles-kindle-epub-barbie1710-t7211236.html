Description
Jeffrey Archer: Best Kept Secret (Book III of Clifton Chronicles)
.
AZW3, EPUB, MOBI
.
The vote in the House of Lords as to who should inherit the Barrington family fortune has ended in a tie. The Lord Chancellor’s deciding vote will cast a long shadow on the lives of Harry Clifton and Giles Barrington. Harry returns to America to promote his latest novel, while his beloved Emma goes in search of the little girl who was found abandoned in her father’s office on the night he was killed. When the General Election is called, Giles Barrington has to defend his seat in the House of Commons and is horrified to discover who the Conservatives select to stand against him.
But it is Sebastian Clifton, Harry and Emma’s son, who ultimately influences his uncle’s fate. In 1957, Sebastian wins a scholarship to Cambridge, and a new generation of the Clifton family march onto the page. After Sebastian is expelled from school, he unwittingly becomes caught up in an international art fraud involving a Rodin statue that is worth far more than the sum it raises at auction.
Does he become a millionaire? Does he go to Cambridge? Is his life in danger?
Best Kept Secret will answer all these questions, but once again, pose so many more.

Dear Barbie1710 i love your torrents re Jeffrey Archer books since they include everything, including the much needed XRAY entities. I am desperately searching for the Clifton Chronicles No 2 - The Sins of the Father but none come with the XRAy - do you by any chance have this torrent? i would really appreciate you helping me out thanks reply

I think transferring via calibre is the easiest way.
But you can transfer via windows explorer: copy and paste into the documents folder on the Kindle reply
