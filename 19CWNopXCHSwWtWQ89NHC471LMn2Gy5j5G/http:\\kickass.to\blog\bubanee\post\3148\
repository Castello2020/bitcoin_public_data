0 views posted 09 Jul 2012, 20:57 Bubanee - Fake - Rar - Password . This blog i'm making so sooner or later it will be picked up by search engines.. . In recent times well since late 2009 there have been thousands of Bubanee fakes mainly written like this Artist - Title [MP3-Cov-20**][Bubanee] ~~ Firstly if you have come across this post you have actually arrived to a real account of mine where everything in my name is done myself.. KAT ACCOUNT
~~ If your looking for a password, i'm sorry you've been scammed and there's nothing i can do about it.. I don't do .rar or passworded crap in music avoid places like isohunt especially where the moderating is extremely poor and other index sites with poor or no moderating... The only advice i can give you for myself and others when searching is stick to good moderated sites like this one incase your a first time here and ALWAYS read comments!... I have 2 main accounts.. The link above and the piratebay (if you see bubanee with a VIP skull - Click it!) .

Bubanee - Why not package a few really nasty computer viruses into a torrent for those fakers to download? I'm sure they probably D/L your genuine torrents, and load their own crap into them - it would be nice if the virus contained a dialer into every nasty porn site (kiddy and beasty stuff), every terrorist website (Al Qaeda, C18, KKK), and simultaneously attempted to hack into the CIA, FBI, MI5, MOSSAD, etc whilst filesharing the jpegs and terrorist propoganda from aforementioned sites. Obviously, there would need to be something there that removed all references to your name! That'll get them a free holiday in Guantanamo Bay!! 0

I very rarely download RAR files now unless I trust the source as I've been caught so many times by non existent passwords & fakes. It's a shame really as zipped files are much smaller & therefore quicker to DL, but the few spoil it for the many as usual. It must be maddening when they do it in your name too!!! 0

I don't encode or upload anything in .rar either - so I won't be looking for a password for anything any time soon. I don't usually download movies TV shows or albums in rar (I don't trust the split .rar archives which make up a single movie)
and isohunt is the last place I'd go because I'm pretty sure it has unleashed email/poker/casino spam on me as well as the fake shit.
we all know you bubs and we trust you. 2

If I find a Bubanee121338 torrent, in rar, with a password, what should I do?
~~Would like me pm you so that you can personally delete them or may I ban them from existence?
~
You don't really have to answer that question, I'm pretty sure I already know. 0
