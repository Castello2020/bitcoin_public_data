0 views posted 01 Aug 2012, 23:02 I love the coffee. Love it in the morning. Love it with dessert. Love the smell of coffee beans. Wish it tasted as good as the beans smell. Love how healthy it is. Love love love the coffee. Shouldn't drink it after noon but I do any way. Guess why? Because I love it. I wanna marry coffee. I just wanna kiss it and lick it all over. Coffee is even better than kittens. There I said it....coffee coffee coffee....
Stay tuned for my next blog about pillows. I just love pillows.....

Only one cup a day for me or I can't sleep at night. Now when you say pillows, are you referring to chest pillows or just standard pillows? 0

Coffee beans are very costly here, so we buy packed instead, it does good, I am a coffee fanatic and I drink 3-4 times a day, my mothers makes it for me and now I will use my faulty CD-ROM drive as mug holder lmao ▼ Show More
