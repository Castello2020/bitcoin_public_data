Description
Game Description:
Deep in the jungles of Sri Lanka, the Ghosts have 72 hours to prepare the way for a U.S. invasion force. As open conflict with Pakistan looms, the Ghosts uncover proof that they've been targeting the wrong enemy. Now they must act before falsified intelligence lures America into an unpredictable and devastating war.
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Predator offers an exclusive tactical experience for PlayStation Portable gamers, delivering a true Ghost Recon experience with sophisticated technology, weaponry, graphics, and challenging gameplay. Alone or with your friends, decide what tactics are best -- use your massive firepower to eliminate powerful enemies or use the jungle to sneak behind enemies and strike using the element of surprise.
Installation & Info:
Unrar
Drag and drop the klown-ghrp.iso to the ISO folder on your memroy stick
Tested and working on 5.50 GEN-D3 & 5.03 GEN-C
If ANY of my releases don't work on Prometheus CFW you have no one else to blame but yourself.. Should have stuck with what you had or learn how to test before completely switching to shit ;)
