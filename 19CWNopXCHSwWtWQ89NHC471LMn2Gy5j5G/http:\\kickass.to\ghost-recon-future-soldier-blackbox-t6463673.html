• 25 Jun 2012, 11:07 works on windows 7 64-Bit. Just go into where you installed it, under program files it will be called black box, go to future soldier and you will see a Future Soldier Application, run as Administrator. Your Firewall will ask you to connect to the internet (AVG) deny it. The game will start up in off-line mode. User name is Skidrow, should already be there, put whatever password that you want and start the game. Works for me. All Comments
