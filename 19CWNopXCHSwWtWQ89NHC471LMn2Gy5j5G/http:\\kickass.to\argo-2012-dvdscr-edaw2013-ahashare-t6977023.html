• 12 Jan 2013, 00:22 The movie is complete. VLC USERS instaed of trying to drag/scan through the movie use FFWD to scan it is the arrow to the extreme right you can click FFWD a couple of times mine went to about 31x speed. Will npot work in WMEDIA PLAYER. And you may not be able to burn in Convertx But it is entirely watchable..i was able to sacn passed the 1hr7mins that is being commented on and have watched the whole movie. the creens provided are passed the mark thats mentioned -10

audio: 8video: 7 Didn't work with BS Player but worked with GOM with just a not-so-important problem, it didn't show timing, I mean when I paused or was watching, it didn't show the minutes and seconds. So, try not dividedly watching this but finish as you star playing it Thanks for the upload. Great movie btw reply
