Description
Please seed!
Dracula Dead and Loving It [1995]
Another spoof from the mind of Mel Brooks. This time he's out to poke fun at the
Dracula myth. Basically, he took "Bram Stoker's Dracula," gave it a new cast and
a new script and made a big joke out of it. The usual, rich English are attacked
by Dracula and Dr. Van Helsing is brought in to save the day. Starring: Leslie Nielsen, Mel Brooks and Peter MacNicol Director: Mel Brooks
Video: MPEG2PAL 16:9 720x576
Ausio: English Dolby AC3/2
Subs: Suomi, Svenska
Extras: Trailer
Talent Files: Leslie Nielsen and Mel Brooks
