- The Sorcerer’s Apprentice DVD Covers
That’s the WHOLE The Sorcerer’s Apprentice DVD plus the soundtrack for you to enjoy of Chinese New Year. Please SEED! NO LEACHERS! This is a collection of material all from the DVD and nowhere else on the net. There are plenty of copies of The Sorcerer’s Apprentice out there to leach if you just want a copy but this is the whole DVD and soundtrack so I need some permanent seeders on this. Cheers, vladtepes3176.

PLOT: (IMBD)
Balthazar Blake (Nicolas Cage) is a master sorcerer in modern-day Manhattan trying to defend the city from his arch-nemesis, Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina). Balthazar can't do it alone, so he recruits Dave Stutler (Jay Baruchel), a seemingly average guy who demonstrates hidden potential, as his reluctant protégé. The sorcerer gives his unwilling accomplice a crash course in the art and science of magic, and together, these unlikely partners work to stop the forces of darkness. It'll take all the courage Dave can muster to survive his training, save the city and get the girl as he becomes The Sorcerer's Apprentice.
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
Magic is everywhere in Disney's The Sorcerer's Apprentice-the fun family adventure from the creators of National Treasure. Balthazar Blake (Nicolas Cage) is a modern-day sorcerer with his hands full defending Manhattan against dark forces. When a seemingly average kid shows hidden potential, Balthazar takes his reluctant recruit on a crash course in the art and science of magic to become the ultimate sorcerer's apprentice. Experience more extraordinary thrills, heart-stopping action and spectacular special effects than you can imagine as these unlikely partners show us that the real world is far more magical than we ever knew!
Please Seed. Thanks…vladtepes3176
