Description
Fury in the Pacific is a 1945 documentary short film about a pair of World War II battles in the Pacific: the Battle of Peleliu and the Battle of Angaur.
It was co-produced by the United States Army, United States Navy, and the United States Marines, and directed by a series of combat cameraman — of whom nine became casualties of the battles they were filming.[1] The film is especially noteworthy for its praise of the fighting abilities of Japanese soldiers (a rarity for American propaganda during World War II), and its fast-paced editing.
The film is sometimes erroneously credited to Frank Capra, but he did not, in fact, direct the film.
