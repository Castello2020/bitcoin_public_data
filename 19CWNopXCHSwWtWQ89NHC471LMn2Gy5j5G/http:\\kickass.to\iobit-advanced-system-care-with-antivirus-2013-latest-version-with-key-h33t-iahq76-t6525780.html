Don't work as specified.The system ask for a license code and we get a serial number;on toop of that if you disconect from the Internet
the verification process will not work; I got an error indicating "we can not access our servers. Is a waste of time,
DON'T WORK. The uploader better check on all these errors,to find out where the problem is;even if the license code is good,I get a licensed code invalid. Trash reply
