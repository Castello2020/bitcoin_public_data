Jus' installed this version of AutoCAD on my desktop running Windows 8 Professional x64 with no issues what so ever. Had to run it on a WinXP for my mom bein' an architect who doesn't like switchin' to the new interface (bein' 67 it's a success she still deals with projects after all). My dad, on the other hand, has to switch to a Win8 since he does administrative work and uses the the net a lot and has to have a reliable laptop at his hand for it (it's an older Lenovo T60, but still pretty fast with the Win8 though). They don't have room to spare for a desktop and don't like the idea of buyin' a new laptop at the same time. Lucky they got me to deal with their wishes... 'bout the installation process... Jus' run the 'setup.exe' 'As Administrator', deal with the registration process as described (it works for any given country) and run the app 'As Administrator' once again after the installment. :) reply
