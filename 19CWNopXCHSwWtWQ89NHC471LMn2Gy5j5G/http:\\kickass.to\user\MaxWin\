uploads 138 Idea: A notification message for deletion of a torrent due to Copyright InfringementToday when I going through my old uploads, I found that one of my uploaded torrent has been deleted 3 months ago due to Copyright Infringement, but I was not aware about that matter till today.
At that moment, I felt the importance of a Notification Message very badly because such file was uploaded by me.
So, I requesting to the Site Admins to make a review about this matter and to add an auto generated messaging option. Thank You..!! in Comments, Messages and Feedback254 12 years and 4 months ago updated	2 months ago
