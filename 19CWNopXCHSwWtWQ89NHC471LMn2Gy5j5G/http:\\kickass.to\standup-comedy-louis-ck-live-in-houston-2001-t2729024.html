Description
**UPLOADER’S NOTE** - This album is already out and about, but the OP had it in MP4a for some reason. I converted it over to 128 kbps mp3, fixed all the tags, added cover art. Louis C.K. mentions this album on his website, but does not sell it there, nor is it to be seen for sale on Amazon or the other standard websites. My guess is that it was a small run sold-out thing from his early days, like a lot of up and coming comics do. The information below is his biography from AllMusic.com http://www.louisck.net/ http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&searchlink=louis|ck&sql=11:wjfexzu5ldfe~t1
Biography by Jason Buchanan
Born in 1967, Louis CK got his start in comedy after moving to New York City in 1989 and appearing on as many of the numerous televised comedy programs being shot in the city as possible. Soon making short films and touring the country on the comedy circuit, CK got his start in television as one of the original writers for the wildly irreverent Conan O'Brien Show when it premiered in 1993. Masterminding such long-running skits as the "Staring Contest" and "Actual Items" (some of which continued to appear regularly, years after his departure), CK continued to make short films as he later worked for The Late Show with David Letterman and The Dana Carvey Show, all the while gaining popularity as a talented comedian. 1996 proved to be a somewhat pivotal year for him. After taping his own comedy special for HBO, he was hired as a producer for what would become one of his most fruitful opportunities, The Chris Rock Show. After a brief departure, during which he shot his first feature film, Tomorrow Night, he returned to The Chris Rock Show and earned an Emmy for his contributions in 1998. Serving as host to the PBS short film showcase Short Cuts the following year, CK next wrote and directed his first major studio film, Pootie Tang (2001), based on the mush-mouthed character he had created for The Chris Rock Show, in addition to serving as co-writer on Rock's Down to Earth. In 2006 his semi-autobiographical sitcom, Lucky Louie, aired on HBO for one season before being canceled. The show featured fellow standup comedian Jim Norton, an old friend who was working for Opie & Anthony's national morning radio show where CK made numerous appearances. A 2007 special for HBO called Shameless was followed by a move to rival cable network Showtime and the 2008 special Chewed-Up. The latter would be released on both CD and DVD that same year.
