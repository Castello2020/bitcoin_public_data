audio: 4video: 4 First for the uploader and seeders for this torrent, thank you, been looking for stuff like this! Second, for the encoder of these files, you are a total dumbass for encoding this in anything less than 640x480, and should be publicly flogged for it at the very least for doing a half-assed job. Third, for those reporting A/V 10 in the comments here, you need your eyes checked. These are A/V 4 at best, and some are A/V 1 (like episode 41 which isn't even watchable). I'm thankful this series is available, but we are ALL fools to keep sharing this garbage instead of trying to get a better quality rip done. reply
