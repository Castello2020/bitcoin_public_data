Description
My wife complained the original mix was too boring. Spent a couple days tinkering around with the single track remixing and effects and such. Ended up with a 2 track offset/delay mix that she finally found more appealing. Thought I'd release it. Comments are welcome. It's just a 128. If there's more interest I'll remix a 320kbs. Be well everyone. And special thanks to Gotye for making the original. Peace and light.
[edit** was really tired when I originally posted this.]

• 30 Aug 2012, 09:32 mixed it in audacity. ended with several tracks that got merged with a couple different stage effects applied to each. don't remember exactly what I did. but I know one was a bass reverb, one was an offset attack, another was a delay, one was a slight 0.5 second echo, there was a compressor track, a wah, and a distortion. they were applied to leave enough of the original song, but also change it slightly. then the merged track was offset by about 13 seconds over the original to give the dual track overlay. glad you liked it. peace. be well.
