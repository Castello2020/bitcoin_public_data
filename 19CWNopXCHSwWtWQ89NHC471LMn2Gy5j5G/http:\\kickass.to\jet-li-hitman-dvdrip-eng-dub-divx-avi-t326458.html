Description
Sat sau ji wong (1998)Also Known As:-HitmanKing of Assassins (literal English title)The Contract Killer (USA) (video title)The Hitman (Hong Kong: English title)Genre: Action | ComedyYear: 1998Director: Stephen Tung WaiProducer: Gordon Chan Car-SeungWriter: Chan Hing-Kai, Vincent Kok Tak-ChiuCast: Jet Li Lian-Jie, Eric Tsang Chi-Wai, Simon Yam Tat-Wah, Gigi Leung Wing-Kei, Ng Chi-Hung, John Ching TungThe Skinny: Uncharacteristically low-key for a Jet Li film, this action-comedy still manages to entertain and even charm with its action and sense of humor. The action sequences aren\\\'t bad, either.Reviewby Kozo: Jet Li?s \\\'Hitman\\\' is a curious film. It?s an action comedy about Fu (Jet), an ex-soldier who gets hired by a low-rent triad (Eric Tsang) to chase a $100 million dollar hit: to kill the King of Assassins, who was responsible for the murder of a powerful Japanese crimelord. Thing is, everyone and their brother is after the reward, including the Japanese guy?s son, who?s damn intent on getting that 100 million for himself.Fu seems to have the ability to get the job done, but he?s too damn nice, which is a perfect fit for Jet Li the actor. This is actually the best character Jet Li has played in a while, eschewing his humorless acting for a gentler personality. This film effectively dodges the previously inescapable Jet Li bullet: no personality. Eric Tsang and Jet Li make a good team, with Tsang edging Li in the acting department. However, Li isn?t too bad, and we hear his real voice for the first time.Gigi Leung shows up as Tsang?s daughter, a budding lawyer who takes a small shine to Fu. As always, she?s incredibly cute but she doesn?t do all that much. Simon Yam is on board as the cop intent on catching all the hitmen entering HK. There are some good action sequences that are weighed down by a sometimes confusing and slow plot. But, this film has a definite HK charm that it deserves credit for. This isn?t a thrill-a-minute exercise, but it?s quite worthwhile, especially for the chemistry between the actors.Parents Guide: View content advisory for parentsRuntime: 103 minCountry: Hong KongCertification:Philippines:PG-13 | Iceland:16 | Finland:K-15 | South Korea:15 | Australia:MA | Canada:13+ (Quebec) | Canada:18A | Germany:18 | Hong Kong:IIB | New Zealand:R16 | Singapore:NC-16 | Sweden:15 (video rating) | UK:18 | USA:R
