thx
Encode:
well the disc wasnt the burner as usual, some interlace, some ghost frames, some noise in the video.
also ar and aspect was off, the nearest fitting video size is 700x400. also chose a lower bitrate,
as usual dont see the point in making it bigger than needed.
tried to fix all above mentioned problems, also added slightly sharpness and brightness, still got
watchable considering the source files. Slightly unsharp but its not gonna get better than this.
