Description
The collection of comments in this text file certainly are different from the
ones included with the other Persuasion,(2007).
I like it. The 1995 write-ups are lively, upbeat and positive.
The 2007 comments are too wrapped up in analysis and criticism.
What a difference!
I liked it and I needed it.
