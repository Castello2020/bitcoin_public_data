BeeThink IP Blocker v1.3 Software + Crack | 1.73 MB
BeeThink IP Blocker is an application which will help you block unwanted IP addresses based on IP blocklists. It monitors network activities in real-time and prevents the connection between a server/website and certain IP addresses or ranges of addresses. BeeThink IP Blocker effectively bans undesired connections from those computers to a website, mail server, or other Internet server. It is very easy to block country IP addresses with Apache's .htaccess file. If users want to know where their computers communicate, the 'IP address look up' program will tell them more. Meanwhile, users can easily build up their blacklist or whitelist by simply clicking.
If you want to block unwanted network access to your website, an Apache's .htaccess file will be a good choice. But the htaccess file can only prevent the unwanted connection to your server application which is at a higher level, it does not cut off the unwanted network connection to your server computer. In other words, hackers can easily invade your computer at a lower network layer.
BeeThink IP Blocker works under NDIS (Network Driver Interface Specification) layer, which is the first layer that incoming network traffic passes through. Since NDIS filtering occurs at such a low level, BeeThink IP Blocker can filter each incoming and outgoing network packet. When a packet is received or sent from the user's computer, BeeThink IP Blocker will query the firewall rules to determine whether to let it pass through.
Here are some key features of "BeeThink IP Blocker":-
------------------------------------------------------------------
· Block IP addresses. BeeThink IP Blocker easily blocks country IP addresses with Apache's .htaccess file.
· Real-Time network activities monitoring. BeeThink IP Blocker monitors each incoming and outgoing packet in Real-Time. It displays local address, remote address, and other information of each network traffic.

1. Extract the .rar
2. Ignore/delete the "Enter Here" and "Just one Click to Get More Stuff" internet shortcuts.
3. Go into BeeThink_IP_Blocker_1.3 folder
4. Ignore/delete the internet shortcuts... AGAIN.
5. Install BeeThink_IP_Blocker_setup 6. Go into the crack folder. Copy the crack (and yes, there is one) into the installation directory. reply
