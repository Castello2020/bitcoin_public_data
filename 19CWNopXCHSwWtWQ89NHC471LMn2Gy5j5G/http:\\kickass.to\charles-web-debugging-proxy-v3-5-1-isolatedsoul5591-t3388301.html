Description
Product Description:
Charles is a web proxy (HTTP Proxy / HTTP Monitor) that runs on your own computer. Your web browser (or any other Internet application) is then configured to access the Internet through Charles, and Charles is then able to record and display for you all of the data that is sent and received.
In Web and Internet development you are unable to see what is being sent and received between your web browser / client and the server. Without this visibility it is difficult and time-consuming to determine exactly where the fault is. Charles makes it easy to see what is happening, so you can quickly diagnose and fix problems.
Charles makes debugging quick, reliable and advanced; saving you time and frustration!
KEY FEATURES:
SSL Proxying – view SSL requests and responses in plain text
Bandwidth Throttling to simulate slower Internet connections including latency
AJAX debugging – view XML and JSON requests and responses as a tree or as text
AMF – view the contents of Flash Remoting / Flex Remoting messages as a tree
Repeat requests to test back-end changes
Edit requests to test different inputs
Breakpoints to intercept and edit requests or responses
Validate recorded HTML, CSS and RSS/atom responses using the W3C validator
What's New?
Minor bug fixes.
--> Repeat advanced tool: fix bug which caused it to stop prematurely after a number of requests
--> Auto save tool: fix bug where "Enable on startup" didn't work
Installation:
--> Open folder & mount dmg
--> Drag app to your applications folder
--> Use registration info from .txt file
--> Done!
ENJOY!!
