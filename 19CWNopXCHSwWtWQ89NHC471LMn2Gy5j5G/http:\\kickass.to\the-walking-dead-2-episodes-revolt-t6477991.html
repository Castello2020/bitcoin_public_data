• 02 Jul 2012, 15:34 I'm not the same guy but you take c:progamfiles/walking dead 2/pack/walkingdead102 folder and move it to the place were you first installed Episode 1, at c:progamfiles/walking dead /pack/
don't place it in the default folder, just next to it in the pack folder. This worked for me, I have windows 7 btw 5

• 02 Jul 2012, 09:11 Works great, If you want to keep your save, install it somewhere seperate, then find the folder for episode 2, and copy that folder into your original install, in the folder you grabbed it from All Comments
please, leave only comments related to that torrent
