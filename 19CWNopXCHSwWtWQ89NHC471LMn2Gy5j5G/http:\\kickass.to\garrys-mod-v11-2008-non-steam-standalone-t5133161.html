Description
Garry's.Mod.11 |===========================================================================================| |Garry's Mod or GMod is a modification for the Source engine. It is a physics sandbox game | |that allows the player to manipulate objects and experiment with physics.Garry's Mod was | |created in 2005 by Garry Newman. It started out as a mod that allowed users to rope things | |to go together, and it made the pistol shoot out manhacks. Since then, the game has gone | |through eleven versions, adding more and more features until it became the established | |community-based sandbox game it is today. With the tenth version of Garry's Mod, the | |version numbers were dropped, and it has now become simply Garry's Mod.Garry's Mod allows | |players to manipulate props from any Source engine game using the Physics Gun, or Physgun, | |a blue version of Half-Life 2's Gravity Gun (Which is really the same model as the super | |gravity gun at the end of HL2) that allows objects to be picked up from any distance, | |adjusted in mid-air and frozen in place. A second, multi-purpose gun called the Tool Gun | |can perform many tasks such as weld objects together or rope them together with ropes or | |controllable winches, plus hanging lights and lamps, doors and buttons, or whatever the | |community is able to code it to perform. | |===========================================================================================| |System Requirements: | |1.7 GHz processor | |512 MB RAM | |DirectX 8 compatible videocard | |Windows 2000/XP/Vista | |===========================================================================================| |Install Info: | |1.Download and Unrar | |2.Start the game with Launcher.exe located in the Garry's Mod folder. | |3.Play the game. If you like it, buy it. It supports the developers and encourages them to | | make new games. | |===========================================================================================| |Other Info: | |For more addons/mods go to: www^garrysmod^org/downloads/ | |This was tested and was fully working! | |Enjoy! | |___________________________________________________________________________________________|
