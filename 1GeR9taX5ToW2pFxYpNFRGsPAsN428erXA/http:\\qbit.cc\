									<p>WHEN Ernest Shackleton and his men marched towards the South Pole in December 1908, they came across something entirely unexpected. After scaling the vast Beardmore glacier on the edge of the polar plateau, they found seams of coal amid the snow and ice. They also found impressions of leaves in sandstone boulders nearby and even fossilised wood from a coniferous tree.</p>

									<p>The next day I went into work and sat down with a trusted senior Mexican manager.  I looked at him and said, &#8220;I thought guns were illegal in Mexico.&#8221;  He chuckled and said, &#8220;So you stayed in town last night?&#8221;  As the conversation progressed, it became clear that guns are as common in Mexico as tamales at Christmas.  Everyone he knows, including himself, own at least one gun.  And, it matters not whether it&#8217;s a semi-auto or fully automatic, they&#8217;re all illegal, so why stop with semi-autos?  Though clearly illegal in the states in most instances, a lot of Mexicans have more firepower in terms of military weapons than we can only dream of owning here.</p>

Now we know that Pappas was correct.  The embarassment of having Secretary of State Clinton talk about bin Laden in Pakistan was horrific.  He has been dead since December 13, 2001 and now, finally, everyone, Obama, McChrystal, Cheney, everyone who isn&#8217;t nuts is finally saying what they have known for years.</p>

							<strong>Brave New World - Aldous Huxley (1932)</strong> &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&nbsp; In this mesmerized, technologically, pharmacologically-controlled society of the future, a person's caste is predetermined before birth.  The ubiquitous drug <em>Soma</em> suppresses emotions.  Only "savages" dare live outside this system.         
							Aldous' brother Julian Huxley was the first Director General of UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization).

							 <strong>Underground History of American Education - John Taylor Gatto </strong> &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&nbsp;  This is an incredibly detailed look into the origins of compulsory public schooling in the US. So detailed in fact that I'm only half way through it, but it has been informative so far.  Recommended highly for those with kids in school.

							<strong>The Fluoride Deception - Christopher Bryson</strong> &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&nbsp; 
							Everything you ever didn't want to know about the history, politics, fraudulent science, and adverse health effects of water fluoridation. Health effects of ingesting fluoride include Skeletal fluorosis, brain damage, bone cancer, and disruption of the endocrine and reproductive systems.  
							98% of Europe does not fluoridate water, so why is the majority of municipal water in the US is fluoridated with poisonous fluorosilicic acid?  Why are we <a href="/chinese-fluoride-of-questionable-purity-being-added-us-water/">using impure imported chinese product</a>?

							<strong>1984 - George Orwell (Eric Blair)</strong> &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&nbsp; One of the quintessential works of dystopian fiction.  Combines themes like mind control, propaganda, and torture, and with a depressing love story. 
							Orwell's future is the quintessential police state.  Animal Farm was fun and perhaps has some metaphoric political commentary, but it's very esoteric compared to the piercing message of 1984. This is the one that would never make it onto a high school required reading list. "In a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act."

							<strong>Classified Woman-The Sibel Edmonds Story </strong> In this startling new memoir, Sibel Edmonds—the most classified woman in U.S. history—takes us on a surreal journey that begins with the secretive FBI and down the dark halls of a feckless Congress to a stonewalling judiciary and finally, to the national security whistleblowers movement she spearheaded.

							<strong>Dark Alliance - Gary Webb</strong> &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&nbsp; If you have ever wondered whether the US Government really ships in tons of cocaine, this is the book to read.  Gary Webb's meticulous research into the topic set a new bar for journalistic integrity. 
								Unfortunately he knew too much and wouldn't shut up, so he was suicided.  Can a person shoot themselves twice in the head?  Extremely improbable.  Could his death have be related to what Gary described as "government people" breaking into his apartment who he caught "scaling down the pipes" after coming home? Could it have been related to the death threats he was receiving?  
								It's obvious that the War on Drugs is a fraud, but until you read this book you will not know just how deep that rat hole goes.  Respect and gratitude to Gary Webb who paid the ultimate price so that we would know where all the crack was coming from.

							<strong>Trance Formation of America - Cathy O'Brien and Mark Phillips</strong> &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&nbsp; Cathy O'Brien claims to have been a victim of the CIA's MK Ultra mind control; used as a drug mule and sex slave to the New World Order elite.  What she describes fits with other evidence of MK Ultra, Project Monarch, CIA drug dealing, and the New World Order agenda.  
								If Cathy and Mark were the only ones coming out with stories like this, it'd be a lot easier to dismiss. Research MK Ultra / Project Monarch for more info.

							<strong>Terror Storm - Alex Jones</strong> &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&nbsp;  I was somewhat awake before watching this movie, but it propelled me to a new level of understanding.  Terror Storm is a historical analysis of government sponsored <em>false flag terror </em>- 
							terror attacks that have been carried out by governments and blamed on enemies as pretexts for wars and policies that would otherwise not be accepted.  Even those of us not yet exposed to this information may have our suspicions about certain terror attacks, but was one of the first, and certainly the most influential documentary ever to tie it all together with a particular focus on 9/11.  It's packed with documented, declassified, historical evidence. If you only watch one of Alex Jones' films, this should be it.
							But after watching this one you'll probably want to watch them all.

							<strong>The Corporation</strong> &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&nbsp; Mikela J. Mikael (Actor), Rob Beckwermert (Actor), Jennifer Abbott (Director), Mark Achbar (Director).

							<strong>Endgame: Blueprint for GLobal Enslavement - Alex Jones</strong> &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&nbsp;

							<strong>Loose Change - Final Cut -  Dylan Avery, Jason Bermas, Corey Rowe</strong> &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&nbsp; 
							<em>The</em> final cut of the original 9/11 documentary.  Covers controlled demolition of WTC7, 1, and 2, pentagon inconsistencies, and flight 93 shoot-down.  Dylan, Jason and Corey were in high school when they made this video,
							but the production is top-notch. Perhaps the most widely downloaded film of all time, it has awoken millions to the real perpetrators of the world's deadiest false flag terror attack.
