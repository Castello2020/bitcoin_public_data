<p>THE SALT LAKE HERALD SUNDAY JUNE 27 1897<br />
STRANGEST MAN IN NEW YORK<br />
Nikola Tesla and His Perpetual Motion Machine</p>
<p>New York June 25 -The strangest man in this city is unquestionably Nikola Tesla. Within the past fortnight he has astounded scientists the world over by his announcement that he had perfected his wireless telegraphy – in other words that he had sent and received communications between distant points without the use of wires and simply employing the natural energy the earth. Nature, he says, teems with power and motion.</p>
<p>Tesla is a young man. He has just past his fortieth birthday. If he lives 20 years or more and retains his faculties the world will be a different place to live in compared with today. His ideas and projects are so big that it takes time to grasp their real import. He talks as calmly of producing a flash of lightning a mile long as the ordinary man speaks of telegraphing to Chicago. Not long ago in his laboratory he said: ”I expect to live to be able to set a machine in the middle of this room and move it by the energy of no other agency than the medium in motion around us.”</p>
<p>This sounds like the vaporings of a dreamer. It means a perpetual motion machine, and that, in itself, is enough to stamp Tesla, in the minds of ordinary men as a full-fledged visionary.</p>
<p>But Tesla is the very acme of practicality in all things except money making. If he wished he could be a millionaire five times over. As it is, there are dozens of ordinary mechanics within a mile of his laboratory who could buy and sell him six times over. “If every man.” said Tesla, “who uses my machine in electro-terafy alone would give me a quarter of a dollar, I would be very wealthy. I have never received a dollar for it, and there is no way in which I could.</p>
<p>Tesla is I strange in all things. He will talk willingly about electrical inventions of the past, present and future, but it is like drawing teeth to him to say a word about himself. He has a genuine distaste for notoriety when Tesla, the man, is concerned, and politely asks to be let alone.</p>
<p>He ts a Montenegran by birth. His father was a man of unusual mental attainments, and his mother had the inventive genius to a considerable degree. “I am not much of a linguist,” says Tesla. “I speak but six or seven or eight languages. My father spoke 18, and, besides, he was a remarkable mathematician.”</p>
<p>Tesla is tall, thin and lanky, but quick and impulsive in manner and earnest in speech. He is not much of a talker, but every word he utters means something. His head is big and bony and his ears stick out. He is not a handsome man, by any means, but he is impressive. His hair is as black as hair can be, and is coarse and rumpled.</p>
<p>Physically he does not appear to he robust, but he says his constitution is rugged and he can stand almost any strain. In his youth he was a famous wrestler. He went in for all kinds of sport. The Montenegrans are rare gamblers, and Tesla inherited the national love of excitement over the card table. More than once in those days he went through single sittings of 48 hours at a stretch, and then only stopped because the other players had succumbed.</p>
<p>“I know the fascination of play,” he said, “but all the allurements of the game are insipid to me compared with the overmastering excitement of life in the laboratory. No thrill can go through the human frame like that felt by the Inventor as he sees the creation of his brain unfolding to success after months and years of waiting and hoping.” So Tesla does not gamble now, at least, not over the card table. His laboratory supplies all the excitement that his emotion can stand.</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s father was a clergyman of the Greek church, and it was intended that the son should fit himself for the same life. The idea of entering the ministry was opposed by the boy with such pertinacity that at last his father compromised by agreeing that he should become a professor or mathematics and physics. With that end in view Tesla was sent to the Polytechnic institute at Gratz, and there, in operation, was a gramme dynamo. That simple electrical instrument, the first that he had seen, settled the future calling of Tesla.</p>
<p>Prior to entering the Polytechnic at Gratz he had first attended a public school at Gospich, and later spent three years at the high school in Carstatt, Croatia. It was while he was here that he saw his first steam engine.</p>
<p>Immediately on entering the Polytechnic he began experimenting with electricity, and when his father heard of it there was a stiff family row, but the son came off victor, and instead of taking the course that would have fitted him for a college professorship of mathematics, he studied engineering. The gramme dynamo became his great pet, and while working about it he got the notion that it could be operated without commutator or brushes. This idea he labored over and experimented upon and finally after many years, it resulted in one of his greatest inventions, a rotating field motor.</p>
<p>The world owes a debt of gratitude to the little gramme dynamo, as it instigated the fundamental idea which subsequent elaborations and perfections by Tesla made possible several of the grandest mechanical feats that the world has ever known. When Tesla first came to this country, little I was known of the alternating current, and electrical energy was delivered almost entirely by the continuous current system. This is a successful method for short line work, but where the power is to be transmitted to a considerable distance it is impracticable.</p>
<p>One of Tesla&#8217;s inventions, based upon his first idea, was an alternating current motor that permitted the transmission of energy long distances at high pressure over the wires. This invention made possible the bridling of the power in Niagara, and natural forces by its use can be harnessed everywhere. Originally it was thought necessary to employ two wires for the transmission of power &#8211; one to convey it and the other to return it. Tesla proved that the second wire was a needless expense and that the energy could be transmitted with one wire with smaller waste than with two.</p>
<p>The bulk of Tesla&#8217;s income is derived from his invention in the rotating field, and it is not a large income either. He also receives a small sum from his fathers estate, and these are the sum total of his pecuniary resources. Nine-tenths of this money goes into his laboratory work. He spends next to nothing on himself. He is unmarried. He says an inventor has no business marrying, as the necessary home life would surely interfere with the prosecution of his labors.</p>
<p>From 12 to 18 hours a day he spends in his laboratory. He has no social life. He attended a reception once, was lionized by his hostess and the guests and spent the most unhappy hour of his life. Since then he has avoided social functions with assiduous care.</p>
<p>After leaving the school at Gratz Tesla went to Paris, but he attracted little attention, because his Ideas were then in their infancy and were of such magnificent calibre that the mere mention of them made the leading French electricians regard their originator as a fanciful dreamer. Some friend advised him to come to America. This he did, and, hunting up Thomas A. Edison soon convinced that genius that he was a valuable man to employ.</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s stay with Edison was brief. He had his own ideas, and, it is believed, they clashed with Edison&#8217;s. Tesla has never said much about this. Right here it should be mentioned that the Montenegrans has not the jealousy common among inventors. He never belittles the work of any man, and he has done more for young electricians Just starting out than any other dozen men of his profession.<br />

					<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Tesla Coil Conversations</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>by Arto Juhani Heino (c) 2014</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Memories of Tesla and 1000 other coils</p>
<p>Arto and Fred standing in front of a Large Cylindrical Tesla Coil, in the workshop and home laboratory of Arto Heino:</p>
<p><strong>Arto:</strong> &#8220;Stick your hand in at the base of that big Tesla coil and tell me if the voltage is big&#8221;, he said while grinning wryly.<br />
<strong>Fred:</strong> &#8220;No way man, I can see the high voltage at the top, which means I might die, because it is the current that kills&#8221;, jumps back while he exclaims, being puzzled by his own instinctive understanding.<br />
<strong>Arto:</strong> “Well said, how did you figure that out?”<br />
<strong>Fred:</strong> “Just hanging around you, by watching how you avoid touching the primary and any part down at the base of the coil”</p>
<p>He looks around the workshop and sees lots of different balls sizes and some toroids, he can see that they attach to the top of the Tesla coil.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> &#8220;Why have you got that ball on top?&#8221;<br />
<strong>Arto:</strong> &#8220;To store the reactive charge into the dielectric around the ball while the dielectric component is reflected at the anti-node and will be transformed back to the magnetic component at the base which is reflected by the node, all this happens during each cycle at its natural frequency and is the due to it&#8217;s standing wave resonant structure, which relates to the length of the wire being the quarter of the wave length of its natural frequency, while also adhering to the balance of two components the inductive which is the magnetic component and the capacitive which is the dielectric component at the same frequency,&#8221;<br />
<strong>Arto:</strong> &#8220;To simplify they act as polar opposites both have reflections at the opposite node, Magnetic/Node, Dielectric/Anti-node, so simple no complicated explanation necessary. This sort of knowledge makes theoretical and mathematical people nervous.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Fred:</strong> &#8220;Wow that changes a my way of thinking, they never told me that at school&#8221;<br />
<strong>Arto:</strong> &#8220;I understand, sometimes understanding something is not easy, you have to be able to fail and disappoint yourself to get past those prejudices&#8221;</p>
<p>Now they are standing in front of a bench with lots of coils, capacitors and power supplies:</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> &#8220;What’s with that other coil, there is no sparks or ball?&#8221;<br />
<strong>Arto:</strong> &#8220;Oh that is a half-wave system, that doesn’t use a reactive transformation like the Tesla Coil. It just swaps between the Voltage/Current transform, but in a nodal resonant fashion, by the length of the wire being half the length of the wave length of its natural frequency.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fred points to another fancy coil on the bench:</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> “That one their has a ball at either end, and a thick primary in the center.”<br />
<strong>Arto:</strong> “That is another half wave system, but this one also has capacitive reactive exchanges at either end, it acts like two Tesla coils joined at the base.”</p>
<p>Fred walks over and flicks the switch that is labelled “LC circuit”.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> &#8220;Then what’s this other one here, it has a Capacitor and Coil, but it sparks are small&#8221;<br />
<strong>Arto:</strong> &#8220;That is similar to the Big Tesla Coil, but it only resonates between the reactive components not the nodal structure, the wire length only relates to the amount of turns and an increase in inductance&#8221;<br />
<strong>Fred:</strong> &#8220;Oh so you are saying that resonance can be number of exchange devices&#8221;</p>
<p>Fred picks up a long cylindrical neon tube and walks over to the Tesla coil:</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> &#8220;Check out that Neon light when you bring it to the top of the coil&#8221;<br />
<strong>Arto:</strong> &#8220;Yes, that is the high charge density around the top capacitance, it affects the neon inside the tube and makes it fluoresce, that’s why they call it a florescent tube&#8221;<br />
<strong>Fred:</strong> &#8220;The light is not bright down here&#8221;<br />
<strong>Arto:</strong> &#8220;That is because the alternating magnetic component does not affect the neon in the tube, and the dielectric charge density is low just like the voltage but having said that the current density is high&#8221;</p>
<p>Now they are standing in front of a industrial neon light fitting, using a multimeter:</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> &#8220;How come when I measure the small neon transformer here it only shows 120 volts&#8221;<br />
<strong>Arto:</strong> &#8220;That’s the voltage just to maintain the florescent activity in the tube, the ignition circuit starts the florescence and is part of the same transformer, it just creates a inductive high voltage charge when the starter switches&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not hard to teach people to look but its takes a lifetime to educate those to see.&#8221; &#8211; Arto Heino</p>
<p>This could be one  my last post on WordPress, due to slow sales of my book and lack of support for my work, I will be moving my previous posts and they will be only available as PDFs, sorry I given a lot of my work for free and do not know if I can continue with this blog, good luck to all the experimenters and researchers. Regards Arto.</p>

<p>NIKOLA TESLA.</p>
<p>(By Frank G. Carpenter in the Los Angeles &#8220;Illustrated Weekly Magazine.&#8221;)</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>TESLA&#8217;S NEW INVENTIONS.</p>
<p>And , now to Mr. Tesla&#8217;s latest discoveries. If he has what he thinks he has he will revolutionise labor and give man greater benefits than have come from any inventor since the world began. Indeed, the statements made me tonight in the mouth of any other man would be a fair test of in sanity. But many of Tesla&#8217;s wild statements of the past have been verified by great working inventions. He said he could harness Niagara, and through his experiments in tho rotary magnetic fields Niagara is now furnishing a power equal to that of tens of thousands 0f horses, and electrical works are being run by the same principle all over the globe. The New York subway, for instance, is founded upon it, Tesla demonstrated that wireless telegraphy could be done in 1893, and it is a question whether his inventions in that field are not prior in those of Marconi or De Forrest.</p>
<p>Tonight he told me that he had almost completed inventions by which he could send electrical power lo any distance, without wires, and that in any quantity, small or great. Said he :—</p>
<p>&#8220;I have proved that power can be thus transmitted. Let us suppose I have my plant at Niagara and you are running a sugar factory in Australia ; by my discoveries ii will be possible to send you 100, 500, or 1,000 horsepower for your factory, and to supply the same regularly, by the force furnished from Niagara Falls. Suppose you are travelling in the wilds of the Andes and make your camp on the shores of Lake Titicaca. By the outcome of this principle you may have telegraphed to you the instantaneous reports of the news of tho world as it happens from time to time. You may cook your dinner over an electric fire thus transmitted, and you may have the same at will on any part cf the globe. We shall be able to send power from place to place at will, and that at such a small cost that it will be industrially profitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>THE TRANSMISSION OF ENERGY WITHOUT WIRES.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you discover that this might be done, Mr. Tesla ?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been for years working on the transmission of electrical energy, and, in 1898 established a laboratory on the edge of the Rocky Mountains, near Colorado Springs, My laboratory, there was over 6,000ft, high, higher than the top of Mount Washington, and I had extraordinary conditions for my experiments. Colorado is famous for its natural displays of electrical force. The earth at times is alive with electrical vibrations, and the air is full of electricity. I have seen 12,000 lightning discharges with in two hours, and all within a radius of 30 miles of my laboratory. These discharges were of great violence, some of them looking like trees of fire on the heavens. It was among such discharges that I had my electrical instruments, and studied the principles of electricity transmission through the earth and air. One day while watching the lightning I noticed that the discharges afar off often affected the instruments in my laboratory more than those near by. Upon examination I found that this could not be caused by the difference of intensity in the individual charges.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What could it be ?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Through instruments made for the purpose I tested the matter from time to time and finally came to the conclusion that the vibrations caused by the lightning moved around the world, and that there were stationary waves, I could gauge the discharges near the laboratory and see them fade away, and, after a certain fixed period, find   them returning almost with no loss of power. In short, this planet, big as it is, was acting as a conductor, and I became convinced that upon it not only telegraphic messages, but also the modulations of the human voice and electrical power in unlimited amounts, could&#8217; be carried around the entire globe, and sent to any part of it with hardly any perceptible loss. With my transmitter I actually sent electrical vibrations around the world and resolved them again, and I then went on to develop my machinery. I had, as I have told you, been studying and inventing along the lines electrical   transmission, and was ready to take advantage of my discovery. I have   since so improved the means of individualisation and isolation that such energy may be sent in any amount to any fixed place without danger of its going elsewhere or affecting others,   and I believe the individualisation can be carried out to almost any degree.&#8221;</p>
<p>NIAGARA FOR THE WORLD.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will this enable the power of Niagara to be sent anywhere over the world ?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have been experimenting at my laboratory on Long Island. I have machinery and buildings there which have cost in the neighborhood of £70,000, and the results show me that a plant could be erected at Niagara which can transmit its force to any place, desired. I am designing such a plant now at my laboratory, and would have had it completed had it not been for unforeseen delays, which have nothing to do with its technical features. The design which I have adopted will have a transmitter which will emit a wave complex of a total maximum activity of 10,000,000 horse- power, one per cent, of which is enough to girdle the globe. This enormous rate of energy delivery &#8211; it is twice, as much as the force of Niagara Falls &#8211; is obtainable only by the use of certain artifices which I shall make known some time in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been offered 10,000 horse- power from the Canadian Power Company. What I want to do is to build machinery there and transmit this power to various parts of the globe. The value of that amount of horsepower would be about £40,000 per year, and a plant erected to take advantage of it will pay large dividends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much would the plant cost?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It might cost in the neighborhood of £400,000, but its value would be enormous, and its success would revolutionise the working forces of the globe. It would result in other plants being erected at other places, and in the utilisation of all the great waterfalls for the work of man.&#8221;</p>
<p>MOTHER EARTH PUT TO WORK.</p>
<p>&#8220;By this invention every live part of mother earth&#8217;s body would he brought into action. Energy will be collected all over the globe in amounts small or large, as it may exist, ranging from a fraction of one to a few horsepower or more. Every waterfall can be utilised, every coalfield made to produce energy to be transmitted to vast distances, and every place on earth can have power at small cost. One of the minor uses might be the illumination of isolated homes. We could light houses all over the country, by means of vacuum tubes operated by high frequency currents. We could keep the clocks of the United States going and give everyone exact time; we could turn factories, machine shops and mills, small or large, anywhere, and I believe could also navigate the air.</p>
<p>THE TRANSMISSION OF INTELLIGENCE.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the most important features of this invention,&#8217; said Mr. Tesla, &#8220;&#8216;will be the transmission of intelligence. It will convert the entire earth into a huge brain, capable of responding in every one of its parts. By the employment of a number of plants, each of which can transmit signals to all parts of the world, the news of the globe will be flashed to all points. A cheap and simple receiving device, which might be carried in one&#8217;s pocket, can be set up anywhere on sea or land, and it will record the world&#8217;s news as it occurs, or take such special messages as are intended for it. If you are in the heart of the Sahara, your wife can telegraph to you from Washington, and if the instrument is properly made you alone will get the message. A single plant of a few horsepower could operate hundreds of such instruments, so that the invention has an infinite working capacity, and will cheapen the transmission of all kinds of intelligence.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Daily News (Perth, WA) Saturday 1 April 1905</p>
<p>NIKOLA TESLA.</p>
<p>(By, Frank G. Carpenter in the Los Angeles &#8220;Illustrated Weekly, Magazine.&#8221;)</p>
<p>I give you to-day the substance of two remarkable talks with Nikola Tesla. The first I had in his laboratory on East Houston Street, nine years ago last September. The second was held in the Waldorf tonight.</p>
<p>The first interview was most interesting, giving a wonderful insight into Tesla the inventor and Tesla the man, but it was never published, for Mr. Tesla, at its close, on the ground of business reasons, begged that I say nothing about him for months to come. I wrote out the notes, however, and laid them away, and when I met Mr. Tesla tonight I told him I now intended to use them. At the same time we had the most extraordinary conversation about his recent discoveries and inventions as to the transmission of force, which I reproduce in the latter part of this article.</p>
<p>TESLA THE MAN.</p>
<p>First take a glance at Tesla the man. He looked more like an Italian savant than a hard working inventor when I saw him in the Waldorf tonight. He was in evening dress, and was the most striking figure of the score of public men who stood about the lobby. Mr. Tesla is now 47 years of age, and is in his physical and intellectual prime. He is tall and slender, his head is long, thin and intellectual, with a forehead high and full. He was born in Hungary and educated there, but he speaks English perfectly, and is one of the most charming conversationalists I have ever met. During my chat of some years ago he talked of his boyhood. His father was a clergyman of the Greek Church, and Nikola was intended for the priesthood. He had a brother older than himself, whom the rest of the family, considered much brighter. That brother died young, and this so crazed his father and mother that it took them long to realise the genius of Nikola. If he stood well in his studies his father&#8217;s eyes would fill as he thought how much better, perhaps, the other son might have done, and whatever Nikola did was always compared with the possible work of the boy who had passed away. His first education was in the public schools of Gospich, and after that he went to the Real Schule at Karlstadt. As he went on with his studies he liked mathematics so much that he intended to fit himself to be a professor of mathematics and physics, and with that view studied at the Polytechnic School at Gratz. He changed to the engineering course, and later on stud- ied philosophy and languages in the colleges at Prague and Budapest. He has since been made a doctor of laws by Yale and Columbia. Shortly after completing his studies Mr. Tesla was associated with the Government of Austria-Hungary in the telegraph engineering department, where he invented several improvements. From there he went to Paris, to be engineer of a large lighting company, and thence to the United States, where he was employed by Thomas Edison in his laboratory. His next position was that of electrician to the Tesla Electric Light Company, and at the same time he established the Tesla laboratory, from which his great inventions have come.</p>
<p>TESLA THE INVENTOR.</p>
<p>During my chat with Mr. Tesla I asked him when he first realised that he had the inventive faculty, and he told me he had always been inventing something or other. When he was quite a small boy he made toy guns, which would shoot birds, and as he was the only one who could make them he supplied the boys of his neighborhood. He made clocks at eight or nine years of age, and began to dabble in electricity before he was in his teens. His first determination to devote his life to invention came shortly after he went to London to deliver a lecture before a scientific society there. At this lecture he met Lord Rayleigh, the great physicist, and showed him some of his experiments. Rayleigh said that he had undoubtedly the faculty of discovery and that he would succeed as an inventor. &#8220;Shortly after this my mother died,&#8221; said Mr. Tesla, &#8220;and I concluded to exert this power. Lord Rayleigh had said I possessed it, and, upon examining myself, I believed him correct. I did not want to waste my powers on small things, and I decided to strive towards something that would benefit humanity. I am working on an invention for the transmission of force. This invention will, I believe, revolutionise the world of labor. I am also working on electricity, and I cannot remember when I was not working more or less in the direction of a successful flying machine. My idea as to that is along different lines than any yet proposed, and I expect to see it realised. Indeed, we shall eventually have flying machines that will be large enough to carry crowds through the air. They must be large in order to succeed&#8221;. These words were uttered by Mr.Tesla nine years ago. Today he says he has completed his force transmission invention, as will be seen, by my Waldorf conversation, which follows. He has also done other things which he proposed in that interview. Remember, it was before the time of the wireless telegraph, but he then said to me the following:—   &#8220;I tell, you, we are on the threshold of a new era. We have only begun to master the great forces of Nature, and the inventions of the next few decades will be far superior to any of the past. What would you think of standing on the shore and telephoning to your friend in midocean? What of being in the centre of a room and making your whole body blaze with light? What of sending power to and fro over tho earth at will and making it do its work anywhere, and almost anyhow?</p>
<p>HOW IT FEELS TO INVENT.</p>
<p>Mr. Tesla told me that his greatest pleasure was in his work, and that he could conceive no moment so exciting and rapturous as that connected with the discovery of a new principle which, when put into use, would revolutionise the work of the world. Take, for instance, the invention which brought forth the apparatus used in the transmission of power at Niagara Falls. Said he, as he took me to a great coil of wire wound round a stationary magnet, which was connected with the dynamo, and held above it a little globe in which was a steel wheel moving on a pivot: &#8220;I had been working on that experiment for a long time, and this was the test. I know that if I were correct the wheel in this globe, would revolve as soon as I turned on the electricity. It did revolve, and I know. I had discovered  what would revolutionise the labor of tho world. You can run all sorts of power by that principle. You can take power from Niagara and bring it to New York. The cars can be pulled by it, factories run, houses heated and dinners cooked. I cannot describe my sensation when I saw the wheel revolve. I thought I should go crazy, and I went home, to my laboratory and took some bromide of potassium to quiet me. &#8220;It has been the same in some of my experiments with electric lights and other things. No 1 the greatest rapture one can have is to discover a new force or series of forces which will reduce man&#8217;s working necessities to the minimum. I do not believe in laziness, and I should like to see the loafer wiped from the face of the earth, but I want that those who are willing, to work should accomplish their results with the least labor and in the best way,&#8221;</p>
<p>HOW TESLA WORKS.</p>
<p>As to Mr. Tesla himself, there is no harder worker known. He told me that he seldom slept more than four hours of a night, and during some periods not more than three. When in the thick of a new invention it was hard to sleep. His work in always with him, and he says that his mind sometimes works in his sleep. He awakes in the morning to find that the problem which had worried him when he went to bed has been practically solved overnight. He has always been a light sleeper. His mother died at 70 and she never took more than four hours sleep. His father also was a light sleeper. Tesla is a peculiar worker. Failures do not trouble him.  After he undertakes a thing and decides that it should come out a certain way, he keeps on experimenting and experimenting, believing in his success. He says that if he doubted his ability it would make him crazy. He seems to have a dual mind. He told me that he often found himself carrying on two trains of thought at the same time, and said that while he was talking to me he could see the figures of some of his calculations behind me and could carry them on at the same time. He is always figuring. His scrap basket is filled with the calculations which he has torn up and thrown away. He keeps a record of his experiments, and when his laboratory was burned some years ago he lost the work of years in ideas and suggestions which had thus been recorded. (To be continued on Monday)</p>

<p>The Cumberland Argus and Fruitgrowers Advocate, (Parramatta, NSW) Wednesday 27, February 1901</p>
<p>TESLA LIGHT.      MARS.</p>
<p>The system by which Mr. Nikola Tesla hopes to be able to signal Mars. Mr. Tesla recently said to an interviewer : — &#8221; It seems to me that only men absolutely stricken with blindness can hold that the earth is the sole planet inhabited by intelligent beings. I have perfected my transmitting apparatus to the extent that I can understand to construct a machine which, without a doubt will be fully competent to convey sufficient energy to Mars to operate delicate appliances such as are used here. Since we ourselves are so far advanced, is it unreasonable to believe in the possibility that of the 20 or 25 planets of the solar system, one, if  not more, may be ahead of us in evolution ? The time has arrived for the electrician to join the astronomer in the explanation of neighbouring worlds.</p>
<p>Fourth planet from sun (140 millions of miles distant). Diameter — little more than half the earth&#8217;s Atmosphere like ours. The black signifies water; the white, land. Note the wonderful canal system, proving that the Martians are highly civilised.</p>

<p>TESLA&#8217;S ACHIEVEMENTS.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Mr. Tesla gives the following description of some of his recent achievements :-&#8221;With a small engine, capable of pressing a piston backward and forward with a force of but two pounds, I have set an entire block of modern buildings, by careful attunement, into such a swaying that the people rushed out affrighted. With an impressed force of a fraction of a pound I caused steel rings of several square inches cross-section, capable of supporting several   hundred tons, to vibrate and form loops like thin piano wires, until they finally broke.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tesla Patents.</p>
<p>&#8220;A&#8221; broad field has apparently opened to tho electrical world   with the expiration, of the three patents granted Nikola Tesla in 1888, covering fundamentally the rotary field type of electric motor. But the actual situation developed by the expiration of these patents is slightly obscured by the patent granted Tesla on the split phase motor in 1890, which still remains in force. The electro-magnetic rotating field was discovered by Professor Galileo Ferraris, of Italy, and on a broad application of the rotating field to alternating current motors the first Tesla patents were issued.   Courts have held broadly, in a number of decisions in litigation concerning these three patents, that they cover the system of producing power from an electric motor by means of the rotary field. Hence it seems reasonable to assume the principle of the rotary field is released to the world of invention by their expiration, in audition, in so far as the split phase patents are concerned, the   invention of this principle by Tesla was denied   by two Courts, one of these decisions being sustained on appeal, and the other reversed. But it remains to be decided by those interested to what extent the line of subsidiary patents issued during the life of the fundamental patents   may narrow the field opened by the termination of the latter.</p>

<p>NIKOLA TESLA.<br />
Nikola Tesla, the American scientist, says coal is a &#8220;back number,&#8221; and that we shall soon be driving machinery, running railway trains, sailing steamships, cooking food, and lighting streets and houses by power obtained direct from the sun.</p>

					<p>I have made  a life long study in researching archives of many types of historical and technical articles for many years, so I decided to focus on one of my favorite people, Nikola Tesla. These are from papers printed and published in Australia, I also decided to include part of the page where his articles reside, it gives you an understanding of the events and cultural times of his era.  Thanks to the National Archives of Canberra.

<p>COSMIC ENERGY</p>
<p>To Drive World Machinery.</p>
<p>INVENTOR&#8217;S CLAIM.<br />
NEW YORK. NOV. 1.</p>
<p>Nikola Tesla, a well-known physicist and inventor, in a signed statement today, announced the discovery of a principle whereby power for driving the machinery of the world may be derived from the cosmic energy operating the universe.<br />
The principle, which taps the source of power described as &#8220;everywhere present In unlimited quantities,&#8221; and which may be transmitted by wire or wireless from a central plant in any part of the globe, will, he says, eliminate the need for coal, oil, gas, or any other common fuels, and will soon be ready for use, and, while the present form will require central plants employing vast machinery, he popes to work out a plan for its use by Individuals.</p>

<p>TESLA&#8217;S BIRTHDAY.<br />
COSMIC RAY REVELATIONS.</p>
<p>Speed 50 Times Greater Than Light.</p>
<p>NEW YORK, July 11.</p>
<p>Mr. Nikola Tesla, the holder of 700 patents, celebrated his 79th birthday anniversary today in his customary fashion by revealing the seemingly incredible advances that he is making in the field of electro-physics. He said that he had completed studies which &#8220;knocked the props&#8221; from under the theory of relativity. He said that he had measured the velocities of the cosmic ray from Antares, which he found to be 50 times greater than the speed of light, which relativity proponents contended to be the maximum speed of the physical universe.<br />
Mr. Tesla, referring to two electrical inventions, described one as &#8220;apparatus by which mechanical energy can be transmitted to any part of the terrestrial globe.&#8221; He said that it had many practical applications, such as providing a new and unfailing means of communication, and a safe means of guiding ships at sea.<br />
Of the other invention he said: &#8220;It will be considered absolutely impossible by competent electrical engineers.&#8221; He described it as a new apparatus for producing direct current without a commutator, whereby aeroplanes and even lorries and railway trains could be operated by electric power from a disconnected station.</p>

<p>The Sydney Morning Herald, NSW, Monday, July 13, 1936</p>
<p>POWER BY WIRELESS.</p>
<p>Nikola Tesla&#8217;s Claim.</p>
<p>NEW YORK, July 11.</p>
<p>M. Nikola Tesla, the noted inventor and electrician, celebrated his 80th birthday by announcing an invention for transmitting power without wires.<br />
He predicted that the development of wireless power would overshadow his other accomplishments. Thus, power developed at Muscle Shoals could be transmitted to England, China, and Little America, with equal ease, and at comparatively little cost.<br />
He added that several European Governments had promised their co-operation. A plant for the exploitation of the invention will be installed in some place in Europe within a year, he claims. The scheme will utilise one hundred million volts, compared with eighteen million volts which, it is stated, is the maxi- mum so far attained in any laboratory.<br />
[Dr. Edgar Booth, of the University of Sydney, said last night: "M. Tesla, as a younger man, made a number of important contributions to the development of science, particularly in the field of electrical phenomena, but he has not been In active scientific work for some years. A similar announcement was given out in the name of M. Tesla at least six months ago, but nothing further happened. Although we appreciate the brilliance of his   earlier work, it would be inadvisable to attach a great amount of importance to the reported discovery until some further particulars are available. There is no doubt that ultimately some method may be obtained by means of which radio energy will be transmitted in a given direction without dissipation, but at the present time there is no practicable scheme which could compete in any way with transmission by wire."]</p>

					<p><strong>An Ode to the Bastardising of Living History</strong></p>
<p><em>by Arto Juhani Heino 2014</em></p>
<p>They are the secretive and work generationally, over aeons to eradicate free thinkers.<br />
They create the Lodges, Societies and groups and form doctrines to maintain their premise.<br />
They indoctrinate members to carry forward their ideas, maintaining foot holds on power to rule society.<br />
The prime steps of control are the money systems in every country, state and county.<br />
They implant a system of wealth creation by false market exchanges and usury.<br />
The plan is to destroy natural history and organic culture by any means possible.<br />
They begin disenfranchising artists, scientists, engineers, farmers, poets and writers.<br />
The artists rebel by expelling fractured images, cacophonous sounds and creating a reflection of their shattered lives.<br />
The scientists become stripped of resources and are left to theorise.<br />
The engineers are left to repair and maintain a broken system.<br />
The farmers are put in servitude to the land owners and corporate resellers.<br />
The writers are left to write about the frivolous and mundane.<br />
They peak in profiteering as false wars wipe out the cultural continuum.<br />
They replace its threads with contrived culture crafted by physiologists, political scientists and psychopaths.<br />
They steal the jewels of a generations of artists, writers, scientists and inventors and rebuild a false dialogue.<br />
The lesser artists now follow a false cultural history.<br />
The lesser scientists are now divorced from application and become theoretical.<br />
The lesser engineers are now system interface designers and are separated from invention.<br />
The lesser writers now give account of a false history of life lived, and fiction becomes the norm.<br />
The lesser freethinkers are now chained to perceptions made by false ideologue.<br />
They repeat events as listed and rewrite history.<br />
The light now shines on calamity that praise the death dealers.<br />
The power mongrels are treated as heroes and guiding spirits.<br />
The sustenance of our living culture is poisoned by the misguided.<br />
The bodies of our being are ravaged by the weakness in our nutrition.<br />
The minds of men are now but empty vessels to the oligarchs of society.<br />
This is the way of the Self-appointed Bastards who rule our lives.<br />
The true free thinker cast as a danger to the narrow minds of corrupted men.<br />
The remnant leaders of our time is still bastardising a living history.<br />
The catapult, the axe and the torch are tools for an old destruction.<br />
The image, the sound and the pen are all we have left to begin a revolution.</p>
