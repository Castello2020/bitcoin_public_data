Marauder Webbing

25 Comments ↓ First – the caveats: I’m only using this as a CFAV, my boss gave/issued me this webbing, my last experience with webbing was near 20yrs ago, and I’m a self confessed gear whore!
So, on to the webbing. This the Marauder SAS/Para MTP Webbing available from Britkit for £94.95 I’ve no idea what makes it SAS/PAra… that’s their label.
It’s configuration is pre-fitted pouches to a padded belt, with a roll-pin buckle. Available in 2 sizes (below 32″, and above 32″), the smaller size has 2 double ammo pouches (each comfortably taking 3 mags) closed with Velcro and a press stud, 3 water bottle pouches with velcro and a QR buckle, 2 small utility pouches on the side of the front two mag pouches, plus an FFD pouch. Build quality seems really quite good but I’ve not used it that long so we’ll have to see… The good stuff:
It’s very light – surprisingly so. The weight of webbing is easily overlooked as it’s rarely empty but when you get/make up a new set consider how much of your final weight will be the webbing itself.
It’s really quite comfy – I tend to go without the harness/yoke and the padded belt was very comfy on the hips without need for any further padding. The material is similar to that on the current Predator pack
Pouch size – the water bottle pouches are plenty big enough to allow you to get a little extra in, like a meal around your jetboil or water bottle.
The small utility pouches – they’re just the right size for small torch and a leatherman which helps keep them to hand. Although let down by the way the ammo pouch lid obscures them.

Jetboil in waterbottle pouch giving an idea of size
The not so good stuff:
Overall capacity – because the pouches are stitched on, they’re not that close together meaning that with a waist size of 32″ you can only have 3 water bottle pouches. In the pic you can see that they still have room to allow the belt to open flat. On my old ’58 water bottle pouch set up, there was no way it was laying flat. But maybe you don’t need more than 3 pouches or you’re fat and can have 4 pouches FFD pouch – no good for the current dressing
Belt – it’s two piece, stitched to the padding (rather than one piece all the way through the padding), meaning that the padding is taking the load, not the belt. You can see on my set that it’s already deforming after only a few days use… doesn’t look good for the long run. And as the pad is slightly stretchy, it also makes it harder to get a secure fit.
Pad length – it could be I’m just a skinny runt, but the pad definitely comes around to the front, particularly the side with the FFD pouch. It feels like it could start to rub to the top of your thighs on longer tabs. I feel like even if I was 36″ waist, I would still go with the smaller size to help with this.

Overall, I give it 3 out of 5 stars – some nice ideas that are just not quite thought through enough. For me, as someone who prefers not wearing the yoke – the belt issue has me thinking I might buy my own.
Happy to post more pics and to try to answer questions for anyone who’s considering buying it.

Reply Wally666 says: March 27, 2012 at 9:51 pm Think webbing is starting to become more of a thing of the past. Very much doubt there will be many deployments where we wouldn’t be wearing armour. A Molle belt where you can alter your pouches makes more sense. Nothing wrong with your review though.
Reply BuggerAll says: March 28, 2012 at 10:48 am I’ve had a ‘hippo pad’ since the mid-80′s and can remember the joys of pouch burns from 58. Whilst I note what you say about lightness there are a couple of things that would put me off a made uop belt kit and I wonder if you could comment on them.
Firstly I always thought that the solution to the pouch burn was the ability for the pouch to rub on the pad rather than on you like a sock liner. I’d be concerned that the pad would end up rubbing you away.
Secondly for those of us who are not flat I’d be concerned that the pad might not flex enough to be tight enough on the waist and on the thighs.
Lastly the issue already mentioned of a lack of flexibility.
Reply Mav says: March 28, 2012 at 2:42 pm Good questions BA…
As to the pouch/pad rubbing – I’ve only got 15 or so miles on my set and have had no issues so far… In terms of how it’s supposed to work, I think it’s to stop the hard edges of things in your pouches, like mags, and also to help with the fact that pouches move around creating increased chafing. To that extent, I think this pre-made up webbing does the same job as using a hippo pad.
To your second question – this is a key concern for me too. As the padding is the belt, it takes the load. My set still has some give in it so I found myself having to tighten fairly regularly – not something I remember on my old kit that also used a roll pin buckle. It’s possible that it’s just new and has some give in it still… If were someone who was gonna use a four pouch unit, loaded with 2 water bottles, and regularly carried a full complement of mags, I’m not sure I would be confident that the belt would secure the webbing. Being a skinny CFAV, I only have the three pouches and will likely never need to carry 12 mags!
Finally: flexibility – I’ve thought about this too… but in all honesty, if you’ve got your set up just right, how likely are you to change it? And from memory, once I got my old kit set up how I wanted it, I made damn sure it wasn’t coming undone… which also made it a bugger to change it! So in terms of flexibility, if you know what you want your set up to be and this matches, then I would say no loss…
Hope that makes sense!
Reply Mothman says: April 1, 2012 at 12:46 pm I’m glad I’ve got a complete OG set of 95 with a privately purchased hippo pad to wear when we go PCS is September (Yes, I’m a CFAV)
I’ll buy a PALS belt & yoke and individual pouches gradually before I switch.
Reply Captain_Kirk says: April 3, 2012 at 9:58 pm Mav – excellent review – thank you for taking the time to write such a comprehensive and practical assessment. Anyone who has carried/run with gear knows how important it is to get this right – to be fair, I don’t do a great deal of that anymore (well, at all really) but having suffered enough in the past I am still drawn to read about good quality gear! As I said, a very thorough and informative article, with detailed pics – thanks. Personally, I still have 2 sets of 95 made up in the garage – one for speed and one for load – and although they are useless with CBA they do offer flexibility of configuration. ATB
Reply unicycle says: April 3, 2012 at 10:46 pm Its a good review. I was never sure about stiched webbing, im a skinny git like you and when i first joined i had issues carrying everything. I just learnt to carry less shit around with me. As for the new stuff, flexabilty may well be the way forward. You might be carrying a minimi tomorow, with molle webbing you can just whip off the ammo pouchs and put on a link pouch. Just one example but im sure there are others. I got me some multi-cam molle webbing for when we get shiney new kit. I thought about stiched webbing, although you like yours you have convinced me i did the right thing.
Reply ugly says: April 6, 2012 at 3:26 pm I am now fatter than a RA Bdr and not getting any slimmer but thankfully padding seems to be acceptable nowadays!
Reply Travelgall says: September 20, 2012 at 11:12 am Molle webbing is the way forward. Switch out loads for the role required in the comfort of your FOB before going on the ground. Stitched webbing is fine if you’re doing a CFT, but for little else. It doesn’t even have the flexibility of PLCE attachments which are a 1970′s answer to load carrying. It still inexplicably issued because the MoD thinks squaddies are too fecking stupid to work out what they do and do not need to carry. Yet as soon as they land in Afghanistan they suddenly gain the knowledge necessary to use MOLLE.
Reply really?_fascinating says: September 21, 2012 at 10:01 am I’ve always found that when arriving in a location it is best practice for everyone to throw all their pouches in a pile and then do a lucky dip prior to the next task. This keeps things interesting and makes for some highly amusing anecdotes when, all of a sudden, the team medic is called forwards and finds his pouches full of dog biscuits. Meanwhile the ato is forced to try and neutralise a device using the contents of the padre’s kit and is reduced to offering the bomb a Werther’s and a chat about the football.
Reply Boxy says: September 21, 2012 at 2:33 pm Is that why there is a molle belt in the black bag now?
Reply ugly says: September 25, 2012 at 5:13 pm Do you really believe the grown ups hang onto PLCE because we arent to be trusted or could it be that as Osprey isnt general Issue and is Theatre specific it isnt absoluttely necessary yet to issue everyone Molle and as it happens by the time PLCE will need replacing (not long in its life now and I was involved in its trials twice in the 1980′s) just about the whole of the much reduced army will have enough Molle to keep 101st Airsoft brigade supplied as well as our much reduced armed forces.
I would expect that the plan to remove PLCE from the system will come when enough molle is in circulation to ensure the training units get it and also that the army is fully used to using molle. It could be that as there is no massive need for matching load carrying kit (colour wise) then there is no real plan to phase in PLCE in MTP! Otherwise watch the news from gearspotter etc.
Reply Travelgall says: September 25, 2012 at 5:27 pm Hi Ugly. I just don’t understand why they bothered making PLCE in MTP then. I’ve already seen the stuff so unless that’s a UOR or stopgap too (Gearspotter?) then they plan on issuing this PLCE Army wide. They could buy off the shelf Molle Webbing belts and issue them instead with the MOLLE pouches and a yoke. I would argue that Molle is absolutely necessary (rather than a UOR) as it is the only load carrying equipment that is compatible with the issue CBA, not to mention having commonality with many of our NATO allies. It should be general issue rather than just theater issue. The bit about PLCE being issued because they don’t trust NIG’s not to MOLLE strap the kitchen sink to themselves I’ve heard from more than one source. And the MOD has previous on this with the old Rip Stop DPM smock that was yanked from issue due to Crows not wearing warm kit underneath it. I’ll stand corrected with you if you or Gearspotter say that’s not the reason re the MOLLE.
Reply ugly says: September 25, 2012 at 5:56 pm I hadnt heard that PLCE was issued in MTP, I thought it was all multicam knock offs and not IRR. Interested if it is being issued but as stated the molle was uor for osprey which doesnt mean its the dogs danglies for everything it just means we found a way to make stuff work short term to solve an urgent problem. If the stuff makes it into general service then no doubt we will hear soon enough.

Stand corrected then! Ugly is largely correct. The reason that there has been no switch to a Molle PLCE type system is that a new system – VIRTUS – is just around the corner (well, as long as that corner is 2 years away!). Therefore there is no reason to change to a Molle system as inevitably there would be a massive rush from units demanding the new kit which would then be promptly replaced again. The MTP PLCE kit you are seeing is just a change of colour which is easy and will just be on replacement of worn out kit. It’s not regarded as a big concern. Introducing the Molle belt into the Black Bag is the right thing to do. It gives guys on ops the choice they need. I’m sure that’ll raise more questions so feel free to ask.
As for the smock – total b*llocks and usual Army rumour control! Simply put, the ripstop one was crap! Not robust enough, too expensive etc. Better versions (the pre-PCS version) for less price available. Recruits insulating themselves or not didn’t enter into it.

Reply The_Duke says: September 25, 2012 at 6:00 pm Wow – “arrse poster citing utter bollocks based on shithouse rumour silenced by someone who knows what they are talking about” shocker!
Reply Travelgall says: September 25, 2012 at 6:25 pm Gearspotter. Questions then. Is this Virtus system compatible with our NATO allies? Does it work with Osprey?
Reply ugly says: September 25, 2012 at 6:27 pm Why should it be compatible with nato? Just our own stuff would make a fucking change!
Reply ugly says: September 25, 2012 at 7:37 pm [QUOTE=Travelgall;4638495]Mate I’m more than happy to admit I’m not an MOD procurement individual or when I’m wrong. But unlike Cutaway doing his internet hard man I’m willing to read and listen. Gearspotter, I disagree with you on that. The Ripstop one is light and perfect for the Field in Summer and MATT 2/CFT’s. It needs warm kit in winter though. And mine lasted for god knows how many years and I would still be wearing it were it not for the MTP change over. The Later DPM ones were too heavy IMHO and got relegated to the loft, although the new Tantalus style MTP smock with venting zips and mesh has finally rectified this problem. Anyhow, back on topic. I still stand behind my stitched webbing is a waste of money meme.[/QUOTE]
Gearspotter gave you the DS solution, you don’t have to agree and oddly enough those who made the decision may not be bothered esp as its history now! You should have seen the shit kit they fobbed us off with post falklands! As for wasting money on stitched webbing don’t!

VIRTUS will be a complete system of body armour, helmet and load carriage – webbing, day sack and bergan – so it will integrate with itself. Integrating with Osprey won’t be a problem. Fair point on the smock – everyone’s different so understandable there are different opinions. The majority view from the trials was that there were concerns with it. Glad you like the new one though.
Reply Subatomic says: September 26, 2012 at 10:56 am This VIRTUS, are there any sources of info out there on the web? Will it be compatible with molle pouches or will those have to be ditched?
Reply Cutaway says: November 3, 2012 at 7:37 pm Reply h301593 says: December 3, 2012 at 12:00 am Nicely played.
Reply Signallers says: January 26, 2013 at 11:09 pm It’s fixed, better when you could adapt it, though this mollie system makes it alot easier.
