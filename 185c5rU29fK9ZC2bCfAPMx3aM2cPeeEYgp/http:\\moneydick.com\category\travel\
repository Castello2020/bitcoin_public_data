<p>So I met a Meaghan in Bordeaux when I was staying with a girl I met through globalfreeloaders.com and she was like yo you should come to Grenoble because there&#8217;s haunted houses and alpine resorts and craggy climbing peaks every place your eyeball goes&#8230; so I says ya that sounds like a peachy keen idea and I&#8217;ll let you know and now that&#8217;s my next destination after the place I&#8217;m currently in which may or may not be Lisbon, Portugal where they&#8217;re not quite Spain (wishing they were Brazilian) but very colorful and happy and fun without all the snootyness of some Spaniards I met.</p>
<p>Without writing too many more periods, I will be hitting Strasbourg February 5th after Grenoble&#8217;s coldness to partake in goodness unparalleled by any soul.<br />
I have uploaded so many good pictures that I nearly blew up the Internet, so check them out before it burns to the ground. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/moneydick">CLICK HERE FOR TELEPORTATION TO LISBON</a>.<br />
The Portuguese scene is my favorite so far. Maybe I just like the fact that there&#8217;s no personal space and I can share pockets and food with strangers, but there&#8217;s also a familiarity to Lisbon, mainly the fact that it&#8217;s become a replica of San Francisco in many areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>There&#8217;s a perfect copy of the golden gate bridge constructed by the same architects.</li>
<li>Trolly cars get people up and down the steep places, and many highly angled streets have steps.</li>
<li>The steep hills look out towards the water (and sometimes look out towards the Golden Gate bridge), like many areas in the San Fran bay</li>
<li>The art scene is off the hook.</li>

<p>For the past four days I&#8217;ve been staying in a Danish paradise. I&#8217;ve had just over a dozen different living situations on this trip but these last few days at a &#8216;Folk&#8217;s School&#8217; have been miles beyond any previously conceived notions of decadent living. Massive thrice-daily platters of saucy salmon, ranks of corned beef, and fresh loaves of bread the size of cats&#8211;all to the tune of the gorble dwop of Danish youngin&#8217;s.</p>
<p>This sizable commmune means to me much more than just free lodging, free food, great company, music movies and internet, a hopping off point for Hiller??d and Copenhagen, and a loft to sleep in; this place is like an engineered northern outpost prepared for my enjoyment. For the Danish who live there, it&#8217;s essentially a place for them to hang out with other 18-20 year olds for a short time after they have finished their Danish high school equivalent education. Most don&#8217;t stay for more than 3 months as it is primarily a short break&#8211;a short stay just prior to entrance to a University. For the Americans reading this, consider it this way: You&#8217;ve graduated high school. Instead of taking a summer class at your local community college before shipping off to yonder Ivory Tower, you decide to enroll in one of those Folk&#8217;s Schools where you&#8217;ll be surrounded by your best friends for a whirlwind journey through post adolescent adventures in responsibility.</p>
<p>There are approximately 30 Danes here, but I was lucky enough to gain entrance to this glory town as the guest of a certain illustrious expatriate named Dan Dickson. Because the Kopenhavn-based school that Dan and six other American students attend through their Junior Year Abroad programs ran out of housing, they were given a place in the folk&#8217;s school, known in Danish as H??jskole. Even though they have a long commute to their school, I believe they are among the luckiest people in the world.</p>
<p>Before I knew too much about this place it seemed a lot like a summer camp. Walking around the grounds and the building complex, I was surprised to find a full photo lab, a ceramics and glass workshop, a decked out computer room (where I am now), a tv room, party room, gym, and music performance equipment for evening time fun. After hearing more about this place, I&#8217;ve found that these amenities are for the continued education of the Danes who are enrolled here. Each student who stays here takes an assortment of classes and participates in activities to add points to their educational record in Denmark. This allows them to begin their University education at a certain point.</p>
<p>From these pictures down the right side you can get a feel for the place. Also check out the Copenhagen <a href="http://moneydick.com/europepics">folders here</a> for an insane amount of pictures. On Thursday, my first night, we had a Danish John Mayer type come and sing. He had a strange way of sticking his tongue out when he really got into his tunes that would make us kinda scared. Friday night we had a Jazz Band tear up the dining room. Saturday night was the yearly reunion party complete with Alumni visitors, the board of directors, and a <a href="http://moneydick.com/europepics/index.php?Qwd=./copenhagen4/DCIM/100MSDCF&amp;Qif=DSC01511.JPG&amp;Qiv=name&amp;Qis=M">Prince Cover band</a>. Last night was the equivalent Christmas Celebration for the Folk&#8217;s School. Roast Beef, Potatoes, Rice Pudding with Jelly Sauce, and fresh Mountain Water with sparkling diamonds. I feel that I need to capitalize the names of foods because they were so extraordinary.</p>
<p>After that meal the already loud gym filled with Danes and noisy Americans soon erupted into song&#8230;. The first video is song book fun in Danish (something the American kids were struggling with) But the next video is a rendition of &#8216;California Dreaming&#8217; by two Yanks, a Polack, and a legit Dane. Try to see which is which! But You&#8217;ll have to click for  <a href="http://moneydick.com/2005/12/02/grundtvigs-h%c3%b8jskole-the-danish-commune/#more-142" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>
