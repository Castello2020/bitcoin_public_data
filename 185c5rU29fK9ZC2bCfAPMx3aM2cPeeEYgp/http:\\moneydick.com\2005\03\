              <p>Sometimes I feel like I go to a rockalicious <a href="http://www.vassar.edu" target="blank">school.</a> Friends of friends in the east tend to visit this place for their Spring break like birds fly south for the winter. The size of the campus doubles, the cafeteria is always packed, and my once close-knit community is shattered by a strange thing: new faces wearing their college sweatshirts (not on their faces). It makes me wonder what a huge state school would be like. Everyone must be so strangerly to one another when there’s thousands and thousands of schoolies. It sure makes me love this place. Cheers.<br />
<a href="http://moneydick.com/images/foundersday2004/pictures/slides/DSC02431.html" target="blank"><img src="http://moneydick.com/images/foundersday2004/pictures/thumbs/DSC02431.JPG" alt="jonah and liza" align="right" /></a>On the same tone of enjoyable spring-time fun, I’d like to personally pleasure the internet, but more importantly, the Freshman of Vassar College with a taste of Founders Day. Last year Moneydick Productions had a great public relations extravaganza with high quality t-shirts and stylish beautiousness on a fine Mayday known as Founder’s Day. I offered some meticulously hand-crafted t-shirts for sale, and surprisingly they sold out. If you’re wondering, I will be selling shirts once again, so stay tuned. The design will look something like <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/moneydick">this</a> (the first one). To relive the gloriousness and spark some wide-eyed anticipation for those who missed it (Crew, Freshman), and to taunt those who will miss it again this year, here’s a <a href="http://moneydick.com/images/foundersday2004/pictures/index.html" target="blank">photo album</a> from last year, May 5th, 2004. <a href="http://moneydick.com/2005/03/31/spring-break-headquarters-poughkeepsie-ny-2/#more-30" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

              <p>Redesigning this site has given me some ideas about what exactly the site should be for. I&#8217;ve discovered what it shouldn&#8217;t be for. I promise it will never be a random musings of Daniel Morgan website. <strong>It will be a haven for the mysterious and magical, humorous and vibrant, strange and stupid. </strong>  I&#8217;m going to beef up my awesome radar, and find some goodies worth sharing with my <a href="http://moneydick.com/webstat/usage_200503.html#TOPCTRYS">diverse</a> readership.<br />
So this is the new layout. It&#8217;s a little dark, a little light, and I still see some problems. <em>Be a kind visitor and let me know how I can improve this layout. </em> Just leave a comment below.<br />

Skype. It’s new, and it’s hot. It lets you make free calls to anyone who has the Skype software. Your eery voice travels across the interweb, and freaks the hell out of anyone who works for a telecommunications company.<br />
Freaking the hell outta the telecommunications industry is not what I’m about. I’m about <strong>free calls</strong>. That’s good stuff.<br />
Here’s what the chairman of the Federal Communications Commision had to say about the whole mess:<br />
<em>‚ÄúI knew it was over when I downloaded Skype…when the inventors of KaZaA are distributing for free a little program that you can use to talk to anybody else, and the quality is fantastic, and it‚Äôs free ‚Äì it‚Äôs over. The world will change now inevitably.‚Äù</em><br />
Fortune Magazine, February 16, 2004</p>
<p>Here’s a great <a href="http://addict3d.org/index.php?page=viewarticle&amp;type=news&amp;ID=4000">article</a> for more information on Skype, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voip">explanation</a> of the technology that allows voice over the internet.</p>

If you ever watched full house, check out this dramatic realization of the man known as Bob Saget. There’s but a few short video clips, but I hope it will break the mental picture you have of him. BREAK IT TO PIECES!!<br />
Lyrics!</p>
<blockquote><p>“…he’s fucked up. sometimes the show wasn’t that funny, fuck you, made lots of money. But I gave half to my ex-wife anyway. Woulda been cheaper if I had been gay. Tell me why some people call me faggot. Tell me why, maybe because my last name’s Saget. I changed it it used to be Somosexual. Tell me why, I sucked dick for coke, but that’s ok. Danny Tanner was not gay. Danny tanner was not gay… like Dave Coulier.”</p></blockquote>
<p class="ArticleText">So Bob Saget stopped by Vassar last night. We were<br />
warned by hearsay of his raunchy tactics, but what we got from him was far<br />
beyond our wildest dreams. It was purely awesome. There is unimaginable<br />
value for Bob Saget as a comedian, and negligible value for him as a line-reader.<br />
Here&#8217;s some assorted photos of Bob, and you&#8217;ll find videos at the bottom.</p>
<p class="ArticleText">He mentioned being ridiculed on South Park, putting<br />
his dick on Michelle&#8217;s head, and told us about the baby stroller he got<br />
for his last 15 year old girlfriend. STICHES we were in. Can&#8217;t even tell<br />
you. We would have found this material awesome from any random comedian<br />
off the streets of Los Angeles, but Bob Saget, when he knelt down and told<br />
Michelle (from Full House) to treat people with &#8220;kindness and respect<br />
and&#8230;wait a second take this {reaches to unzip his fly} let me just put<br />
this on your head. *plop* Wait. Where are you going! Where&#8217;s comet?&#8221;<br />
There are no words to explain. We ate him up.</p>
<p class="ArticleText"><a href="../images/saget/saget1.avi">VIDEO1</a> (here<br />
he sings a song where he asks the world why they think DannyTanner was gay.</p>
