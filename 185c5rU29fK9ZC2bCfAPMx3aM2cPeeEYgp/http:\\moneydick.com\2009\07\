<p>Pictured above: Oprah, and Henry Louis Gates. Guess which one was arrested after trying to enter his own house?</p>
<p><em>Episode 4</em>: &#8220;Who left the Irony on?&#8221; starts like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>BOSTON – Police responding to a call about &#8220;two black males&#8221; breaking into a home near Harvard University ended up arresting the man who lives there — Henry Louis Gates Jr., the nation&#8217;s pre-eminent black scholar</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Ogletree [Gates' lawyer] said Gates gave the officer his driver&#8217;s license and Harvard identification after being asked to prove he was a Harvard professor and lived at the home, but became upset when the officer continued to question him.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was shocked to find himself being questioned and shocked that the conversation continued after he showed his identification,&#8221; Ogletree said.<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090720/ap_on_re_us/us_harvard_scholar_disorderly"> via</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Now may be a great time to quote from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Louis_Gates,_Jr.#Honors_and_awards">Awards section of Henry Louis Gates&#8217; Wikipedia article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gates has been the recipient of nearly 50 honorary degrees and numerous academic and social action awards. He was named a MacArthur Fellow in 1981 and was listed in Time among its “25 Most Influential Americans” in 1997. On October 23, 2006, Gates was appointed the Alphonse Fletcher Jr. University Professor at Harvard University. In January 2008, he co-founded The Root, a website dedicated to African-American perspectives published by The Washington Post Company. Gates currently chairs the Fletcher Foundation, and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He is on the boards of many notable institutions including the New York Public Library, Jazz at Lincoln Center, the Aspen Institute, the Brookings Institution, the Studio Museum of Harlem, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, HEAF (the Harlem Educational Activities Fund), and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, located in Stanford, California.[2]</p></blockquote>

On the surface, the revolution of 79 and now the &#8216;Green Revolution&#8217; are governance-based uprisings. Look a little deeper, and we see previously veiled women removing their veils for the first time, older women taking an active role in marches, and women gathering in coffee shops, bars, and public spaces to discuss politics where normally only men would gather. Below are some snippets and suggested reading from recent articles I&#8217;ve encountered dealing with Iranian sexuality:</p>
<blockquote><p>On one side, is an all-male cabal of gun-totting, club-wielding men — the Army, the Revolutionary Guard and the volunteer militia — supported by the pantheon of the highest government offices in the land — the Supreme Leadership, the Presidency, and membership in the Guardian Council — all monopolized by men.</p>
<p>&#8230;On the other side, is a sea of lawfully demonstrating men and women marching side by side and shoulder to shoulder. Holding hands, green in color, hopeful in outlook, vibrant and non-violent, they fight bullets and batons with open hands and support Mir Hossein Moussavi, who is often accompanied by his wife, Zahra Rahnavard.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>A synonym for the word “woman” in the Persian language is <em>Pardeh Neshin</em>: “She who sits behind the curtain / the veil / the screen.”  The expression perpetuates, even linguistically, the cultural ideal of woman’s absence in public. Pardeh Neshin implies enclosure, invisibility, and controlled mobility, all associations that are inseparable from conventional definitions of femininity in Iran.</p></blockquote>

<p>The regime&#8217;s failure to allow women into public life has made transexuality in Iran a unique window through which one can observe the hypocrisy of gender. In the documentary film <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Like_Others">Be Like Others</a></em> by <a title="Tanaz Eshaghian" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanaz_Eshaghian">Tanaz Eshaghian</a>, we learn the surprising social politics of transexuality in Iran in this <a href="http://www.dfgdocs.com/Resources/Articles/102.aspx">interview</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>What do you remember from the preliminary phone conversations with these people before you went to Iran?</strong><br />
Cleric Kariminiya, who had written his “PhD”—the Islamic version of a PhD that a cleric gets—on applying Islamic law and thinking to transsexual identity, really gave me a sense of another world. He was fantastic. He had also explored such topics as what happens to the inheritance of a male that becomes a female (Under Islam a woman gets half of what a man gets for inheritance). He let me know that because of a sex change, <strong>the person is now female—and gets half!</strong></p></blockquote>
