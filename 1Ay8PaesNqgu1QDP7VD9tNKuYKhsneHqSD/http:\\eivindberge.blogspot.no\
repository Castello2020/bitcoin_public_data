<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6cEdhSWOOmjMzZ6Ry1wQlBRb3c/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Elliot Rodger's manifesto</a> is absolutely amazing. It reads like an expertly crafted and professionally edited novel. In fact, it is so well written that it almost makes me suspect the whole thing is a hoax. It is hard to believe that a sophomore from a community college who keeps dropping his classes can produce such a captivating and immaculate book. With the director father and all, could this be something other than it seems? Some sort of viral marketing campaign, perhaps? Propaganda against the NRA? But no, with all this deadly serious news coverage, I guess we have to conclude it is real.<br /><br />This isn't insanity, either. Rodger is mentally stable throughout his life, but virginity naturally becomes increasingly frustrating as time goes by. He has poor social skills, which despite counseling will never improve, but he's not schizophrenic and does not slip into psychosis or anything like that. At worst he might be a high-functioning autistic, but even that is unclear. Maybe he is just suffering from social anxiety. The most insane part of the book is when he thinks he will win the lottery and dabbles in the law of attraction, but he gets over that and there are no magical beliefs guiding him on his way to revenge. He is rational and calculating and meticulous, even planning his suicide well in order to avoid capture and imprisonment (use two handguns with a spare in case one jams). There is absolutely no doubt that the rampage is caused by sexual deprivation, and up until the end he holds out some hope that he will get laid after all and cancel the whole retribution thing. As long as he can't have sex, he is determined to destroy some of the happy sexually active people around him. Girls who pick other men and the lucky men who get laid are targeted equally, and he even plans to kill his housemates and brother and step-mother.<br /><br />You either have to experience celibacy yourself or read this manifesto to comprehend how dangerous this sort of man is. While reading, I was struck with the realization that he is at least as smart as you, and he is going to use that intelligence to kill you. This means he has a good chance of succeeding, which he did. There is no "treatment" for this condition (besides getting sex), because the incel is just as smart as the psychiatrists or cops or whoever tries to intervene, and so he will anticipate their moves and thwart them. The close shave with the cops when they almost search his room is chilling, but here he demonstrates that he is indeed sane and from then on he sleeps with a loaded gun nearby to ensure he will get in at least some kills if they come back.<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
The monster virgin is a true product of our sex-hostile feminist society, which denies that involuntary celibacy can ever be a problem and is more concerned with constructing the bizarre lie that women can be rapists than acknowledging the basic needs of men. You reap as you sow.</div>

Last year in Norway, the ruling leftist coalition lost the election and their government was replaced by a coalition of so-called right-wing parties. I didn't vote for them, or at all, because I knew they would merely replace socialism with fascism. In past elections I always voted for the Progress Party (Frp) in the belief that they would be a lesser evil, but now I understand there is no such thing. Their authoritarian, police-loving, man-hating views simply cannot be excused even if their economic policy is slightly less oppressive, and now the results of their hateful ideology are starting to manifest themselves. While the new government did decrease the income tax by one percentage point and repealed the death tax, on men's rights they are in fact worse than the old socialists.<br />
<br />
The scumbags in the Norwegian legislature, fully supported by the new government, have <a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/Historisk-vedtak-om-a-fjerne-foreldelse-for-alvorlige-forbrytelser-7526087.html" target="_blank">abolished the statute of limitations on sex crimes</a>, even victimless sex crimes like consensual sex with young teenagers, setting the stage for witch-hunts on old men just like the Savile hysteria in Britain. They didn't yet make it retroactive, so it will take a while for this to bear fruit, but it certainly proves that the Progress Party consists of even more odious feminist scumbags than the Labor Party, and I hate their guts equally profoundly. If anything, minister of justice Anders Anundsen from the Progress Party is a more despicable person than any of his predecessors.<br />
<br />
And they are working on <a href="http://www.dagbladet.no/2014/04/25/nyheter/politikk/seksualforbrytelser/32968866/" target="_blank">expanding the definition of rape</a>&nbsp;once more,&nbsp;inheriting the <a href="http://eivindberge.blogspot.no/2013/02/another-round-of-feminist-rape-law.html" target="_blank">proposed changes</a> I blogged about earlier from the previous administration.<br />
<br />
Thus the march of misandry continues, regardless of which party is voted into power. All political parties in Norway, without exception, represent hatred against men. None of them deserve our vote, and all of them deserve our utmost contempt.<br />
<br />
So much for partisan politics, but there is one voice of reason amid all the misandry. Synnøve Brattlie is a psychiatrist making surprisingly <a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/Mener-voldtekter-ma-graderes-7544293.html" target="_blank">lucid statements about rape law</a>.&nbsp;She points out that women are not served well by a dishonestly expansive definition of rape with escalating punishments. She believes that when every woman who has her regrets after sex is defined as a rape victim and the hateful machinery of the state is maximally supportive in having the man convicted and locked up for many years even though the woman shares equal blame for the sexual encounter, then this may do more harm than good to women. Or to honest women, at any rate. In her clinical experience, the dishonest and hateful nature of rape investigations and trials on the part of the feminist state also messes with women's psychology, because the entire point of the proceedings is to perpetuate a lie. In the current system, there is no such thing as bad or regretted sex, or men simply acting like jerks -- everything is rape if the woman has any negative feelings about it whatsoever,  so women are not allowed to be honest about their sexual experiences. This realization is progress and very similar to what I have been saying for ten years now, except as usual in public discourse, only the woman's point of view is taken into account. We have now reached the point where in the opinion of at least one psychiatrist, rape law is hurting women because it is too expansive and draconian, so feminist rape law reforms should be reversed to help women. I doubt our hateful legislators will listen to this point of view either, however.

The bizarre behavior exhibited by the manginas in the Men's Human Rights Movement (MHRM), found at <a href="http://www.avoiceformen.com/" target="_blank">A Voice for Men</a> (AVfM), whereby they embrace the most absurd and hateful feminist ideals regarding sex, and even more bizarrely, apply these standards to women as well, is puzzling in the extreme. After thinking long and hard about what might possess these nincompoops to behave in such a deranged manner, and rereading the Unabomber Manifesto, I think I have figured it out. I thought for a long time that they must be some kinds of autistic freaks or something like that, but the explanation may be found in the far more pervasive concept of oversocialization. The buffoons at AVfM fancy themselves as rebels against feminism, but of course they are nothing of the sort. They are feminists of the more extreme kind. I hate feminists, but most of them have the decency to at least back off the most absurd manifestations of their odious worldview in practice -- for example if you were to apply their sex-hostility literally to women as well as men. The buffoons in the MHRM have no such barriers. They are loose cannons among radical feminist, who will cling desperately to feminist tenets no matter how absurd it gets in the real world.<br />
<br />
Here is yet another example of their idiocy: <a href="http://www.avoiceformen.com/misandry/boys-raped-more-often-than-girls/" target="_blank">Boys raped more often than girls</a>.<br />
<br />
Any person just a few short decades ago would laugh his ass off if you told him women can "rape" boys. An honest biologist would still laugh his ass off at such an imbecile notion, as would any halfway rational or commonsensical person. Biologists know perfectly well that because the sexual superiority of women is the prime fact of life for deep evolutionary reasons, women committing "rape" or "sexual abuse" is not a meaningful natural concept but a legal fiction you have to be oversocialized to take seriously. But the manginas in the MHRM do take it seriously, because they have been oversocialized into feminist ideology.<br />
<br />
Ted Kaczynski explains how it works in his <a href="http://cyber.eserver.org/unabom.txt" target="_blank">Manifesto</a>:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. The two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; call "feelings of inferiority" and "oversocialization." Feelings of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole, while<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; oversocialization is characteristic only of a certain segment of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; modern leftism; but this segment is highly influential.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; [...]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 24. Psychologists use the term "socialization" to designate the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; process by which children are trained to think and act as society<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; demands. A person is said to be well socialized if he believes in and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; obeys the moral code of his society and fits in well as a functioning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; part of that society. It may seem senseless to say that many leftists<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; are over-socialized, since the leftist is perceived as a rebel.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, the position can be defended. Many leftists are not such<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; rebels as they seem.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 25. The moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; think, feel and act in a completely moral way. For example, we are not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; supposed to hate anyone, yet almost everyone hates somebody at some<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; time or other, whether he admits it to himself or not. Some people are<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; so highly socialized that the attempt to think, feel and act morally<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; imposes a severe burden on them. In order to avoid feelings of guilt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; they continually have to deceive themselves about their own motives<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; and find moral explanations for feelings and actions that in reality<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; have a non-moral origin. We use the term "oversocialized" to describe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; such people. [2]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 26. Oversocialization can lead to low self-esteem, a sense of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; powerlessness, defeatism, guilt, etc. One of the most important means<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; by which our society socializes children is by making them feel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ashamed of behavior or speech that is contrary to society's<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; expectations. If this is overdone, or if a particular child is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; especially susceptible to such feelings, he ends by feeling ashamed of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; HIMSELF. Moreover the thought and the behavior of the oversocialized<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; person are more restricted by society's expectations than are those of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; the lightly socialized person. The majority of people engage in a<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; significant amount of naughty behavior. They lie, they commit petty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; thefts, they break traffic laws, they goof off at work, they hate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; someone, they say spiteful things or they use some underhanded trick<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; to get ahead of the other guy. The oversocialized person cannot do<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; these things, or if he does do them he generates in himself a sense of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; shame and self-hatred. The oversocialized person cannot even<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; experience, without guilt, thoughts or feelings that are contrary to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; the accepted morality; he cannot think "unclean" thoughts. And<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; socialization is not just a matter of morality; we are socialized to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; confirm to many norms of behavior that do not fall under the heading<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; of morality. Thus the oversocialized person is kept on a psychological<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; leash and spends his life running on rails that society has laid down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; for him. In many oversocialized people this results in a sense of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; constraint and powerlessness that can be a severe hardship. We suggest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; that oversocialization is among the more serious cruelties that human<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; beings inflict on one another.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 27. We argue that a very important and influential segment of the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; modern left is oversocialized and that their oversocialization is of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; great importance in determining the direction of modern leftism.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Leftists of the oversocialized type tend to be intellectuals or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; members of the upper-middle class. Notice that university<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; intellectuals (3) constitute the most highly socialized segment of our<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; society and also the most left-wing segment.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 28. The leftist of the oversocialized type tries to get off his<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; psychological leash and assert his autonomy by rebelling. But usually<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; he is not strong enough to rebel against the most basic values of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; society. Generally speaking, the goals of today's leftists are NOT in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; conflict with the accepted morality. On the contrary, the left takes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; an accepted moral principle, adopts it as its own, and then accuses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; mainstream society of violating that principle. Examples: racial<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; equality, equality of the sexes, helping poor people, peace as opposed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; to war, nonviolence generally, freedom of expression, kindness to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; animals. More fundamentally, the duty of the individual to serve<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; society and the duty of society to take care of the individual. All<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; these have been deeply rooted values of our society (or at least of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; its middle and upper classes (4) for a long time. These values are<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; explicitly or implicitly expressed or presupposed in most of the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; material presented to us by the mainstream communications media and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; the educational system. Leftists, especially those of the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; oversocialized type, usually do not rebel against these principles but<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; justify their hostility to society by claiming (with some degree of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; truth) that society is not living up to these principles.<br />
<br />
Thus the manginas at AVfM attempt to oversocialize their natural attraction to teenage girls away (whatever age of consent local feminist legislators decree, the manginas will unquestioningly accept and internalize in the most servile fashion), since their feminist ideology will not permit them to think any "unclean thoughts." This would merely be laughable if these clowns didn't take their bizarre oversocialization one step further and insist that underage boys who get lucky with women are actually <i>victims</i>. And of course they also support all the hateful feminist sex laws and abuse-industry nonsense applied <a href="http://theantifeminist.com/1-in-6-boys-has-been-abused-1-in-4-men-are-paedophiles/" target="_blank">to men</a> and women alike, so they are frankly as pure evil as the scumbags in law enforcement who put feminism into practice, and must be exposed as such. There is simply no nice way to put it; they are feminist scum.<br />
<br />
I suppose the Unabomber has correctly identified this as a leftist phenomenon. A leftist is above all else a conformist. The leftist does not think for himself; he merely absorbs the political correctness of his times, and if these ideals conflict with human nature, then human nature be damned. And in this day and age, the pinnacle of political correctness is the ideology of ubiquitous sexual "abuse" (or usually and increasingly just called "rape" regardless of the details). The more socialized you are, the more you see "rape" or "sexual abuse" everywhere, until "abuse" encapsulates all of human sexuality (and beyond -- as even an image of a baby breastfeeding can qualify). With sufficient oversocialization, it is even possible to insist on the existence of female sexual abusers with a straight face. This is the pathogenesis of the female sex-offender charade, which has caused me so much headache. Never mind that common sense, natural science and experience all tell us it is preposterous to hold women culpable for sex crimes. The oversocialized leftist mangina will insist on his internalized politically correct hogwash even if all his senses and reason as well as science contradict him. Thanks to the Unabomber for identifying the word for it. I know my ranting against the female sex-offender charade for the umpteenth time probably won't sway any of the manginas, but at least now we know what to call the phenomenon that rots their brains.<br />
<br />
The Unabomber is brilliant in some ways, foolish in others.  One way he was wrong was thinking he had to kill people in order to get his message out. With writing skills like his, there is no need for violence, at least not in the Internet age. Rather than wasting away in a supermax prison, he could have had a popular blog now if he had only waited for the rise of the Internet. It is also completely unnecessary to use violence to bring down industrial civilization, since peak oil will take care of that beautifully. Soon there will be no occasion for what the Unabomber derides as "surrogate activities," as any survivors of the imminent Malthusian catastrophe will have no choice but to struggle to stay alive by the sweat of our brows, rather than leisurely sit by as fossil fuel slaves do the work. My attitude now that I am aware of peak oil is that unless you are already incarcerated, then insurrection against the feminist establishment is largely superfluous.<br />
<br />
As I have <a href="http://eivindberge.blogspot.no/2013/01/beware-of-sex-negative-mras.html" target="_blank">said before</a>, the Men's Rights Movement has not grown. There are only 3 sex-positive MRA sites that I know of beside myself: <a href="http://theantifeminist.com/" target="_blank">The Anti-Feminist</a>, <a href="http://human-stupidity.com/" target="_blank">Human Stupidity</a> and <a href="http://angryharry.com/" target="_blank">Angry Harry</a>. The rest is merely feminist oversocialization, although I suppose <a href="http://www.the-spearhead.com/" target="_blank">The Spearhead</a> should get an honorable mention for lately at least somewhat acknowledging the <a href="http://www.the-spearhead.com/2014/01/21/florida-mother-celebrates-teenage-sons-high-school-gay-porn-career/" target="_blank">insanity</a> of feminist sex-hostility as codified in law, as well as the <a href="http://www.the-spearhead.com/2013/10/09/making-men-victims-victimizes-men/" target="_blank">foolishness</a>, if not the biological absurdity, of men trying to assume the role of victims of rape by women (Price has, however, written some embarrassingly naive articles on the female sex-offender charade in the past where he has parroted the feminist narrative in much the same way as AVfM). I have no hope that there will ever be an effective Men's Rights Movement, but we don't need it anyway, because with peak oil comes peak feminism. If the feminists and manginas want to do something enduring for their cause, they might get busy trying to figure out how to keep up mass incarceration in a low-energy world. Rather than dreaming up ways to identify more sex offenders, they ought to be seriously worried about how to even keep the sex offenders they got incarcerated long enough to serve out their sentences. John Michael Greer has got a post up about <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.no/2014/01/seven-sustainable-technologies.html" target="_blank">seven sustainable technologies</a> that may be practiced in our low-energy future, and the industrial prison system is not among them. I don't see how anything like the feminist sex abuse industry can possibly exist without the abundant energy flows provided by fossil fuels. Look back to the prison population in the era before fossil fuels, and you get an idea of how many people a low-energy society is capable of imprisoning. It is no accident that mass incarceration was unheard of before the Industrial Revolution, and for most of history, incarceration wasn't even recognized as a standard punishment. (Slavery did exist, and can in theory arise again if most of the prisoners are coerced into manual agriculture, but there will be insufficient energy available to make the transition to sustainable slavery in our coming dark ages, not least because the feminists don't even realize that time is running out for reorganizing their infrastructure if that were to be accomplished). Since the prison is a cornerstone of feminist society, there is reason to rejoice even as all the things we care about and depend on are about to disintegrate. Technology has been convenient and fun, but we also see what kind of sex-hostile dystopia it leads to, which gets <a href="http://theantifeminist.com/2013-was-bad-2014-will-be-worse/" target="_blank">worse for every passing year</a>. So perhaps peak oil is a good thing even with the extreme hardship and die-off it necessarily entails, because the alternative for men is surely prison unless you put on the charade of an oversocialized mangina.

After reading through this thread,<br />
<br />
<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=412846.80">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=412846.80</a><br />
<br />
I am convinced that Gavin Andresen is an evil man. It is much worse than I thought. He literally wants the Bitcoin Foundation to be an extension of the feminist sex abuse industry. In fact this is even worse than what the feminists are currently doing. He thinks it might be a good idea if the Bitcoin Foundation offered a bounty paid in bitcoin for anyone who can successfully accuse someone of a sex crime against children. This is so sick and absurd, he comes across as a caricature of the kind of dimwitted scumbag who will blindly favor any kind of persecution as long as it is claimed to be "for the children." These are <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=412846.msg4497754#msg4497754" target="_blank">his words</a>: "For example, maybe offering mostly-anonymous bounties to reward anybody who gives information that leads to the arrest and conviction of people abusing children for profit or pleasure is a good idea. Maybe those bounties could be paid in Bitcoin."<br />
<br />
Ok, let me follow his example. I hereby offer a bounty of 1 BTC to anyone who successfully accuses Gavin Andresen of a sex crime. If anyone can put him in prison for at least a decade and on the sex offender registry for life, then I shall send the informer one bitcoin. How do you like to live in a world where any idiot could get paid to make up accusations against you, Gavin? Or perhaps send you some child porn and call the cops? What if others chip in and make the bounty 1000 BTC, do you still only feel warm and fuzzy about "protecting the children" then, Gavin? And what makes you think creating these kinds of perverse incentives is the job of the Bitcoin Foundation?<br />
<br />
We seriously need to support some new developers, because not even the central bankers could come up with this shit...<br />
<br />
Anyone who wants to contribute to the bounty on successfully accusing Gavin Andresen of a sex crime can send BTC to 1Ay8PaesNqgu1QDP7VD9tNKuYKhsneHqSD, and I will hold it for that purpose.<br />
<br />
And just to clarify, I am not trying to incite false accusations here. I am just giving him *exactly* what he asked for...

For all our talk about gender roles, there is little attention paid in the manosphere to the deeper basis for keeping civilization running. Let us not forget that the economy is an energy equation. Whatever else is going on, nothing can work unless the laws of thermodynamics are obeyed. You can do all sorts of funny stuff with enough energy, but without a huge energy surplus, there is very little to do beyond subsistence farming for the vast majority of people, as history indeed attests to. The inescapable need for sufficient energy input is often forgotten in the manosphere, just as it is in almost every other sphere nowadays. Which is also unsurprising if you think about it, since we all grew up in an unprecedented era of extreme energy abundance and never directly felt the harsh economics of natural existence. MRAs often assume that if we only fix marriage and repeal some laws, everything will be all right. But I fear we may run into a greater problem even if all this is accomplished. There is one sphere dedicated to this problem, and they do seem to be onto something. According to the peak oilers, we will soon reach a point where the energy needed to hold the system together that we all rely on is unavailable. After reading sites like the <a href="http://www.theoildrum.com/" target="_blank">Oil Drum</a> and <a href="http://ourfiniteworld.com/" target="_blank">Gail the Actuary</a> for a while, I suspect they may be fundamentally right. And I say this as someone who thought believers in peak oil were all tinfoil-hat lunatics until very recently. If this means I too have gone insane, then please point out in the comments which part of the limits-to-growth argument is flawed, because it sure seems more convincing right now than the cornucopian vision.<br />
<br />
In a word, I have become peak oil aware. I am convinced the world is in a much worse state than the mainstream media is letting on, and it will be all downhill from here. If you watch the news, you get the impression that fracking and shale oil have solved peak oil to the point that the U.S. will soon be an exporter, renewable energy will gradually replace fossil fuels and be almost as good, and of course economic prosperity is always right around the corner. It is also arrogantly assumed that we can easily keep the system running long enough to burn enough fossil fuels to cause significant global warming, which is seen as our most important worry (as if peak oil won't do us in long before climate change possibly can). But if you look more closely into any of these issues, it becomes clear that the official position is catastrophically flawed. Renewables are a joke, with so horrible energy return on energy invested (EROEI) that it's unclear if they can even serve to delay collapse rather than hasten it due to the complexity they add. At best, renewables can work as fossil fuel extenders, but they don't produce enough energy to reproduce themselves. For example, we don't know how to use solar cells to make more solar cells without an oil-based infrastructure. You can't make more hydroelectric plants or maintain the existing ones without oil, either, or wind farms, or any of the proposed alternatives.<br />
<br />
There is simply no practical alternative to burning fossil fuels. In truth, we have no idea how to maintain industrial civilization and keep us all fed any other way. Not with seven billion people (except nuclear, but that won't happen in time for political reasons). For every calorie in our food, ten calories from fossil fuels go into growing and processing it, and this is the only way we know how to do it. There is even no readily available alternative to liquid fuels, and these are absolutely essential to prevent collapse. And even more immediately, there is probably no alternative to our debt-based financial system to keep the wheels turning. As soon as awareness spreads in the system that all the growing debts cannot ever be meaningfully repaid because the necessary wealth will never materialize in a shrinking economy, the whole system comes tumbling down. This is not a physical necessity, but it is a strong likelihood. It is also possible that essential services will keep running until we hit hard physical limits (which admittedly would take decades), perhaps by means of government coercion such as forced labor,  but this is highly uncertain and would in any case be highly unpleasant.<br />
<br />
Collapse could start as early as this week if the U.S. government defaults on its debt, or perhaps they will come up with a way to kick the proverbial can down the road a bit further. In any event, they can't borrow their way out of their problems in a shrinking economy for long, so eventually collapse will catch up with them. Because of globalization, the depression will spread, and so we must return to a world with much less complexity. Because of resource depletion and population overshoot, the future will be ridiculously much worse than any other period in history. The stone age will likely seem like Utopia compared to what awaits us, because back then they were only moderately crowded and still had low-hanging fruit around to mostly subsist (although deforestation was already a problem back in prehistoric times). Whatever technology they had was also realistically suited for their world, while we can't get anything done without computers and oil, none of which will be available in the future.<br />
<br />
When I see the malice perpetrated against men by governments around me, I take solace in the likelihood that they will soon lack the energy to keep it up. There will be plenty of benefits for men as entropy overtakes feminist enforcement of all their hateful sex laws. For one thing, a post-collapse society cannot keep a sex offender registry because all electronic records will disintegrate. There will be no functioning electric grid and no Internet, so all surveillance technology will cease to function. Cops will have no way to check if you are wanted, and said cops won't be paid properly anyway, so they probably won't even stay on the job.<br />
<br />
And governments cannot incarcerate a great number of people in a low-energy world unless they can coerce slave labor out of them to make the EROEI of the prisoners sustainable. This is unlikely because the technology needed to force slaves to work the fields is lacking and cannot be produced at the scale needed. You can't manufacture as much as a shovel without oil, and the machinery currently used will break down, never to be repaired. Contemporary prisoners all have an EROEI much lower than 1 (usually zero), which isn't workable for long. Perhaps slavery was sustainable in previous times when all of society was adapted to that level of existence with the technology and skills to go along with it, but I don't see that happening now. Most likely, collapsing states will be faced with the option of killing off prisoners or setting them free, because resources to employ guards and feed them and the prisoners too will be lacking. This is the silver lining of peak oil from an MRA perspective.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, most of us will starve to death or succumb to disease or wars or exposure as we flee the cities, which will be the biggest death traps of them all. I am hardly a rugged survivalist type myself, so I realize I will probably not be among the 1% or less expected to survive the kind of collapse envisioned. But after recovering from the initial peak oil blues most people experience when they become aware of the predicament, I have come to feel optimistic about the coming collapse. Because I hate the sex-hostility perpetrated by our governments so intensely, I will be happy to witness their downfall even if I have to suffer alongside them. At least I will get to see the terror in the eyes of feminists and manginas when they realize the lights of our civilization are going out for good and it's only brutish barbarism from here on. The moment when the scumbags in law enforcement and our legislatures realize their kids will not grow up because there will be no economy to sustain future generations, and their own pensions are as worthless as Monopoly money, will be priceless to us decent folks. There is nothing we can do to prevent collapse, so it's best not to be too invested in any worldly things, but we can still take delight in the suffering of our enemies. Sure, people could have reasonably good lives in preindustrial times, but not with seven billion...<br />
<br />
Even if you are a hard-core prepper, I wouldn't expect to survive much longer than most people, because unless you have the kind of fortified facility only a billionaire can afford, it is impractical to have food when others around you are starving. If nothing else, you will quickly run out of ammunition to fend off looters. Therefore, I don't bother with prepping. It is always prudent to keep a well-stocked pantry and learn basic survival and self-defense skills, of course, but beyond that, there isn't much any of us can do to improve our chances. I expect that within a few months after supply lines are cut, things will get so bad, the outcomes for each of us will be largely uncorrelated with our preparations.<br />
<br />
This is assuming a fast collapse. It is also possible the collapse will be more protracted, in which case we will live longer and get gradually poorer, our life expectancies will fall and so on. Archdruid John Michael Greer is a proponent of this sort of slow catabolic collapse, and he might be right. He is also probably the most erudite peak oil writer, in my opinion, and his <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.no/" target="_blank">blog</a> is not to be missed. The Archdruid thinks <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.no/2013/09/the-next-ten-billion-years.html" target="_blank">business as usual can continue for ten more years</a>, after which a long series of calamities will befall us over the next hundred years. At that point the human population will be down to three billion and falling. This is possible if we are able to catabolize parts of our infrastructure and recycle it in successive stages for the benefit of a much reduced population, and unfortunately it also enables oppressive governments to stay in business longer. I don't claim to predict exactly what will happen, and I don't think anyone knows. But one thing seems certain: This cycle of civilization is doomed, and we won't make it to the Singularity first like I foolishly believed in my youth, because we don't have enough energy to channel into technological progress. Prosperity isn't something which magically appears as randomly the wind blows, like I used to assume and as economists still seem to think. Prosperity must of course be based in a real energy surplus, and that energy surplus will no longer be forthcoming.

I would like to draw attention to a feminist&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/sid/Jeg-er-mann_-og-jeg-ble-voldtatt-7260902.html" target="_blank">fraud perpetrated in the newspaper Aftenposten</a>. Women lying about rape is nothing new, but did you know they even make false accusations on behalf of men, against other women? Bizarre, isn't it? But it makes sense now that the <a href="http://eivindberge.blogspot.no/2013/02/another-round-of-feminist-rape-law.html" target="_blank">law is about to be changed</a> in order to criminalize even more of male sexuality as rape. So in order to drum up support from gullible men for their expanded rape definition, feminists are impersonating a male "victim" of "rape" by a woman, as if men need this law, too. The narrative somewhat resembles the story of the freak show known as James Landrith (and <a href="http://eivindberge.blogspot.no/2013/01/beware-of-sex-negative-mras.html" target="_blank">as noted</a>, even he has been exposed as a fraud) -- except this one is obviously not written by a man at all. <a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/sid/Jeg-er-mann_-og-jeg-ble-voldtatt-7260902.html" target="_blank">Read it</a> and see for yourself, if you can read Norwegian.<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Jeg er blitt tvunget til å ha sex. Jeg er blitt voldtatt. Det hendte en 
natt en helg, og jeg hadde drukket en del. Ut på kvelden havnet vi på et
 soverom. Vi pratet og jeg sovnet. Da jeg våknet, var det en som nærmest
 lå over meg, mens den andre fiklet med underlivet mitt. Jeg forsøkte å 
vri meg unna, men kom ingen vei. Og så forsvant jeg, liksom. Kunne bare 
observere det som skjedde - helt lamslått. Kroppen min var gått i lås. 
Så forsvant de, og jeg ble funnet sovende på rommet tidlig morgenen 
etter. [...]</blockquote>
Aside from the fact that no normal man would react to a perfectly harmless sexual situation like the text claims, the last sentence is jarringly incongruent and transparently spoken by a bitter feminist cuntrag: "Synd jeg ikke er kvinne, da kunne jeg bare dratt på meg bestemorstrusen og snudd ryggen til."<br />
<br />
And the saddest part is, people are buying it, and it looks like the new rape law will soon be passed by the legistlature with little opposition. <a href="http://universalemenneskerettigheter.blogspot.no/2013/08/voldtektsapologeter.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is an example of a mangina who has been duped by the charade, clearly also influenced by the "men's human rights" gibberish of AVfM which includes blind allegiance to feminist rape ideology.<br />
<br />
To anyone with a functioning bullshit detector, it should be abundantly clear that the purported anonymous 19-year-old male "rape victim" is a feminist impostor. As one of my commenters puts it in the comments to my <a href="http://eivindberge.blogspot.no/2013/07/feminist-rape-gets-reality-check-in.html" target="_blank">previous post</a>:<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Ja, f.eks. måten hun "Mann(19)" bare skriver 'mottak' i stedet for 'voldtektsmottak', som om det er et dagligdags tema, avslører at dette er en person som har voldtekt på sin daglige agenda. På slutten kommer hun "Mann(19)" inn på den reelle agendaen for det falske debattinnlegget, at menn og kvinner må være på lag i å kjempe mot voldtekt, hvilket for henne åpenbart betyr utvidelse av voldtektsbegrepet og senking av beviskrav samt lengre straffer. Folk flest synes å sluke dette tøvet til hun "Mann(19)" rått.</blockquote>
Whether Aftenposten is in on the fraud or they simply got hoaxed, I don't know. It would behoove them to do some fact checking, because this seriously hurts their credibility. They have also published <a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/sid/Ikke-mindre-mann-7267925.html" target="_blank">another article by the phony rape accuser</a>, which is also obviously written by a professional feminist. Please get the word out because this is doing serious damage. If I still haven't convinced you that entire concept of female sex offenders is inherently laughable -- which it is -- at least you should not be hoodwinked by outright lies.

As we all know by now, in Norway and other feminist countries it is a simple and routine matter for any woman to have her regrets after sex, cry rape and count on the police and justice system to do its utmost to convict the accused man regardless of how willingly she had sex. A young woman from Norway, 24-year-old Marte Deborah Dalelv, naively thought she could do the same in Dubai, but was shocked to learn that what passes for "rape" in Norway is criminal conduct for women in Dubai. The courts in Dubai didn't agree that her story constitutes rape, and sentenced her instead to 16 months in prison for fornication and drinking alcohol. This case was first widely publicized here in Norway, and now <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/20/world/meast/uae-norway-rape-controversy/index.html" target="_blank">CNN reports it as well</a>. It beautifully showcases the entitlement of feminist women to have all their regretted sex prosecuted as rape. And it also predictably brought the <a href="http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10112027" target="_blank">manginas of Norwegian politics</a>&nbsp;out of the woodwork, who vehemently protest this verdict while they are perfectly happy to imprison men for false rape in Norway. In short, this case highlights all the reasons why I became an MRA: Normal male sexuality makes us all rapists in the eyes of the law, and the entire system here conspires to promote this misandry.<br />
<br />
One side of a story is almost never accurate, and here we only have the woman's story quoted. Even so, Marte's story does not add up to rape even if she is telling nothing but the truth. She describes only token resistance in going to the man's hotel room before willingly going to bed with him, and then blacks out and implies no resistance at all until she has her regrets the next morning as she wakes up naked. There is no violence; only drunkenness and regret. The case could hardly be more stereotypical of regretted drunken sex redefined in retrospect as rape thanks to feminist rape law -- minus the feminist law. The accused rapist is just a normal, persistent man, behaving like I have done many times and any of us would. Only with perverse, misandristic laws can this be rape, and I am pleased that Dubai rejects the hateful precepts of feminist rape law that Marte thought she could get away with. <br />
<br />
Marte Deborah Dalelv was at worst taken advantage of while drunk and careless, like any normal man would do, but she was not raped. I am happy that she is now experiencing a backlash for her hateful attitude that she is entitled to have men imprisoned for our normal male sexuality.<br />
<br />
Remember also that admitting it was not rape amounts to confessing to the crimes she is convicted of, so she has a powerful incentive to remain a false accuser, even as she probably understands by now that she made a foolish mistake by calling the police.<br />
<br />
In Norway a woman is never at fault for her actions, no matter how irresponsible. If a woman has any sexual regret at all, for any reason whatsoever, a man is always guilty of rape. Kudos to Dubai for standing up to this feminist ideal. While I am no fan of the sex-hostile moralism of Sharia law, their system is clearly superior to ours and admirably equitable. I don't agree with criminalizing fornication. But if we must have so repressive laws, it is much fairer to hold the woman responsible along with the man in cases of regretted sex (and in this case the man was sentenced to prison as well, just not for rape). Sharia law is the lesser of two evils. Rather than institutionalizing false victimhood like feminist law does, it holds both sexes accountable to rigid moral standards. I would take excessive moralism over excessive misandry any day. Thus, as an MRA, I applaud Dubai and I welcome Islamization of Europe too, over feminism at any rate.

<div class='post-body entry-content' id='post-body-7964759316117198207' itemprop='description articleBody'>
As a direct result of the embarrassing failure of the Norwegian police to prosecute me for statements on this blog (all of which can still be found here), politicians promptly set in motion a process to <a href="http://eivindberge.blogspot.no/2012/09/lex-berge.html" target="_blank">change the law</a>. And now on May 24th, 2013, the new law <a href="http://www.itavisen.no/nyheter/n-m-du-v-re-forsiktig-med-hva-du-sier-p-nettet-68627" target="_blank">went into effect</a>.<br />
<br />
In hopes of having better luck prosecuting MRAs and other outspoken undesirables in the future, the government has changed the legal definition of "public" in such a way as to include the Internet. Not just anything on the Internet, but statements communicated to at least something like 20-30 people, as explained at length <a href="http://www.regjeringen.no/pages/38164747/PDFS/PRP201220130053000DDDPDFS.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;So private email is still not public, but blogs and forums are. Specifically, this was accomplished by <a href="http://www.lovdata.no/ltavd1/filer/nl-20130524-018.html" target="_blank">changing</a> section 7 of the old Penal Code of 1902 into <a href="http://www.lovdata.no/all/hl-19020522-010.html#7" target="_blank">this</a>: <br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<b>&#167; 7.</b> Med offentlig sted menes et sted bestemt for alminnelig ferdsel eller et sted der allmennheten ferdes. <br />
<br />
En handling er offentlig når den er foretatt i nærvær av et større antall personer, eller når den lett kunne iakttas og er iakttatt fra et offentlig sted. Består handlingen i fremsettelse av en ytring, er den også offentlig når ytringen er fremsatt på en måte som gjør den egnet til å nå et større antall personer. <br />
<br />
Endret ved lov 24 mai 2013 nr. 18. </blockquote>
While defining the Internet as public is not problematic in and of itself because that merely reflects the truth, given the laws it in turn affects, this legal reform is sadly a setback for freedom of speech in Norway. Changing the legal definition of "public" acts and utterances has implications for several more criminal laws, so I dare say I have had quite a significant impact on our penal code. In my case though, it means <a href="http://www.lovdata.no/all/hl-19020522-010.html#140" target="_blank">&#167;140</a>, the law on incitement according to which I was charged, could theoretically have been applicable. &#167;140 applies to incitatory <i>public</i> speech, and now statements made on the Internet can qualify. <br />
<br />
However, contrary to popular belief and tabloid portrayals this doesn't necessarily mean they can convict you just for advocating cop-killing like I did. The incitement law specifies the advocacy of <i>initiation</i> ("iverksettelse") of a crime, and I don't believe anything I have said on this blog would qualify as such. Did I tell anybody to go out and kill cops? No, I said killing cops is the right thing to do for MRAs as activism against misandric sex laws. I said cop-killing is in complete harmony with everything I stand for. There are weighty reasons for why this law is not meant to criminalize this sort of speech, according to precedent and legal scholarship. Statements about the morality, utility and desirability of revolutionary acts are meant to be exempt, or else a whole lot of leftists and feminists also ought to be prosecuted. So even if I had not been liberated by the Supreme Court on the technicality that the Internet is not public, it is dubious whether the cops would have been able to convict me anyway in a jury trial. And let us not forget that glorifying crime, which I was also wrongfully charged with, <a href="http://eivindberge.blogspot.no/2012/12/a-public-service-announcement-to.html" target="_blank">is and remains legal</a> as I have emphasized before. We are free to celebrate publicly when acts of violent activism befall our rulers and their enforcers, and we are free to make moral pronouncements about such acts and state that we support them. What is new is merely the criminalization of incitement on the Internet to initiate specific criminal acts, but I never engaged in that anyway.

<br />
Today, for the first time on my blog I present a guest post. Walt Forest has written articles I've enjoyed for <i>The Spearhead</i> in the past (such as "<a href="http://www.the-spearhead.com/2012/10/08/the-hot-teacher-myth-and-how-it-hurts-men/" target="_blank">The Hot Teacher Myth, and How it Hurts Men</a>"), so when he submitted a piece for consideration, it was easy to accept it. This is a good list of reasons for why feminists deny the sex differences between men and women, though I might add he left out the one which irks me the most, which is how denial of sex differences is used to criminalize male sexuality further by pretending women can also be culpable for sex crimes. Hence we get what I like to call the female sex-offender charade, in which <a href="http://human-stupidity.com/stupid-dogma/teenage-sexuality/25-hottest-sex-offenders-boys-want2become-victims" target="_blank">feminism sacrifices some women as factitious sexual predators</a> in order to cater to gullible fools such as the manginas at <i>A Voice for Men</i> who might otherwise have seen the relentless criminalization of male sexuality for the misandry it is.<br />
<br />
<b>45 Reasons for the Denying the Differences between Male and Female Sexualities</b><br />
<br />
<br />
by Walt Forest<br />
<br />
<br />
1<br />
<br />
We deny differences between male and female sexualities because we mistake sameness for equality (and move farther from true equality than ever). <br />
<br />
2<br />
<br />
Stephen King once wrote: women think they understand male lust, and that&#8217;s probably just as well for their sleep and peace of mind. <br />
<br />
If we stopped denying difference, countless women would suffer sleepless nights and highly troubled minds.<br />
<br />
3<br />
<br />
We deny difference out of fear of being told we are &#8220;naïve,&#8221; &#8220;in denial,&#8221; &#8220;too pathetic to get laid,&#8221; &#8220;backwards,&#8221; &#8220;bigoted,&#8221; &#8220;prudish,&#8221; &#8220;Victorian,&#8221; etc.  These terms are now more than insults. They are denunciations meant to ostracize, socially or professionally, anyone who dares to question the ideology of sameness.<br />
<br />
4<br />
<br />
Many women do not like to admit that their sexual power gives them enormous advantages over men.   Therefore they deny the difference from which this power comes.<br />
<br />
5<br />
<br />
The creators of sexual harassment policies and laws deny difference and its myriad implications on the human mating ritual, making any man who tries (however timidly) for the proverbial bra strap an &#8220;offender,&#8221; and the woman who pushes his hand away (no matter how bright-eyed, no matter how she giggles) into his &#8220;victim,&#8221; who is granted with this status the power to ruin his life if she chooses.    This is, of course, exactly what our man-hating society wants. <br />
<br />
6<br />
<br />
We all know those men who enjoy making other men envious by describing (in the most casual of tones) how someone&#8217;s wife or girlfriend, hot teachers, sexy female bosses, and women they have only just met routinely lead them by the hands to their beds, &#8220;no strings attached.&#8221; The credibility of these Don Juan tales depends on our denial of difference. <br />
<br />
7<br />
<br />
The woman who feels the same way a man does about sex exists only in pornographic fantasy. Many men, like modern-day Don Quixotes, like to pretend these slutty Dulcineas are real.  To do so, they must deny difference. <br />
<br />
8<br />
<br />
Some women wish to avoid the responsibility that female sexual power should entail. To do so, they deny this power and the difference from which it comes.<br />
<br />
9<br />
<br />
We all know those women who stir up male interest by suggesting they want sex as badly as any man.   The popularity of these teases depends on denying difference.<br />
<br />
10<br />
<br />
Women who have abused their sexual power over men naturally want to remain blameless (and go on abusing). They can get away with it, so long as we deny difference.<br />
<br />
11<br />
<br />
The myth of &#8220;the fuck buddy&#8221; depends on denying difference. <br />
<br />
12<br />
<br />
Men commit suicide at about five times the rate of women. To understand why, we must ask, What makes men different?  But we don&#8217;t want to understand why. As a society (if not always as individuals) we hate men. We deny both the crisis and the difference at its root, and hasten still more men to their deaths.  <br />
<br />
13<br />
<br />
We mislead young women by assuring them that the men they go out with feel the same about sex as they do.  The resulting disappointment (and worse) creates a constant supply of new man-haters. In this way the denial of difference fuels our society&#8217;s already overwhelming intolerance of men. <br />
<br />
14<br />
<br />
A woman who has been used can assure herself that she only wanted sex, just as the man did, so long as we deny difference.<br />
<br />
15<br />
<br />
Men who obtain sex by falsely suggesting the possibility of commitment and love can flatter themselves by pretending that their victims only wanted sex, same as they did.  It&#8217;s a simple matter of denying difference.<br />
<br />
16<br />
<br />
By pretending that women feel the same as men do, we encourage husbands to leave their wives in search of sexual freedom. As neither this sameness nor the freedom it would create exists, these husbands wind up miserable. This is exactly what our man-hating society wants, so we go on denying difference. <br />
<br />
17<br />
<br />
Men who wish to be pious can make believe they are resisting the temptations of countless women yearning to sin with them, thereby exaggerating their own virtue without suffering any of the angst real sexual opportunity would create.  In this way denying difference can create an instant sense of righteousness. <br />
<br />
18<br />
<br />
A wife may imagine her husband surrounded by horny women who leave him cold because he loves her so much.   This romance depends on denying difference.<br />
<br />
19<br />
<br />
Storytellers have long endowed their female characters with a male-like sex drive to provide audiences a temporary escape from the oppressive everyday reality of difference.  <br />
<br />
20<br />
<br />
The great novelist Isaac B. Singer once said that a story, to be interesting, must concentrate on the exceptional. As there is little quite so exceptional as the woman who feels like a man does about sex, she is the subject of a great number of stories, all of which hinge on denying difference. <br />
<br />
21<br />
<br />
If we did not deny difference, we would have to admit that the storyteller&#8217;s art (whether in film, fiction, journalism, or oral) has been sacrificed to create today&#8217;s propaganda of correct &#8220;gender politics.&#8221; Our stories are no longer about expressing truth, whether of the sexual reality or of our hearts.  They are about upholding the false ideals of sameness. <br />
<br />
22<br />
<br />
By denying difference, we can mislead generations of young men, giving them a false idea of women, causing them a great deal of disappointment and pain.  This is exactly what our man-hating society wants.  <br />
<br />
23<br />
<br />
When a woman and a man fall in love, it can be reassuring for both to deny the chasm of difference that separates them.<br />
<br />
24<br />
<br />
Samuel Johnson once said that the law gives woman so little power because Nature has given her so much. Now that women&#8217;s legal power meets and exceeds that of men in the West, why don&#8217;t we turn to these &#8220;natural&#8221; inequalities, consider what should be done about them? <br />
<br />
Because we don&#8217;t have to, so long as we deny difference. <br />
<br />
25<br />
<br />
Female sexual power is non-transferable: we can no more grant it to men than we can the ability to give birth.  Achieving true equality of the sexes would require taking into account many different types of power. Rather than rising to the challenge, we turn away&#8212;denying difference.<br />
<br />
26<br />
<br />
If we admitted difference, we would eventually have to acknowledge that one of the most effective ways of dealing with it is through observing the propriety and decorum which our culture developed over the centuries for this purpose, and which we now take such pride in having put behind us (even as we, hypocritically, continue to follow it). But we lack the necessary humility. Instead we deny difference. <br />
<br />
27<br />
<br />
If we admitted difference, we would also have to admit there are sound reasons for legalizing prostitution. <br />
<br />
28<br />
<br />
Men who go to prostitutes like to think these women enjoy the experience as much as they do, even though they demand money to provide it and often clearly loath their clients. The fragile illusion of mutual desire depends on denying difference. <br />
<br />
29<br />
<br />
If we admitted difference, we would have to pity the man who goes to prostitutes rather than hating him. Our society prefers to hate men, so we deny difference. <br />
<br />
30<br />
<br />
Across much of the U.S., uncover female police officers pose as prostitutes and arrest any man who offers them money in exchange for sex. The men know about these stings (they are covered by the local media) yet they risk everything&#8212;job, wife, family, respect, reputation&#8212;and, in the end, lose everything.  <br />
<br />
We can avoid confronting the deep and widespread male desperation these actions suggest, dismiss these men as &#8220;losers,&#8221; if we deny difference.  <br />
<br />
31<br />
<br />
All those gay men who think they would be God&#8217;s gift to women if they were straight would have to admit they would be in the same boat as their hetero counterparts if we acknowledged difference.<br />
<br />
32<br />
<br />
If we stopped pretending that men and women feel the same about sex, many men who currently pass as bi-sexual would feel secure enough to &#8220;come out&#8221; as straight, and admit they are only taking advantage of the sexual freedom homosexuality offers.  But this would suggest men suffer from sexual oppression, and that women are the oppressors&#8212;the last thing anyone wants to admit.  We would prefer to blame the men themselves for all the misery we make them suffer.  So we deny difference.  <br />
<br />
33<br />
<br />
If we did not deny difference, all those swingers would have to start calling themselves wife swappers again.<br />
<br />
34<br />
<br />
Women who try to be like the characters in &#8220;Sex and the City&#8221; (or whatever television show they watch now) are reluctant to admit that they are forcing themselves to play a part that does not suit them (unlike like Sarah Jessica Parker herself, who has confessed that in &#8220;real life&#8221; she is a prude). To avoid coming to terms, these women deny difference.  <br />
<br />
35<br />
<br />
Countless baby boomers would have to concede their so called &#8220;sexual revolution&#8221; was a sham if we failed to deny difference. (As one would-be hippie put it: &#8220;The only ones cashing in on the free love action were the pushers and the lead singers in the more popular bands. The rest of us were lucky if we got to take part in a gang rape.&#8221;<br />
<br />
36<br />
<br />
<br />
By pretending women feel the same as men do about sex, we can keep male hope of sexual freedom at its current fever pitch, increasing women&#8217;s sexual power over men even more.<br />
<br />
37<br />
<br />
The woman who chooses a mate because of his status in a given sphere (whether social or economic) is not &#8220;natural,&#8221; as the evolutionary psychologists would have us believe, but rather a symptom of our degraded culture.  By denying difference, we can avoid facing the suffering such women cause themselves and especially the men they pass up for all the wrong reasons. <br />
<br />
38<br />
<br />
Men who use their status in a given sphere to obtain sex would like to think that women are attracted to more than their success. They can convince themselves, if they deny difference.  <br />
<br />
39<br />
<br />
The old chivalry involved opening doors for the ladies and letting them have the first life boats when the ship went down. The new chivalry, a perversion of the old, is far more dangerous.  Observing it is simple: all you have to do is deny difference and the sexual power difference creates. In this way we allow women to enjoy all the benefits of this power, with none of the responsibility wielding it should involve, none of the penalties its abuse should incur. <br />
<br />
Never have we placed women so high upon their pedestals as we do now that we deny difference.   <br />
<br />
40<br />
<br />
If we tell men that women in other countries are &#8220;less inhibited,&#8221; men flock to those countries.  If we tell men that urban women are more &#8220;sophisticated,&#8221; they will rush to the cities. I suppose if we place in men&#8217;s minds some old fashioned idea of the lusty farmer&#8217;s daughter, they will even go to the country.  When we deny the universality of difference,  pretend that it is only a construct of certain cultures (almost always those we wish to look down upon), we keep men running back and forth, here and there, and prevent them from realizing what is being done to them, which is the point. <br />
<br />
41<br />
<br />
Mainstream feminism owes much of its current popularity to its depiction of Everywoman as a heroine battling male oppression. If she fails, she is tragic, the victim of men. If she succeeds, her victory is all the more triumphant. We have all heard it said: &#8220;She had to work twice as hard.&#8221; Admitting difference and the female sexual power difference creates undermines this fiction by reminding us of the truth: women have many advantages that men do not.  Sensing how unpopular this truth would be with its base, feminism denies difference. <br />
<br />
42<br />
<br />
Some gay men like to think their sexuality is essentially the same as women&#8217;s. (It never occurs to them to ask why we have no heterosexual equivalent of the gay bathhouse). If we admitted difference, they would lose this illusion of oneness with women.  <br />
<br />
43<br />
<br />
Male masturbation fantasies often rely on denying difference.  <br />
<br />
44<br />
<br />
All of the reasons for denying difference listed here (as well as many others) reinforce each other. If journalists, novelists, film makers, television people, the tease in the next cubicle, the would-be Casanova at the water cooler, all deny difference, women and men must be the same, right?<br />
<br />
45<br />
<br />
Which brings us to the biggest reason of all: we deny difference because everybody&#8217;s doing it.

<div class='post-body entry-content' id='post-body-8081992420116556935' itemprop='description articleBody'>
Criminalizing sexuality, and particularly male sexuality, is the most salient aspect of feminism, in my view. All the other feminist shenanigans pale in comparison because criminalization represents direct, institutionalized violence against men. Witnessing ever more hateful and draconian legislative attacks on sexuality is the primary reason behind <a href="http://eivindberge.blogspot.com/2011/11/my-antifeminist-journey.html" target="_blank">my radicalization</a> into an MRA. It has reached the point where even the mainstream media these days <a href="http://www.bt.no/nyheter/innenriks/Mer-enn-tidoblet-straff-Afor-voldtekt-av-sovende-2849185.html" target="_blank">report the profound impact</a> of feminist sex law reform. In 1999, sex with very drunk or unconscious women was defined in Norway as a relatively minor crime of sexual exploitation and punished by an average of 4 months in prison. Today the same phenomenon is called "rape" and the usual sentence is 4 years.<br />
<br />
And that's just one example from a long list of legal reforms during the past 13 years which includes criminalizing negligent rape (abolishing <i>mens rea</i>), criminalizing johns (but not whores), the introduction of a grooming law and associated police stings, criminalizing bestiality, escalating mandatory sentencing, and so on. But despite these extreme advances in misandry, feminists are far from satisfied with the status quo. Now, for the fourth time since 2000, here we go again with another major round of feminist-driven sex law reform. Definitions and penalties for various sex crimes ranging from stalking to rape are set to escalate, in order to capture even more of male behavior and increase the prison population. Sex with anyone under 14 is now categorically to be defined as "rape," shamelessly instituting a deliberate lie in order to demonize men further. A brand new category of "abuse" of 16 to 17-year-olds will also be invented which effectively raises the age of consent to 18 if only the pigs find a pretext for claiming the girl was in a "vulnerable life situation" -- which can mean practically anything they want it to mean. The statute of limitations for sexual offenses against minors is proposed abolished, and retroactively so, so as to prosecute old men for alleged sex crimes many decades in the past. And bizarrely, they want to redefine masturbation to "intercourse" in order to apply the full force of rape law to men who persuade girls to perform sexual acts on themselves. The government has even managed to propose expanding the scope of child pornography law, which is already so absurdly broad that images of adult women who look young are covered, as are drawings and texts which sexualize "children" under 18. This is not enough for the feminists, so now even more ways to incriminate men for "child pornography" are set to be invented.<br />
<br />
All the proposed laws can be found <a href="http://www.regjeringen.no/pages/38226240/Hoeringsnotat.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, and now the NGOs and various interest groups <a href="http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/hoeringer/hoeringsdok/2013/horing--endringer-i-straffeloven-1902-og/horingsuttalelser.html?id=714313" target="_blank">will have their say</a> (and notice they are pretty much all <a href="http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/hoeringer/hoeringsdok/2013/horing--endringer-i-straffeloven-1902-og/horingsinstanser.html?id=714315" target="_blank">feminist groups</a>&nbsp;-- notorious feminists like Ottar are on the list while MRAs are absent), before legislators decide on the final version. <br />
<br />
Out of all this hate the highlight is, as usual, the definition of rape. The legal concept of rape has always been the most central concern of feminists, and now the law is officially intended to match the hate-propaganda promulgated by Amnesty International, the UN and other hate groups against men. The spiteful lobbying of these groups really does pay off, and the changes are happening astoundingly fast. Up until as late as 2000, rape law was still fairly sane in the Norwegian Penal Code. This is a facsimile of rape law (&#167;192) before all the recent reforms: <br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ISgywN5uCSE/USYawSIssBI/AAAAAAAACtQ/Ax0MC04pXtE/s1600/Sex+law+pre+2000+IMG_2586.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ISgywN5uCSE/USYawSIssBI/AAAAAAAACtQ/Ax0MC04pXtE/s200/Sex+law+pre+2000+IMG_2586.JPG" width="133" /></a></div>
<br />
"Den som ved vold eller ved å fremkalle frykt for noens liv eller helse tvinger noen til utuktig omgang..." -- This defines rape as sex coerced by violence or serious threats, which is a reasonable definition. Simple lack of consent does not make it rape and neither does a trivial threat. The woman needs to be made to fear for her life or health. This definition is also consistent with Common Law ("Carnal knowledge of a woman forcibly and against her will")  and even with evolutionary psychology  (&#8220;Human copulation resisted by the victim to the best of her ability unless such resistance would probably result in death or serious injury to her or others she commonly protects&#8221;  is the definition used by Thornhill &amp; Palmer in <i>A Natural History of Rape</i>). If you dilute the definition to include lower levels of sexual coercion (such as threatening to break up a relationship or start a rumor about a woman), then "rape" ceases to be a heinous crime and pretending we are dealing with the same phenomenon is dishonest.<br />
<br />
Yet this is precisely what the feminists have done and, perversely, they have escalated the punishment extremely at the same time as expanding the definition to include trivial levels of sexual coercion. As of 2000 and onwards, <a href="http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-19020522-010-023.html#192" target="_blank"><i>any</i> kind of threatening behavior will do</a>, and so will unconsciousness on the part of the woman (which in practice usually means she had sex drunk and later regrets it). <br />
<br />
And still, this is not enough. The most vaunted reform in the proposed changes is now to remove the requirement of force/threat entirely, and define rape in terms of simple lack of consent. In practice this means the woman is to be regarded the same way as the law currently treats unconscious women -- even if she is completely sober and feels no fear and is fully able to resist or flee at no risk, she shall not be bothered to do so, because holding women responsible for their actions under any circumstances at all is too much to ask in the current political climate.<br />
<br />
If this definition passes, Norwegian rape law will be brought up to the level of the most flagrantly hateful rape laws in the world, such as the Sexual Offences Act of 2003 in the UK. English law went all the way ten years ago and defined rape as intentional penetration of a vagina without consent, and consent is defined as agreeing by choice with the freedom and capacity to make that choice. Violence or coercion does not enter into the definition at all. I have <a href="http://eivindberge.blogspot.no/2011/11/feminist-police-state-grinds-on-versus.html" target="_blank">pointed out this trend before</a> as well as the fact that courts tend to convict men according to this radical feminist definition throughout Europe regardless of the letter of the law. In Norway the courts have already routinely convicted men for "rape" without coercion for twelve years now, beyond what the law actually says, as the judges themselves admit. This legal reform is thus more a matter of harmonizing the letter of the law with practice and precedent, but it nonetheless represents a profound conceptual shift in what the feminist state considers to be rape, paving the way for a renewed deluge of accusations against men who will now have even less room to defend themselves.<br />
<br />
I would encourage all Norwegians to <a href="http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/hoeringer/hoeringsdok/2013/horing--endringer-i-straffeloven-1902-og/horingsuttalelser.html?id=714313" target="_blank">watch this space</a> for the statements of the interest groups. My regular readers probably know better, but I know a lot of men support NGOs like Amnesty and Save the Children. Do yourself a favor and read the statements from these organizations as they appear and decide if you really want to support such brazen hatred against yourself. I know there are no political parties we can vote for who don't support misandrist sex laws, but you don't need to fund the lobbying for these laws by the odious scumbags in Amnesty and the like also, now do you?
