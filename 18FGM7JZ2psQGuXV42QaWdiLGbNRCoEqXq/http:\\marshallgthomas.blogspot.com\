This is a statement qualifying the issue of copyright in the songs for sale on my websites and on itunes and other vendors. 
All the songs are 100% my own or have music with free use or purchased rights to utilize and resell except for the following songs.
Kryptonite Odyssey 2013 was written by another party. The lyrics are mine. I am pledging to share royalties on a 50/50 basis until such time as an agreement is made.
Time To Heal The Earth was written by me but the drum roll in the background was written by another party. I am pledging to share royalties on a 50/50 basis until such time as an agreement is made.
All other music not of my own creation was either taken from the internet where it was placed for the express purpose of the commons, or the music was purchased with full rights to use and resell. 
All lyrics are 100% my own creation.
Nearly all of the video in the music videos is not of my own creation. These videos were and are being shared 100% free online. None of the individual video contributions are used for more than 20 seconds. The doctrine of fair use is cited as a means of using raw video placed online. No resale is involved. No excessive use of one work is involved. The videos tell a story that promotes the common good in a responsible manner. There is no obscene or graphic content. All authors who request credit for their contributions will be complied with.
The definition of plagiarism is to claim the works of another as your own creation. 
I have never done so.
Any errors in acknowledging individual contributions in my work will be corrected as they are brought to my attention. I wish to thank all the creative individuals whose work I have built upon to create music videos, songs, and books. I do hereby acknowledge all such contributions.

Anonymous donations can be made online to Monarch 501 C 3 or me using these Bitcoin addresses and using the Tor browser with the latest Firefox edition.  These transactions are the only private financial transactions left except face to face cash transactions. 
Download the TOR with the new FIREFOX browser and use a Bitcoin service such as http://MTGOX.COM
 or http://COINBASE.COM to send Bitcoin currency to one of these secure addresses:

15ZoXAjSwq5nArugmo7AovT69QjVzeyCNC 
(Monarch)
18FGM7JZ2psQGuXV42QaWdiLGbNRCoEqXq   
(me)

It is possible to verify the transaction went through using the Bitcoin service wallet.  This is the preferred method to use in order to avoid the kind of problems experienced by WikiLeaks when trying to use Paypal and credit card donation mechanisms. These addresses are secure from all forms of electronic interference. Anyone can see the account balance, but without the KEY one can only make deposits to the account. All funds will be dedicated to aiding the victims and exposing the truth.
Thank you on behalf of the victims of non-lethal weapons and organized stalking

Domestic political reform: All reforms herein are designed in hope of stopping a repeat of crimes against humanity and collapse of faith in our public institutions.
The US constitution designated a state that evolves and is self-correcting. In the beginning there were no political parties as we know them, nor any mention of them in the founding document. Running for office was a no holds barred anything goes endeavor that featured the Founding Fathers engaged in negative campaign tactics that might make even modern practitioners of the art blush. The current state of political parties and the legislative process finds a deadlock that ensures little or nothing will get done. The term banana republic comes to mind with their examples of ossification and corruption. This cannot be the future our founders had in mind. Our institutions are in a crisis that no one seems to be able to answer.
The rise of transnational corporations, international financial institutions, and other supranational entities dwarf our public institutions in their wealth, political power, and unchecked influence upon our lives. It has been repeatedly stated by many social scientists for over a generation that transnational institutions would increasingly control our lives, and that eventually governments would become no more than a fig leaf for lending legitimacy to their larger designs. In an age of repeated epic financial fraud and collapse, and wars without end, we increasingly realize we are no longer in control of our own destiny. The standard American model of a robust middle class has largely given way or is in the process of giving way to a South American model of a few fabulously wealthy families and a population mostly composed of low wage &#8220;slaves&#8221;. It is clear under these new circumstances that a Republic cannot prevail and that authoritarian government is the default setting for the future. A system of such inequality and basic unfairness can only be sustained by violence, the kind practiced by a police state upon its own people, similar to regimes in the south. This probably includes the widespread use of torture and death squads to intimidate the masses. 
This awful model is very widespread across the face of the earth, and has been for a very long time. The US has historically been seen by the rest of the world as a bulwark against the triumph of this onerous model that moves humanity towards a perpetual state of despair without hope of deliverance. Even those who condemn US foreign policy in strident terms, often inquire with their next breath about the possibility of obtaining a visa to live and work here. As Lincoln observed, we truly are the last best hope of the human race. We did not conceive, nor originate this system that brings hope; we have inherited it from those who came before us. It did not come cheap, for often they purchased it at the cost of their lives.
I have come here not to castigate the current generation, nor to praise it, but merely to map out a manner of keeping what we have been given. It is difficult to know where to turn or how to answer questions that seem to have no easy answers. Our institutions and leaders do not seem up to the task for reasons that are not entirely their fault. The fault is not in our stars dear friends, but within ourselves. We have participated in the divisions and mistakes that are leading us down a path to decay and collapse. Happily since we are largely the cause of our own problems in life, then by definition we are also the answer to the problems seemingly without solutions. Democracy was enshrined on the plains of Marathon in a desperate battle between the independent city states of Greece and the super power empire that marched to deliver their destruction and submission. The shared sacrifice of the land owners and the poorer citizenry sealed a bargain, and without that social compact of shared sacrifice this is not a system of government that can endure.
The corrupting influence of money upon the political process was acknowledged and dealt with 100 years ago. The Progressive Movement curtailed the worst abuses of the Gilded Age, and set in motion the zenith of American power and influence on the world stage in what came to be known as the American Century. No person or nation is completely self-serving and without fault, but the defeat of Fascism and Communism cannot be argued away. We have saved the world on more than one occasion, so let us on this hopeful new day go to the trouble of saving ourselves. There is nothing new under the sun. The historian tells us how great nations and empires rise and fall, it is no great mystery. Simplified and condensed, the elite take the opportunity to garner the lions&#8217; share of resources within their society for themselves. The term used is rent seeking behavior. The Ottoman Empire decayed because the administrators of the realm changed the rules to allow their children to inherit their power and wealth. The French kings sold off the rights to tax the citizenry to an aristocracy that made themselves immune from taxation, and slowly bled the populace dry. To put the problem in modern terms, no one can resist the power to print money. Political power confers the right of the stock market and financial entities to violate the basic tenants of fairness and common sense in order to make vast sums of money in schemes bound to fail. Political power purchased with the wealth earned in this manner allows them to ignore the laws and rules we all play by. These institutions become much wealthier; they then use that wealth to purchase more political power that in turn leads to increased wealth. It is a feedback loop that seems to have no end; however everything must end, witness the Ottoman Empire and the French Aristocracy. 
Everyone knows that before they go on vacation, if they give their teenager the keys to their sports car and hand them a credit card with no limit, then when they return from vacation the sports car will be wrapped around a tree and their bank account will be empty. No one can resist the ability to print money, but if enough people print enough money, then money becomes worthless paper. This is why we elect representatives, to act as the adults in the room when someone suggests they be allowed to engage in activity equivalent to the ability to print money. I must tell you the obvious at this point, that the money being &#8220;printed&#8221; is used to bribe our representatives whose job it is to restrain childishness and corrupt self-interest that leads to collapse. Blame your representatives all you want for this deplorable state of affairs, it is mostly our fault. The first step towards solving a problem is to admit it exists. Next one must accept responsibility for the problem. Finally, we the people, must take the necessary steps to solve the problem. Our political system has evolved into a system of legalized bribery and extortion. I now take this opportunity to suggest in all humility to my fellow citizens how we might fix this problem.
First, a new law which mandates the public financing of all state and federal elections, not to exceed 1/2 of 1% of the state or national budget. New laws that severely penalize the offering or acceptance of bribes for political favors, as well as extortion by representatives for payments to avoid political sanction, penalized by not less than twenty years in federal prison. Pay rates for representatives commensurate with their responsibility, pay that is similar to (50-100%) that of the average pay for a corporate CEO, all remunerations for pay, housing, travel, and elections not to exceed 1% of the state or national budget. Open primaries (state and national) that choose two candidates independent of party affiliation, and then a runoff election between the top two contestants to decide the election. Free air time on the public airwaves (as a condition for the license holder) for all candidates so that they may communicate their legislative agendas unhindered beginning 100 days before elections, not to exceed the seven highest polling candidates, such air time not to be less than 100 hours in times and manner of maximum exposure to the greatest numbers of the citizenry of all classes. The expense borne by any one communication medium (example: television) for the 100 days may be shared across the various stake holders of each respective medium. 
Any political communications that rise to the level of campaigning that are not publically financed within the 100 days regarding the election of state and federal representatives are restricted, just as political communications within a certain distance of polling places are restricted. The penalty for purposeful violation of this restriction are civil fine for the first offense, and criminal penalty for subsequent violations, not less than $10,000 or 180 days in jail. Political communications that rise to the level of campaigning outside the 100 day period that are not publically financed may not be reciprocated by elected state or federal representatives with favors in kind, including favorable treatment in votes for legislation that affect the interests of said outside parties. The penalties for garnering influence in this manner shall be censure, dismissal, and criminal penalty not less than ten years in federal prison for all (both) parties to the act(s). 
All representatives shall enjoy the right to travel free of charge at the public expense with one other person, anywhere in the US (state representatives) or the world (national representatives) in economy class. All representatives shall enjoy free communal housing as near as possible to the location of their workplace in the capitol of their state or the nation, including immediate family relations. Transparency in government will be the de facto rule of the land. This includes the transparency of ALL documents, emails, conversations, actions, judgments, and ALL other records and deeds of the nation&#8217;s legal representatives relating to public business within one year of their creation, and severe criminal penalty for violation of said transparency. All official legislative business must be recorded in full in an immediate public record that cannot be obscured or altered under severe criminal penalty, not less than twenty years in federal prison. No legislative legal actions may be taken or enacted that are not immediately made public in a manner accessible to the greatest number of constituents; this includes all financial records of representatives, personal, private, and public. National and state representatives must be in session transacting the people&#8217;s business no less than three quarters (&#190;) of the calendar year, excluding weekends and national holidays. Time out of session may not exceed thirteen (13) weeks. The 100 days prior to election the representative is standing for shall not be included as time out of session.
Elections shall be held on days to include an official holiday for that purpose and a weekend so as to insure maximum participation by the citizenry. Elections will include legal voting by all persons who are born or naturalized citizens regardless of past civil or criminal offense. All elections must be certified as verifiable in their results by a reasonable means of oversight, this precludes electronic means that cannot be verified by paper receipt or similar means after the fact. Any such electronic means or other means of election that is not legally certified by the courts as verifiable is null and void and must be repeated in a legal manner. All ballots and other means of election must be made available to the general public during the 100 days as an example of how the ballot shall appear and how it will be filled out or otherwise put to its intended use. The courts may judge if ballots are misleading and may direct a standardized design. The means of choosing the President shall be direct election of the President of the United States. A civil penalty of a nominal fine will be liable for all persons of age and physical ability who fail to vote. Repeat violation may be punished by 24 hours in jail. Absentee balloting shall be available to all citizens eligible to vote upon request without qualification or hindrance. Any person or persons who engage in voter suppression shall be liable for criminal penalty. If said suppression extends to more than one thousand persons then said criminal penalty shall be twenty years in federal prison.
This list of reforms shall be added to the constitution as the 28th Amendment in order that the courts or other legal entities not strike it down after the fact of its coming into law. In order to make this Amendment a reality, voters must demand ALL of their representatives publicly sign an explicit promise to vote for this reform at the earliest appointed time. If your representative, who is a servant of the people, fails to uphold their promise, then they must be replaced at the next election, or prior to that election, if legally possible. The benefits of these reforms will take several years to become apparent. It is our hope and prayer that the reforms will break the system of legalized compulsory bribery and extortion being practiced in the open today. The responsibility for realizing the reforms recorded here fall first upon the people of this great country, and after the fact upon their legal representatives. God Bless the United States of America. 9/24/12

Seeking God:
       All human beings are by definition God seeking. They search for greater meaning in life as part of their basic human constitution. I was an atheist in a lifelong quest for God. I began a spiritual path at 25 that culminated at 37 when a mystical experience in the mountains brought me in direct contact with the divine presence. God is everywhere, existing outside of time and space, not just here, but across the entire universe. All people, all living things, even the most humble among us, carry within them a part of the eternal, a part of the sacred and divine. I believe that any human being is capable of the direct experience of God. This experience is an ecstatic joy beyond description. 
       I am a humble man, with a good heart who willingly traveled a hard path. I have been granted extraordinary abilities for the purpose of serving mankind in the hour of its darkest night. I was chosen not because of some innate superiority, but because of my journey through the fires of hell. Incredible human suffering transformed me. I do not have all the answers. I do not call all the shots. I am a human being who bleeds and cries, just like you. I make mistakes every day and I strive to do better. I bring gifts for all people, answers to the questions that seemingly have no answers. I bring a new definition of what it means to be human, and a new value upon human life, a new value on our world. 
       We stand upon the cusp of heaven and hell. From this point forward humanity will either move in the direction of God, and live out the meaning of our creed&#8230;or we will spiral downward into an abyss and go into the darkness forever. Evil exists and works its will in this world. I am calling upon all people to take direct personal responsibility for their own future, the future of their nation, and the future of the world. Throw off your feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. Stand up and join together in order to grasp the reins of destiny in your own two hands. This moment will not come again.
       I suggest four goals to move human events in the right direction. End the secret dirty war on political activists and whistleblowers. Reform our domestic politics from the influence of wealth. Sign a collective security treaty to end the arms race. A new Marshall Plan to control hunger and disease, and preserve the our planetary ecology. There are no perfect solutions, or instantaneous transformations that will solve the problems that confront us. There are only the deliberate changes we make every day in our lives, and the gradual transformation that comes from placing one foot in front of the other. The changes I suggest will take several generations to blossom. Our expectations must accept that this is the work of a lifetime.    
       These gifts do not belong to one nation, one race, or one religion. These gifts do not belong to one man. All people are one family, brothers and sisters without exception. The truth of this cannot be denied, even as we sometimes blindly persecute one another on the basis of our perceived differences. God loves us and has granted us free will. We are free to choose good or evil. We are free to succeed or fail. It is not written whether humanity will join with God in ecstatic vision, or whether we will give in to fear and hate and destroy ourselves. It is written that it is our duty to try. It is written that now is the hour of destiny for all God&#8217;s children. Let us honor that love, let us join together and move in the direction of a loving God.

Final terms and military operation....
In order to avoid a mass casualty event the following terms are offered to military intelligence perpetrators. All officers and men are allowed to enter witness protection and be given enough money that they will no longer need to work to support themselves. The top commander will be subject to five years detention without open trial, then released to witness protection on the same terms.....

The current standoff is a draw that portends more casualties and few immediate results. The use of a high risk high reward strategy is advised. Make the offer above and schedule a military operation to disarm the perpetrators. On Saturday, August 25, 2012 the designated forces shall move on the bases, individuals, and locations at approximately 0400 to secure the nation from further attacks. The president will signal the go code by giving a speech that contains the phrase, "When in the course of human events". The go code will allow secretary of defense to choose the EXACT time the operation will commence, and he will give the final order on or about Saturday, August 25th, at 0400. It is our hope that the perpetrators will take this chance to avoid further violence. If not, then mass casualties will probably result, arguably in a manner that was unavoidable, if not inevitable. Any blame or fault lies with this party in that regard. Marshall Thomas 8/18/12....

National authority may choose to avoid the potential worst case scenario. I suggest that the roll out on 8/25/12 instead consist of one person, who gives a speech that details the outlines of the conflict and attempts to rally nonviolent opposition among our people. I volunteer to make the speech and attempt to rally mass opposition to the perpetrators. If the mass movement fails to achieve a breakout then the above scenario of military resistance will again proceed on the same terms approximately five months later on MARCH 13, 2013 using the same methodology and timing.

8/27/12
The current timeline suggested for moving into the public sphere with information assets is 9/3/12, on or before noon EST if possible.
In the event of hostilities state, local, and national authorities should implement FEMA management plans in areas near the bases mentioned, and in other affected areas. Civilians should be evacuated if their movements will not hamper operations, which take priority.  This coordination includes that for moving large military forces into target areas and APB for all personalities who must be taken into custody. Once the base at HHC (Fort Meade) is secured by friendly forces the hostile operations shall be turned to protect friendly forces and to confront and or neutralize other hostile elements using advanced technology from the HHC location and other bases that have been neutralized as threats. If friendly forces sustain casualties that make their mission doubtful, then all necessary force is authorized for the bases in question, including missiles from sea and air. The hostile locations that include antennae complexes and hostile communications nodes are cleared for destruction at the first sign of open hostilities and attacks upon civilians, military personnel, and national leadership.

Four Facts and Logical Explanations:<br />Political activists and whistleblowers are being attacked with electromagnetic weapons (EMW) and used as human guinea pigs in terminal experiments designed to force a suicide, incarceration, or premature death from non-ionizing radiation. This program is a continuation of earlier illegal government programs. <br />During the Cold War the Department of Defense (DOD) used 500,000 US citizens as experimental subjects in nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) weapons development programs. We refer to these all of these crimes against humanity as the human guinea pigs experiments. <br />During the Cold War the government made hit lists of political activists and waged an undeclared secret war on them. This illegal program was the FBI Counter Intelligence Program or COINTELPRO. <br />During the Cold War the CIA used Nazi scientists to learn how to control the human mind using drugs, torture, ECT, electromagnetic radiation, and hypnosis. This illegal program was Mind Kontrol ULTRA or MKULTRA.<br />Today Army intelligence (INSCOM) is accomplishing all three illegal government programs in a single program using the military strategy known as force multiplication. INSCOM is perfecting (EMW) electromagnetic weapons on unwilling people.  Human guinea pig experiments. <br />INSCOM is also neutralizing potential enemies on a hit list, political activists and whistleblowers, by using them as the unwilling subjects of the human experimentation. Cointelpro<br />Finally, INSCOM is using extreme trauma, sleep deprivation, and other torture techniques delivered by EMW to the targets to further refine the science of behavior modification.  MKULTRA<br />Force multiplication means enfolding all three of the previous illegal government operations, human guinea pig experiments, Cointelpro, and MKULTRA, together with the new electromagnetic weapons (EMW) development program, in short accomplishing all three aims at once. <br />Political activists that in the past were attacked in a traditional manner are now targeted with EMW. Targeted Individuals (TI&#8217;s) fit a common profile just like previous illegal programs. The new technology often leaves no obvious injuries so that driving TI&#8217;s to suicide using EMW is plausibly deniable. If the traumatized TI&#8217;s retaliate they are incarcerated, if they protest too vehemently they are forcibly institutionalized. The long term effect of non-ionizing radiation is often cancer, heart attack, or similar cause of death that is recorded as natural causes. Murder by heart attack, stroke, or cancer is plausibly deniable, and thus the perfect crime. Army intelligence (INSCOM) is committing crimes against humanity, the same criminal activity for which the WWII Allies executed Nazi scientists.  <br />The case being made is based on Four Facts to avoid confusion, disinformation, and circular arguments that lead nowhere. MKULTRA took place at over 80 institutions and the current program (MONARCH) is equally complex. Four facts are all that&#8217;s necessary to convince a reasonable person this atrocity is really taking place and demands immediate action. The name MONARCH has been chosen by the author, the real name is unknown.<br />ONE: EMW like the active denial system (ADS) and milliwave radars are public weapons. The USSR used EMW to attack the US Embassy in Moscow in the 1950&#8217;s. In response the US began a secret crash program to develop microwave weapons.<br />TWO: Criminal history, a prior pattern of criminal behavior, half a million (500,000) US citizens used as guinea pigs in nuclear, biological, chemical (NBC) weapons programs. Cointelpro government hit lists of activists and MKULTRA behavior modification experiments using torture. All three illegal government programs escaped detection for decades and no perpetrators were ever punished.<br />THREE: Credible witnesses have testified they are targets of classified EMW and organized stalking. The author has interviewed 200 targets in person. Most TI&#8217;s are activists and whistleblowers, about 40 years old, with a high IQ, and other commonalities. The majority fit a common profile similar to victims of previous illegal government programs. <br />FOUR: Persons of interest, Army intelligence officers who have worked since 1980 to develop EMW for the Army, publicly admired MKULTRA, advocated using EMW on civilians in their homes, moved classified weapons from the DOD to the DOJ and to law enforcement. They promote borderline beliefs as part of a smoke screen cover up.<br />These are the basic facts reduced to the bare minimum. More evidence is free online in books, films, blogs, government documents, military science papers, EMW scientist&#8217;s papers, patents, newspaper and magazine articles, the testimony of experts and witnesses. Four Facts are all that is necessary to prove a preponderance of evidence, enough to convince a reasonable person that these crimes are taking place and must be stopped. If adds up to four, open the door. (open the secret archives)<br />When the USSR attacked the US embassy in Moscow with microwave weapons in the 1950's the US began to develop microwave weapons in secret. Today there are public nonlethal microwave weapons like the active denial system (ADS) and milliwave radars, but where are the weapons that kill? The USSR developed microwave weapons that kill by stopping the heart and causing cancer. The US also developed lethal microwave weapons capabilities but kept them secret because if the American people saw human beings killed by heart attack or cancer then they might object to the weapons as immoral and dangerous.<br />The active denial system (ADS) shoots a tight beam of electromagnetic radiation (95Ghz) that heats your skin to 130 F and feels like you&#8217;re touching a red hot iron. It is a pain amplification device engineered not to kill so the public will accept the new weapons. Milliwave radars are see-thru-wall radars used by the military for house to house fighting. They see through building materials and the water in the human body lights up with great definition. The world is now a fish bowl and the American people no longer have privacy even inside their own homes. <br />If the US had weapons that could kill anyone anywhere without leaving any physical evidence and only a select few knew of their existence, wouldn't they tempted to use them for their own selfish purposes. The power to kill anyone anywhere is an absolute power that corrupts absolutely. <br />If intelligence agencies have a history of criminal behavior targeting activists and the current targets are activists who testify they are attacked with classified anti-personnel weapons similar to the ADS, shouldn't they be investigated?<br />During the Cold War the US Army used 500,000 US citizens as guinea pigs for NBC weapons. EMW are the latest and greatest toys coming out of government weapons labs. Do you think they just suddenly stopped at the end of the Cold War? If they could continue without getting caught, wouldn't they be tempted to continue?<br />If a murderer has tortured and or killed half a million people and got away with it, and then you gave him an EMW that could kill anyone anywhere without the risk of getting caught, what would he do, just stop out of new found sense of morality?<br />The USSR attacked the US embassy in the 1950's with EMW, and it was kept secret until the 1970's. If the USSR could get away with using EMW against the US, even then the world&#8217;s greatest superpower, then what chance would a single individual have against this kind of state sponsored high tech terrorism? The USSR has had EMW for decades that can kill goats at a distance of half a mile. Were the Russians the only ones smart enough to develop EMW? Innocent people are being attacked everyday with EMW in their homes and work places. They are living a nightmare you can&#8217;t imagine. EMW attacks employ a decoy and deception strategy making it nearly impossible to tell who is attacking you, or how attacks are being accomplished. If these EMW were public you might believe them, but as it stands now they have no chance. <br />When KGB agent turned whistleblower Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned with polonium-210 there was a radiation trail that led from Moscow, to London, and back to Moscow. When a TI is murdered using non-ionizing radiation to induce heart attack, stroke, or cancer, there is no physical evidence of foul play, no traces of NBC agents, and no bullet fragments. A murder that is plausibly deniable is the perfect crime. The intelligence agencies have achieved perfect deniability for their crimes.   <br />There are persons of interest in charge of nonlethal microwave weapons development for the Army since 1980 working at weapons labs like Los Alamos where the atomic bomb was invented in secret. These men have expressed admiration for MKULTRA, interest in using EMW to modify human behavior and &#8220;neuter people&#8221;. They&#8217;ve publicly advocated using EMW to attack civilians in their homes, and been instrumental in moving classified military weapons from the DOD to the DOJ. These persons of interest are experts with 45 years of experience in psychological operations (psyop)(Mind War), misdirection, and counter insurgency warfare. Remote Viewing is sold online by Army intelligence officers, in effect saying that for $3,000 we&#8217;ll teach you super powers of the mind so you can spy on the Russians in their underground bases or find their submarines hidden at the bottom of the ocean. Should we believe them or be skeptical and look more closely at what they are doing? None of these intelligence officers and government physicists actually believes in apocalyptic death cults or remote viewing. These superstitions are a smoke screen. Superstitions don&#8217;t go together with Army weapons development programs. One of these things does not belong with the other. They do go with the concept of the Big Lie used as a smoke screen. The Big Lie was first used for the WWII D-Day invasion. Army intelligence created a fake Army around General Patton to mislead the enemy with fake radio traffic, inflatable tanks, planes, and landing craft. The Nazi high command was so fooled that even weeks after the Normandy invasion they were still holding their Panzer tank divisions in reserve waiting for the real invasion at Calais. The Big Lie was used to cover up the real operation of 8,000 ships and hundreds of thousands of men. It is misdirection on a mass scale to screen a secret plan, a large military operation. <br />It is important to understand what we are dealing with. J Edgar Hoover had files on Congressmen, and Presidents that detailed their personal lives and made them afraid to fire him. The FBI targeted political activists in Cointelpro. Hoover personally wrote MLK a letter to force him to commit suicide. Hoover's career stretched from 1920's to the 1970's when he died in office. This was unprecedented for one man to control one of the most powerful agencies in government for so long. This is the kind of power we&#8217;re faced with, men too powerful to defy, too powerful to cross, or Congressmen and even Presidents might be politically or even physically destroyed. Anyone who commands the power to assassinate people in manner that appears to be a natural cause of death is able to get away with murder. It is the perfect crime. This capability is exactly what we are faced with today, the ability to kill anyone with plausible deniability. If Hoover had access to EMW he would have used them on people like MLK. You would have read one day that MLK had died of heart attack, stroke, cancer, or even suicide. MLK&#8217;s movement would have stalled out and died out before it had gained sufficient momentum within society to succeed.   <br />Investigative reporters have independently corroborated these charges. Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) has a secret weapon, a revolutionary breakthrough in electronic warfare capabilities that will transform how war is waged. They possess a secret weapon that can track and kill anyone in their area of operations, day or night, in any kind of weather. JSOC has a death squad with a hit list carrying out assassinations outside the chain of military command or civilian oversight. These are the same charge made by activists, that they are targeted with classified anti-personnel weapons similar to the ADS.<br />EMW are referred to as a Revolution in Military Affairs or RMA. This term is very specific terminology used by military scientists. Examples of an RMA are gunpowder and nuclear weapons. The invention of gunpowder meant all previous weapons were suddenly obsolete and a few hundred men armed with cannon and firearms could take over entire nations, turning the military, political, and social structure upside down. If Nazi&#8217;s had invented nuclear weapons in 1940 and had 100 atomic bombs, they could have taken over the entire world and put in place a fascist state world government. Today&#8217;s battle field weapons are shells and missiles that travel at top speeds of 3,000 miles per hour. EMW and lasers travel at the speed of light (186,000 miles per second) and have demonstrated the ability to destroy shells and missiles in flight.<br />To understand the current illegal program (MONARCH) it is necessary to understand Cointelpro and MKULTRA. Cointelpro targets were the civil rights, anti-war, environmental, and women's movements. Infiltration and psychological operations probably began in the 1950's. The theory of counter insurgency operations dictates that infiltration and &#8220;psyop&#8221; be used against dissident groups in &#8220;normal times,&#8221; before any mass movement can develop. This means an undeclared war must be waged on civil society, namely people trying to bring about progressive social change in a lawful and constitutionally protected manner. The favorite FBI tactic is the &#8220;snitch jacket,&#8221; where suspicion of being an informant is used against legitimate leaders. In practice an FBI informant would join MLK&#8217;s inner circle and use false evidence to make it appear that MLK was himself an FBI informant. The organization is torn by suspicion and broken apart from within. FBI agents put pressure on landlords to evict the activists, and pressure on employers to fire them. Cointelpro went silent in the late 1970&#8217;s, and then re-emerged in the early 1980's. Infiltration of anti-war groups is a common part of the current &#8220;Global War on Terror&#8221;. <br />MKULTRA: The CIA scientist Dr. Sidney Gottlieb used Nazi scientists and their state of the art mind control techniques perfected in concentration camps of WWII. Nazi scientists experimented on children using drugs, torture, electroshock, and hypnosis. Mind control works best when trauma is administered by age three. Trauma causes the personality to split or dissociate in order to shield the mind from memories too painful to endure. It works like partitioning a computer hard drive. The Three Faces of Eve is a true story of a woman&#8217;s multiple personality disorder (MPD) accidently created by childhood abuse. Trauma causes the dissociation. MKULTRA works best when the trauma is repeated on the child at six. Later the child&#8217;s IQ and personality tests determine if the child may be trained in espionage. The subject can be hypnotized and used for operations, after which they have no memory of events and are only consciously aware of a sense of lost time. They are like a sleep walker who remembers nothing. The current illegal program using EMW to traumatize targets is a direct result of these earlier programs.<br />The DOD does not want a public backlash against weapons they are pouring billions of dollars into. EMW are the perfect tool for espionage operations (psyop) very versatile, cheaper than other weapons, and give you more bang for the buck. EMW will never willingly be made public or given up by INSCOM. The intelligence agencies still keep the formula for invisible ink secret after 100 years.<br />DOD physicists have developed EMW that couple with and interact with the human central nervous system without electrodes. Many scientific papers written in the 50&#8217;s, 60&#8217;s, and 70&#8217;s have been classified retroactively but many scientific papers still remain public. There are hundreds of public patents for EMW that both interact with and attack the central nervous system. Today the private sector is reinventing the wheel. Similar technology is being used for the disabled. Toyota makes a wheel chair that quadriplegic&#8217;s can control with mental commands.                                     <br />Government elites are effectively above the law due to the National Security Act (NSA) of 1947, which allows claims of national security exceptions in courts of law to cover up criminal wrong doing. Judges accept the argument, "trust us or our enemies will learn our secrets". Wearing the uniform of the US doesn&#8217;t mean men stop being human, and thus imperfect. The NSA was first invoked in court in 1953 when a B-29 crashed killing the civilians aboard. Their widows sued for negligence. The DOD invoked the NSA and the court records were sealed. Fifty years later the records were unsealed and there were no secrets to protect, only DOD negligence. This was first time the NSA was used in court and the pattern has been repeated to allow the DOD and others to avoid criminal penalties. It is the perfect get out of jail free card.  <br />The motivation to assassinate loyal American opposition stems from perception of dissent against the Vietnam War as treason.  This philosophy is stated very clearly in the MindWar paper written by Army intelligence officer Lt Colonel Michael Aquino. The claim of sabotage by domestic enemies as the reason for losing the Vietnam War was once a borderline view, but is now the premier narrative of the Neocons. This claim of betrayal is the exact same claim made by the German Army after their loss in WWI. German conservatives and German military leaders blamed Socialists, Communists, and Jews who "stabbed them in the back on home front&#8221;. INSCOM officers and others with hard right wing views have followed the well-worn path of blaming their political opponents of treason and using that as an excuse to eliminate them. These charges of torture and murder are the most serious charges ever made against US government employees, and are not made lightly.               <br />In WWI the US Army created its first formal intelligence service, the Military Intelligence Division (MID). The MID was small but multiplied its force using an unofficial army of 250,000 vigilantes, called the American Protective League (APL). The vigilante army members were used to, "keep watch over suspicious activities", and perhaps more importantly, to suppress resistance to the war. Leaders of the vigilante army were made official officers in the MID (supposedly) to control the worst of the &#8220;illegal activity&#8221; by the vigilantes.  <br />Targeted Individuals (TI&#8217;s) are victims of organized stalking. Other terms are gang stalking, street theater, gas lighting. The KKK called it mobbing. TI&#8217;s are victims of a public smear campaign to cast them as, &#8220;undesirable elements who must be driven out of the community&#8221;. The vigilante means of driving TI&#8217;s out of town are low level attacks, some of which are not technically illegal, and are difficult for the TI to describe to others. Strangers cursing the TI in public everywhere they go, bumping and blocking tactics on city sidewalks, streets, and inside stores. Total strangers start verbal arguments and even physical fights. Forcing car wrecks by pulling in front and slamming on brakes, or simply ramming TI&#8217;s cars in parking lots. Constant break-ins, vandalism, sabotage of computers, harassment at work, and noise campaigns such as neighbors blasting music all night, every night. A symphony of systematic low level attacks that occur literally dozens of times a day, and after just a few weeks pegs the stress level of the target at an artificially high level. The person begins to lose physical energy, sleep patterns are altered, depression sets in, and work output drops. These constant tactics of causing psychological trauma might be termed, the death of 1,000 cuts.  <br />The tactics are similar to Behavioral Science Consultation Teams (biscuit teams) that tailor psyop attacks designed by a doctor, psychologist, and interrogation specialist, to individually design a campaign targeting cultural and personality weaknesses of the detainee. Biscuit teams use many small stress factors applied one on top of the other, used over time, including isolation, extreme temperature, stress positions, constant lights on or lights off to distort the time sense, sleep and sensory deprivation, sound attacks, sexual humiliation, constant threats of violence to the detainee or their families, even odors and other techniques to slowly break down and psychologically destroy the subject without resorting to &#8220;traditional torture&#8221; such as electrocution, or pulling out finger nails, etc. <br />The USSR by the 1960's was worried about world opinion and could no longer openly imprison and execute political dissidents. They began forced institutionalization of dissidents into mental hospitals and forced them to take experimental drugs to destroy them. The 1972 US Army study, Controlled Offensive Behavior USSR, was an in-depth study of the non-traditional torture techniques and tools the USSR used on dissidents. The topics of study included the use of isolation, temperature, light, sound, smell, sleep and sensory deprivation, fake firing squads, and EMW, including the use of the device known as the LIDA (EMW) within mental institutions, used to "pacify" patients. The techniques and weapons were used to break down minds in behavior modification experiments and turn political dissidents into psychiatric cases. The US has now adopted the weapons and techniques of our former Communist enemies in the current Global War on Terror, and in the secret war on political activists and whistleblowers.<br />It is inevitable that TI&#8217;s will be called crazy and explained away as mass hysteria. This often happened to the human guinea pigs in past. Both Cointelpro and MKULTRA used the strategy of making TI&#8217;s look crazy as a primary method for keeping the illegal operations secret. The human radiation experiments exposed thousands of citizens to harmful or lethal levels radiation. This is one man&#8217;s story out of half a million. In 1947 Mr. Elmer Allen was injected with plutonium in the left leg in a San Francisco hospital, and the next day his leg was amputated. He told his best friend and his family doctor that he thought he might have been used as a human guinea pig. His friend didn&#8217;t believe him and avoided him and his family doctor permanently classified him as a paranoid schizophrenic in his medical records. Mr. Allen&#8217;s family didn&#8217;t find out the truth until years after he died. In 1995 the US government decided to go public, it held hearings and issued a report but no one was punished. The hearings functioned as a white wash. <br />Cointelpro targets were routinely depicted as paranoid when they claimed that the government was systematically following them, harassing them, and sabotaging their lives. Anti-war activist Abbie Hoffman told press, family, and friends that he was being targeted, but most refused to believe him, and afterwards avoided him. Friends of Hoffman broke into FBI offices and stole documents that proved the FBI was spending half its time on Cointelpro. It was only then that some members of the press believed him. <br />MKULTRA survivors still live in fear in the shadows even today. If victims tell a doctor or therapist that as children they were drugged and tortured in government labs to induce MPD they will be permanently classified as paranoid schizophrenics in their medical records. This keeps the worst aspects of MKULTRA secret. Many victims report receiving threats and harassment when they attempt to give public testimony. MKULTRA was designed and run by government funded psychiatrists, men such as Ewen Cameron, former head of the American and World Psychiatric Association. <br />Current victims of MONARCH will be smeared as tin foil hat mass hysteria cases because many previous victims of illegal government programs have suffered the same fate. To say that it can&#8217;t happen here or that something this big cannot be kept quiet is untrue because all the previous illegal programs involving a half million victims did happen here and they were kept secret for decades. The DOD used 500,000 human guinea pigs for weapons development programs without interruption for 50 years. Cointelpro waged war against activists from the 1950's onward. MKULTRA traumatized children from 1953 until the late 1970's. The atrocities continued for generations completely off the public radar. The guilty parties got away with it every time, and no one went to jail. The only two men ever convicted for Cointelpro crimes (FBI agents) were pardoned by President Ford. MKULTRA is still largely an unknown since the hearings exposed only the tip of the iceberg, and the victims have been intimidated into silence. If the full truth ever came out that the CIA systematically tortured children in government labs, their reputations would never recover. <br />Demands for air tight proof are impossible to meet as long as perpetrators are able to use the National Security Act in court. The only way air tight proof can be obtained is to break into Fort Meade, Army intelligence headquarters, and steal government documents. Even this may not work. Activists broke into FBI offices, and stole Cointelpro documents that led to multiple congressional hearings but no one went to jail. Cointelpro went dark for a few years, and then reemerged in the 1980's. Demand for air tight proof is unreasonable and impossible under the circumstances. We might as well demand spontaneous confession by mass murders. Rattle snakes don't commit suicide; you have to chop off their heads.<br />The case presents sufficient evidence of crimes against humanity. The weapons are proven to exist, there is a prior pattern of criminal behavior, credible witnesses have testified, and persons of interest are named who have developed EMW, written about how to use the weapons, advocated using the weapons, given the weapons to law enforcement, and participated in a cover up. In view of similar programs in the past that went undiscovered and unpunished a different strategy is necessary. An independent special prosecutor is needed, a Congressional Commission, and a truth and reconciliation commission. These three bodies should all aim for the Five Reforms: Open all secret archives, Disarm all EMW, a truth and reconciliation commission, an international conference to ban EMW, and an international bill of rights that is enforceable.        <br />It may be the case that EMW capabilities are too overwhelming for our 800 year old legal system to deal with. Military force may be the only sufficient answer to the problem at hand. If this is the case, then I recommend that the elite 704th army intelligence brigade be disarmed using all necessary force. Four goals to heal the damage done to our nation and the larger world and to make sure that these types of crimes against humanity never happen again. The Four Goals: End Secret Dirty War; Domestic Political Reform; End Nuclear and Conventional Arms Race; Scientific and Humanitarian Initiatives to End Disease and Hunger and Preserve the Planetary Ecology. The last goal is an ambitious new Marshall Plan designed to displace the role of militarism as the driving social and economic force in the world. What is at stake: Our world is facing more than the loss of a few thousand do-gooders, the future at stake and the freedom in jeopardy is our own.
