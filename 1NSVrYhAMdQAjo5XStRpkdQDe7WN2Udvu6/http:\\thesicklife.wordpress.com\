					<p>Hey, just wondering if anyone else still checks my blog out? For a couple reasons I have stopped posting on the Opiophile forums. I hope things get secured over there and that they are able to raise the money they need to keep the place running.</p>
<p>I need to invest in a new PC, but I am leaning towards getting a netbook. If anyone wants to donate one (netbook, notebook/laptop/etc., PDA, tablet computer, anything really), get in touch with me through the contact link. For the near future I may end up having to resort to some drastic measures to get online.</p>
<p>Trying to get some extra money lately, legitimately I might add. I&#8217;ve been working on making tinctures and growing some interesting rare plants that are not currently available (some not widely available, others not available at all). Not too long ago I made some Bitter Orange (Citrus aurantium) tincture, an ephedra type herb containing synephrine, N-methyltyramine, octopamine, and other compounds. Going to make some Catnip (Nepeta cataria) tincture. It would be interesting to experiment more with catnip and different extractions of it. Nepetalactone, the main compound found in many Nepeta species, may cause analgesia and sedation through the opioid system, likely the kappa and delta receptors.</p>
<p>I am working on the newsletter that was mentioned in my last blog post. I&#8217;m considering turning it into a full-fledged magazine. If anyone likes the idea of a zine let me know. I am willing to accept submissions for articles on plant based medicines/drugs, plants that contain natural cannabinoids (besides cannabis), opioids (besides opium), phenethylamines, etc, medical marijuana, &#8220;designer&#8221; drugs, or anything you think might fit in.</p>
<p>Currently I&#8217;ve found that a very common tree that grows throughout the US may contain a cannabinoid in it. I am currently growing another species that contains the same compound and has other interesting things in it and appears to be safe to consume, whereas this tree may contain other unwanted compounds and may not be as safe as the other species.</p>
<p>So readers, let me know if you are interested in reading about things like this. All of the money goes directly toward research on plant compounds, semi-synthetic, and full synthetic compounds that may be useful medically and otherwise. To get 1 issue donate at least $5, and to get a 1 year &#8220;subscription&#8221; (4 issues, its quarterly), donate at least $10. Bitcoin donations are accepted but you&#8217;ll need to contact me if you want to get issues of the newsletter/zine by donating with bitcoins. The research group I work with/co-founded is also accepting other forms of donations, for example a netbook or notebook/laptop is needed, as well as agricultural equipment (pH sensors, wetness meters, nutrients, etc.) and scientific equipment. If you would like to donate any computers or equipment to the research organization please get a hold of me. To contact me, click on the <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEN5YmhLOFNWcDVNekJGbVRZdVNpbEE6MQ" target="_blank">Contact link</a> on the right side of the page. It will take you to a form where you can send me a message. I would post the info on the research company here but I don&#8217;t think that would be appropriate. So get a hold of me if you are interested in the newsletter/zine, submitting articles for it, donating money, bitcoins, or equipment, OR if you are interested in helping or collaborating on research together.</p>

<p>Just wanted to let everyone know that the donation button on the right column was directing people toward an old account I no longer have access to. So if anyone has tried to send me donations, they were not received and that is why the payment never went through.</p>
<p>And speaking of donations&#8230; I&#8217;m broke right now, spent most of my money on some very interesting research I&#8217;m doing. I&#8217;m thinking about putting out some kind of quarterly newsletter to mail out to people who make donations of $10, or more, a year. In fact, if I get any donations for $10+ and you include your address I will mail you quarterly updates on the things I am currently researching and you will gain access to a special online page. Right now that research involves plants that contain opioid and cannabinoid compounds, and I am not talking about opium poppies or cannabis; these are very interesting legal plants and plant compounds. So any donations of $10 or over are eligible to receive these gifts for donating: the quarterly newsletter/zine and access to a special web site that will keep you more up to date, and go more in depth, into what I am researching. Donations of $5-9.99 are eligible to receive one issue of the quarterly newsletter as a gift. All of this research and info will be opened up to the public here in the future, its just that currently I don&#8217;t want to leave it out in the open until I am further along with the research. Plus this stuff isn&#8217;t funding itself. There are so many amazing compounds out there in nature, waiting to be discovered, researched, and used for healing, fun, and profit.</p>
<p>I can also accept donations through AlertPay.</p>
<p>And if anyone else uses Bitcoin, feel free to donate Bitcoins to me @ 1NSVrYhAMdQAjo5XStRpkdQDe7WN2Udvu6</p>

But I&#8217;m hoping to kick but the planet it&#8217;s glowing”<br />
-David Bowie</em></p>
<p>Lately I had been working to try and get medical marijuana passed in Pennsylvania and taking many interesting designer drugs. The JWHs and CP synthetic cannabinoids, stimulants like MDPV, desoxypipradrol, and dimethocaine. There are so many legal goodies out there, and they aren’t just fun but they are very useful in research. I had started working for a non-profit research organization that was studying cannabinoids, opioids, stimulants, and other compounds found in nature. Things were looking much better, though I was kind of lonely and bored in my free time. I was still broke so there were periods when I couldn’t afford JWH-018, stimulants, or even weed. Those times I would get through by smoking cannabis leaves, some were potent enough to actually get a decent buzz from, they came from good strains.</p>
<p>There are legal synthetic opioids out there, as well as legal natural opiates in nature. O-desmethyltramadol became available online but I wonder if stronger things would begin to surface. There are powerful tramadol analogs that would be completely legal and highly profitable.</p>
<p>Some states got a case of drug paranoia when JWH and spice and k2 started getting press. Kansas even proposed to ban it during the same week that medical marijuana legislation was proposed, the hypocrisy was amazing. At least it was the states throwing a fit and not the feds. Other countries like the UK and Germany had already banned some of the new synthetic drugs. Red Bull Simply Cola was even banned in Germany recently. They discovered it contained trace amounts of cocaine. Its a delicious drink, I really like it. I hope that the almost-infinite amount of new synthetics and new natural compounds underline the futility of the drug war. They can ban them and new ones will be made and discovered.</p>
<p>My poppy crop was doing great early in the season but it suffered from a small period of no water. Some still survived, I should have took more care of them, indoor poppies seem to be better off, in my experience. Though that is likely only because it was hard to not remember to water them.</p>

					<p>Ok, so I think I will finally start this back up. I had gotten a laptop and was planning on writing regularly, and I was helping my friend with AIDS grow cannabis and opium. I stayed there for a couple years, but my friend was a little psychotic, so I moved out, the laptop got broke too.</p>
<p>But lately I&#8217;ve been working to get medical marijuana laws passed and researching plants that contain phyto-opioids and phytocannabinoids. There are many plants that look promising but many are hard to find a source for seeds/spores or material.</p>
<p>I really will start updating more, I hope my writing style gets back into the same rhythm, but better. For a while I was in a relationship, but it was kind of shitty, at times way too shitty. But now I am single again and much happier. Most of my friends have moved away or moved on or just aren&#8217;t around for other reasons, so the adventures have been limited to research but not totally. I will try and write some of the crazy stuff down. I&#8217;m hoping to get enough money together to go down to Puerto Rico to investigate 2 species that contain cannabinoids and one contains a stimulant.</p>
<p>My chemical situation has improved. During the relationship I was in, I took lots of different goodies, but most of the time I was sick. After I moved out for good I finally got on to a steady dose of methadone, tramadol, and percocet. I&#8217;ve been experimenting with the new cannabinoid and stimulant reasearch chemicals. Lately though I&#8217;ve been stuck smoking cannabis leaves. Cannabinoids and opioids share so much in common, they share the same pathway in the brain.</p>
<p>Well I&#8217;ll keep you guys updated. I really appreciate all the nice comments and am really kind of surprised that there were that many people who looked forward to my stories.</p>
<p>Later!</p>

					<p>It has been too long since I&#8217;ve wrote anything. I finally left the &#8220;farm&#8221; and will be writing about how my crops went. I also have plans on writing about brewing and tinctures. There might even be an audio blog added. I also have some interesting information on the drug ondanestron, an anti-nausea drug that is a 5-HT3 antagonist which recently was discovered to control opiate withdrawal and tolerance to opiates. For now I plan on writing a few pieces for a new punk zine and doing some political activism. If you live in Pennsylvania, PLEASE contact your local state representative and ask them to support HB 1393, the bill that would legalize medical marijuana in PA. So in the next week or so I plan on adding a big post.</p>

					<p>Never underestimate the unfathomable depths of stupidity.</p>
<p>Biden should crush Pallin in the Vice Presidential debate. As much as I absolutely dislike and despise Biden&#8217;s liberal and anti-gun positions, there seems to be no question he should be able to run circles around Pallin&#8217;s permafrozen airheadedness.</p>
<p>It would be funny and predictable if the VP debate gets higher TV ratings than the first presidential debate between McCain and Obama did. Nothing could be more pointless, and usually, most often traditionally ignored, than a Vice Presidential debate.</p>
<p>On another subject, I have come across a great brew. I’ll post the recipe but here is a glimpse at the ingredients list: cannabis, poppy seeds, wormwood, coffee, cinnamon, nutmeg, and maybe some other psychoactives. May have more of a beer hybrid than a wine but to say the least it is a very interesting recipe. More on that soon.</p>

					<p><em>&#8220;They ought to be disappointed in Ron Paul. Endorsing a theocratic candidate ["constitution" party candidate Chucky Baldwin] makes little sense whatsoever. What we’re trying to do is what we hoped Ron Paul would have done, which is to provide true focused leadership.&#8221;</em><strong> -Bob Barr, 2008 Libertarian Party candidate</strong></p>
<p>Ron Paul has basically given a defacto endorsement to the theocratic &#8220;constitution&#8221; party candidate Chuck Baldwin. I think for anyone who actually believed in Paul&#8217;s platform or in libertarian ideas in general should vote for the libertarian party, if only to give the party more numbers.<br />
The &#8220;constitution&#8221; party reads like the libertarian party, EXCEPT, they are still drug warriors, they say there can be no debate on abortion, and their charter names the lord, even actually states Jesus Christ, jesus christ!</p>
<p><em><strong>The Constitution Party gratefully acknowledges the blessing of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ as Creator, Preserver and Ruler of the Universe and of these United States.</strong></em></p>
<p>So unless you are fortunate enough to live in Louisiana where there will be the option to vote for a Ron Paul / Barry Goldwater Jr under the party the Louisiana Taxpayers Party, or if he should appear on any other ballot as a pre-approved choice, you should vote for BOB BARR THE LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATE, NOT RON PAUL&#8217;S BUDDY CHUCK &#8220;THEOCRACY&#8221; BALDWIN.</p>
<p>REMEMBER: The libertarian party has for over a year been trying to GIVE Ron Paul the nomination. Even after the republican primaries he had ample time to accept the presidential (and as recent as a few weeks ago) the vice presidential candidacy of the libertarian party which has the third largest base and should have ballot access in 47-49 states.</p>
<p>RON PAUL BLEW IT.<br />
HE CLAIMED TO BE GIVING US CHOICE AND SPREADING &#8220;HIS&#8221; MESSAGE but now Ron Paul is saying,<br />
<em>&#8220;It is not against the law to participate in more then one political party. Chuck Baldwin has been a friend and was an active supporter in the presidential campaign….<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>I’ve thought about the unsolicited advice from the Libertarian Party candidate, and he has convinced me to reject my neutral stance in the November election. I’m supporting Chuck Baldwin, the Constitution Party candidate.&#8221; -Ron Paul<br />
</em><br />
Even though I personally do not trust Bob Barr and have zero faith in him, he had the potential to bring the votes and funds in IF the Paul had pushed his influence in the right direction. Instead Paul wasted his time pulling a bullshit press conference that was 50% Ralph Nader mental masturbation and in the end, ended up endorsing a candidate and party whose platform is THEOCRATIC just because Bob Barr wasn&#8217;t into the whole, &#8220;any 3rd party vote is a vote for change&#8221; BS. I still totally believe in what he TRIED to do, but in the end it seems this revolution may have accomplished NOTHING for giving America a real choice on the ballot in a year we absolutely need more than McBama and O&#8217;Cain.</p>
<p><span>Addendumb&#8230; To anyone that gives a shit anymore, PLEASE REPOST THE ABOVE and the below  any typos, grammatical mishaps, and rants may be excused on the fact I haven&#8217;t slept in like 80 hours and I&#8217;m still pushing on. -The Hacha Cha</span></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry I&#8217;m still on a strict drug and alcohol intake regimen, as you&#8217;d know if you are regular reader.</p>

				<small>April 30, 2008 </small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>It was mid-December when I met Joan. Joan was a transgendered girl, ie a chick with a dick. I was at a bar with some friends and Joan approached the Katie, the girl who had taken me out that night with her friend. Joan asked if I was bi or straight or what and a few minutes later she came over and talked to me. I honestly didn’t know Joan was transgendered. In fact Katie didn’t realize Joan was transgendered until a few weeks afterwards. Joan and I ended up going over to a table by ourselves and she ended up asking me what I did and asked if I smoked weed. “Do you,” I asked before answering. “Yeah, I love it”</p>
<p>“Me too actually.”</p>
<p>“You holding?”</p>
<p>“No, I wish.”</p>
<p>“Yeah if I had some we could go outside and smoke a bowl.”</p>
<p>Before my friends were ready to leave Joan asked me if she could have a kiss. “Sure, why not?” We exchanged screenames  and I went home and checked out her myspace. That was when I discovered that Joan was transgendered. The next day we started chatting and I found out she was HIV positive and had Hep C. She told me she had been addicted to opiates for years. At the time she was 28 and had started with darvocet at the age of 14. She came down with a friend of hers, he turned out to be very flamboyantly gay. I have nothing against homosexuals, but I do think some gays try to live up to a stereotype instead of just being themselves. In fact I believe most homosexuals are bisexual in some way. Kinsey was probably infinitely more accurate with his sexuality scale than the narrow pigeonhole classification system of exclusively straight, bi, or gay.</p>
<p>So Joan and her friend took me back to their places and we hung out and smoked some weed. It turned out Joan had just inherited some cannabis plants that had been abandoned by their original owner. I guess he had reason to think someone he had pissed off was going to call the law on him. Out of nowhere Joan asked me if I would move in. “I’m really lonely by myself out here.”  I thought for a little while and at the time it seemed like farming cannabis and opium would be an adventure and me and Joan seemed to get along fine. So I decided to move out into the middle of nowhere for a little while with Joan.</p>
<p>The plants were huge and there were at least 30 of them, most of them being several feet tall. I started adding better lighting, adding nutrients, and generally reading everything I possibly could on growing cannabis. I became the garden’s caretaker, but what were Joan’s intentions? At first I couldn’t tell if she wanted anything more than friendship and someone to hang out with and help him grow pot.</p>
