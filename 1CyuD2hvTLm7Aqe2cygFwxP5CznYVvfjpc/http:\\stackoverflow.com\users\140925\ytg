I'm a code monkey with little experience in JavaScript, jQuery, .NET Compact Framework 2.0 (C#), PHP, Zend Framework, Java EE stuff (Struts 1.x, Hibernate), Android Java, SQLite, .NET Framework (C#), and Delphi, and a very little experience in ASP.NET (C#), Visual Basic 6, PL/SQL, T-SQL, C, C++, and almost nothing at all in Ruby and Python.
Currently working with Java EE and Struts.
