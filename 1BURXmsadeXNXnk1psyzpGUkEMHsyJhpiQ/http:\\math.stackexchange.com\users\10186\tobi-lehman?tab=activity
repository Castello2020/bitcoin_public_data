Optimizing interest for a set of debt payments
However, depending on the principal, you may be able to completely pay off some of the lower-interest loans first, then re-allocate some of that money to the higher interest loans. I'm not totally convinced.

Binary operations defined on sets of groups?
I will look for some structural feature that gives a unique integer between 0 and n-1, this sounds like a straightforward approach.

@ccc Intersection on subgroups of the same order, not arbitrary groups.

Binary operations defined on sets of groups?
@SrivatsanNarayanan Yes! For n=32, the number of isomorphism classes is 51, this is the smallest n with the property that the number of isomorphism classes is at least n. After 32, there is 48, 64, 96, 128... you can see where I'm going with this. I want to see if I can construct a group that is isomorphic to one of its elements. I want it to contain itself (up to isomorphism)

Let's assume $n \in \mathbb{N}$, I am only considering finite groups. The number of isomorphism classes is at most $n!$, so $m$ is defined and finite.

Oh yes, I didn't think of that. However, I'd like to have an operation that has the properties of associativity, identity and inverses. Any thoughts?
