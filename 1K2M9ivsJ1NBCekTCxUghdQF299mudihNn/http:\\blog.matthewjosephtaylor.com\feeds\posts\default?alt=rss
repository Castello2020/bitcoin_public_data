This is just so evil I am flabbergasted (what an awesome word!)! &amp;nbsp;Like I&#39;m not really sure I&#39;m seeing what my eyes are telling me I&#39;m seeing. &amp;nbsp;If you use labels in your code then you, my friend, are an idiot and you should just stop programming now while you still have a few good years left. Here is a hint: &amp;nbsp;most methods should be less than 5 (FIVE) lines long. &amp;nbsp;If you have the space to put in a label then you are already doing something wrong. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I love the little note in the spec concerning why they STUPIDLY and WRONGLY and EVILY decided they wanted to include this REALLY BAD IDEA: &amp;nbsp;&quot;Labels should be avoided by programmers at all costs. The motivation for including labels in the language is primarily making Dart a better target for code generation.&quot; &amp;nbsp; In other words they knew it was a bad idea at the time and did it anyway, because at some point there might be a machine that might maybe possibly at some day in the far future maybe decide it wants to generate some really truly horribly nasty machine generated code. &amp;nbsp;Wow. &amp;nbsp;Like I said I&#39;m just stunned by this.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;assert:&lt;/b&gt; &amp;nbsp;I like the idea. &amp;nbsp;I like the keyword. &amp;nbsp;I don&#39;t like that they aren&#39;t evaluated in &#39;production mode&#39;. &amp;nbsp;Pre and post conditions to a function are an awesome concept. &amp;nbsp;For the 0.001% of the code that is actually performance critical then comment these guys out in PD or surround them with isDebug() or something like that.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;imports and includes? &lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;eck! &amp;nbsp;Just have one and create a convention. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other things I like:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;semi-colons are mandatory!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Functions appear to be first-class citizens&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;main() method!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;yummy closures&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;can create functions without a &#39;function&#39; keyword.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other things I don&#39;t like:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Code repository is subversion ? &amp;nbsp;Any modern open source project has to be in git, or I&#39;m already kind of wary of it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;The whole include/import thing and the lack of namespaces. &amp;nbsp;Java did this right with the domain thing, really that is the thing to copy here. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;d love to see something like:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;require (com.acme.Widget &amp;gt;= 1.5, &amp;nbsp;&#39;http://optional.place.to.load.widget&#39;) {&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;// I don&#39;t like to type&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;var Widget = com.acme.Widget;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Then have a nice default place to load widgets from like /script/${full.package.name}-${version}.dart&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;That really isn&#39;t that hard now was it?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Things lacking:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Library ecosystem. This is THE problem of all languages right now IMHO, and there is no reason why the library dependency resolution/discovery mechanism can&#39;t be &#39;baked&#39; into the language. &amp;nbsp; Syntax is cool, but code is king.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Again just a few simple conventions, or a bit of thought could make all the difference. &amp;nbsp;A central repository would be the obvious thing (like CPAN/RubyGems for instance). &amp;nbsp;However that is kind of old-school (but still a billion times better than nothing).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;My dream system would probably resemble something closer to github, but with some mechanism for voting (maybe a cross between github and stackoverflow?)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Final Thoughts:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Damn it I really &lt;i&gt;didn&#39;t&lt;/i&gt; want to like this language! &amp;nbsp;Javascript is the obvious web language, and although it isn&#39;t perfect, it is like 95% perfect (tackle the namespace issue, and get rid of the weird way &#39;this&#39; is handled and it would be more like 99% perfect).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;But Dart is very, very sexy. &amp;nbsp;Such a wonderful blend of the best of javascript and Java. &amp;nbsp;After spending a couple of hours going over it I have to say I&#39;m fairly impressed. &amp;nbsp;The only obvious &#39;missed the boat&#39; thing is the lack of namespaces for libraries.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;I could definitely see myself getting attached to Dart if I&#39;m not careful. &amp;nbsp;It will come down to the VM implementations and how widely available they become. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://blog.matthewjosephtaylor.com/2011/10/thoughts-on-googles-dart-programming.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Matt Taylor)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1348390458703889218.post-1695264777702409230</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Oct 2011 17:46:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2011-10-06T10:46:07.223-07:00</atom:updated><title>Steve Jobs</title><description>One of my hero&#39;s died today. &amp;nbsp;It was expected, but is nevertheless a sad day.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is a moment for pause and reflection.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Time is short, every moment alive is a precious gift, but it is so damned easy to forget that simple truth. &amp;nbsp;The problem with an abundance of something is that one gets used to it. &amp;nbsp;One takes it for granted. &amp;nbsp;One starts to feel entitled. &amp;nbsp;Time works that way as well. &amp;nbsp;One gets lazy, and starts to loose focus, because there will always be &#39;tomorrow&#39;, because there have been so, so many yesterdays. &amp;nbsp;But no tomorrow is&amp;nbsp;guaranteed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I get the feeling that Jobs never lost sight of this fact. &amp;nbsp;He pushed, and kept pushing, and never stopped until he&amp;nbsp;literally&amp;nbsp;had nothing left.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Too achieve anything requires focus, and I think that is what in the end Jobs means to me. &amp;nbsp;Focus. &amp;nbsp;The following blog post I think captures this aspect of Jobs the best.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/2011/10/universe_dented_grass_underfoot&quot;&gt;http://daringfireball.net/2011/10/universe_dented_grass_underfoot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I don&#39;t know what Steve Jobs the real flesh and blood person was like. &amp;nbsp;So to me he is (and sadly now will remain) a mythical iconic figure. &amp;nbsp;A person I admire. &amp;nbsp;A sort of hero. &amp;nbsp;A man who proved with actions and results, what others only talk about, and showed what was possible.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I will miss you Steve Jobs, but in those dark trying moments of life I will remember your example. &amp;nbsp;Thank you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://blog.matthewjosephtaylor.com/2011/10/steve-jobs.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Matt Taylor)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1348390458703889218.post-3136728551817774399</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2011 00:43:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2011-08-25T17:56:58.863-07:00</atom:updated><title>How To Have Fun</title><description>&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step one:&amp;nbsp;

Let go of the Future.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;It is seductive to think that there are ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ futures.&amp;nbsp; Futures that are ‘good’ and futures that are ‘bad’.&amp;nbsp; Futures worthy of desire.&amp;nbsp; Futures that I need to put some serious thought into finding, and perhaps one special future that is calling my name.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Unfortunately that is total bullshit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;All futures are the same.&amp;nbsp; I won’t be satisfied in any of them.&amp;nbsp; True, I will be dissatisfied about different things, but I will generally be about as dissatisfied as I currently am at the present moment. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;There is even empirical research backing up the idea that no matter what their circumstances (and even if those circumstances change dramatically either positively, or negatively) people have a ‘set point’ of happiness.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;All possible futures I could have are all going to wind up in more or less the same place:&amp;nbsp; I’m unsatisfied at the present moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Bottom line: No particular future is worthy of desire.&amp;nbsp; The future is a commodity.&amp;nbsp; It’s difficult to distinguish one future from another, so choose one with the same care as choosing any other commodity item (like a bag of sugar at the supermarket):&amp;nbsp; Look for one that isn’t obviously damaged, but don’t put a lot of time/effort in choosing the ‘best’ one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step three: Enjoy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Simply enjoy the present moment.&amp;nbsp; Don’t be concerned about the future consequences.&amp;nbsp; Know that you are going to end up in the same place regardless, so take the time to enjoy the trip.&amp;nbsp; Go with your gut.&amp;nbsp; Not that your gut is ‘right’, go with it because it’s yours, and if the destination is the same either way, why not?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://blog.matthewjosephtaylor.com/2011/08/how-to-have-fun.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Matt Taylor)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1348390458703889218.post-3181192901404329654</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2011 06:41:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2011-08-06T15:28:58.493-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">bitcoin</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">economics</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">government</category><title>Bitcoin: Why it Matters More than the US Debt</title><description>In the beginning there was poverty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one day our species started cooperating with each other, and we developed barter. You have fish, I have grain, we each want what the other has: lets make a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few moons later, people recognized that some barter goods were commonly desired by many people. &amp;nbsp;And because many people desired them, they became valued not only for their intrinsic value, but as &#39;trade goods&#39;. &amp;nbsp;You have fish, I have grain, but I want fur, and you want fruit: &amp;nbsp;we sell our goods to each other (and anyone else) for tobacco! Then we use the tobacco to &lt;i&gt;buy&lt;/i&gt; what we each desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many more moons pass, and some trade goods are recognized as being more universally accepted, easy to transport, and more&amp;nbsp;convenient. &amp;nbsp;Thus man&#39;s lust for gold and silver begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one of the most important inventions of all time happened: accountancy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon a mark in a clay tablet, or scrap of paper became &#39;as good as gold&#39; (because you could trade them for gold), and man&#39;s lust for paper began...well among a few anyway. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One fine day it was discovered that the gold really wasn&#39;t needed at all. &amp;nbsp;Since paper is more&amp;nbsp;convenient&amp;nbsp;than gold, few people ever traded it in. &amp;nbsp;And as long as everyone else knew that everyone else wanted the pieces of paper, the paper itself had value. &amp;nbsp;Tada! The birth of &#39;Fiat Currency&#39; like todays&amp;nbsp;&#39;Dollars, Yen, and Rubbles&#39;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came the computer and the internet, and together they changed everything yet again. One didn&#39;t even need the paper anymore. &amp;nbsp;The paper with marks became bits stored electronically on a computer somewhere on the web. &amp;nbsp;As long as you have the password to an online banking account you can buy anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is a dark side to the current Fiat Currency regime: &amp;nbsp;One has to trust that the guy with the printing press (digital or real) won&#39;t print out more money, and sad to say, no entity yet has lived up to this trust. &amp;nbsp;:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever wonder where all those extra dollars come from when prices keep going higher and higher? &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/data/M1SL.txt&quot;&gt;In 1959 there were $138.9 billion dollars total floating around. &amp;nbsp;Today there are $1947.4 billion dollars in circulation&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Note that this is using the M1 count of money (a relatively conservative accounting). &amp;nbsp; Those dollars didn&#39;t just appear miraculously. &amp;nbsp;Note that inflation of the monetary base doesn&#39;t hurt too bad as long as it is predictable (sort of like a faucet that leaks a small amount). &amp;nbsp;The &lt;u&gt;real&lt;/u&gt; fear is that at some point the US Government will simply decide to turn on the printing press to print its way out of its obligations (and with the latest financial crises, the US &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing&quot;&gt;proved to the world it was willing to go down that road&lt;/a&gt;, so it isn&#39;t even a theoretical possibility, it already happened).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also the somewhat darker side of having to utilize the services of a public institution like a bank or using a credit card, &amp;nbsp;to spend one&#39;s money. &amp;nbsp;There are always some transactions (like playing online poker, or buying certain psychoactive chemicals) that a powerful chunk of society feels is wrong. &amp;nbsp;And so pressure can be applied to stop those financial transactions by force of law (and you better believe those banks and credit card companies that want to stay in business will obey those laws). &amp;nbsp;This makes those transactions riskier and costlier to everyone (even those who don&#39;t participate). &amp;nbsp;Think about&amp;nbsp;prohibition, the rise of powerful criminal organisations,&amp;nbsp;and why that was not a happy thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there is privacy. &amp;nbsp;In my own mind I&amp;nbsp;believe&amp;nbsp;I&#39;m a pretty respectable citizen, however I don&#39;t do everything in the public eye (as a curtesy to others I shut the bathroom door). &amp;nbsp;And maybe there are even some things where my sense of morality doesn&#39;t line up with the powers that be (I think poker is an excellent game, one that tests one&#39;s ability to make good choices under pressure without all the facts, but some feel otherwise for one reason or another).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately humans are nothing if not inventive. &amp;nbsp;And so finally, so many moons after the first trade of fish for grain, we are experimenting with our first widely accepted &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;P2P&lt;/a&gt; currency: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bitcoin is unique in that it has proven that one can unlink a currency from the control of a central authority, and have it work in real world conditions. &amp;nbsp;There is no entity that can control the total number of Bitcoins that will be available. &amp;nbsp;None. &amp;nbsp;It is all based on math, and the&amp;nbsp;innovative&amp;nbsp;idea of a &lt;i&gt;publicly&lt;/i&gt; held register. &amp;nbsp;In effect, everyone watches everyone else, and so no-one can do anything nasty, like spend money that isn&#39;t theirs, or try to create more Bitcoins than the math allows. &amp;nbsp;It is early days yet, and while Bitcoin itself may eventually go the way of the Shekel, the idea of P2P currency looks like it is hear to stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why do I think it is so darn important?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put: it is the beginning of the end of large centralized governments, the ascendancy of a non-centralized economic systems, more power to the people in general, and there is no way to stop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is it the end of large centralized government? &amp;nbsp;Because it is likely to be the end of taxes related to financial transactions (which are most taxes, like income, or sales tax). &amp;nbsp;These taxes are relatively easy to collect now, when transaction data is centralized and controlled by a small number of institutions. &amp;nbsp;P2P currency destroys the need for these institutions, and thus makes collection much more costly. &amp;nbsp;Also, it destroys the ability of the government to &#39;steal&#39; money through inflating the currency (printing money), but really that is secondary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that it isn&#39;t the end of all government, just the end of big, far away government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concrete examples:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Payroll taxes: &amp;nbsp;I can agree with my employer to work for minimum wage in dollars, with the rest of my earnings taken in bitcoin. &amp;nbsp;If I am an&amp;nbsp;independent&amp;nbsp;contractor, not even the fiction of minimum wage employment is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Sales taxes: &amp;nbsp;I have a hard time believing that cash operated businesses currently report all sales transactions. &amp;nbsp;In effect, all financial transactions will be similar to todays cash transactions. &amp;nbsp;It will be up to the business to self-report, and internet-based businesses are likely not to report, and so will out-compete those businesses that do (similar to Amazon vs one&#39;s local Target store today only more so). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Business Income Taxes: &amp;nbsp;Businesses that take in P2P currencies will have the option of not reporting the income, or of over-reporting expenses (ala kickbacks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over time things like the above erode the governments ability to coerce payment, even from entities willing to pay (because those willing entities will soon go bust, because they won&#39;t be able to compete).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that certain types of taxes are still viable, but they are the most &#39;painful&#39; in that the government entities have to send out a bill and &lt;b&gt;demand&lt;/b&gt; that must be paid or else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Property taxes&lt;br /&gt;2. License taxes&lt;br /&gt;3. Poll taxes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So government itself isn&#39;t likely to go away, but it is going to shrink dramatically -or- will become much more authoritarian. &amp;nbsp;I could be wrong, but I just don&#39;t see the US government successfully instituting those sorts of controls on its population. &amp;nbsp;Which leaves only one other option: &amp;nbsp;a smaller government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine a government if you will, without the ability to coerce payment of taxes, or restrict who you do business with. &amp;nbsp;A government without the power to meddle with the economy in a significant way (No FED, no US Dollar, no ability to easily tax, no social security or other welfare programs). &amp;nbsp;That is a very different government than the one we have now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that because some dude in Japan named Nakamoto published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; with a bit of math in it. &amp;nbsp;Amazing really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there is the really cool stuff this new monetary technology makes possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. &amp;nbsp;Micropayments are finally viable! &amp;nbsp;Current bitcoin transaction costs are currently 0.0005 BTC. &amp;nbsp;That currently translates to around $0.005 (around half a penny).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. &amp;nbsp;Dramatically lower transaction cost for buyers/sellers, making all web transactions cheaper (that half a penny is regardless of the size of the transaction, unlike credit card transactions that usually are 1-2% of the total + $0.50 or more).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. &amp;nbsp;Non-human entities can make and accept payments. &amp;nbsp;Not only can your dog have a &#39;bitcoin wallet&#39;, but so could an&amp;nbsp;independent&amp;nbsp;piece of software. &amp;nbsp;Imagine that, a piece of software living out there on the web buying &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade#Web_Hosting&quot;&gt;CPU cycles&lt;/a&gt; to stay alive, and selling its services to the highest bidder. &amp;nbsp;The start of real artificial life, perhaps the genesus of our ultimate successors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. &amp;nbsp;True mesh networks! &amp;nbsp;Anybody with a WIFI router could become a temporary ISP to their neighbors, or to a passing motorist. &amp;nbsp;I would buy a few minutes of WIFI time for a few pennies, I imagine others&amp;nbsp;would too. &amp;nbsp;Add things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.22&quot;&gt;802.22&lt;/a&gt; and things start to get real interesting, real quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of that is just barely starting to nibble on the &#39;big picture&#39; of the change. &amp;nbsp;This is a fundamental reworking of the entire world economy and political landscape at a single stroke. &amp;nbsp;Sort of like the dawn of the internet, only faster and more dramatic. &amp;nbsp;In general, the world becomes much closer to the one imagined by the early cyberpunk writers like Gibson and Stephenson. &amp;nbsp;Way more wild west and just generally weird. &amp;nbsp;Harsher, but also more beautiful, astounding and generally more exciting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the future my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you liked this post please encourage me. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bitcoin address: 1K2M9ivsJ1NBCekTCxUghdQF299mudihNn</description><link>http://blog.matthewjosephtaylor.com/2011/08/bitcoin-why-it-matters-more-than-us.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Matt Taylor)</author><thr:total>1</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1348390458703889218.post-2388623463399708850</guid><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2011 03:53:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2011-06-11T21:14:03.332-07:00</atom:updated><title>Human Constraints and Software Development Best Practices</title><description>&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;I&#39;m&amp;nbsp;beginning&amp;nbsp;to see that some of the software development &#39;best practices&#39; that I&#39;ve adopted over the years (or aspire to adopt :) ) correlate strongly with some of the unique characteristics of the human mind. &amp;nbsp;My guess is that this isn&#39;t a unique insight but it is one I plan to explore a bit further.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;For instance,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two&quot;&gt;Studies have shown&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that humans can hold approximately three to nine things in their head at once. &amp;nbsp;This number varies somewhat according to what the things are and the person, but it is definitely very small and applies to everyone.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px;

margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having no more than three input parameters per function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having a function contain no more than seven lines of code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having a source code chunks (classes/modules) that fits into a single &#39;page&#39; in an editor (which generally restricts the class/module to containing no more than five to seven fields/methods).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don&#39;t_repeat_yourself&quot;&gt;DRY&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;principle (more &#39;ways&#39; of doing something eats into our Working Memory budget)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having a &#39;flattened&#39; class hierarchy (using&amp;nbsp;inheritance&amp;nbsp;sparingly and generally&amp;nbsp;preferring&amp;nbsp;composition).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In general creating abstractions/groups/blocks/chunks when the underlying number of elements goes much beyond five to ten.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;I think this should lead one to be more overtly&amp;nbsp;conscious&amp;nbsp;of taking Working Memory into account when designing and writing software, and perhaps more importantly give a more concrete foundation into why such best practices should be adopted.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px;

style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time&quot;&gt;beginning&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;there was &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;C&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;This was the first Great &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language&quot;&gt;Language&lt;/a&gt; to transform the modern era. &amp;nbsp;The strength of C is its portability and execution speed. &amp;nbsp;&quot;Portable Assembler&quot; is the magic phrase that captures its essence. &amp;nbsp;If you need to talk to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bare+metal&quot;&gt;metal&lt;/a&gt; directly, and you aren&#39;t concerned too much about the specifics of the hardware, this is THE language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with C is that its intended audience is the computer. &amp;nbsp;One has extremely fine control of the hardware, but with great power comes great responsibility. &amp;nbsp;For large complex programs that interact with users or other systems, the flexibility and control turns into a liability. &amp;nbsp;Also, as a language C lacks a way to create useful abstractions which makes it difficult to compactly describe higher-level concepts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years many languages have been built on top of C, extending the language while attempting to keep all the good things C offered. &amp;nbsp;The dominant languages (or language extensions) turned out to &amp;nbsp;be C++ and Objective-C. &amp;nbsp;The main benefit these languages offer is the ability to program in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming&quot;&gt;Object Oriented&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;mannor. &amp;nbsp;C++ in particular came to be the Great Language of the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C++ turned out to have problems of its own however. &amp;nbsp;One spends a significant amount of time focused on &#39;housekeeping&#39; rather than solving the larger problem, and it&#39;s object model in many cases led to a new set of complexity problems. &amp;nbsp;And so &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like C Java offered a new level of abstraction for hardware interaction. &amp;nbsp;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jvm&quot;&gt;JVM&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;was the key to Java&#39;s success. &amp;nbsp;The JVM combined with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)&quot;&gt;Garbage Collection&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;freed the programmer from many of the concerns about hardware. &amp;nbsp;And so Java became the Great Language of the late 90&#39;s through the 00&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Java the language was not free from&amp;nbsp;problems&amp;nbsp;however. &amp;nbsp;In a rush to make java perform well, the evilness of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_data_type&quot;&gt;primitives&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;were included in the language, and methods were demoted to second class citizens. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real challenge for Java is simply that the landscape of computing itself changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web&quot;&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;has gained dominance, and with it the abstraction of Machine/Hardware has been retired in favor of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOM_tree&quot;&gt;DOM&lt;/a&gt; tree and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture&quot;&gt;Services&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Today large applications run on the Web, and increasingly most people think of the Web as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system&quot;&gt;Operating System&lt;/a&gt; all its own. &amp;nbsp;And as C is to Unix, C++/Objective-C is to Windows/Mac, and Java is to JVM, Javascript is to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_operating_system&quot;&gt;WOS (Web Operating System)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a language Javascript has much to recommend it: &amp;nbsp;It is FULLY OO (no nasty primitives, try 1..toString() it works!) with Functions as first class citizens (allowing &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming&quot;&gt;Functional Programming&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp; It is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_type#Dynamic_typing&quot;&gt;Dynamically Typed&lt;/a&gt;, has &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)&quot;&gt;Closures&lt;/a&gt;, and natively supports &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expressions&quot;&gt;Regular Expressions&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s simplicity and elegance (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aptana.com/reference/html/api/JSKeywords.index.html&quot;&gt;keywords&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_syntax&quot;&gt;syntax&lt;/a&gt;) rivals C.&amp;nbsp;Not to mention that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop&quot;&gt;event-loop&lt;/a&gt; paradigm appears to be winning over the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_(computer_architecture)&quot;&gt;multi-thread&lt;/a&gt; model. That is the stuff it has had for years, here is the new stuff that has finally pushed it over the top: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks to Google&#39;s V8 (and Firefox&#39;s Trace/JagerMonkey) Javascript is now &lt;a href=&quot;http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/which-programming-languages-are-fastest.php&quot;&gt;Fast&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With the advent of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nodejs.org/&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Javascript now has access to the backend as well (using the same language for both the front and back end leads to all sorts of efficiencies from code re-use to ease of communication between client and server).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5&quot;&gt;HTML 5&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element&quot;&gt;Canvas&lt;/a&gt; tag, all things UI related are now possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All is not roses of course. &amp;nbsp;Javascript still has to get over some hurtles. &amp;nbsp;Hurtle #1 is probably the name of the language itself. &amp;nbsp;It has nothing to do with Java, and &#39;Script&#39; makes it sound like a dumbed down toy language or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language&quot;&gt;DSL&lt;/a&gt; which it definitely is not. &amp;nbsp;The second problem is also in a way what makes it exciting: Javascript is young! &amp;nbsp;Yes it has been around for 15+ years, but nobody really took it that seriously, so there is a lot of stuff missing that is being addressed by things like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.commonjs.org/&quot;&gt;CommonJS&lt;/a&gt; project. &amp;nbsp;There is still a lot of room to be explored, even in something as simple as programming style issues (what is the best way to specify a function associated with an object?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Javascript gets my vote for the Great Language of the current age. &amp;nbsp;It is the language that I personally plan on using for all future projects from iPhone development, to shell scripts, to of course web applications. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s extensible, flexible, and I think it has within itself the power to create and power a whole new world of exciting possibilities.</description><link>http://blog.matthewjosephtaylor.com/2011/05/javascript-next-great-language.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Matt Taylor)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1348390458703889218.post-682903696585077474</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2011 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2011-05-15T22:00:19.231-07:00</atom:updated><title>Simplicity Creates</title><description>&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;I think I&#39;ve finally figured out what I want to do/be when I grow up.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;A month or so back I loaded up the game&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.minecraft.net/&quot;&gt;minecraft&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for the fist time and my life changed forever.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;Minecraft is a simple first person &#39;walker / shooter&#39; type game. &amp;nbsp;At first glance one would most likely label it as &#39;childish&#39; or maybe even &#39;incomplete&#39;. &amp;nbsp;Both of those labels currently apply, but they also totally miss the point. &amp;nbsp;The simple fact is that this isn&#39;t really a &#39;game&#39; in the traditional sense.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;The reason the game touched me so, and I believe the reason why it has achieved cult-follower status is that it isn&#39;t a game: it&#39;s a creativity tool. &amp;nbsp;It will be seen as the first in what I believe will be a whole new generation of software tools, that will eventually unlock an astounding explosion of new creative works. (Hint: I&#39;m busy creating one myself (a software tool that is (which for me is also a creative work))).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;But that is almost besides the point.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;The real kick in the pants I got from this game was the &#39;meta-lesson&#39; of how this game/tool achieved what it has achieved. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;simple&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;Thats it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;That was the big &#39;wow&#39; moment for me. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;People create. &amp;nbsp;It is what we do that distinguishes us from animals. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s not language. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s not culture. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s not the fact that we walk on two legs. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s our ability to have two or more ideas bounce around in our central nervous systems and out comes something new. &amp;nbsp;Most of the new stuff is horrible and doesn&#39;t survive. &amp;nbsp;But every now and then if we bang enough stuff together, something good and and maybe better than anything that previously existed, comes out.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;It&#39;s all a numbers game. &amp;nbsp;It isn&#39;t magic. &amp;nbsp;It isn&#39;t that some people are &#39;creative&#39; and others aren&#39;t. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s simply that some people have a desire to improve the world. &amp;nbsp;That desire leads them to bang stuff together until something good falls out. &amp;nbsp;The key to creativity is being an efficient banger-togetherer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;This is where simplicity comes into play. &amp;nbsp;Especially simple&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;tools. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;If one is doomed to create a million monstrosities for every something beautiful, then it needs to be as fast and easy to explore the universe of the uglies as possible.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;Simple/intuitive things don&#39;t take up as much head space, or slow you down. They get out of the way. &amp;nbsp;If something is truly simple one doesn&#39;t even &#39;think&#39; about it, one is just magically able to quickly do whatever one wants to achieve. &amp;nbsp;Imagination becomes the only limitation. &amp;nbsp;Think it and it happens.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;So simplicity itself has given my life new purpose and meaning. &amp;nbsp;I see now that I am and always have been compelled to simplify the world around me. &amp;nbsp;Now it is time to be more focused and organized about it. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;I&#39;ve decided I am going to create a company with only one product:&amp;nbsp;simplicity. &amp;nbsp;I will&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;sell&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;simplicity itself. &amp;nbsp;I am going to be a simplicity evangelist. &amp;nbsp;I am going to create&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;simple&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;tools to empower myself and others. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;m going to provide&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;simple&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;services, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;simple&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;goods. &amp;nbsp;I plan on making a living doing this, but I think the real driver is going to be seeing what cool things other people create.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px;

jobs will now be open to mechanization. &amp;nbsp;Hopefully information workers (of which I am one) will prove more flexible than their blue-collar counterparts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be great fun for those of us who can adapt. &amp;nbsp;It will set free our creativity and allow us to create on a scale we can barely imagine today. &amp;nbsp;With an army of truly &#39;virtual&#39; virtual assistants what business or purely artistic goal will be out of reach?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will truly suck for those who are unable or unwilling to embrace the new environment. &amp;nbsp;The fact is that boring uncreative jobs are going away. &amp;nbsp;They will never go away entirely, but they will become harder and harder to find. &amp;nbsp;I also wonder how people who won&#39;t accept even relatively simple cultural shocks like the belief in evolution, are going to deal with &#39;people who are not human&#39;. &amp;nbsp;Will a future &#39;Defense of&amp;nbsp;Marriage&#39; act be&amp;nbsp;amended&amp;nbsp;to keep people from marrying&amp;nbsp;their non-biological partners? &amp;nbsp;And the most serious question of all: &amp;nbsp;what will this do to the tax code? :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really see this as a positive change for humanity overall. &amp;nbsp;We continue to free ourselves of tasks which in themselves don&#39;t lend much to the fun of being human. &amp;nbsp;Throw into the bargain that everything will get cheaper and better, and the future looks bright indeed (for those who are bold enough to change with the times).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I invision this as the beginning of the &#39;industrial revolution&#39; for information. &amp;nbsp;Steam power multiplied man&#39;s ability to multiply his physical labor. &amp;nbsp;AI power will multiply our ability to accomplish intellectual tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will you or I be up to the challenge?</description><link>http://blog.matthewjosephtaylor.com/2010/12/true-ai-is-almost-here.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Matt Taylor)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1348390458703889218.post-425116444164548464</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2010 05:24:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2010-07-14T22:24:18.379-07:00</atom:updated><title>My Current Top iPhone App Recommendations</title><description>&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;

style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;JotNot Pro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is truly one of those &#39;killer app&#39; applications for the iPhone. &amp;nbsp;It basically turns your iPhone into a scanner. &amp;nbsp;For a long time I&#39;ve searched for a note-taking device that will allow me ditch my notepad and pen. &amp;nbsp;Sadly nothing (not even the iPad with a stylus (I&#39;ve tried)) beats this thousand year old tech. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This app however, does such a good job of translating a photo (or set of photos) into a&amp;nbsp;readable&amp;nbsp;PDF (or image) via special filters, edge detection, etc., that I no longer think of pen and paper as evil. &amp;nbsp;It solves the problem of me having to loose my notes once I&#39;ve filled up a notebook, or loose access to them if I&#39;m away from my desk. &amp;nbsp;I simply go to my meeting, take notes like a normal person using the pen and paper. &amp;nbsp;Then immediately afterwards I whip out my iPhone, shoot the pages and process them. &amp;nbsp;In under a minute I have a nice multipage PDF sitting in my google docs (or evernote, or iDisk, or Dropbox) online storage/sharing service. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it works great for any document I happen to have in my possession that I want a scanned copy of. &amp;nbsp;Yes I could have always just photographed it, however, with the image processing this software does (things like auto-cropping the photo down to just the page itself), the end result is really very close to running it through my scanner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best $0.99 I&#39;ve spent in a long long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tomtom-u-s-a/id343289842?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;TomTom U.S.A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years my Garmin Nuvi has stuck with me, routing me through the mean streets and highways of Dallas, Tx. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;ve been very happy with it but it is time to move on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a fair amount of research and have been holding out to see if one GPS Navigation system for the iPhone would become a clear winner (or if maybe google would do turn-by-turn directions for their iPhone map app). &amp;nbsp;With the addition of iOS 4 and the ability for apps to integrate closer with the audio capabilities of the iPhone (pause currently playing basically) I found I could wait no longer. &amp;nbsp;It was tough to decide and their are a lot of cheaper apps that do navigation. &amp;nbsp;However, none of them have all of the features (live traffic updates, Google Local POI search, etc) that I dearly crave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bit the bullet and spent the $50 on TomTom. &amp;nbsp;So far I&#39;ve been very pleased. &amp;nbsp;I mostly listen to podcasts while traveling. &amp;nbsp;I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.proclipusa.com/&quot;&gt;ProClip&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;iPhone mount in my car that hooks into the aux-in port on my car stereo (so I can listen to music/podcasts on my iPhone via the car speakers). &amp;nbsp;It so sooo cool to have the podcast I&#39;m listening to pause, hear the navigation instruction through the speakers, then have the podcast resume. &amp;nbsp;Before I had to choose between paying attention to my podcast, or pay attention to the instructions...sometimes with poor results. &amp;nbsp;:) &amp;nbsp;My only complaint is that the menu system is a tad on the confusing side. &amp;nbsp;Not horrible but there is a little learning curve to figure out how to do things (like clear the current route) that should be a bit simpler. &amp;nbsp;All-in-all though I&#39;m very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pandora-radio/id284035177?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;

technology for their SMS network which &lt;a href=&quot;http://gthing.net/the-true-price-of-sms-messages&quot;&gt;must be costing them a fortune&lt;/a&gt;, since they are charging me like $0.50 per text message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-mobile-app/id284815942?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google on the iPhone. &amp;nbsp;It is the chocolate and peanut butter combination of our age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/evernote/id281796108?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;Evernote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google docs is great and all, but sometimes one just needs a really slick UI when entering a text note. &amp;nbsp;The real killer-diller however is the cloud aspect of this service. &amp;nbsp;Take a note anywhere (iPhone, laptop, web, etc.) and have it all magically synced and shareable from anywhere instantly. &amp;nbsp;They have even exposed their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.evernote.com/about/developer/api/&quot;&gt;web service based API&lt;/a&gt; to the world. &amp;nbsp;So lots of other applications are using them as a way of syncing/sharing data around (note JotNot above for instance). &amp;nbsp;I&#39;m currently using their thick client mac app on my laptop for note taking. &amp;nbsp;There is a lot of overlap of functionality between evernote and google docs. &amp;nbsp;However, sometimes a thick client is just faster and easier to deal with (I have a hot-key that brings up a new evernote notepad for instance) than a web based app. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus/id284885288?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perhaps my most useful iPhone app. &amp;nbsp;Don&#39;t tell the developers but I&#39;d willingly pay 10x what they are currently charging for this app. &amp;nbsp;There is also a desktop application that this can sync with, but you don&#39;t absolutely have to use it (but it is nice). &amp;nbsp;Where to begin. &amp;nbsp;I have an issue with planning. &amp;nbsp;I hate it. &amp;nbsp;Or rather I used to hate it. &amp;nbsp;I hated the rigid structure that most &#39;planing systems&#39; force upon you (once upon a time, for the period of a couple of years, I did the franklin planner thing (went to a class on it and everything)). &amp;nbsp;But on the other hand I also hate not quite knowing what it is a &#39;should&#39; be doing. &amp;nbsp;That nagging feeling like I&#39;m forgetting to do something that is probably important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disillusioned&amp;nbsp;and frustrated, for years I&#39;ve had the &#39;default&#39; planning system most people use: &amp;nbsp;a calender application with occasional email reminders sent to myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one magical day I discovered the book/cult/philosophy of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000280?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=matthe00-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0142000280&quot;&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Wow. &amp;nbsp;It was one of those rare moments of yearning for something, feeling fairly certain that one is searching in vain, &amp;nbsp;and then finding&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;exactly &lt;/b&gt;what one is searching for. &amp;nbsp;Immediately after reading the book, I searched for a software package that would help me utilize this system. &amp;nbsp;I eventually found Omnifocus. &amp;nbsp;I fell in love. &amp;nbsp;There is a learning curve involved here and I wouldn&#39;t even think of picking up OmniFocus unless you&#39;ve read David Allen&#39;s book. &amp;nbsp;But with a bit of effort I promise that those feelings of anxiety and stress (those related to planning anyway) will soon melt away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;

style=&quot;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;by Daniel Gilbert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I think I learned a thing or two about how the mind and imagination work, especially in regards to their relationship to the past and the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I learned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. &amp;nbsp;When imagining the future or remembering the past the mind uses the current moment to substitute and fill in the gaps (and there are a lot of gaps). &amp;nbsp;So we mistakenly believe the past and future are closer to what we are currently experiencing aka as &#39;Presentism&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. &amp;nbsp;When imagining the future one tends to think abstractly, but not realize that one is doing so. &amp;nbsp;The more distant the future, the more abstract (I think of what I want to accomplish with the trip, not the bag-packing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Two different kinds of happiness : emotional happiness (that cake tastes good!), virtuous happiness (Not eating the cake is the good thing to do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. &amp;nbsp;We can&#39;t think/reason about&amp;nbsp;absences (the dog who _didn&#39;t_ bark).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This explains a lot to me about why people so easily fall into the broken window fallacy. &amp;nbsp;Could be the one big thing I learned from the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. &amp;nbsp;We use our emotions during imagination to &#39;prefeel&#39; our futures. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately our current emotional state tends to override our &#39;prefeelings&#39;. &amp;nbsp;So we flavor our preferences based more on what we are feeling right this moment, rather that the &#39;prefeeling&#39; we are trying to feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. &amp;nbsp;We are blessed with a psychological immune system which strives to keep us up-beat and positive-thinking. &amp;nbsp;Our minds naturally attempt to fit the facts around us in the happiest way possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. &amp;nbsp;Our psych-immune system is only triggered if the&amp;nbsp;affront&amp;nbsp;to our well-being reaches a critical&amp;nbsp;threshold. &amp;nbsp;So minor annoyances continue to annoy (toe stubbing), but for major&amp;nbsp;traumas (toe loss)&amp;nbsp;we&amp;nbsp;actively&amp;nbsp;seek to look at it the best way possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. &amp;nbsp;The act of explaining (even if the&amp;nbsp;explanation&amp;nbsp;is poor) an event can make a very unpleasant event less unpleasant. &amp;nbsp;The same holds true for a very pleasant event (pleasant events become less pleasant). &amp;nbsp;Rationalization is a sort of emotional discharger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. &amp;nbsp;Our minds think that if something can be brought to mind more easily, then it is more likely (why people overcompensate for rare events that make good stories).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. &amp;nbsp;We tend to use the end of an event to summarize the whole (good movies with bad endings are &#39;bad&#39;, while bad movies with good endings are &#39;good&#39;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end of the book Gilbert finally reveals the secret to not making the&amp;nbsp;cognitive&amp;nbsp;mistakes that lead people to choose futures where they are unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I was a bit&amp;nbsp;disappointed&amp;nbsp;with this&amp;nbsp;secret. &amp;nbsp;He warns during the course of the book, repeatedly, that it is highly unlikely that we will take his advice. &amp;nbsp;However, the reason I&#39;m&amp;nbsp;disappointed&amp;nbsp;is not because his advice is impractical or I&#39;m unwilling to take it, but rather because it is so mundane and something that most people do all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drumroll please.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His advice is not to trust one&#39;s imagination, and to rather ask someone who is _currently_ experiencing the event what their opinion is. &amp;nbsp;That is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do this all the time: &amp;nbsp;movie reviews,&amp;nbsp;restaurant&amp;nbsp;reviews, heck, ANYTHING reviews. &amp;nbsp;There are opinion polls, and just plain old asking your friend what that new&amp;nbsp;restaurant&amp;nbsp;is like. &amp;nbsp; I have to say I&#39;m a bit&amp;nbsp;put-off&amp;nbsp;that the advice would turn out to be so mundane and widely used already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now after reading this book, I do plan on asking for (and taking more seriously) peoples _recent_ opinions of things (and discounting heavily the more the current moment in time is&amp;nbsp;separated&amp;nbsp;from event). &amp;nbsp;So it was a good book/advice in that sense. &amp;nbsp;It just doesn&#39;t seem to&amp;nbsp;warrant&amp;nbsp;the big build-up and mystery Gilbert gave this &#39;shocking&#39; advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now of course I&#39;m trapped. &amp;nbsp;I seem to remember enjoying most of the book (Gilbert is a pretty good writer and keeps the narrative flowing at a healthy clip). &amp;nbsp;However, that ending is pretty&amp;nbsp;disappointing. &amp;nbsp;He built it up so much I was really hoping for something kind of spectacular. &amp;nbsp;Some advice or trick, that even though I was&amp;nbsp;convinced&amp;nbsp;I wouldn&#39;t use, would at least help me appreciate the problem in a new light. &amp;nbsp;Good advice? Yes. &amp;nbsp;Revolutionary, unthinkable-to-utilize advice? &amp;nbsp;No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now that I know that the ending is unduly flavoring my memory what do I do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#39;ll leave it as is: undefined. &amp;nbsp;Maybe I liked the book and maybe I didn&#39;t. &amp;nbsp;:)</description><link>http://blog.matthewjosephtaylor.com/2010/05/book-review-stumbling-on-happiness.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Matt Taylor)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1348390458703889218.post-6186676187910460293</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2010 02:57:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2010-12-09T12:18:52.699-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">chair</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">computer</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">desk</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">mount arms</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">stripper pole</category><title>The Ultimate Computer Chair</title><description>I had a dream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That dream was to find the most comfortable computer chair in existence.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My standards were quite high.  I sit in in front of my computer for hours at a stretch.  Some days, except for bathroom breaks, I literally spend the entire day staring at my monitor, typing and mousing away.  (For the moment we won&#39;t go into if this is a superior way to spend my life or not, it is simply a fact. :) )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day it occurred to me that the most comfortable chair I own is my trusty recliner.  If only I could find a chair just as comfortable!  I literally sometimes fall asleep in this chair it is so relaxing.  Ah, comfy Mr. Recliner....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched in vain for a chair that I thought could match this standard.  But every time I found something, it never quite stacked up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then it hit me!  I had been looking at the problem all wrong.  I had already found my chair.  It wasn&#39;t a chair problem.  It was a desk problem!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of finding the perfect chair, I needed to find a desk that would support my already quite perfect chair (Mr. Recliner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I searched, and I modeled, and I thought and figured and schemed until finally at long last I have achieved my dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behold the Ultimate Desk AND the Ultimate Computer Chair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YdUb_W3E0uQ/S_8pTOw_o_I/AAAAAAAAAdo/d59X7qOVfeM/s1600/ultimate_office_chair.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YdUb_W3E0uQ/S_8pTOw_o_I/AAAAAAAAAdo/d59X7qOVfeM/s320/ultimate_office_chair.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who like the nitty-gritty details here is the bill of materials:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 X &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SJFS5A?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=matthe00-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000SJFS5A&quot;&gt;X-Pole Xpert 50mm Chrome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=matthe00-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B000SJFS5A&quot; style=&quot;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 X &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Ergotron-Wall-Mount-Keyboard-Arm/dp/B003B430M2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=matthe00-20&amp;amp;link_code=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ergotron LX Wall Mount Keyboard Arm - Keyboard/mouse arm mount tray&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=matthe00-20&amp;amp;l=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B003B430M2&quot; style=&quot;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 X &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Ergotron-Wall-Mount-LCD-wall-mountable/dp/B00358RFJ8?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=matthe00-20&amp;amp;link_code=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ergotron LX Wall Mount LCD Arm - wall-mountable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=matthe00-20&amp;amp;l=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B00358RFJ8&quot; style=&quot;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 X &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Ergotron-Laptop-Mount-Tray-50-193-200/dp/B003MNJMF6?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=matthe00-20&amp;amp;link_code=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ergotron Laptop Arm Mount Tray (50-193-200)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=matthe00-20&amp;amp;l=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B003MNJMF6&quot; style=&quot;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 X &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E7JUZ0?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=matthe00-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000E7JUZ0&quot;&gt;Ergotron Mounting Pole&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=matthe00-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B000E7JUZ0&quot; style=&quot;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;d also like to recommend getting a trackball.

width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; an idea has captured my attention: &#39;Meaning implies action&#39;.  I could &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;feel&lt;/span&gt; something stir within myself as I chewed on that concept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many stories can be told about the meaning behind a situation.  Relatively few understand that meanings are entirely personal.  Religion, Family, Nation, Fan Club, etc., all benefit from the fiction of &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;one meaning&lt;/span&gt; to a set of facts.  Put plainly it is a lie, but a lucrative one.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes feel pity, sometimes anger, towards the delusional &#39;objective meaning&#39; crowd.  Yet I also admire the beauty of their predicament.  Yes, they are witless puppets.  However, by living the unexamined life they are able to fully embrace the &#39;reality&#39; of the world they see around them.  Actors giving the performance of a lifetime to an empty theater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a Charlie Brown cartoon where Linus becomes aware of his tongue.  Noticing how it presses all &quot;lumped up&quot; against his teeth he loses the ability to ignore it.  His attention becomes completely absorbed by his inability to control his awareness.  Linus is trapped by the undeniable truth of his own tongues existence.  In explaining his predicament he also inadvertently traps Lucy in the same tongue-awareness-prison.  As I now trap you dear reader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar to Linus loosing the ability to disregard his tongue, I&#39;ve lost my ability to suspend my disbelief in regards to the meaning of life itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve become an actor without a script forced to improvise.  Unable, I stand awkwardly mute on the stage.  Viewing the empty chairs before me, my poor performance at least goes unseen.  I take solace in my own obscurity.  Ultimately I find myself becoming both boring and bored. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Meaning implies Action&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odd as it may sound.  Recently I find myself becoming more &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;personally&lt;/span&gt; involved in my own life.  Almost as though I am awakening from a long slumber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no neutral moral stance towards the meaning of my surroundings.  I become aware, which forces moral judgment and action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is the key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are levels, shades, and contexts of course.  Water is wonderful when I&#39;m thirsty, evil when it rains on me.  The very awareness itself motivates.  Awareness and motivation are irreducibly bound together.  It is impossible to have one without the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understood more than most care to know about meaning and morality.  What I had failed to appreciate however was that the two are one.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aha!  I have found a copy of the script.  Now I just have to play my part to the best of my ability.</description><link>http://blog.matthewjosephtaylor.com/2009/06/embracing-story-of-my-life.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Matt Taylor)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1348390458703889218.post-4647524518847453044</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2008 06:33:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-11-04T23:47:15.658-08:00</atom:updated><title>Well that was kind of strange.</title><description>I voted for the Libertarian candidate this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That isn&#39;t odd, I almost always align myself with the Libertarian party (I&#39;m an intelligent single white male working in the information technology industry, it is practically my duty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hesitated before I did so however.  I almost went with Obama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end however my ideals won over my sentiment, and for me that was the right choice.  It was the choice that for me contained the most personal integrity and I don&#39;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say however that I am proud of the person my fellow Americans helped to elect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that strikes me most is my sense of being able to relax a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Bush won in 2000, I felt that the country had chosen poorly.  But I also felt that Gore ran a very mediocre campaign and lost the election more than Bush won it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after 9/11, at the first mention of I Iraq I began to feel &#39;out of touch&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed very odd to me that so many people could even briefly be fooled by Bush&#39;s (or rather Cheney&#39;s) rather clumsily obvious push for war against a country that had zero to do with 9/11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really made me nervous though was the 2004 election.  It seemed very much like the election had literally been stolen.  If it was or wasn&#39;t is besides the point though.  The odd thing wasn&#39;t it being stolen, the odd thing was the lack of complaint.  The passivity with which the other side seemed to cave in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add into the mix a series of freedoms lost/American principles forgotten (no fly lists, Guantanamo Bay, official approval of torture, domestic spying, etc...).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the 2006 elections happen.  Americans seem to wake up.  However the Democratic party, even when given a pretty clear mandate still seems to be asleep.  The absolute refusal of the Democrats to consider impeachment, when the president had clearly gone a bit power-mad, was just fucking strange.  I mean come on, Clinton was impeached for a blow-job, Bush illegally wire-tapped the whole country!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets just say that I&#39;ve been getting successively more and more creeped out by the entire &#39;political system&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight however I feel something I haven&#39;t felt in a long, long while: hopeful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t know what kind of president Obama will be, but one thing I feel confident of is that, finally, the weird waking-nightmare of the last eight years is finally over.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking back all I see is destruction.  America fiscally, morally, and physically weakened.  The Republican party seemingly utterly destroyed, left only it seems with a core of bigots and religious fanatics.  Nobody won, we all lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to some future historian explaining to me just what the hell happened these last eight years and who we should send the bill to.</description><link>http://blog.matthewjosephtaylor.com/2008/11/well-that-was-kind-of-strange.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Matt Taylor)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1348390458703889218.post-5479582897536682796</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2008 01:34:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2008-06-17T20:57:34.255-07:00</atom:updated><title>And I was there...sort of</title><description>Occasionally I go into a news-blackout mode.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get interested in some project or topic, or work gets busy.  For whatever reason I stop paying attention to my various rss feeds and other media for at times a month or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I of course take a moment to breath and catch back up (RSS feeds/readers have made this process _so_ much more efficient!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today was such a &#39;take a breath&#39; day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So today was the first day that I realized that I will in fact most likely live to see a science-fiction kind of future after all.  I thought I would write down my initial reactions so that I can be amused by them later on in life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say I&#39;m a little shocked at how little &#39;buzz&#39; there is about it in the news.  I suppose that is a sign in and of itself that we have more or less reached the fabled &#39;singularity&#39;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is of course a fair amount of news releases and articles in the appropriate special interest websites.  For the moment however it seems that the popular culture hasn&#39;t quite caught on that _everything_ is about to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It means fasten your seat belt Dorothy, &#39;cause Kansas is going bye-bye. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--cypher &quot;The Matrix&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What am I talking about?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I am talking about the discovery published on April 30th, 2008 of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memristor&quot;&gt;memristor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember reading Issac Asimov&#39;s novels.  Like a lot of sci-fi authors he invented a few words to help him describe items that would exist in the future for which there was no direct analog today.  One that I&#39;m almost ashamed to admit I had always thought of as a bit &#39;quaint&#39; was &#39;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positronic_brain&quot;&gt;Positronic Brain&lt;/a&gt;&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to be a bit of a cop-out and failure of imagination to suppose that there was some magical &#39;material&#39; that would give the CPUs of his robots the ability to think like a human.  I mean a computer is a computer right?  Why not just call it that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well part of the answer is of course that there are fundamentally two different kinds of computer:  Analog and Digital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a certain point of view they are basically the same.  Given enough &#39;cycles&#39; a Digital computer can approximate an analog computer to any degree of accuracy required.  The reason that digital computers took off so fast compared to analog was simply that they are much easier to program.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out analog computers are however very good at evaluating huge numbers of parameters more or less in real time.  So they can be vastly superior at doing things like pattern recognition or balancing feedback loops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The things we usually associate with brain-like activity are a much closer match to what happens in an analog computer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A memristor is more or less a direct analog to a human synapse, and fundamentally it is a new kind of basic electronic device, so my apologies to Asimov.  It was my and not his failure in imagination (but I mean come on, what are the odds of something like this being invented?!?!?!? :) ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We knew of _three_ fundamental circuit components before April 30th and we&#39;ve used those three fundamental circuit components to create every single electronic device mankind has ever made.  Now we know of a fourth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just repeat that:  For the 200 odd years or so we have seriously been playing around with electricity/electronics to make things like communication satellites, cell phones, computers, electric motors, batteries and radio we have done so with only three of the four fundamental components of an electric circuit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That in itself is sort of mind-blowing...which is in a way appropriate because this is the stuff that the AIs will be built of in the next few years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thats right, not decades...years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people looking at the curves and crunching the numbers think that digital computers will be cheap/fast enough in 20 years or so to approach the computing power of the human brain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But nobody reckoned on this.  This changes the game entirely.  Instead of &#39;emulating&#39; an analog computer in the digital realm we will shortly be able to simply _build_ one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;memristic brain&#39;, it even has sort of a nice ring to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The articles I&#39;ve read have simply focused on little things like having instant on computers with terabytes of storage, and oh by the way, they also won&#39;t really generate any heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my mind though the AI angle is the only one that really matters.  We are on the very cusp of a culture-changing event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#39;ve decided to vote for Obama. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t like either candidate but I think Obama has the greater adaptability of the two and we are likely to see some _really_ crazy stuff in the next 5-10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And my prediction:  There will be at least one man-made non-human intelligence on this planet five years from now with the ability to pass the Turing test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My I be among the first to welcome our new memristic-brained-overlords!  :)</description><link>http://blog.matthewjosephtaylor.com/2008/06/and-i-was-theresort-of.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Matt Taylor)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1348390458703889218.post-8607384629631504139</guid><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jun 2007 18:45:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-06-23T12:12:02.747-07:00</atom:updated><title>Apple gripe:  Third time is enemy action!</title><description>Ok, I&#39;ve owned my macbook for several months now.  I use it daily and is my &#39;main&#39; computer that I use to store my personal data and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that overall I&#39;ve found the apple experience very pleasant.  There have been a few rough patches but nothing insurmountable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I just got through the latest upgrade-patch and I must say that I&#39;m royally pissed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally I&#39;m a pretty easy-going sort of guy but there is a limit, and once that limit is crossed it is sort of a trigger that flips me from peace-loving individual who tries to find the best in any situation to...SCREAMING MANIAC!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m sure we are all well aware of the quote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once is happenstance, twice is coincidence, the third time its enemy action&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I&#39;ve gone through apples software update process about 3 or 4 times, and it seems that each time it it resets all of my preferences to the factory defaults.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all of my preferences mind you...just the program preferences.  Ones like which IM client I want to use by default, which web-browser, things like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I was able to forgive apple the first time or two this happend because I assumed it was such a major update that they simply had no choice but to reset everything (perhaps they changed the very way they store preferences or something).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now I&#39;m no longer going to believe that.  I&#39;ve now come to the conclusion that this is simply a marketing decision to promote their own software.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THAT IS FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#39;t believe that mac-people put up with shit like this.  So what?  Now I have to go find some fucking program that backs-up my preferences and remember to run that program before the update, and then &#39;reload&#39; the preferences later?  Macs are supposed to be EASY!  They aren&#39;t supposed to force the user into all sorts of gyrations, or to confuse users who no doubt wonder why their programs no longer work after upgrades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#39;m not so naive  as to assume I have enough influence to change this.  However this is something that seriously diminishes my opinion of apple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not to the point of throwing my macbook out and returning to Linux, however I&#39;ve edged a bit closer to doing so, and that magic line is out there somewhere....</description><link>http://blog.matthewjosephtaylor.com/2007/06/apple-gripe-third-time-is-enemy-action.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Matt Taylor)</author><thr:total>2</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1348390458703889218.post-903339286177002389</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Apr 2007 19:28:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-04-15T14:54:31.309-07:00</atom:updated><title>Nothing is as easy as it should be. :)</title><description>I want to do a simple thing (or at least it seems simple to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want the &#39;mail&#39; command on my macbook to send email using Google&#39;s smtp server.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In effect I want the smtp server on the macbook to forward all email to smtp.google.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple enough right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well no, actually it isn&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ISP doesn&#39;t allow _any_ traffic OUT of port 25. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I think this sucks and is no way to run an ISP, but I can also see why they did this (to protect the world from their fucking idiot customers who run windows) , and that I&#39;m very much in the minority.  So I&#39;ll &#39;deal with it&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it happens google&#39;s smtp server really prefers TLS encryption on port 587 anyway (which isn&#39;t blocked) so I&#39;m setting up postfix (the smtp server that mac OSX uses) to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where the &#39;fun&#39; starts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that in order to get this working I&#39;m forced to generate/sign/put in proper place/configure postifx to find in same place (hopefully) various SSL/TLS certificates/keys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a pain in the ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not sure who came up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509&quot;&gt;x.509&lt;/a&gt; (ok, I looked it up, it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU-T&quot;&gt;these people&lt;/a&gt;) but &#39;ease of use&#39; and &#39;simplicity&#39; are foreign concepts to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily others before me have figured out the magic steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://souptonuts.sourceforge.net/postfix_tutorial.html&quot;&gt;this guys&#39; recipe&lt;/a&gt; for the most part (I ignored the fetchmail stuff obviously, and used the fink openssl97 package instead of &#39;rolling my own&#39;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then discovered that (joke of all jokes!) my postfix refused to connect to google&#39;s smtp server because my macbook didn&#39;t trust it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So on I go on a merry quest surfing the net until I run across &lt;a href=&quot;http://prantran.blogspot.com/2007/01/getting-postfix-to-work-on-ubuntu-with.html&quot;&gt;this guy&#39;s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then proceed to steal the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/c/ca-certificates/ca-certificates_20070303.tar.gz&quot;&gt;debian ca-certs package&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One little &#39;make&#39; command later I had the thawte cert that google&#39;s cert is signed with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I get the cute little error:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peer verification: CommonName in certificate does not match: smtp.gmail.com != gmail-smtp.l.google.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and postfix crashes ( I get a cute little meaningless crash-report and everything)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried fixing with a:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smtp_tls_enforce_peername = no&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;option in main.cf...but to no avail. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I&#39;ve spent hours on what should be a simple fucking little thing and I&#39;m pissed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Know who I blame for this mess?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The US congress of the 90&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of its stupid idoitic &#39;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography&quot;&gt;encryption is a weapon/export restriction&lt;/a&gt;&#39; stance early on in the late 90&#39;s, they threw a monkey-wrench into grass-roots collaborative efforts to solve the trust/crypto issue.  So instead of something user-friendly, sane, and simple we get X.509 with its top-heavy, control-freak, hard to implement, hard to configure approach to security.  (oh, and that same congress is pretty much the reason for SPAM as well, because almost nobody uses PGP to sign their mail (because PGP was illegal to export, so no-one could build it into their mail programs to make it user-friendly), so all mail is effectively anonymous/untrustworthy, which caused my ISP to block port 25 in the first damned place).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grrr....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the moment I&#39;m just going to give up on this route.  Prolly end up hacking my own &#39;mail&#39; command to use some library to speak smtp/tls directly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side...errr...there is no bright side.  There is only me, paying the price for other peoples seemingly endless desire to control things they are too stupid to realize can&#39;t be controlled.</description><link>http://blog.matthewjosephtaylor.com/2007/04/nothing-is-as-easy-as-it-should-be.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Matt Taylor)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1348390458703889218.post-7677444744320079430</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Apr 2007 00:59:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-04-13T18:53:04.470-07:00</atom:updated><title>Who won&#39;t watch the watchers?</title><description>Over on slashdot today was this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/city/dallas/stories/041207dnmetredlights.3051d8c.html&quot;&gt;interesting article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that police fear having to comply with traffic laws (which it seems they are now no longer &#39;above&#39;  thanks to such tasks being handed off to Big Brother (hi bro!) ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It got me to thinking about the good aspects to the relentless stripping away of privacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major problem with an Orwellian &#39;Big Brother&#39; isn&#39;t really the lack of  privacy, it is the creation of an unbalance of power created by the disparity of distribution of knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the records are open (the more open the better, which means of course ironically loosing even more privacy) then the &#39;safer&#39; we will all truly be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I say &#39;hurray&#39; for cameras every 10 feet that can see through clothing, and listen to our hearts beat in our chest.  &#39;Hurray&#39; for being electronically tagged.  &#39;Hurray&#39; for our bank records, library records, and phone records...as long as I get to watch as well, including those watching me watch!</description><link>http://blog.matthewjosephtaylor.com/2007/04/who-wont-watch-watchers.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Matt Taylor)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1348390458703889218.post-8648247636371414094</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Apr 2007 19:35:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-04-15T14:59:45.223-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">gmail</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">google</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">migration</category><title>Migrating Gmail account to Google Apps</title><description>Step 0: Buy domain  (personally I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.godaddy.com/&quot;&gt;godaddy&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: Setup &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/a/&quot;&gt;Google Apps&lt;/a&gt;, have fun changing MX and CNAME records! (don&#39;t worry they have very good instructions and the process only takes an hour or so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: Migrate existing Gmail account info to Google Apps account. (here is where the fun starts!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is actually something that kind of worried me about using (and eventually getting addicted to ) the cool features of Gmail that aren&#39;t &#39;standard&#39; yet in the rest of the worlds email systems.  In short:  how do I migrate my mail meta-data (aka labels) ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are mechanisms to suck the mail out using gmail&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol&quot;&gt;pop&lt;/a&gt; interface nicely described &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/hosted-the-basics/browse_thread/thread/5923bc4329c17837&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I can get the raw data out but I lose information (which is frankly unacceptable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well after several hours of screwing around with various &#39;hacks&#39; I&#39;ve discovered this little &lt;a href=&quot;http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/gmailer/&quot;&gt;ruby gem&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voila, all my problems are solved....except:  I can now download all of my labels and associate them with messages, I can even add new labels to new messages.  Unfortunately it only works with Gmail, not with google apps (so I can backup but I can&#39;t repopulate!).  I tried hacking it a bit but gave up as it occurred to me that this was a one time import, and that it would be more frustrating to get it working than to simply redo my labels by hand.  Also any code that I created could be made meaningless tomorrow if google decides to change any of its AJAX calls.  (This is why spending any time coding against somebody else&#39;s proprietary APIs is evil in my book).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think most people have given up on google coming up with a nice API to gmail which is a shame.  I&#39;m not sure if not coming up with a clean export feature for labels is &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;evil&lt;/span&gt; exactly but it sure isn&#39;t nice, and if they aren&#39;t going to come up with a nice API the least they can do is come up with some crappy CSV label:message-id thing like they did with contacts.  I can&#39;t imagine that would take more than about 1/2 hour to code and would give people a nice migration path from Gmail to Google Apps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know what?  Now that I think about it, not exporting label information &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; evil!  I really can&#39;t imagine why they aren&#39;t doing it.  I mean they are already using a crappy csv file for contact info, so I don&#39;t think it is that they want to &#39;hold off and do it right&#39;.  This is beginning to have the stench of &#39;vendor lock-in&#39; to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, can&#39;t fight all the worlds battles in one afternoon.  It seems that they are at least making something of an attempt at creating an &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/apis/apps/&quot;&gt;API for google apps&lt;/a&gt;. It isn&#39;t really that great yet but at least it is a step in the right direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it seems my google apps mail account has finished sucking all my mail from my gmail account.  I&#39;ve got a busy couple of hours of relabeling to do. :)</description><link>http://blog.matthewjosephtaylor.com/2007/04/migrating-gmail-account-to-google-apps.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Matt Taylor)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1348390458703889218.post-2230012028417866124</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Apr 2007 19:37:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-04-08T12:36:22.663-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">applescript</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">mac</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">osx</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">vi</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">vim</category><title>Vim and Applscripting fun</title><description>I love vi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I like my vi to be a bit more &#39;graphical&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not alone and so some nice people created &lt;a href=&quot;http://macvim.org/OSX/index.php&quot;&gt;vim for mac&lt;/a&gt; that actually uses Aqua (why the default vim installed with mac OSX doesn&#39;t include this is a mystery to me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I downloaded and installed and it basically just works except for one annoying little thing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It always brings up the window in the upper left hand corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a big deal except I like having my dock on the left and unlike most mac apps mac-vim doesn&#39;t seem to obey some window placement rules and so shows up with its left-hand side under the dock (which is annoying).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided a little applescripting was in order to fix this little annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off I&#39;ve got to say it is a bit of a pain in the butt to find what commands an app will respond to.  This seems such a basic thing that I&#39;m shocked that there isn&#39;t some great big site on the net which has this info. (there is a script-editor File-&gt;Open Dictionary menu item which is handy but only seems to work on those apps that are nice enough to include a dictionary (which doesn&#39;t seem to include mac-vim))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a bit of searching I discovered this little gem : &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/applescript/uiscripting/downloads/uiinspector.dmg&quot;&gt;UI Element Inspector&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/applescript/uiscripting/02.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it became obvious to me that there is a catch-all application called &quot;System Events&quot;, and hey what-do-you-know it is kind enough to have a dictionary in Script Editor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a bit of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=system+events+ui+element+inspector&quot;&gt;googling of &#39;system events ui element inspector&#39;&lt;/a&gt; turned up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.21/21.06/UserInterfaceScripting/index.html&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which helped me craft this bit of magic:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;tell application &quot;System Events&quot;&lt;br /&gt;   tell process &quot;Vim&quot;&lt;br /&gt;          set position of front window to {160, 150}&lt;br /&gt;   end tell&lt;br /&gt;end tell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The important gotcha here is that one has to turn on the &#39;accessibility framework&#39;  under &#39;System Preferences&#39; -&gt; &#39;Universal Access&#39; -&gt; &#39;Enable access for assistive devices&#39; (I have no clue as to why this isn&#39;t on by default).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the nifty osascript command which I discovered in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/macxtigerunix/&quot;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; I can then:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;osascript -e &#39;Tell app &quot;System Events&quot; to tell process &quot;Vim&quot; to set position of front window to {160,150}&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortuantely the window has to come up before I can tell &#39;System Events&#39; to move it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the final solution is a bit ugly in that I have to run a bash script to fork off the above command which takes just enough time for mac-vim to come up so it can be repositioned.  Maybe there is some sort of &#39;waitfor&#39; command in applescipt but my solution works &#39;good enough&#39; for the moment. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gvim:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;repos_gvim.sh &amp;amp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;/Applications/Vim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim -g $@&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;repos_gvim.sh:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;osascript -e &#39;Tell app &quot;System Events&quot; to tell process &quot;Vim&quot; to set position of front window to {160,150}&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><link>http://blog.matthewjosephtaylor.com/2007/04/vim-and-applscripting-fun.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Matt Taylor)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1348390458703889218.post-2267333141233871073</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2007 01:07:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-04-08T12:37:09.781-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">itunes</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">json</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">opml</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">xml</category><title>XML sucks!</title><description>First rant of my new blog!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Setup:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m migrating my iTunes install off of my windows box onto my shiny new mac-mini.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;iTunes has the ability to export my podcast list into &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great right?!?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing could be easier thanks to the ultra-portable XML standard that obliterates the idea of cryptic, closed file formats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I import the file into the mac-mini I get a wonderfully expressive &#39;unknown error (-50)&#39; message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, after trying to convert line formats using dos/unix/mac format, and a couple of other voodoo things I know to check for because I&#39;ve had the pleasure of dealing with several XML parsers I finally end up doing the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I exported out a simple OPML playlist from the mac-mini iTunes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut and pasted all of the &#39;meat&#39; from the winows OPML file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saved and re-imported into iTunes and voila, it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I know that it has to be a line-end-format issue because I actually chopped/pasted the windows OPML file to the exact text of the mac-mini OPML file and kept getting the same error.  Since, I haven&#39;t bothered to grab a hex-editor I don&#39;t know exactly what the problem is but I&#39;m sure of one thing:  XML files aren&#39;t supposed to care about end of line formating of crap outside of the tags!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This in a nutshell is the problem with this fucked up standard.  It isn&#39;t the idea of the standard itself that is the problem, the problem is that almost every parser &#39;cheats&#39; (usually because of re-use of existing text-file library reasons) when implementing it (by relying on things like &#39;end of line&#39; when grabbing text from the file).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;XML is the epitome of a top-down standard that looks great on paper but is a nightmare to use in the &#39;real&#39; world because programmers are basically lazy, and writting a &#39;correct&#39; parser is really pretty darn hard, and I can write something in a short amount of time that will work &#39;good enough&#39; to solve the larger technical problem I&#39;m wanting to solve.  Meaning that at the end of the day XML is just a touch too &#39;brittle&#39; to be the true universal standard it should have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I shouldn&#39;t be bitching, because the OPML file (broken as it was) was much more open than some binary file format.  I was able to solve my import/export issue, and there is no doubt that any attempt at open-ness (even if it is messy and harder to deal with than it should be) is way way better than the closed world of binary file formats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still it sucks and I for one refuse to accept it any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;XML might have been a good first step on the right path, but a better bottom-up standard such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.json.org/&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt; is going to win eventually just on ease of use.  At least that is where my money is at the moment.  It isn&#39;t as flexible or as rich as XML, but really I&#39;m thinking that might just end up being a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for now I say to hell with XML!  Long Live JSON!</description><link>http://blog.matthewjosephtaylor.com/2007/03/xml-sucks.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Matt Taylor)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1348390458703889218.post-2208970790233258169</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Mar 2007 16:37:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-04-08T12:38:15.500-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">boring</category><title>Fist Post!</title><description>From time to time it is good to have a general house-cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that in mind I&#39;ve decided to invest in a new domain name and basically start from scratch all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is fitting given my decision to &#39;come back down from the mountain&#39; and start participating again in larger society.
