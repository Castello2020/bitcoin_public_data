(Posted on 10/3/13 at 10:25 am to WikiTiger)quote:But what do you see as the upper limit for bitcoin valuation? I'm going to answer in terms of crypto currency in general. I stated a long time ago that I don't think it will receive broad based acceptance, but will rather be a niche commodity-esque transaction mechanism that will be popular with some coders and anti-monetarists. Nothing more, nothing less.Back to topWikiTiger LSU FanMember since Sep 200740721 postsre: So what happens to Bitcoin now?

I don't really know how to answer that because I don't really care for gold. So I don't seem unwilling to answer, I would say that I would view them differently because there is a (theoretical) limited amount of gold, which limits inflation (unless they start mining it from asteroids). But the thing is, when you get down to it, all forms of money are simply collective delusion, bitcoin included. So in that sense, they are the same.

Authentication requires tracing back to the block chain. Any mixing would have to be recorded for accurate record keeping. You can't mix the Bitcoins and erase all traces of ownership without compromising the entire system. quote:And I'm sure most vendors used independent mixing services as well. The taint on any coins used in SR transactions is probably long gone.I think it is absurd to assume that most vendors were more sophisticated than the creator of the Silk Road. Isn't the block chain a permanent ledger of ownership of Bitcoins? Taint does not attach to the specific Bitcoins, it attaches to any Bitcoins owned by persons who participated in illegal transactions. If John Doe was alleged to have participated in illegal activities in 2010 that earned him 50 distinguishable Bitcoins, then the feds could sieze any 50 Bitcoins John Doe owns at the time of arrest in 2013 as the proceeds of illegal activities. Once law enforcement knows who John Doe is, they can trace all his uses of Bitcoins with the knowledge of which specific Bitcoins he received from his illegal activities. They can analyze those transactions looking for other illegal activities that will spread the taint. The feds don't need convictions to seize Bitcoins. They need credible allegations, and once the property has been seized it is not easy for the owner to recover. I doubt the feds are going to waste time chasing five and dime criminals (recreational drug users) on Silk Road, but they will go after people who's crimes spread beyond recreational drug use.Back to topI Love Bama Alabama FanAlabamaMember since Nov 200731780 posts Online re: So what happens to Bitcoin now?

(Posted on 10/3/13 at 6:36 pm to BennyAndTheInkJets)quote:There is a clause in there that should make you worry about any chance of broad based acceptance. The CFTC is debating whether or not to put bitcoin under their supervisory remit, which in essence will place all exchanges under the scrutiny and regulation of the CFTC. Won't affect P to P usage obviously, but it will essentially deflate any chance of this getting wide acceptance in the form that you wish for it. This is what I was referring to when I previously made the point that regulators will not ever let something like this just freely go, and you said "if it happens then frick them for it". Hasn't happened yet but being debated. Bitcoin remitters are already being held accountable for AML purposes. The Treasury announced earlier this year that they view Bitcoin remitters the same as any other remitter in terms of AML compliance.Back to topLSURussian LSU FanBaton RougeMember since Feb 200579911 posts Online re: So what happens to Bitcoin now?

In other words, it’s Silk Road users’ Bitcoin. The FBI has not been able to get to Ulbricht’s personal Bitcoin yet. “That’s like another $80 million worth,” she said, explaining that it was held separately and is encrypted. just thought some of y'all might find that tidbit interestingBack to topLSURussian LSU FanBaton RougeMember since Feb 200579911 posts Online re: So what happens to Bitcoin now?

Granted, this dude is rapidly showing that, technosavvy aside, he wasn't really that bright but I doubt he was stupid enough to volunteer to the authorities that he had eighty million dollars in whatever that they couldn't get. Kind of like how every 18 wheeler packed with weed stopped by the cops has a "street value" of (unrealistic number) million dollars.

If they want to maximize the money they get for them then they'll have to sell slowly.
