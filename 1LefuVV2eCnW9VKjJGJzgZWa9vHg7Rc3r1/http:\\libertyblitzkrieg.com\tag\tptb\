The article covered the usual bases. Such as the fact the Obama Administration is the least transparent ever, how it has attacked whistleblowers and journalists more than all other Presidents combined, and how citizen journalists pose a threat to the corrupt and dying status quo. All things that we already know.</p>
<p>One of the people quoted in the article is Pentagon correspondent for the New York Times, Thom Shanker, who proudly noted &#8220;his employer has implemented rigorous standards to balance the security risks of reporting classified information with the public’s right to know.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>The Tipping Point</strong><br />
Serfdom has simply been pushed too far.  Globally.  What we are about to witness, incredibly, is not just a change in the way that one or two countries or even a specific region of the world operates.  No, what we are about to witness is a complete transformation globally, a change that I believe will be incredibly positive and will ultimately free us from the shackles upon the minds of humanity as a species.  The internet has allowed us to connect with one another in a manner never before possible, and this tool has permitted us to blast through the lies of the global elite that is desperately trying to hang on to control.  Whether it was the intention from the outset or not, what globalization has created is a very small class of incredibly wealthy people that are extraordinarily corrupt as a group and also above the law.  They are able to hide enormous amounts of money.  They are able to insider trade.  They are able to deal drugs.  They can do whatever they want, yet if anyone below them does the same they are prosecuted in a manner that resembles Medieval torture.</p>
<p>Many people say to me, “but Mike, aren’t things always corrupt, hasn’t it always been this way?”  To this I answer yes and no.  Of course within any complex societal and political structure there will be elements of corruption.  This is obvious.  However, there are cycles of corruption and degrees.  At some point, particularly toward the end of a cycle where globalization creates this “super corrupt class” of individuals roaming the planet doing as they please with us pawns, you reach a tipping point.  That tipping point has already been reached.  What we are witnessing now all over the world are merely the effects of that tipping point clashing with the corrupt global elite that refuses to budge an inch and reform even though it is in their best interest to do so.  No, they are so arrogant and criminal after decades of doing what they please with zero consequences they would rather attempt to implement a global police state rather than deal with the nightmare of their actions and make the world a better place.  Therefore, it is up to us, as a species, to reclaim what is our birthright.  Freedom.</p>
<p>As I wrote the other day on twitter, what we have today is not Socialism or Capitalism, it is Ponzism.  I am talking on a global level.  Basically every country and every region.  The biggest pitfall we must avoid as a species is allowing the global power structure to pit us against one another.  These guys don’t fight wars, they send you to fight them.  Don’t fall for it.  Their number one trick once things get bad within their own nations is to attempt to create a war.  This checks two very important boxes for them.  First, it creates a distraction for the general public and even makes them think that they are part of a team that needs to be cheered.  It’s like a big football game but with thousands or millions dying on the field.  Second, it allows the government to do pretty much anything they want in the name of “winning the war” or “national security.”  This is exactly why the “war on terror” was the perfect war for a <em>kleptocratic</em> elite.  It is a war with no end, so theoretically they can constantly claim war as an excuse for taking away civil liberties.  The problem for them at the moment though is that the American people are waking up to this scam.  Therefore, a larger and much deadlier war is in their best interests.  If it is in their best interest you can be sure it is in our worse interests. Therefore, we must do everything we can to prevent it.</p>
<p><strong>The Global Spring   </strong><br />
When the “Arab Spring” broke out early last year, many simply took it to be an outburst of rage and frustration from a region that has been shackled by autocratic regimes, lack of economic opportunity and cultural stagnation.  While it was the surge in global food prices that catalyzed the event that we now refer to as the Arab Spring, what I think was under appreciated and continues to be, is that fact that this was merely the first major outburst in what is certain to be a Global Spring.  The world’s population centers in general are increasingly able to identify with the frustration of those in the Middle East, so far removed from our psyches just a decade or so ago.  The most important thing for us all to realize is that there is another way.  We have infinite potential as a species to create, innovate and evolve.  We just need to collectively remove the gigantic jackboot from our face.</p>
<p>The number of events happening at the moment that provide evidence of the emerging Global Spring are almost too many to keep track of, but in the following paragraphs I will try.  I assume that most everyone reading this piece is aware of these events, but what I am trying to do is explain my thesis that all of them are essentially related to the same theme.  A massive global uprising against the current status quo and the economic and political systems that it has put in place.  People are becoming increasingly aware that these systems are run by the few and for the few, and the boiling point is being reached.  Community by community and nation by nation.  Let’s start with China.</p>
<p><strong>China</strong><br />
Unless you have been living under an economic rock for the past six months, you are aware that China is in the midst of a serious economic slowdown.  As I have said for years and continue to say, this is not a small bump in the road.  This is a major contraction.  Similar to the U.S., China had a choice in the 2008 slowdown.  They could have taken the hit and moved toward measures to rebalance the economy away from an over emphasis on investment and construction spend and toward consumption, but they did nothing of the sort.  Rather, they doubled down on their prior mistakes and mal-investments in an epic bet on the ponzi economy.  After a brief sugar high, this has now failed.</p>
<p>So with the economy back in steep decline, the authorities fear pumping massive stimulus in as they did four years prior due to their justifiable fears of sparking rampant inflation.  Meanwhile, thanks to social networking, citizens have become more aware of the incredible corruption and theft of their leadership, whether in the political or business world.  They are increasingly acting out about it and it is becoming so blatant that even China&#8217;s legendary control of media is unable to direct the plot.  The most recent outburst came from the Foxconn (a major supplier to Apple) factory in Taiyuan, China which employs 79,000 people.  While details are sketchy, most accounts point to the riot, which reportedly involved 2,000 people, being sparked by a fight between security guards and workers.  From the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/foxconn-riot-in-china-unlikely-to-be-the-last-experts-say/2012/09/25/1e6828b8-071c-11e2-afff-d6c7f20a83bf_story.html">Washington Post</a>:</p>
<p><em>When guards beat up workers from Shandong province, others from the same region fought back, igniting a full-fledged riot, according to the news agency’s (China News Service) account.   </em></p>
<p><em>The young migrant workers whose labor has fueled much of the growth of China’s economy and the global manufacturing sector have begun to change in demographics and desires. That labor pool is shrinking, according to experts, as workers from China’s provinces have become better educated and hold higher expectations for their lives.</em></p>
<p><em>Foxconn, in particular, has drawn attention in recent years because of its connection to Apple and the increasingly visible signs of unhappiness among its workers. A string of employee suicides in 2010 pushed the company to install netting to catch jumpers and take other steps.</em></p>
<p>Anyone think this is an isolated event?  Didn’t think so.  While this is the most high profile riot as of late, the New York Times in its coverage of the incident wrote:</p>
<p><em>Many of the protests this year appear to be related to the country’s economic slowdown, as employees demand the payment of overdue wages from financially struggling companies, or insist on compensation when money-losing factories in coastal provinces are closed and moved to lower-cost cities in the interior.  </em></p>
<p>Of course, China’s leadership was well aware of all of this before the Foxconn incident came onto the scene, so what is a good authoritarian regime to do?  Well, you attempt to direct the rage and angst to an outside enemy.  In this case Japan.  Zerohedge has a great report on the anti-Japanese violence and hatred that burst onto the scene recently.  The link to their piece <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/postcards-furious-china">Postcards from a Furious China</a> really says it all.</p>
<p><strong>Europe<br />
</strong>Like the Middle East, the Southern countries of Europe have been in and out of rage now for almost two years.  The most recent explosions onto the streets of Greece and Spain are particularly disturbing since the inept clownish leadership on the Continent had supposedly “solved” the crisis for the third time just a few weeks ago.  Or was it the fourth time?  Really, who’s counting anymore…</p>
<p>Let’s start with Spain.  While Greece is still on fire, Spain is where the real action is due to the size of its economy and the importance it has to the political EU hacks.  Not only were there enormous protests this week in the capital Madrid in reaction to austerity measures, but there is also a very significant secession movement picking up steam in Catalonia.  This isn’t about leaving the euro, this is about leaving Spain!  For those that aren’t aware of Spanish geography, Catalonia is the wealthiest region in Spain and it is where Barcelona is located.  First, we saw enormous protests in Catalonia about a month ago, which I covered <a href="http://libertyblitzkrieg.com/2012/09/12/forget-the-euro-will-spain-ultimately-break-up/">here</a>.  Now we see that last night the regional parliament approved a referendum on independence that will apparently be voted on during regional elections on November 25.  Reuters covers the story <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/27/us-spain-catalonia-idUSBRE88Q1JE20120927">here</a>.</p>
<p>While this is hugely important, let’s not overlook the massive demonstrations in Madrid this past week.  I will let this powerful video below do the talking.  Draghi says “the euro is irreversible.”  Don’t make me laugh.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let’s talk Greece.  I think a lot of people brushed off this week’s protests as “oh it’s just the Greeks in the streets again.”  This is a mistake.  These demonstrations were different and here is why.  From the UK’s Guardian:</p>

                <p>The Wisconsin shooting tragedy took a huge turn for me ever since I heard that one of the seriously wounded is Satwant Singh Kaleka, father of Amardeep Kaleka, who is intimately involved in the creation of the movie Sirius, a film that from what I can tell may expose information that TPTB do not want to the broader public to see.  Quite the coincidence in my opinion and no matter what your biases are, I implore you to keep an open mind.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/crime/reports-of-people-shot-at-sikh-temple-in-oak-creek-qc6cgc0-165059506.html?page=1#!page=1&amp;pageSize=10&amp;sort=newestfirst">Here is an article</a> on the shooting where Amardeep Kaleka has his head in his hands in a photo at the top.</p>
<p>Here is a link to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp9aOb04e20&amp;feature=player_embedded#!">trailer for the movie Sirius</a>, in which Amardeep makes several appearances.</p>
<p>Furthermore, here is Amardeep saying there were multiple shooters involved.</p>

My deepest thoughts and prayers go out to Amardeep, his father and all the others affected by this horrific tragedy.</p>

<p>Those are three of my favorite paragraphs from a blog post titled, &#8220;Why I&#8217;m Leaving America,&#8221; which a reader sent me a few days ago.  I am thoroughly impressed.  This kid has a way with words.  I&#8217;m sad to see such a thoughtful mind leave our shores, but this should serve as a warning.  These are the folks that feel compelled to pick up and leave given the rampant criminality and corruption that pervades the nation in these dark days.  If things don&#8217;t turn around, the brain drain exiting this country will make the decline irreversible.  I hope this doesn&#8217;t happen.  Please take the time to read this heartfelt and powerful post&#8230;</p>
<p>Goodbye, America.<br />
For as long as I’ve lived you’ve been my only home. I’ve had a wonderful life here. Your inhabitants are almost universally kind, and I’ve become lifelong friends with many of your citizens. All of my family lives here, everyone I have ever known or loved, and I will miss them all a lot. But after 22 years, I feel impelled to leave.</p>
<p>According to your founders, “When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one [person] to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.” Well, I certainly wouldn’t want to be disrespectful.</p>
<p>At first glance, you look like the greatest of all social systems. You seem like a stable and sturdy structure. People look at you and see strength. They see freedom and opportunity, democracy and unity. But a peak behind the curtain reveals a scared old man, desperately trying to maintain an illusion. Your size and complexity hide a simple truth: that you don’t physically exist. You are nothing more than a system of human interaction; not a thing in and of itself, but the result of a widespread pattern of behavior. You emerge from our beliefs, and the actions they compel us to take.</p>
<p>We learn our roles and play them well. The guards act like guards, the judges act like judges, the cops act like cops, and we all pay our taxes. You exist because individuals behave as if you did. Of course this seems patently obvious, but it has some frequently overlooked implications. There is an inherent problem with this sort of system, a cancer written in your genetic code, an inoperable tumor that spells your demise.</p>
<p>The mistake is so subtle that generations have failed to identify it. Your creators devised a way to hide it for centuries. They separated your powers, pitted ambition against ambition to mask your fatal flaw. As long as people were content, as long as your tyranny was well hidden, the problem went unnoticed. But it was there all along, metastasizing beneath the stars and stripes.</p>
<p>The problem is choice. I alone control my actions. Your system depends on us adhering to a certain pattern of behavior, but we each have the power to reject it. You will only survive as long as individuals believe you exist and act accordingly, but you cannot compel the choice. You can never take away my ability to choose life without you, to ignore your behavioral suggestions, to act on my own.</p>
<p>Oh but of course, you tried your best to conceal this fact, to convince me I needed you, to give me faith in your existence, to make me fall in love with you, to count you as my own. You started young, indirectly at first and then directly through my “education”.</p>
<p>For thirteen years I was forced into your indoctrination facilities, and social pressure pushed me into another three and a half. Without a doubt I learned many useful things. I had many wonderful teachers who only wanted what was best for me. I am grateful for their wisdom.</p>
<p>Far more sinister were the unspoken lessons. Structure matters more than content; your hidden messages are far more powerful than what is said aloud in lecture. For more than a decade you required my direct submission to your representative at the front of the class, using all the silly threats that work on a child. You taught me that knowledge is obtained from authority, that all problems have answers in the back of the book. You judged me constantly, trying to teach me to look to others for approval, trying to make me conform. You lead me in the pledge of allegiance over 2,000 times. But worst of all, you tried to parent me. You tried to make me realize a familial bond with you, to make me believe you had my own interests at heart. You tried your best to make me choose you, but it didn’t work.</p>
<p>The more you try to coerce my affection, the more obvious the ploy becomes. All the ridiculous forms of manipulation that go unseen by the masses are the red flags of malicious intent. My obedience isn’t for my protection, but for yours. You don’t want me to see the choice because that leads directly to an investigation of merit. No longer are you a parent that must be respected, but a business transaction that must be evaluated. Well America, your benefits don’t outweigh your costs. You do more harm than good.</p>
<p>I recognize your advantages. I understand you have rivals who treat their citizenry far worse. Raised in another land, it’s possible I would have never received enough information to understand my situation. And for that, I thank you. But it’s not enough. Your existence relies on a mortal sin, and no amount of bribery will sway me to forgive you for it. No number of schools, hospitals, roads or defense networks could ever justify your systematic use of aggressive coercion.</p>
<p>Coercion is “the practice of forcing another party to behave in an involuntary manner by use of threats, intimidation, fraud, or some other form of pressure or force.” Making someone do something they wouldn’t out of their own free will. Aggressive coercion means the initiation of such action. Threatening someone who hasn’t threatened you, defrauding the trusting, harming an innocent; the initiation of force.</p>
<p>Coercion is your single purpose, your only weapon and your only form of control. A government IS a monopoly of the “legitimate” use of aggressive coercion; a monopoly over the initiation of force IS a government. Hear it straight from the horse’s mouth. When all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.</p>
<p>It’s not your fault. You were created with one lever, so every time the people wanted change you pulled it. When people got scared about retirement, you gave them Social Security. The price: enslaving the next generation. You put the bill on the backs of their children before they were old enough to vote, and the only choice you provided was pay up, leave or live in a metal cage. When people got scared about flying or drugs or pornography, you pulled the lever and made more threats. All of your rules are coercive. Every single piece of legislation is ultimately backed up by a threat of physical violence. Every law is a gun under the table, and I don’t negotiate with terrorists.</p>
<p>I will not support the use of aggressive coercion as a solution to social problems, even implicitly by voting or paying taxes. It causes far more problems than it solves. This isn’t a belief that was handed down to me as many of your citizens obtained their ethics. My belief that that coercion is undesirable and ineffective isn’t based on faith, and I’m open to the possibility that I’m wrong. But this is the conclusion of my sincerest attempt at an objective search for truth. It is a conviction forged with evidence and reason. I don’t believe aggressive coercion is wrong because anyone says so; I won’t support its use because of the way it affects humans as individuals and societies.</p>
<p>This probably seems like a radical and unsubstantiated belief to you. It’s certainly an uncommon principle within your borders. It might be unusual, but popularity has no bearing on truth. On the scale of individual interactions, it’s clear that receiving threats is not desirable. Nobody wants to be coerced, by definition. But what if threats can be used for the common good? What if the negative effects of coercion to a society are outweighed by its benefits? The more I learn about the world, the more I realize that this is not the case. Coercion inhibits the evolutionary search of the free market, it prevents us from trying out new solutions to social problems and from recognizing failures. I’m convinced it’s the cause of almost every problem you purportedly use coercion to solve.</p>
<p>Of course, your greatest supposed benefit is the defense you provide. But what noble defender extorts payment from its clients? How could you possibly be defending us when YOU are our greatest threat? Like the Mafia’s protection racket, our greatest danger presents itself when we refuse to pay. There is only one entity that has ever threatened me with death or imprisonment, and that is YOU. No foreign government, terrorist organization or even a criminal on the street has ever threatened my life or freedom, only you America.</p>
<p>Granted, you provide defense from some of your smaller competitors. You imprison lesser thieves and murderers, a charade to prove your worth. Clearly these are problems that any society must deal with, but ceding the power of legitimate defense to a single entity only exacerbates them. Without feedback such as prices and profit, no one has any idea what methods are effective or desirable. Granting a monopoly of defense is like giving all the guns to an army of deaf men and acting surprised when they don’t respond to our shouts. People deserve a distributed, voluntarily-funded defense network that utilizes free exchange to find the cheapest, most desirable and most effective methods of preventing the initiation of force. Imprisoning tax evaders and drug users while bombing innocent civilians in the Middle East is NOT defense, and I will not allow you to fund your crimes with any portion of the fruits of my labor.</p>

                <p>Early last week, I had the great pleasure to record my first podcast with Kerry Lutz of the <a href="http://financialsurvivalnetwork.com/">Financial Survival Network</a>.  I was fortunate enough to meet Kerry recently for the first time at Freedom Fest in Las Vegas, and we spent what seemed like hours talking about our respective paths in life and how we can defeat the criminals running and enslaving America and the world today.  We discuss everything from the coming attempts at a &#8220;cashless society,&#8221; to NSA Whistleblowers and what TPTB next move might be.</p>
<p>Please have a listen <a href="http://ec.libsyn.com/p/e/f/1/ef1a147213cdfbfc/Michael_Krieger_07-18-2012.mp3?d13a76d516d9dec20c3d276ce028ed5089ab1ce3dae902ea1d01cc853ed8ce5a46ec&amp;c_id=4718133">here</a>!</p>

<p>- All Quotes by Joseph Stalin</p>
<p><strong>Know Your Enemy</strong><br />
I recall wanting to read <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Mein Kampf</span> as a young kid, although to this day I have only read excerpts.  I wanted to know what made this guy tick, what his thoughts were.  How could someone justify such horrific actions. As I have progressed into adulthood I have only become more and more convinced that books written by psychopath killer dictators should be required reading for every single human being on the planet.  In a similar vein, I remember hearing the argument back in high school that people should not read Machiavelli’s <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Prince</span>.  The argument was that if people read a manual on devious thoughts, and the application of ruthless behavior to achieve one’s selfish ends, that it would permeate society and lead us all into a darker place.  As soon as I heard this, of course, the first thing I did was head to the book store to buy it.  I recall my reaction to the treatise vividly.</p>
<p>I remember thinking how absolutely asinine the argument for shielding this book from society really was.  The conclusion I came to was that anyone with a truly sick, sociopathic mind wouldn’t learn anything from this book.  Their minds already intuitively thought that way.  Those that could be persuaded to think in that manner as a result of reading such a book were just dangerous sheeple that would sell their souls to work with a sick system.  They would end up doing so anyway.  Those people don’t scare me so much as the naturally devious mind does.  They can be easily outmaneuvered by smarter men and women.  If I am correct, then the worst possible thing we can do as a society is to pretend that this extremely small percentage of the population doesn’t exist or pose a threat to us in our everyday lives (please read my related article <a href="http://libertyblitzkrieg.com/2012/03/14/humanity-is-rising/">here</a>).  I think that most of the population of the United States (aka Disneyland) has been duped into thinking that somehow the Hitler or Stalin personalities of the world no longer exist!  That somehow they just disappeared from the earth after World War 2, or more importantly, if they exist they are in some remote African country or Middle Eastern nation that just conveniently happens to have oil!</p>
<p>If Americans can indeed be convinced that such people roam the streets of the US of A then they are likely the one-off serial killer we hear about every now and again, or some homeless person that ODs on bath salts and eats some other homeless persons face on the side of a highway in Miami.  The big secret is that the smart, devious and ambitious minds do not lock middle aged women in basements; they go into politics.  More specifically, they pursue power wherever it can be had.  This is why I refer to Washington D.C. as a the world’s largest cesspool.  I think at this very moment there aren’t many places on this earth with a higher concentration per capita of twisted, immoral, inhumane creatures that somehow still refer to themselves as human beings.</p>
<p>So in this context, the awakening that is happening across much of my nation is really just the citizenry realizing what most of the world already knows all too well.  The <a href="http://libertyblitzkrieg.com/2010/04/22/goodbye-disneyland/">Siren’s song of Disney</a> has been strong but its effect is wearing off.  You can’t defeat your enemy unless you know your enemy.</p>
<p><strong>Remember the Words of Joseph Stalin</strong><br />
As we head into the Greek election this weekend, I thought it would be appropriate to recall the words of Joseph Stalin.  Particularly his observation about elections and vote counting.  I find it hilarious that the Greek authorities suspended polling heading into the election.  I mean, that tells you everything you need to know.  This is exactly what you would do if you were thinking about rigging the results.  The worst thing that could happen would be to have Syriza soaring in the polls into the main event.  If that was the case ,it would be much more difficult to arrange a more “favorable” outcome.  This way they can just claim “wow, unexpectedly the bankster parties won!”  I’m not predicting that will be the outcome, I’m just saying the suspension of polling was a huge red flag.*  <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/greek-polling-moratorium-begins-syriza-goes-out-bang-europe-now-flying-blind">Here </a>is the chart of the last polling results and some excellent commentary.  Greece is extremely important as it is a key testing ground for TPTB.  Everything that is happening in Greece will be attempted elsewhere if they can get away with it there.  This gives the country a great deal of significance.  That said, even if Greece is lost there is no way TPTB can win this thing.  It is taking them more than two years to roll up tiny Greece.  Even if they succeed, do you think Spain and Italy will go so easily.  Then what about the U.S. with hundreds of millions of guns everywhere?  There is no chance.  The globalist agenda is already dead in the water; however, as we can see it doesn’t stop them from continuing to try.</p>
<p>What TPTB do not appreciate are the lessons we are all learning from Greece.  We must learn many more lessons though.  We must admit to ourselves that there are truly evil geniuses out there, and in most cases these characters have taken control of the power structure (corporations, politics and factions of the military in most of the nations we reside in).  The necessary action is not for good people to bury their heads in the sand and pretend that such people do not exist.  We must get inside their minds.  We must acknowledge and accept their presence as well as their power and then work tirelessly to relieve them of it.  As Irish statesmen, author and philosopher Edmund Burke so eloquently stated: “All that&#8217;s necessary for the forces of evil to win in the world is for enough good men to do nothing.” Let’s just do it already.</p>
<p>Peace and wisdom,<br />
Mike</p>
<p>* Note, a reader has informed me that a polling ban ahead of Greek elections has been in place for at least several years.  This doesn&#8217;t take away from any of the main points of the piece; however, I felt it significant enough of an oversight to correct.</p>

                <p><em>He said to his friend, &#8220;If the British march<br />
By land or sea from the town tonight,<br />
Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch<br />
Of the North Church tower as a signal light,<br />
One if by land, and two if by sea;<br />
And I on the opposite shore will be,<br />
Ready to ride and spread the alarm<br />
Through every Middlesex village and farm,<br />
For the country folk to be up and to arm.&#8221;</em><br />
- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow from the poem “Paul Revere’s Ride”</p>
<p><strong>Welcome to My Blog:  <a href="http://www.libertyblitzkrieg.com/">www.libertyblitzkrieg.com</a></strong><br />
The world is a very dangerous place at the moment and it is becoming more treacherous with each passing day.  The reason for this is because the self-proclaimed “global elite” or TPTB, whatever you want to call them, have declared war on the rest of us.  It is not just financial and economic war but it is also a moral and spiritual one.  The game is being played on many levels and most of humanity remains completely unaware of it (although I would say a higher percentage of us are aware than ever before in recorded history thanks to the internet).  When people look back at what has happened in the past decade or so and wonder why the welfare-warfare state continues to grow despite who sits in the Presidency the answer becomes clear.  The leadership in the United States of America, and in reality pretty much every government on the planet, could care less about the advancement of their people.  Back in 2008 they weren’t interested in saving the economy.  They simply wanted to steal everything in sight using the government as its tool…and boy did they.  The political leadership in America today (with some exceptions of course) represents the lowest common denominator of our Republic.  They collectively possess a cunning political mindset coupled with a total absence of empathy and a lack of hesitation to engage in ruthless behavior to maintain power.  Meanwhile, our corporate leadership (particularly now that Steve Jobs has passed) are collectively a bunch of cost-cutting, share repurchasing, quarterly EPS obsessed cowards that couldn’t and wouldn’t want to innovate themselves out of a paper bag.  They surround themselves with “yes” men and with a few exceptions dare not to speak out about the crimes being committed against the citizenry by the political class for fear of losing their positions in the socio-economic structure.  In short, they are cowards.  Then of course there is the top of the power pyramid in today’s world.  At the apex lies (pun intended) the Central Bankers (Planners) of the world.  There is no group of people to whom I feel more disdain.  I firmly believe they must face trial for crimes against humanity once their sick game plays out.  This group of people literally control the entire global economy via their privilege to print however much currency they want whenever they want to.  This is a group of insanely egotistical, mathematical robots who think they can excel model and print the world into utopia.  In reality, all they are doing is transferring what is left of the middle class’ wealth into the pockets of the super rich who use 0% money to engage in leveraged speculation on financial assets and then get bailed out by the taxpayer when their bets fail.</p>
<p><strong>One Million Paul Reveres<br />
</strong>It was<strong> </strong>last night in 1775 that Paul Revere made his famous midnight ride to warn the colonists that “the British are coming.”  Amongst other things, the colonists were concerned that the crown was going to disarm the citizenry and arrest John Adams and John Hancock.  It is auspicious that I am launching my blog on the 237<sup>th</sup> anniversary of his legendary warning.  It was late last year that in an interview I said what we need are one million Paul Reveres on the internet in order to get the word out globally and unite against the tiny minority that is doing all this harm to our species.  It is as a result of my never-ending determination to win this fight that I have decided to start this blog.</p>
