Watts Up With That? ^

This post will be a top sticky post for some time, new essays will appear below this one  AnthonyA number of climate skeptic bloggers (myself included) have received this message yesterday. While I had planned to defer announcing this until a reasonable scan could be completed, some other bloggers have let the cat out of the bag. I provide this introductory email sent by FOIA without editing or comment. I do have one email, which I found quite humorous, which I will add at the end so that our friends know that this is valid. Update  the first email I posted apparently was part of an earlier release (though I had not seen it, there are a number of duplicates in the all.zip file) so I have added a second one.Update 2: Additional emails have been added  AnthonyUpdate 3: Delingpole weighs in.Climategate: FOIA  The Man Who Saved The World  Telegraph BlogsI hope one day that FOIAs true identity can be revealed so that he can be properly applauded and rewarded for his signal service to mankind. He is a true hero, who deserves to go on the same roll of honour as Norman Borlaug, Julian Simon and Steve McIntyre: people who put truth, integrity and the human race first and ideology second. Unlike the misanthropic greenies who do exactly the opposite.=========================================================== Subject: FOIA 2013: the passwordIts time to tie up loose ends and dispel some of the speculation surrounding the Climategate affair.Indeed, its singular I this time. After certain career developments I can no longer use the papal plural ;-)If this email seems slightly disjointed its probably my linguistic background and the problem of trying to address both the wider audience (I expect this will be partially reproduced sooner or later) and the email recipients (whom I havent decided yet on).The all.7z password is [redacted]DO NOT PUBLISH THE PASSWORD. Quote other parts if you like.Releasing the encrypted archive was a mere practicality. I didnt want to keep the emails lying around.I prepared CG1 & 2 alone. Even skimming through all 220.000 emails would have taken several more months of work in an increasingly unfavorable environment.Dumping them all into the public domain would be the last resort. Majority of the emails are irrelevant, some of them probably sensitive and socially damaging.To get the remaining scientifically (or otherwise) relevant emails out, I ask you to pass this on to any motivated and responsible individuals who could volunteer some time to sift through the material for eventual release.Filtering\redacting personally sensitive emails doesnt require special expertise.Im not entirely comfortable sending the password around unsolicited, but havent got better ideas at the moment. If you feel this makes you seemingly complicit in a way you dont like, dont take action.I dont expect these remaining emails to hold big surprises. Yet its possible that the most important pieces are among them. Nobody on the planet has held the archive in plaintext since CG2.Thats right; no conspiracy, no paid hackers, no Big Oil. The Republicans didnt plot this. USA politics is alien to me, neither am I from the UK. There is life outside the Anglo-American sphere.If someone is still wondering why anyone would take these risks, or sees only a breach of privacy here, a few wordsThe first glimpses I got behind the scenes did little to garner my trust in the state of climate science  on the contrary. I found myself in front of a choice that just might have a global impact.Briefly put, when I had to balance the interests of my own safety, privacy\career of a few scientists, and the well-being of billions of people living in the coming several decades, the first two werent the decisive concern.It was me or nobody, now or never. Combination of several rather improbable prerequisites just wouldnt occur again for anyone else in the foreseeable future. The circus was about to arrive in Copenhagen. Later on it could be too late.Most would agree that climate science has already directed where humanity puts its capability, innovation, mental and material might. The scale will grow ever grander in the coming decades if things go according to script. Were dealing with $trillions and potentially drastic influence on practically everyone.Wealth of the surrounding society tends to draw the major brushstrokes of a newborns future life. It makes a huge difference whether humanity uses its assets to achieve progress, or whether it strives to stop and reverse it, essentially sacrificing the less fortunate to the climate gods.We cant pour trillions in this massive hole-digging-and-filling-up endeavor and pretend its not away from something and someone else.If the economy of a region, a country, a city, etc. deteriorates, what happens among the poorest? Does that usually improve their prospects? No, they will take the hardest hit. No amount of magical climate thinking can turn this one upside-down.Its easy for many of us in the western world to accept a tiny green inconvenience and then wallow in that righteous feeling, surrounded by our clean technology and energy that is only slightly more expensive if adequately subsidized.Those millions and billions already struggling with malnutrition, sickness, violence, illiteracy, etc. dont have that luxury. The price of climate protection with its cumulative and collateral effects is bound to destroy and debilitate in great numbers, for decades and generations.Conversely, a game-changer could have a beneficial effect encompassing a similar scope.If I had a chance to accomplish even a fraction of that, Id have to try. I couldnt morally afford inaction. Even if I risked everything, would never get personal compensation, and could probably never talk about it with anyone.I took what I deemed the most defensible course of action, and would do it again (although with slight alterations  trying to publish something truthful on RealClimate was clearly too grandiose of a plan ;-).Even if I have it all wrong and these scientists had some good reason to mislead us (instead of making a strong case with real data) I think disseminating the truth is still the safest bet by far.Big thanks to Steve and Anthony and many others. My contribution would never have happened without your work (whether or not you agree with the views stated).Oh, one more thing. I was surprised to learn from a progressive blog, corroborated by a renowned scientist, that the releases were part of a coordinated campaign receiving vast amounts of secret funding from shady energy industry groups.I wasnt aware of the arrangement but warmly welcome their decision to support my project. For that end I opened a bitcoin address: 1HHQ36qbsgGZWLPmiUjYHxQUPJ6EQXVJFS.More seriously speaking, I accept, with gratitude, modest donations to support The (other) Cause. The address can also serve as a digital signature to ward off those identity thefts which are part of climate scientists repertoire of tricks these days.Keep on the good work. I wont be able to use this email address for long so if you reply, I cant guarantee reading or answering. I will several batches, to anyone I can think of.Over and out.Mr. FOIA ===============================================================Here is one email that I found interesting and humorous, email addresses redacted as a courtesy.

Hope these comments arent too late. I dont think I need to see it again.SimonResponse to reviewersI couldnt read your letter  PS files as attachments seem to get munged by our firewall/email scanner so Ive just looked at the paper to see if I think youve dealt with the reviewers comments.Editors comments:3) Dont think you have dealt with the enhanced multi-decadal variability in the paper.Reviewer B.1) Didnt see a justification for use of tree-rings and not using ice cores  the obvious one is that ice cores are no good  see Jones et al, 1998.2) No justification for regional reconstructions rather than what Mann et al did (I dont think we can say we didnt do Mann et al because we think it is crap!)3) No justification in the paper for the 9 regions. I think there is justification in the JGR Briffa paper.4) That is a good point  I would strongly suspect that the control has a lot less variance than the observations over the last century  not the ALL run though!5) No response to this in the paper. I suspect we are doing better stats than all the rest though!Specific Questions/comments1) That is a good point: How about (though a bit germanic) Comparison of simulated northern hemisphere variability with paleo-temperature Didnt see that you had dealt with points 5 and 6.Ditto for point 11.Figures.2-4 seem to be much as submitted!Figs 5-8  do you want to use colour? It would cost!Ref C.Dont seem to have dealt with point a) and it is quite an important point as well!Point b is a reasonable point which I think you go some way to dealing with. I suggest you stress on page 20 the exploratory nature of our analysis. I am just about to start such a run once I have sorted out the orbital forcings and how to calculate their radiative forcings.Point c  not sure what the referee is saying here!Comments on the MS.Page 9 pith means Same sentence I think you need to add that they are grouped by species as well (the rest of the para implies that is what is done).Last sentence of penultimate para: stress that decadal to century scale variability is what we are interested mainly because of its importance in deciding if recent climate change is anthropogenic or natural.First full para on page 13  didnt really follow this para.2nd para, line 11 consider in comparison -> when comparedPage 14, first para  consider expanding the abbreviations i.e CAS -> CAS (Central Asia).Page 20, last para. insert in the four simulations after six negative spikes.Section 10 should be Appendix A. Dr Simon Tett Managing Scientist, Data development and applications.

Let the Games begin!Much of the bad behavior began with We must find a way to get rid of the Medieval Warm PeriodNo amount of spin, cherry-picking, or statistical sleight-of-hand will make it go away.Ditto Roman Warm Period, Holocene Optimum  all warmer than today. CO2 game over.

Hark Ernest! Thanks for the heads up. I shall bookmark this post as appropriate, create a new BOOK MARK FOLDER DIRECTORY named Climate-Gate-2, then go to site to see if I can download the the files, etc.. Perhaps it will go as smoothly as with Climate-Gate-1 and 2 zipped file packages.

Ernie. Am I accurate to think at this point that there is no zip file, that contains a package of emails and other, that that in essence was package like we had a few years back? That is. A zip file that contains a whole mix of emails and data. After wading through the Whats up with that site links, it appears there is not a single zipped file one can download. Am I correct in reaching that conclusion?

This is leaker is great. Too bad he/she has to hide idenity. We could arrange for a presidential pardon for the hacker in the future...
Leftists are unethical sickos and should not have access to bio-warfare research facilities. It’s a mental illness of the criminally insane and it should not be used in shaping “bio-ethics” like it is in science.
If they fail to take over the world’s means of production - energy through climate fear and surrender to leftist centralized control - many Leftists “would go there” (to biological warfare) having convienced themselves they have to kill millions of people to get to Utopia...again. They have wetted their fanatical blood lust within their climate change cult. They have also wetted the appitite of big global money in alternative energy, research, and police state suppliers and wealthy control freak wannabes. The global warming agenda is an unholy alliance between communists and fascists - globally.
The leaker is quite a hero for exposing their lies as the watermelons were blasting the football down the field. They still got away with with billions, Europe and California before they were sacked. They aren’t giving up on America and they own the Senate and Executive Branch.

It has been a long and tough battle to figure out what theses crooks were up to....The eMails totally exposed them....For the politicians of the left,...around the world,...it was going to be a very nice revenue tap for the slush funds via various taxes on carbon.California is still making efforts to implement it.

Thanks, IGTR. I'm in the process of downloading. Understand the password provided by Antony's site. For others. The password is "all.7z" in case you decide to download the 135mb zip file titled all.7z from the site that I got the rope references. REFERENCE THREAD 25.

I spent the time waiting for the zip file to be downloaded. Did an unzip on it.... provided the "all.7z" password as was indicated at Anthony's site. It would not unzip into meaningful files. After twenty minutes of watching the error messages that a password was required. I killed the zip process. Tens of thousands of empty files in directory I directed the unzip to place the files. I'M NOW WARNING OTHERS TO NOT BE SO HASTY IN DOWNLOADING THIS ZIP FILE. IT WILL NOT UNZIP PROPERLY AS ONE WOULD EXPECT. Duty bound to at least WARN others they may be wasting their time.

Global warming is a big hoax. The Earth is cooling not warming so the news media and gov changed the name of global warming to climate change.
This article is just more proof of this hoax
The government funded this hoax . gov spent trillions of $ in grants to fund decades of this totally fake research .
This alone proves that government(socialism) can never work. they are totally unaccountable to reality, to truth , to efficiency etc. If you open up a private business you are accountable to the bottom line, to efficiency, to your customers. government agencies are not and idiots in universities receiving government grants to do global warming research are not accountable to anything .
Then they and the news media use this fake research to further grow government and take away our freedom. And many sheep believe the government and news media brainwashing. They actually believe capitalism (big oil etc) are destroying the planet with global warming. And when I tell these liberals and other sheep that global warming is a hoax many laugh , others look at me like I’m crazy. the media and gov are the problem. We should email this to Rush and drudge etc.

Why would you think that the password was the same as the file name? Did you see this in the original post:The all.7z password is [redacted] DO NOT PUBLISH THE PASSWORD. It seems that selected bloggers received the password, but were asked not to pass it along to the general public.

From the bottom of this Post:
“Analyses like these by people who dont know the field are useless.
A good example is Naomi Oreskes work.”
http://www.americanthinker.com/2011/06/naomi_oreskes_conspiracy_queen.html
“’Naomi Oreskes is the environmentalist Noam Chomsky. She thinks that anyone who questions environmentalist doctrine is evil. Her crusade is to expose the presumed ulterior motives of the critics. According to Oreskes, if you question the dubious studies concerning secondhand tobacco smoke, you must be in the pay of tobacco companies. If you question global warming, you must be working for a fossil fuel company. If you question the DDT ban, you must part of a right wing conspiracy to weaken faith in government regulators.”
