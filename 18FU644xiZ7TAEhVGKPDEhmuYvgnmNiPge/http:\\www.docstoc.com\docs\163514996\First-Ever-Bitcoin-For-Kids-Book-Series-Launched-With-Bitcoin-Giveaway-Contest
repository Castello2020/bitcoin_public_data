					 First Ever Bitcoin For Kids Book Series Launched With Bitcoin Giveaway
                                 Contest
Ponn Sabra and her three daughters release a four-book “Bitcoin for Kids” book series about the digital
currency and giving away 0.25* Bitcoin (approx. $87). By making Bitcoin easy and fun to use, they hope
          to motivate kids and moms to try it out, further pushing Bitcoin to the mainstream.

Los Angeles, CA, November 15, 2013 - Best-selling authors and bloggers Ponn, JuJu (13), GiGi (12)
and JoJo (10) Sabra today announce the “Bitcoin for Kids” Series to motivate moms and kids to
use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is ideal for kids. The digital currency can be sent by anyone of any age, in any
amount, to anywhere in the world, anytime of the day or night. Using Bitcoin is as easy as
sending an email or SMS/text message.

Bitcoin has been maligned and celebrated in recent news. The story of a man from Norway who
bought $27 in Bitcoin four years ago that is worth over $850,000 today captured a lot of positive
attention. The Sabra’s hope stories like this and those in their books will help build more
awareness and interest in Bitcoin. “We want to help make Bitcoin more mainstream by showing
families how easy and fun it is to use,” said Ponn Sabra.

The Sabra’s created the website bitkidz.com, the first to teach Kids about Bitcoin. “We created
the first Bitcoin-for-kids website, the only Bitcoin forum for kids, and our book series will be used
to teach kids in the classroom and online,” said Ponn Sabra. The Introductory book features the
first published case study of kids using Bitcoin.

The Bitcoin for Kids book series includes:

* Bitcoin for Kids Primer: Kids Making Money Online - 12 Inspirational Stories That Will Motivate
You To Action!

* Bitcoin for Kids Book 1: Putting Money In Kids’ Hands Today For A Better Tomorrow - No Need
For Virtual Worlds and Make-Believe Money

* Bitcoin for Kids Book 2: How To Earn, Save, Spend and Share Bitcoin - Easy, Fast and Fun Step-
by-Step Tutorials

* Bitcoin for Kids Book 3: Wise Words From the World’s Best Bitcoiners - Bitcoin Breaks The
Boundaries Of Age And Much More

The books can be purchased with Bitcoin (or with fiat currency through Amazon) and a link for the
FREE Primer can be found at bitkidz.com/bitcoinforkids

In the process of educating kids, they also hope to counter common myths about Bitcoin. “People
stay away from Bitcoin because they either believe it’s too volatile, attracts criminals, or, they
think Bitcoin is so high-tech that the average person won’t be able to understand it.” said Sabra.
“While there’s some truth to those extreme statements, by writing a book series by kids for kids
we’re demonstrating that if kids understand Bitcoin, so can others!”

Bitcoin* Giveaway Contest
The Sabra’s are hosting a Bitcoin Giveaway Contest during the first week of the book series
release, November 13 - 19, 2013. The Grand Prize will be 0.25* BTC and a digital copy of The
“Bitcoin For Kids Trilogy” ($7.97 value). To encourage families to have fun watching the Bitcoin
market value, the *Grand Prize will be based on November 19th’s average rate to be no less than
$70 or the full amount of 0.25 BTC transferred to the winner’s Bitcoin wallet. Current rate: $87.

Generous bitcoiners are welcomed to donate to increase the 0.25* BTC Grand Prize at Bitcoin

Second Prize: $50 gift card from Gyft.com

Why use Bitcoin? The Sabra’s say because it is digital, practical, cheaper, safer, more secure and
global. “Kids and moms need to learn how to use it now! The sooner the better, and the more
lucrative because the value keeps climbing. There is opportunity in being an early adopter.”

Even if Bitcoin drops in value, the Sabra’s think there are lessons. “The math behind it is amazing!
Bitcoin helps kids learn economics, international finance, money markets (watching values go up
and down), budgeting, spending versus saving, computers, technology, the Internet and much
more. These crucial life lessons are often not taught in school or home today. My girls’ lives have
forever changed since Bitcoin was introduced to us, and we want to impart this excitement to
other families as well.”

The Bitcoin for Kids series was recently selected as curriculum at The Bitcoin Academy and the
Bitcoin Bootcamp after school program. The Sabra’s, currently traveling overseas, conducted
months of research and interviewed kids already using Bitcoin for the Primer. In their research,
they found kids who have made significant returns using Bitcoin. The most interesting point
shared by each kid was that Bitcoin has changed their lives.

The Sabra’s are available for interviews via Skype, Google-Hangout, or email.

10% of proceeds from BitKidz.com and the “Bitcion for Kids” book series will be donated to
SeansOutpost.com (5%) and TheBitcoinAcademy.com (5%). An additional 5% during the month
of November 2013 will to donated to the Philippines Typhoon victims via World Food Program.
