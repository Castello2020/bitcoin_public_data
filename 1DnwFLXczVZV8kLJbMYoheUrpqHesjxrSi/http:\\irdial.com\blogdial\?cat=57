					<p>About 20 years ago, Akin Fernandez discovered mysterious sounds and voices being transmitted over shortwave radio stations called &#8220;Numbers Stations&#8221; that weren&#8217;t documented anywhere. With more research, Fernandez realized that these stations had been used during the Cold War to transmit secret messages from intelligence agencies to their spies &#8230; but they were still being actively used though the war was long over.</p>
<p>Such began <a href="http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/tcp1111">The Conet Project</a>, which was first popularized when Wilco used a portion of one of the recordings, a woman saying &#8220;yankee hotel foxtrot,&#8221; in their song <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GanNE5LWF4">Poor Places</a> and as their album title and were later sued for copyright infringement.</p>
<p>Here, we asked Fernandez to write out a description of the project that carries such a mystery with it. Have a listen to a portion of the project in the above clip.</p>
<p><b>Where did you first get the idea for a project about shortwave numbers station recordings?</b></p>
<p>In the early 1990s I discovered that you can receive weather maps and satellite images by shortwave radio with a simple receiver and an inexpensive demodulator that attaches to your computer. I put it all together and started to decode weather satellite images from all over the world.</p>
<p>Whilst trying to tune into stations that were transmitting these satellite weather maps and photos, I kept coming across stations that were transmitting strange voices reading out strings of numbers and letters. In one of the frequency guides I owned, there were entries for some of these stations, listed simply as “Numbers Station,” with no other information.</p>
<p>In order to understand why this is odd, you need to understand how shortwave radio transmitters are licensed and how they behave when they are legally operated. Each licensed radio station on the air is given permission to operate by a government. If it is not, it is a pirate station operating illegally. Each station has call letters, an address, and when they transmit, they announce who owns the station, where it is on the globe and the schedule of transmission times and frequencies. If you write to them with a reception report, they will send a “QSL” card back to you to say thank you.</p>
<p>The only people who do not conform to these standards are pirates, or people using shortwave for their licensed private use, like ships at sea, and in those cases, you sometimes hear people having conversations with each other.</p>
<p>Numbers Stations had none of this. They did not identify themselves as a licensed station should. They were clearly not pirates, because there were too many of them, transmitting all over the dial in many different forms, and their signals were way too powerful for a man in his garage to be operating. They clearly were not two-way radio telephone calls. These were something different, and the scant information that you could find about them in the 1990s bore this out.</p>
<p>To my astonishment, there were no good sources of information about Numbers Stations. There were a few small books printed by enthusiasts (normally printed very cheaply and bound with staples) filled only with facts you could glean for yourself if you listened to a shortwave.</p>
<p>This was a real live mystery, taking place on a global basis, unreported, scantily documented and passing though the bodies of billions of people every day. Everyone I asked about Numbers Stations didn&#8217;t know anything about them. The British Library didn&#8217;t have any recordings of them in its collection. There were even some shortwave radio listeners who were huffy and defensive about them, describing them as “nonsense.”</p>
<p>It was about that time that I lost my mind and had to know everything about Numbers Stations that I could find. I couldn&#8217;t stand the idea that this was going on and no one knew about it.</p>
<p>Here was something that had been going on for decades, that had never been reported on in a newspaper, that was inexplicably missing from the plotlines of every James Bond and spy movie ever made, and that was going on unabated after the end of the Cold War. This is something that had never been documented in the National Sound Archive in the country that built Alan Turing&#8217;s ENIGMA breaking computer, or indeed that is mentioned anywhere by the people curating the espionage relics of war.</p>
<p>Surely, this could not be real, but it was, and it fell right into my lap.</p>
<p>It was at this point and with all this scant information and the red rag to a bull of Numbers Stations in my face and ears that I decided to stop decoding satellite weather photos and start recording and logging Numbers Stations.</p>
<p>Some might think that this is all a bit odd. For certain, people who take that position have not ever heard a Numbers Station. These are not just plain white noises or unedifying, characterless transmissions likethe UK’s “Speaking Clock.” These stations are very VERY weird; they are so weird that they sometimes exceed the emotional thrust of the inspired compositions of Avant-Garde music composers.</p>
<p>These stations, if you are interested in the sort of music that moves me, are a high form of musical expression, fueled by accident and chance, unique, unrepeatable, mysterious and deeply profound. Their lyrics are meaningful and meaningless. They are spoken by men, women, machine women and machine men. They are clearly designed by very creative, thoughtful, anonymous people. Add into this mix the distortions, reverberations and chance elements that the ionosphere superimposes on these “works” and the true nature of their purpose, and you get an art form, available worldwide, without precedent in human history.</p>
<p>This is why I released The Conet Project. It took me three years to compile it, and I destroyed my record label, and myself, to produce it.</p>
<p><b>Where does the name Conet Project come from?</b></p>
<p>It comes from the words spoken by one of the Numbers Stations which ended with the words “Konek.”</p>
<p><b>Some of the tracks actually sound like songs (i.e. “Gong Station Chimes”). Were you surprised by the musical nature of some of these?</b></p>
<p>Very. Not only is “The Gong Station” musical, but for example the Station XPH, which is not explicitly musical, has a mournful slow introduction, and its main body has a phrasing and tempo like a synthesized bagpipe piece. Many stations use music as identifiers, either recordings of pop songs or sets of tones repeating to notify the recipient. Or not. We do not know why these tones were used, because no one who was responsible for these stations has come forward to explain the reasoning behind the design of the transmissions.</p>
<p><b>Can you tell us a brief history of Irdial Recordings? How does a company gain a vision to put out a project like this?</b></p>
<p>Irdial-Discs started in 1987. I had some friends that were making wonderful music but who could not find a label to release their work, and I had some of my own work that I wanted to release that no one would release, so it became obvious that I should run my own label.</p>
<p>Irdial originally was designed to be a blend of Factory, Touch and New York Electro labels like Cutting as a starting point. I took all the things I loved about those labels, mixed them with the works of the people that I knew, and made something that was different to everything else out there in every way, from the sleeves to the sounds and the way we mastered recordings.</p>
<p>The most important thing for me is to not compromise. I hate compromise and accommodating the tastes and ideas of other people. And it has worked. It was clear to me that some of the people who were running record labels at the time that I launched Irdial were not really interested in what they were doing as an act of art. They were trying to balance breaking something new against the tastes of the audience, and they were frightened of taking risks.</p>
<p>Take for example, InSync&#8217;s 12-inch “Storm.” This track was mastered onto a cassette. It was rejected by several labels, simply because it was on a cassette. When I was offered it, I immediately mastered direct from the cassette and released it.</p>
<p>I tell this story because it demonstrates how people can&#8217;t think for themselves and can have something wonderful given to them on a plate but will reject it simply because they are not familiar with it, or because it comes in a format they mistakenly believe is “bad.”</p>
<p>Can you imagine what the answer would have been, had I turned up in a record label&#8217;s A&amp;R department with the idea for a quadruple CD of Numbers Stations, with an 80-page booklet? The only way great things like this can come to light is if someone takes the risk and refuses to follow the herd. That is why I run Irdial-Discs.</p>
<p><b>You release your recordings under the Free Music Philosophy, but here you’ve gone the direct-to-fan route. Can you talk about your choices here in terms of getting the recordings out there to your audience?</b></p>
<p>Back in 1999, we had been on the Internet for two years. Irdial was one of the first record labels on the Internet. It was clear to me, after spending years in the BBS scene and watching the Internet grow, that it made sense to spread your music everywhere rather than keep it bottled up. This is why The Conet Project has now been downloaded over one million times and is on computers, iPods and devices all over the world.</p>
<p>It would have been very difficult to do this without the Internet, and of course today, it’s not unusual to see tens of millions of views of pieces of music on YouTube. Giving away music makes sense; superdistribution is the future. The question is, is there a place for record labels anymore, what is the nature of that role if there is one, and how can artists that make music make enough money to allow them to spend all their time honing their art?</p>
<p>I think an answer is coming soon, and certainly an aggregating platform like PledgeMusic is going to be at the center of this new activity, where the owners of it are curators, filtering in (rather than out) the highest art so that people can find who is making the interesting work.</p>
<p>Since the Internet is essentially an infinite space, everyone can coalesce into their own communities so that no sound maker is left out, and rejection from one curator does not mean death, like it used to before the independent label and the Internet.</p>
<p>People need music in the same way they need food. Music makers have been kept away from their public by the scarcity imposed by physical sound carriers. Now that this has changed, it’s a matter of organizing these forces of nature with software and new contracts to increase the availability of art and get the right sounds to the right people, whilst making sure the sound makers can eat.</p>
<p>It’s an exciting time to be working in music, no doubt about it.</p>

				<small>Thursday, October 25th, 2012 by <strong>Irdial 1DnwFLXczVZV8kLJbMYoheUrpqHesjxrSi</strong></small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>We have had <a href="http://www.irdial.com/RIVPART2.PDF" title="">a long term interest in constitutions</a>, rights and the legitimacy of government. Now we get a chance to see some people in a country attempting to create a constitution from scratch.</p>
<p>A few people living in a place that is today called &#8216;Iceland&#8217; have <a href="http://stjornarskrarfelagid.is/?page_id=2619" title="stjornarskrarfelagid.is   &raquo; Constitutional Bill">decided, unilaterally, that they want and have the right to lay down the basic law of the place where they happen by chance to live, and that will be binding upon everyone, wether they like it or not</a>. Central to this scheme is the fact that no one will be able to opt out of this new &#8216;Constitution&#8217;, which will be imposed upon all people living there by violent force.</p>
<p>No doubt, people who are for this bogus process will claim that since the new constitution is to be put to a vote, that it is &#8220;fair&#8221;. Democracy is not fair. It is not just. It is mob rule and nothing more. It is not a justifying balm for immoral acts like stealing (taxation) or war-making. One thing is for sure, this constitution guarantees that the men living on what is called Iceland would be turned into slaves by this constitution. They would be robbed of their property, children and rights, and that is never a good thing.</p>
<p>Here we go&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Preamble</b></p>
<p>We, the people of Iceland, wish to create a just society with equal opportunities for everyone. Our different origins enrich the whole, and together we are responsible for the heritage of the generations, the land and history, nature, language and culture.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most of this is a statement of fact. Nothing wrong with that. There is a problem from the off however, with the idea of collective responsibility. People are only responsible for what they agree to be responsible for, and they cannot be made responsible for something by force. If this were not the case, anyone could be held responsible for the crimes of other men. If they had left out the word &#8216;together&#8217; this problem would not have arisen.</p>
<p>Men are responsible for the works they create, the land they own, the nature they use, and the culture they leave behind as the excrescence of their intellect. Curators of history and art preserve these artefacts for posterity. There is no need to invoke collectivism to make sure that this happens, and in fact, most of the history we have has been preserved and transmitted to us without it, by the charitable acts of good men.</p>
<blockquote><p>Iceland is a free and sovereign state, resting on the cornerstones of freedom, equality, democracy and human rights.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the real start of the problems. Someone, some man, is declaring that there is a place called &#8220;Iceland&#8221; and that in this fictitious place, the borders of which they have arbitrarily drawn, a &#8220;free and sovereign state&#8221; exists. They do not define what free means in this context; is the sovereign state free, or are the people who live there free? If the sovereign state is free, does it have an opinion on anything? Is it a living being that can be asked wether or not it is sovereign? Heaven knows there are some environmentalists out there who would seriously consider asking the ground if it consents for humans to live upon it.</p>
<p>Iceland is an island, that rests on a tectonic plate. It does not rest on freedom, equality, democracy and human rights. If you are going to claim that it does this, then you need to be plain about what these words actually mean. Rather than resort to bad preamble poetry, it is far better to speak plainly and carefully about these very important matters.</p>
<p>The precise nature of freedom is something people disagree about. There are some that use this word incorrectly, and use this mis-definition to create false rights, like a &#8220;right to the internet&#8221;. What if you are unfortunate enough to be born in Iceland and you want to have freedom from taxation? No doubt the people who are drafting this constitution would declare that this is not a valid freedom or right, but all the other things that they are declaring are, are.</p>
<p>The same goes for equality. Equality for them means that an employer must be forced by violence to pay all of his workers the same money no matter what his ideas are or contracts freely entered into specify, or what it means to his profitability and efficiency, or the capacity of the person offering her skills. In fact, this line does not even state what things it deems should be equal; do they mean that 1 should equal 1 in Iceland? Surely this cannot be the case, because their money is printed on and made out of paper and is backed by nothing, so they cannot be so rigorous in their maths.</p>
<blockquote><p>The government shall work for the welfare of the inhabitants of the country, strengthen their culture and respect the diversity of human life, the land and the biosphere.</p></blockquote>
<p>The inhabitants of a country should work for their own welfare, and keep the fruits of their own labor. If they are good people, they will reflexively support charities and the weak. They should not need a constitution enshrining a violent, immoral and thieving government that is going to carry out their civic and religious duties for them.</p>
<p>The same thing goes for culture. The Icelandic culture, its language, music arts and people came into being without central planning or &#8216;support&#8217;. It also did not need a State to support the diversity of human life, which is diverse without the help of bungling bureaucrats.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not even going to start on this idea of the &#8216;biosphere&#8217; which extends beyond the imaginary boundary lines of Iceland into the rest of the world. Is Iceland gong to go to war to stop people on the other side of the world from farting to protect the &#8216;biosphere&#8217;? This sort of lose language is very troubling, and displays a complete lack of understanding of the nature of man, of nature and of the State and the proper role of government.</p>
<blockquote><p>We wish to promote peace, security, well-being and happiness among ourselves and future generations. We resolve to work with other nations in the interests of peace and respect for the Earth and all Mankind.</p>
<p>In this light we are adopting a new Constitution, the supreme law of the land, to be observed by all.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is a good thing to wish to promote peace, security, well-being and happiness. The question is how you do it, and can you do it without becoming a violent criminal?</p>
<p>If Iceland doesn&#8217;t have an army, it cant participate in wars. This is important, because when these people say they want to promote peace, it really means sending armies to other countries to commit murder. You want to promote peace? Peace where exactly? Iceland is a peaceful place already by all accounts, so what this is doing here without specifics is very odd and ominous. The answer comes a few lines later, where the authors of this document declare that they want to work with other nations interests of all mankind. This actually means more war, more inflation, arbitrary and violent Statist restrictions and insanity. More, &#8220;one size fits all&#8221;, &#8220;our way of life is right and yours isn&#8217;t&#8221; totalitarianism. Absolutely disgusting.</p>
<p>The same goes for security; security of what and of whom? Wellbeing is a matter for doctors and their patients, and it has no place in a constitution. People are free to seek whatever care they like, on terms and with treatments that are suitable for them and this is no one&#8217;s business but yours. It certainly is not something that should be guaranteed in a constitution; healthcare is a good, not a right.</p>
<p>Now for happiness. Sado Masochists are happy when the flesh on their backs is being flayed off by a cat o nine tails. Should the constitution ensure this happiness? What on earth are these people talking about?</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Chapter I. Foundations</b></p>
<p><b><i>Article 1 Form of government</i></b></p>
<p>Iceland is a Republic governed by parliamentary democracy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is it now? And <i>why</i> is it? Whose decision was it? Why not some other form of government, or no government at all? Why a parliamentary democracy and not a democratic republic like the United States of America? Why not a country ruled by the Sharia? Who picked this form above all others? What are their names, and just who do they think they are that they can violently impose this on anyone?</p>
<blockquote><p><b><i>Article 2 Branches of government</i></b></p>
<p>The Althing holds legislative powers under a mandate from the nation.</p></blockquote>
<p>How can the &#8220;Icelandic people&#8221; remove this mandate? Is there a mechanism? If not, why not? Why this and not some other new body? You are redesigning the way the country is governed, why not throw everything out and start from year zero?</p>
<blockquote><p>The President of the Republic, Cabinet Ministers and the State government and other government authorities hold executive powers.</p></blockquote>
<p>What are &#8216;executive powers&#8217;? For those of you who do not know, executive powers are powers what put the executive above the ethics and morality that bind you as a non executive. Executives can order murder and theft without any consequence to themselves, whereas you cannot. They are a class above the law, immune from prosecution and able to wreak bloody havoc without fear of reprisal of any kind. There is no basis for creating a super class that is outside of morality and ethics. They are not super humans; all they need to do is collect enough votes. There is no clean logic behind this; its absurd and offensive that a law exempt group like this can be unleashed to steal, command and murder with impunity.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Supreme Court of Iceland and other courts of law hold judicial powers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just like that, by dint of thirteen words, the power to sit in judgement over men is granted to an unelected body, with an absolute monopoly on dispensing justice. In a free country, men would be able to select whatever court suits them in their philosophies, contracts and dealings. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever why the State should have a monopoly on justice, or anything else for that matter. Icelanders are building themselvs a geothermal prison island, pure and simple.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Article 3 Territory</b></p>
<p>The Icelandic territorial land forms a single and indivisible whole. The boundaries of the Icelandic territorial sea, airspace and economic jurisdiction shall be decided by law.</p></blockquote>
<p>What this part is saying is that the drafters of this constitution are claiming the island of Iceland for themselves, and they are daring anyone to come and take it from them. They have no authority to claim this land over anyone else, they have no prior claim over the whole territory, and their claim is just as valid as anyone else who decides to whip up their own constitution in a drunken stupor and who can rally enough people to defend their property. This is gorilla chest beating, and nothing more.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Article 4 Citizenship</b></p>
<p>Persons with a parent of Icelandic nationality shall have the right to Icelandic citizenship. In other respects, citizenship shall be granted in accordance with law.</p>
<p>No one may be deprived of Icelandic citizenship.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is no &#8220;right of Icelandic citizenship&#8221;; what they are actually referring to here is the <i>privilege of Icelandic citizenship</i>. Or more accurately, this is a clause consigning all Icelanders and their offspring to perpetual slavery by birth. Note how there is no language here to say what steps can be taken to renounce or escape from Icelandic citizenship.</p>
<blockquote><p>An Icelandic citizen cannot be barred from entering Iceland nor deported from Iceland. The rights of aliens to enter and reside in Iceland, and the reasons for which they may be deported, shall be laid down by law.</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe that someone behind this part is a fan of The Pirate Bay. Does this mean that the government of Iceland will never sign extradition treaties with the other nations of the world? They are so keen to promote and, &#8220;work with other nations in the interests of peace&#8221;, how are they going to refuse to extradite &#8216;terrorists&#8217; when Uncle Sam comes asking? <a href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=2278" title="BLOGDIAL  &raquo; Blog Archive   &raquo; Parliament put on notice: DON&#8217;T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!">Their country was already called a terrorist state over the Landsbanki affair</a>; perhaps this is why this clause is in here.</p>
<p>Do you see what I did there? I called it, &#8220;Their country&#8221;. The Statist disease is very infectious!</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Article 5 Duties of citizens</b></p>
<p>The government is required to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to enjoy the rights and freedoms provided for in this Constitution.</p>
<p>Everyone shall observe this Constitution in all respects, as well as legislation, obligations and rights that derive from the Constitution.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is nothing more than a declaration of war against the free people living in Iceland. What if you are living there and you do not want to enjoy the &#8220;rights and freedoms&#8221; this scandalous document pretends to confer on you? What if you are philosophically opposed to this constitution, or even a small part of it? You are being told here, if you are &#8220;Icelandic&#8221;, that you shall observe the Constitution in ALL RESPECTS. Its outrageous, presumptuous, disgusting and extremely violent.</p>
<p><i><b>But it gets worse.</b></i></p>
<blockquote><p><b><i>Chapter II. Human rights and nature</i></b></p>
<p><b>Article 6 Equality</b></p>
<p>We are all equal before the law and shall enjoy human rights without discrimination with regard to gender, age, genotype, residence, financial position, disability, sexual orientation, race, opinions, political affiliation, religion, language, origin, family or position in other respects.</p>
<p>Men and women shall enjoy equal rights in all respects.</p></blockquote>
<p>You cannot have a section like this without defining what &#8216;human rights&#8217; are. Part of the reason there is such an absurd and long laundry list of what the authors of this scabrous document assume are different types of people is that they do not understand what rights are, where they come from or what a human being is. Anyone who understands what rights are does not have to make a comprehensive list of the different things people can classify, believe and do with themselves. Human beings have rights that encompass all of these things automatically, but in order to understand this, you must know what rights are; the people who wrote this garbage, do not.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Article 7 The right to life</b></p>
<p>Everyone is born with the right to life.</p>
<p><b>Article 8 Human dignity</b></p>
<p>Everyone shall be guaranteed the right to live with dignity. The diversity of human life shall be respected in every regard.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is no &#8220;right to life&#8221;. Everyone that is alive has a property right in themselves; this is the true right that these people are trying to and are failing to enumerate. The bogus &#8220;right to life&#8221; is what men use to stop women from having control over their bodies. Once again, Statists are making up rights that they use as a pretext for their violent State.</p>
<p>Similarly, there is no &#8220;right to live with dignity&#8221;. What you might think is dignified is anathema to Muslims. Will this Icelandic constitution enshrine arranged marriages, female circumcision, Halal butchers, all of which are considered necessary for Muslims to live lives of dignity? What about the right to commit suicide, home educate your children, live up a tree with birds or down in a hole with snakes? When they talk about the diversity of human life, do they <i>really mean it</i>, or do they mean just <i>the diversity that they find acceptable in the Icelandic culture of their forefathers?</i> What If someone doesn&#8217;t like their courts, and wants to set up a Sharia court? Will this be &#8220;respected in every regard&#8221;? I think not somehow. This is nonsense on stilts, and an invitation to conflict.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Article 9 Protection of rights</b></p>
<p>The government is at all times required to protect the citizens against violations of human rights, whether committed by public authorities or others.</p></blockquote>
<p>What are rights, and where do they come from? Do I, as an Icelander have a right to my own property, and if someone from public authority wants to steal from me (taxation) against my will, will the Icelandic State run to my defence? Without defining what rights are, these passages are nothing more than hollow rattling noise. Dangerous nose. Dangerous because any Statist can hang whatever they like on the phrase, &#8220;Human Rights&#8221; and then use that as a pretext to violate Icelanders.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Article 10 Security</b></p>
<p>Everyone shall be guaranteed security and protection against violence of any kind, such as sexual violence, inside and outside the home.</p></blockquote>
<p>Violence of any kind; like theft? And <i>guaranteed?</i> Do these people even know what the word &#8216;guarantee&#8217; means? And of course, these guarantees are not in force if the theft is done to you by the State of course, when they steal your money, or force your children to attend their vile schools.</p>
<p>By saying that they are going to protect people inside their homes, they are saying that they are claiming the power to enter your home on whatever pretext they can dream up in their nightmare of a system. You are not safe anywhere in Iceland under this constitution, which is an interesting byproduct of this clause that is meant to enshrine your safety.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Article 11 Protection of privacy</b></p>
<p>The protection of personal privacy and the privacy of home and family shall be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Bodily or personal search, or a search of a person’s premises or possessions, is permitted only in accordance with the decision of a court of law or specific permission by law. The same applies to the examination of documents and mail, communications by telephone and other telecommunications, and to any other comparable interference with a person’s right to privacy.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the first paragraph above, personal privacy and privacy of the home or family may be restricted by a specific provision of law if urgently necessary for the protection of the rights of others.</p></blockquote>
<p>The only threat to privacy in any country is the State. The State, which has backdoor access to almost everything is the number one violator of privacy world-wide. Iceland has its Icelandic ID number (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennitala">kennitala</a>) which is forced upon all Iceland dwellers at birth, without a chance to opt out. Without even bothering to check, I will bet that you cannot open a bank account without one, or rent a property or travel outside of Iceland unless you have been issued one. So much for their pipe dreams of privacy being guaranteed. It&#8217;s utter rubbish.</p>
<p>Note how they say &#8216;bodily search&#8217; by whom? They are referring to the police of course, who are also a monopoly service. They are referring to the airport customs officers who can search anyone, not for security, but for revenue generation for the State, and who are also a monopoly. And who makes the laws permitting these violations? Why, the monopoly State of course.</p>
<p>There is no &#8216;right to privacy&#8217;; this is another made up right that has no basis in the nature of man, and even if it did, they claim that Icelanders have this right with their left hand, but then with the right hand they erase this right by saying that the police, customs and other &#8216;officials&#8217; can violate this right for the purposes of the State. It is as insane as that last passage reads.</p>
<p><b>And now, the <i>Pièce de résistance</i>&#8230;</b></p>
<blockquote><p><b>Article 12 Children’s rights</b></p>
<p>All children shall be guaranteed by law the protection and care that their well-being requires.</p>
<p>The best interests of the child shall always take precedence when decisions are made regarding a child’s affairs.</p>
<p>A child shall be guaranteed the right to express its views regarding all its affairs, and just account shall be taken of the child’s views in accordance with its age and maturity.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is nothing more than a Paedophile&#8217;s Article, claiming all Icelandic children as the property and chattel of the State.</p>
<p>Parents are the owners of their children, and we have been over this <a href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?cat=48" title="BLOGDIAL   &raquo; Home Schooling">many times on BLOGDIAL with reference to Home Education</a>. This is the sort of clause that destroys human nature, corrupts the human family structure and replaces the parent with the State.</p>
<p>This clause does not define who determines what is in the best interest of any child unfortunate enough to live in the Icelandic prison state, it does not say who makes these decisions, and does not specify what a child&#8217;s affairs are as distinct from the lives they live as members of a family.</p>
<p>These people are absolutely horrible, inhuman and disgusting. Its no wonder that <a href="http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2011/07/01/only-one-child-in-iceland-home-schooled/" title="Only one child in Iceland home schooled | IceNews - Daily News">there is only one Home Educating family in Iceland</a>.</p>
<p>Children are granted the right to express their views. What? They already have the property right in their own bodies, that includes their mouths, which they can use to utter whatever they like. They do not need the State to give them what they already have. As for &#8220;a just account shall be taken&#8221;, what exactly does this mean? Who will take a just account, and who decides what is just and what is unjust? How dare these subhumans try and usurp the property of a parent in this disgusting way? Who decides what age is appropriate for what thoughts and desires? Who decides who is mature and who is not?</p>
<p>The people who wrote this <b><u>are extremely sick and dangerous</u></b>.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Article 13 Right of ownership</b></p>
<p>The right of private ownership shall be inviolate. No one may be obliged to surrender his property unless required by the public interest. Such a measure requires permission by law, and full compensation shall be paid.</p>
<p>Ownership rights entail obligations as well as restrictions in accordance with law</p></blockquote>
<p>The right of private ownership is inviolate, unless its your money, your self, or your children, which the Icelandic State is making a de-facto prior claim on if this constitution comes into force. What the public interest is is never defined in this absurd document, which means that it can mean anything at all. Your children can be forced to go to school for the public interest, 90% of your earnings can be stolen for the public interest, you can be forbidden foods and drink in the public interest, your house can be destroyed so that a road can be laid down in the public interest, and so on. Full compensation? For a child&#8217;s life? For a lifetime&#8217;s work? I think not.</p>
<p>Ownership rights, like any other fake right created by the State, is not a true right at all, but is instead, a noose around your neck. It is a means to justify stealing your money and your children from you. These documents always include leverage points where any law can be passed and subsequently nullified by the constitution, &#8220;in accordance with law&#8221; which is the phrase that achieves this. It means that the paedophiles, thieves, crony capitalists and scumbags in any future Icelandic parliament simply have to pass a law to sweep away your rights. This is not how decent people think or behave.</p>

<p>For the record I am not picking on Iceland because Iceland is a particularly bad example, or Icelandic people are inherently evil or anything remotely like that. All of the Icelandic people I have ever met have been perfectly gentlemanly, kind, considerate and peaceful. This is an examination of <i>principles</i> that can be applied to any country with a constitution or that is considering one like it, and this proposed basic law is nothing more than a convenient foil. I could have just as easily chosen Honduras, whose monopoly judiciary has just unilaterally declared that men cannot build a free city, because it would be &#8216;unconstitutional&#8217;. This proposed constitution is but one of many such bad, fundamentally flawed documents, most of them already in force somewhere on the globe, and Iceland drew the short straw because the people there have had the guts to fend off the banksters, and seem to understand that they can build a different sort of country from scratch. This is very brave, and I wish them luck.</p>
<p>What they need to do if they are going to redesign their country is to work from the correct principles, understand what the true meaning of the words they are using are, try and <a href="http://mises.org/rothbard/newlibertywhole.asp" title="For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto - Murray N. Rothbard">get a grip on Economics, rights</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khRkBEdSDDo&amp;feature=plcp">why</a> monopolies in law and security <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kPyrq6SEL0">are a bad thing</a>, and then, maybe, just <i>maybe</i>, they will be able to come up with something robust that will increase their prosperity and protect their rights from predation. One thing is for sure; what this proposed constitution is, is as far away from what is needed as you can get.</p>
<p>Sadly, none of the people who are behind its drafting are even named, so that you cant put the blame where it belongs. It also gives you a false sense of consensus; for all we know, it was written by three drunks and a smack addict on a copypasta binge. It makes you wonder what they are frightened of, that they cannot put their names a document they purportedly believe in, which is going to be used to violently control the people of the entire country. The founding fathers of the United States of America, for all their flaws, all put their names to the documents they produced to create that great country. That is the act of men with guts, who actually believed what they were doing was right, and who were willing to die for what they believed in.</p>
<p>In any case, all of this would have been be moot if <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=thiel+libertarian+honduras&amp;oq=thiel+libertarian+honduras&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Peter Theil and the other Libertarians working to create a free country in Honduras</a> had been successful. Everyone with a wish to be free would have fled to that new free country. The entrepreneurs, the creative and the able, fleeing countries like Iceland, would have left only the incapable, the unable, evil, socialist and stupid. No one would have been left to run the economy, make things or operate anything.</p>
<p>Does this <a href="http://kat.ph/atlas-shrugged-part-1-limited-2011-brrip-xvid-lore-novasetrg-t5942165.html" title="Download Atlas Shrugged Part 1 LIMITED 2011 BRRip XviD-LORE NovasetRG Torrent - KickassTorrents">sound familiar</a>? If the people shaping Iceland&#8217;s future have any sense at all, they should call Peter Theil and ask him how to set up a country for maximum prosperity and liberty, rather than drafting hollow imitations of broken constitutions.</p>

					<p>There is a great deal of deeply seated confusion about corporations, their origins and true purpose. People who are intelligent and well read in the field of the philosophy of liberty sometimes fall short when it comes to understanding what a corporation is, why people use them and what the true nature of them are. On the one hand, they are for voluntary association, and yet on the other, they rail against corporations. This is illogical.</p>
<p>As it is with anything complex, clear thinking is needed when you try to think about corporations. Lets begin by taking apart the myth that they exist as creatures of the State.</p>
<p>There is no reason that in a free society without a State that a group of people cannot band together to work on a project under rules that they select for themselves. They pool their risk, and (for example) decide that they do not want to put all their capital on the line should something go wrong and face a court, however founded, deciding that they are liable. <a href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=3324#more-3324" class="more-link">Read the rest of this entry &raquo;</a></p>

					<p>From BLOGDIAL, &#8220;The answer comes before the question&#8221; January 13th, 2009</p>
<p><a href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=1517" title="BLOGDIAL  &raquo; Blog Archive   &raquo; The answer comes before the question">http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=1517</a></p>
<blockquote><p>[...]</p>
<p>Imagine this scenario. Someone somewhere sets up a Web 2.0 site that features photos of bad police and other officials, or those mysterious agent provocateurs that have been plaguing the useless demonstrations around the world. Imagine that the software behind this site (which could be connected to iPhoto 09) identifies all the bad people and exposes them to the public, nullifying all acts of political infiltration over night. Anyone setting up any sort of anti-state gathering or demonstration or action could, with a gauntlet of workers armed with iphones, vet every demonstrator as they turned up to weed out all the infiltrators, collaborators and provocateurs.</p>
<p>I guarantee you that this will happen, and not only that, but that someone is going to put into a copy of iPhoto 09, a huge archive of photos from demonstrations and political meetings going back decades to pick out the bad guys.</p>
<p>This explosion and convergence of technologies is a double edged sword, and since there are more of us than there are of them, it will be the case that all this technology and the networks that join them together will result in something totally unexpected; the tools may turn around and bite the state in the ass in an unexpected way. The very nature of networks says that this will happen; the population by virtue of its vast networked numbers can overpower any government in a scenario where the network is the power.</p>
<p>We are not powerless like the slaves in the Soviet Union were. We have fantastic tools, all of them free, right in our hands. Those tools, by the act of using them, change the game entirely, and the more the state pushes against the mass, the more dense and impenetrable it becomes.</p>
<p>This is a war that they cannot ever win.</p>

<p>Stephan is a great thinker, but it seems that what he cannot do is empathise with other people.</p>
<p>While he is sipping coffee in his house in Canada, Hillary Clinton and Obama are at this moment concocting another lie / pretext to unleash mass murder on people, namely Iran:</p>
<p><a href="http://politics.salon.com/2011/10/12/the_very_scary_iranian_terror_plot/singleton/">http://politics.salon.com/2011/10/12/the_very_scary_iranian_terror_plot/singleton/</a></p>
<p>Canada, which he funds with his taxes by his own admission, will no doubt be a part of this criminal act.</p>
<p>Should Ron Paul become president before they are able to launch this mass murder, he will be able to prevent it.</p>
<p>For this reason alone, Ron Paul should be supported. Its all very well sitting in the safety of your own home in the empire, and paying taxes to support it, complaining that Ron Paul doesn&#8217;t want to dismantle the state, while your money is being used to kill Iranian children. <a href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=3320#more-3320" class="more-link">Read the rest of this entry &raquo;</a></p>

					<p>It is often said that plastic surgery does not enhance a person&#8217;s beauty but simply provides a means for the surgeon to manifest their own idea of beauty through other people &#8211; further, that the number of such distinct faces in Hollywood is barely greater than the number of plastic surgeons.</p>
<p>What we see is a number of metrics are used to determine a &#8216;good&#8217; face &#8211; certain lips, eye shapes, cheek bulges, line of nose and jaw &#8211; to be more beautiful is stricter conformance to the surgeons criteria.</p>
<p>Similarly there are now companies which purport to determine one&#8217;s online influence, the companies again take narrow metrics (Web 2.0 presence primarily), blend through an algorithm and spit out a result at the other end; there are people stupid enough to think this result matters and who will pay for advice on how to get a better result i.e. become more conformant to a particular company&#8217;s algorithm.</p>
<p>There is an implicit credulity in these scenarios that makes no sense &#8211; why would you trust a stranger&#8217;s idea of betterness over your own instincts (let alone one stranger vs. another). The problem boils down to a sense of insecurity and conditioning.</p>
<p>In plastic surgery it may be the combined forces of the media to portray a certain body type, on the web there are certain traits which gain most attention &#8211; insight is often overlooked in preference to boosterism, the performer who keeps the plate spinning gains more attention than the potter &#8211; and interaction rarely amounts to little more than petty ridicule.</p>
<p>As we know the use of metrics to assess people isn&#8217;t a new phenomenon, credit rating agencies sway the ability of people to gain loans and your flight data are catalogued by security agencies for watch lists. In addition anonymity and atomisation are nearly always inversely proportional to traction &#8211; the braggard or chancer is favoured as the focus of the spectacle.</p>
<p>Whereas a silicon valley company can expect to garner some interest and narrow influence due to a bit of parasitical number crunching it will have little long term effect as people become bored with the personality pyramid scheme it embodies, something as vacuous and thin as the &#8216;Hollywood face&#8217; or the &#8216;No-fly list&#8217;.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>You may have seen there is &#8216;outrage&#8217; from leftists and liberals in the UK that state handouts &#8211; benefits &#8211; are proposed to be capped at £24,000 per year. George Monbiot, for example, <a title="Twat" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/nov/21/for-corporate-welfare-queens-no-caps?INTCMP=SRCH" target="_blank">bleats until his green-eyes pop out of his misguided head</a> about the rich, hard-working business people who should be punished for earning their money. Just when you think he has proposed the most stupid idea possible, he comes up with,<a title="Fucking Twat" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jan/23/george-monbiot-executive-pay-robbery" target="_blank"> instead of a benefits cap, a wages cap!</a></p>
<p>But back to benefits.</p>
<p>£24,000 net equivalent to an income of over £32,000 per year for a working family. Unfortunately many benefits claimants are sadly unable to survive on such a meagre sum when having to not work or contribute meaningfully to society for the privilege of receiving the money.</p>
<p>The <a title="BBQ Benefits cap" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16812185" target="_blank">BBQ, of all people, have provided an example of how a family would be affected</a> by having their benefits reduced from over £30,000 to the proposed cap of just £24,000.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16812185"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.769imaging.com/769imaging/LOLcaps.jpg?resize=447%2C498" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>So, should tax-payers support these people? Let&#8217;s see how they struggle&#8230;</p>
<p>Current benefits: £30, 284 of money taken under threat of force from people who work for a living. More than half of it just as a reward for having bred uncontrollably.</p>
<p>£91 per week &#8216;other outgoings&#8217;: to keep the kids happy via consumerism, apparently. You don&#8217;t believe the crap about school trips, every week, do you?</p>
<p>£20 per week &#8216;entertainment&#8217;: your taxes buy this man a night out at the pub. Every week. Does he deserve this respite from his seven children and wife? Would you give him that money charitably?</p>
<p>£15 per week on SKY TV: &#8216;<em>We get the Sky Movies package because we&#8217;re stuck in the house all week &#8211; otherwise we wouldn&#8217;t have any entertainment</em>.&#8217;  How did people survive before SKY TV? Will the family unit collapse if they have to resort to library books and freeview? Or talking to each other, heaven forbid!</p>
<p>£30 transport: his eldest son is scamming him for most of this if he believes 5 return bus rides to college are £30.</p>
<p>£32 per week on mobiles: &#8216;<em>My wife and I have mobile phones, and so do all of the teenage children. You try telling teenagers they&#8217;re going to have to do without their mobiles and there&#8217;ll be hell to pay</em>.&#8217; Your taxes are saving this man from growing a pair and keeping his children in a world of &#8216;whine and it shall be given&#8217;.</p>
<p>Energy: &#8216; <em>If they do cut our benefit we are going to have to choose between eating and heating the house properly</em>.&#8217; Or choose between mobiles and heating. Or beer and heating. Or fags and heating. NEVER believe these sob stories from ill-disciplined and spineless, willpower-lacking, <a title="Idiocracy" href="http://www.glumbert.com/media/idiocracy" target="_blank">idiocracy-generating fuckwits</a>.</p>
<p>Rent £76 per week: As your state-sponsored incubus notes, this would be much more expensive were it private. Hence you are ACTUALLY paying much more than the £76 per week, as you are subsidizing the housing cost already, before a small portion of the cost is charged to, and then reclaimed by and from, our father-of-seven. All that admin costs too.</p>
<p>Shopping £240 per week. <strong>Includes food and household goods, 24 cans of lager, 200 cigarettes and a large pouch of tobacco. </strong>Has &#8216;Ray&#8217; sent you so much as a card to say thanks for the fags and booze you buy him every week? And of course none of these &#8216;essentials&#8217; could be sacrificed, which makes these proposed benefits cuts so damaging to people like Ray.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to pick on people like Ray, and so it should be! He moans that &#8220;The market for my skills dried up 10 years ago &#8211; there&#8217;s a total lack of work in my area of expertise.&#8221; but has spent TEN YEARS breeding and little else. Retrain, do menial work, start a business, anything!</p>
<p>Stop supporting Ray and his work-shy ilk and let him remember where he left his self-respect, or let him rot in his own filth, before you find yourself sat at home on your recliner toilet chair <a title="Your Children's Future" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAg1r6zw7Bg&amp;feature=related&amp;noredirect=1" target="_blank">watching nothing but this</a>.</p>

					<p>The unintelligent, inexperienced and completely deluded students are out again in force, to be kettled, sheared, abused and used as fodder to provide the police with much needed overtime money.</p>
<p>What is interesting here is that we may be seeing the seed of the idea that all the video cameras that everyone has by default could be used for something useful, active and defensive, instead of just a child&#8217;s toy.</p>
<p>From BLOGDIAL, &#8220;The answer comes before the question&#8221; January 13th, 2009</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine this scenario. Someone somewhere sets up a Web 2.0 site that features photos of bad police and other officials, or those mysterious agent provocateurs that have been plaguing the useless demonstrations around the world. Imagine that the software behind this site (which could be connected to iPhoto 09) identifies all the bad people and exposes them to the public, nullifying all acts of political infiltration over night. Anyone setting up any sort of anti-state gathering or demonstration or action could, with a gauntlet of workers armed with iphones, vet every demonstrator as they turned up to weed out all the infiltrators, collaborators and provocateurs.</p>
<p>I guarantee you that this will happen, and not only that, but that someone is going to put into a copy of iPhoto 09, a huge archive of photos from demonstrations and political meetings going back decades to pick out the bad guys.</p>
<p>This explosion and convergence of technologies is a double edged sword, and since there are more of us than there are of them, it will be the case that all this technology and the networks that join them together will result in something totally unexpected; the tools may turn around and bite the state in the ass in an unexpected way. The very nature of networks says that this will happen; the population by virtue of its vast networked numbers can overpower any government in a scenario where the network is the power.</p>
<p>We are not powerless like the slaves in the Soviet Union were. We have fantastic tools, all of them free, right in our hands. Those tools, by the act of using them, change the game entirely, and the more the state pushes against the mass, the more dense and impenetrable it becomes.</p>
<p>This is a war that they cannot ever win.</p>
<p><a href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=1517" title="BLOGDIAL  &raquo; Blog Archive   &raquo; The answer comes before the question">http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=1517</a></p>
<p>[...]</p></blockquote>
<p>Now look at this video, uploaded to YouTube by noshockdoc on Nov 11, 2011:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/QntZh4ISUoQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>If these people had any sense, they would have already set up this web service as I described in 2009.</p>
<p>Using Augmented Reality ID:</p>
<p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/tb0pMeg1UN0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>They could check each &#8216;protestor&#8217; against the online database of Agent Provocateurs and police officers to make sure that they had not been infiltrated.</p>
<p>Of course, anyone who is that smart is not interested in demonstrating in the first place, but we will leave that aside for now.</p>
<p>The point is, these young and very foolish people are behaving as if it is 1960 and not the end of 2011. As I have said before, again and again, the age of demonstrations is over. The shape of them, how they play out, move, surge and flow is well understood. There can be no surprises with them. Nothing comes of them, no matter how large they are, as we saw with the StopWar demonstrations before the destruction of Iraq.</p>
<p>The problem these people have is that if they were intelligent enough to know this, they would not be demonstrating, and would be well on the way to formulating a strategy that would actually give them what they want. Their problem, clearly, is a toxic mix of a lack of intelligence and experience.</p>
<p>They do not know exactly what they hope to achieve with these acts, they have no discrete goals or deliverables, they have no means of creating a new strategy because they lack the mental capacity to formulate one; in other words, they are a completely lost cause.</p>
<p>One thing that is coming out of this is interesting however.</p>
<p>Because everyone has a camera at these demonstrations, it might come to pass that the light bulb switches on over the head of some computer science student as she realises that it should be possible to create what I describe in the post above.</p>
<p>There are literally dozens of cameras in this clip; surely someone somewhere must be thinking that there is a use that can be put to the footage to help weed out the provocateurs. Who knows?</p>
<p>What we can say with a high level of certainty is that these students are going to achieve nothing by marching in the street. Everything they are planning, even if it is not known about in advance by surveillance is easily counter-able because marching and demonstrating is a &#8216;dead tactic&#8217; that the State has a perfect understanding of.</p>
<p>All of this is a complete distraction of course; even this very post has distracted me from doing something else productive. Unless by chance it spurs the creation of the system I have been writing about.</p>
<p>Once again, demonstrations are &#8216;Yellow Ribbon Thinking&#8217;:</p>
<p><a href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=1152" title="BLOGDIAL  &raquo; Blog Archive   &raquo; Thinking about Yellow Ribbon Thinking">http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=1152</a></p>
<p>they divert energy from useful acts and thinking, and prevent or delay permanent solutions from emerging. You should not participate in them; instead, you should be working only on things that have discreet goals and that has metrics that you can measure directly so that you can know if you are being successful or not.</p>

					<p>As the empire starts to crumble, and the talking heads in the MSM dwindle in influence, replaced by the likes of Alex Jones and Infowars, desperation methods are being rolled out to try and sabotage alternative and social networking media.</p>
<p>It will not work.</p>
<p>The problem they have is one of reputation, and six degrees of separation.</p>
<p>Because everyone is connected to everyone else by only six steps, it is now impossible to inject a lie into the hive mind of The Mass and have that lie survive scrutiny.</p>
<p>We have spoken about <a href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=554" title="BLOGDIAL  &raquo; Blog Archive   &raquo; Gordon G. Brown will never get it">The Mass before on BLOGDIAL</a>; it is the accurate prediction of the Twitter mediated hive mind that is impervious to the State and its lies.</p>
<p>Even if this vile attack on the truth through manipulation and lies was successful in any way, countermeasures can be built in software that would completely eradicate the influence of these glove puppet agents provocateurs.</p>
<p>Using the model of the <a href="http://www.rubin.ch/pgp/weboftrust.en.html" title="PGP: Explanation of the web of trust of PGP">PGP web of trust</a> and the fact of six degrees of separation, it is possible to build a self organising, self healing global network of trusted introducers who can re-tweet only what is known to have not come from a glove puppet.</p>
<p>These trusted introducers and their messages would carry more weight than any glove puppet, and in fact, Twitter almost does this spontaneously through its simple method of people following each other and getting to know the sort of tweets that come out of the people they follow.</p>
<p>Anyone who uses these social networking tools understands that un-following is instant, adaptive network healing; if someone you follow says something that is a lie you either refute them by replying in public or un-following them and never again re tweeting their messages.</p>
<p>These simple actions are like the behaviour of antibodies fighting off infection, in this case, the infection of lies told by lying glove puppets.</p>
<p>These military people simply do not understand the world the are now living in. They cannot use their ridiculous twentieth century PSYOP strategies by &#8216;<a href="http://fyeahsymbionictitan.tumblr.com/post/4317668489" title="Sym-Bionic Titan">upgrading</a>&#8216; them and superimposing them on Twitter; it simply will not transpose to these media.</p>
<p>What they must now realise is that <i>lying as a strategy is finished</i>. This would be the breakthrough that would put them on a strong footing for total domination of the social networking space. Sadly (or happily) they simply have not got a clue, nor the ethical foundation to make the correct strategic decision.</p>
<p>Lets do this!</p>
<blockquote><p>The US military is developing software that will let it secretly manipulate social media sites by using fake online personas to influence internet conversations and spread pro-American propaganda.</p></blockquote>
<p>They will fail.</p>
<blockquote><p>A Californian corporation has been awarded a contract with United States Central Command (Centcom), which oversees US armed operations in the Middle East and Central Asia, to develop what is described as an &#8220;online persona management service&#8221; that will allow one US serviceman or woman to control up to 10 separate identities based all over the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait a minute, is it the US Military, or is it some snake-oil salesman in California who made a successful pitch?</p>
<blockquote><p>The project has been likened by web experts to China&#8217;s attempts to control and restrict free speech on the internet.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is utter nonsense, Grauniad style. Censorship has nothing to do with organised glove puppetry; everyone can continue saying whatever it is they like, unimpeded. Can these morons even define the words they are using? Shocking stupidity, and par for the course at the Grauniad!</p>
<blockquote><p>Critics are likely to complain that it will allow the US military to create a false consensus in online conversations, crowd out unwelcome opinions and smother commentaries or reports that do not correspond with its own objectives.</p></blockquote>
<p>Critics are nothing more than cry babies whining instead of writing software. As I say above, a web of trust can be built either spontaneously or with software designed to tamp down glove puppetry and MILCOMTROLLS. You can always spot trolls very easily, especially when they use templates or multiple identities to spam comments. The Telegraph comments sections are full of garbage; all you have to do to tune it out however, is to set Disqus to &#8216;best rated&#8217;.</p>
<p>The single act of people rating comments up (and not down, there is no downvote button) crowd-sources the bullshit out of sight. If an organised team of MILCOMTROLLS tries to hijack the comments, it is always the case that the best refuting comment outshines the glove puppetry, and the takeover backfires completely.</p>
<p>The people who put this contract out to tender have absolutely no idea how any of this works, and it is going to backfire on them spectacularly. Just ask <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/social-media/8763841/Journalist-Johann-Hari-returns-George-Orwell-prize-after-admitting-plagiarism.html" title="Journalist Johann Hari returns George Orwell prize after admitting plagiarism - Telegraph">Johan Hari about how Google can expose misdeeds in English</a>. Any MILCOMTROLLS that try and poison threads or spin the hash tags will be spotted, outed and crowded out, reinforcing the exact opposite messages that they are trying to push.</p>
<blockquote><p>The discovery that the US military is developing false online personalities – known to users of social media as &#8220;sock puppets&#8221; – could also encourage other governments, private companies and non-government organisations to do the same.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what? Its just like other governments wanting nuclear weapons because the USA has them, or countries like India wanting ID Cards because most European countries have them.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Centcom contract stipulates that each fake online persona must have a convincing background, history and supporting details, and that up to 50 US-based controllers should be able to operate false identities from their workstations &#8220;without fear of being discovered by sophisticated adversaries&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is unfeasible, and if it is feasible, the web of trust can isolate and expunge these glove puppets. Also, consider that when individuals write blog comments or send tweets, they think about what they are writing, instead of working from a script. The only way this MILCOMTROLL plan could possibly work is if they hired individuals to write from the MILCOM point of view, genuinely on a case by case basis, with the target articles distributed to them for attack.</p>
<p>You cannot create a fool proof system where one person can control ten identities and not be crowded out or discovered. Because each of these identities, credible or not, will all be propagating the same point of view, this fact alone would be enough to characterise, isolate, and quarantine them.</p>
<blockquote><p>Centcom spokesman Commander Bill Speaks said: &#8220;The technology supports classified blogging activities on foreign-language websites to enable Centcom to counter violent extremist and enemy propaganda outside the US.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Ron Paul 2021!</p>
<blockquote><p>He said none of the interventions would be in English, as it would be unlawful to &#8220;address US audiences&#8221; with such technology, and any English-language use of social media by Centcom was always clearly attributed. The languages in which the interventions are conducted include Arabic, Farsi, Urdu and Pashto.</p></blockquote>
<p>Its unlawful to glove puppet in English for American audiences, but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnem1Ohm3Q0" title="When The President Can Kill Whoever He Wants - YouTube">its A-OK to ASSASSINATE Americans</a>.</p>
<p>You cant make this stuff up.</p>
<blockquote><p>Centcom said it was not targeting any US-based web sites, in English or any other language, and specifically said it was not targeting Facebook or Twitter.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lies lies and more lies.</p>
<blockquote><p>Once developed, the software could allow US service personnel, working around the clock in one location, to respond to emerging online conversations with any number of co-ordinated messages, blogposts, chatroom posts and other interventions. Details of the contract suggest this location would be MacDill air force base near Tampa, Florida, home of US Special Operations Command.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once again, coordinated messages will be identified and neutralised. Think about this as a possible way of destroying the effectiveness of this dastardly plan.</p>
<p><a href="http://akismet.com/" title="Comment spam prevention for your blog - Akismet">Akismet</a> is a distributed tool for eliminating spam. It is 99.99% effective. A system like that could be used to completely eliminate the occurrence of glove puppets and mass up/downvoters.</p>
<p>Since these people will be working in a coordinated way, their acts will be synchronised. It will be possible to identify them as a group and then systematically exclude them from showing up in comments or as up-votes. Digg has some experience in this, where massive groups of paid Diggers were organised to push stories onto the front page. Since these people all work together, it only takes a few instances of them working to simultaneously to generate a unique fingerprint of their behaviour, which can then be tested against when future MILCOMTROLL style attacks are initiated.</p>
<p>Of course, all this happens silently in the software, so like SEOs trying to game Google, they will meet with a very serious problem the instant they roll this programme out. Anyone working with Gmail knows that it is spam free. This proves that distributed, collaborative filtering and secret sauce software can work to keep out the bad guys.</p>
<blockquote><p>Centcom&#8217;s contract requires for each controller the provision of one &#8220;virtual private server&#8221; located in the United States and others appearing to be outside the US to give the impression the fake personas are real people located in different parts of the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>These people are not going to be posting in English. This is a big hurdle for the glove puppets who are going to be operating their MILCOMTROLL identities. Online credibility is not just a matter of getting an accurate word for word translation of an idea; there are cultural references, nuances and cues that the American military are notoriously and hopelessly bad at. Can you imagine some shorn headed operative in jungle camo, sitting in an air conditioned room in Tampa Florida, trying to pass herself off as a muslim man in Riyadh? Or ten <i>different people</i> in Riyadh?!</p>
<p>The whole idea is simply ridiculous, and in fact the targets of this rubbish will not need any special software to detect these MILCOMTROLLS, they will give themselves away when they post during prayers or some other stupid (and fatal) basic cultural error.</p>
<blockquote><p>It also calls for &#8220;traffic mixing&#8221;, blending the persona controllers&#8217; internet usage with the usage of people outside Centcom in a manner that must offer &#8220;excellent cover and powerful deniability&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is snake oil straight from the brochure. <b>NO $ALE!</b></p>
<blockquote><p>The multiple persona contract is thought to have been awarded as part of a programme called Operation Earnest Voice (OEV), which was first developed in Iraq as a psychological warfare weapon against the online presence of al-Qaida supporters and others ranged against coalition forces. </p></blockquote>
<p>Ridiculous. There were no al-Qaida in Iraq before the Americans got there. This is pure and utter bullshit, and those with memories longer than goldfish know this. The war of blowing people to bits, and pictures of it, are worth many thousands of MILCOMTROLLS. You cannot win hearts and minds with a gun, or a drone. Period. This is a waste of time and a waste of money, and I strongly suspect that anyone who has been on a tour in Iraq will confirm this. The military are giving more money to Ron Paul; more than all the other candidates combined. This is not an accident; these people know what is really going on, and no amount of snake oil, lies, glove puppets or trolls can stop the truth from coming out.</p>
<blockquote><p>Since then, OEV is reported to have expanded into a $200m programme and is thought to have been used against jihadists across Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Middle East.</p></blockquote>
<p>And its not working, on a purely objective PR level, removing all aspects of right or wrong, who started what or anything other than the measure of mindshare. All you have to do is watch the propaganda that these people produce on LiveLeak. No troll, no commenter no one can counter the stark shock value of what these people are disseminating. They are winning the PR war because <i>their PR is quantitatively better</i>. Once again, this has nothing to do with what you personally think about them and their motives, its a pure matter of mathematical fact.</p>
<blockquote><p>OEV is seen by senior US commanders as a vital counter-terrorism and counter-radicalisation programme. In evidence to the US Senate&#8217;s armed services committee last year, General David Petraeus, then commander of Centcom, described the operation as an effort to &#8220;counter extremist ideology and propaganda and to ensure that credible voices in the region are heard&#8221;. He said the US military&#8217;s objective was to be &#8220;first with the truth&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>The best counter-terrorism and counter-radicalisation programme would be to elect Ron Paul. It is a scientific fact that all terrorism against the USA would cease thirty days after Ron Paul was elected.</p>
<p>Do you think that that is a big claim to make? Very well, dont believe, <i>me</i> take it from someone, the only person in fact, who has done a 100% accurate study of the true nature of terrorism: <a href="http://youtu.be/X4HnIyClHEM" title="Prof. Robert Pape on &quot;Dying to Win&quot; (Part 1 of 4) YouTube">Professor Robert Pape, in his lecture &#8220;Dying to Win&#8221;</a></p>
<p>In this lecture, he will prove to you with unassailable facts that if <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJXd-O7AyQc" title="Ron Paul : Mutually Assured Destruction vs Mutually Assured Respect YouTube">Ron Paul wins, terrorism goes away</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>This month Petraeus&#8217;s successor, General James Mattis, told the same committee that OEV &#8220;supports all activities associated with degrading the enemy narrative, including web engagement and web-based product distribution capabilities&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is utter nonsense on stilts. The &#8216;enemies narrative&#8217; as outlined by Dr. Pape is that America is occupying other people&#8217;s countries. That is the ONLY narrative, and no amount of glove puppetry can alter this fact. Only a complete removal of American forces from foreign lands can change the narrative and end the nightmare.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Finally, we get to the &#8216;me too&#8217; part of the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is unclear whether a persona management programme would contravene UK law. Legal experts say it could fall foul of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981, which states that &#8220;a person is guilty of forgery if he makes a false instrument, with the intention that he or another shall use it to induce somebody to accept it as genuine, and by reason of so accepting it to do or not to do some act to his own or any other person&#8217;s prejudice&#8221;. However, this would apply only if a website or social network could be shown to have suffered &#8220;prejudice&#8221; as a result.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is an online identity, a <i>nom de plume</i> a &#8216;false instrument&#8217;? Any website that takes comments from anyone using any name has entered into a contract where such an act is acceptable, and so de-facto, the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981 could not apply. The fact is that UK law is not anywhere near being relevant to glove puppetry and where they apply existing law, they nearly always get it horribly wrong, like the recent case of the autistic Troll imprisoned for&#8230; trolling.</p>
<p>Trolling is a simple matter of freedom of speech (property rights). The people who own the servers are publishing on their own property. They enter into contracts with people who leave comments. It is as simple as that. There is no space in that contract and interaction for the State to interject itself.</p>
<blockquote><p>• This article was amended on 18 March 2011 to remove references to Facebook and Twitter, introduced during the editing process, and to add a comment from Centcom, received after publication, that it is not targeting those sites.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks" title="Revealed: US spy operation that manipulates social media | Technology | The Guardian">http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, bullshit.</p>
<p>This is so full of fail there is fail spilled all over the floor.</p>
<p>The people who are least susceptible to MILCOMTROLL propaganda are the targets of this insane scheme. They are not going to buy any of this, and any attempt to spin the Twittersphere or blogosphere in English, in the <a href="http://www.cafepress.co.uk/usuk_w" title="USUK : US + UK put 'em together...the TRUTH!">USUK</a>, as they are no doubt trying to do right now, is doomed to failure.</p>
<p>The mass rejects their malignant attempts at influence at every step, and as the economy continues to degrade, all calls to ignore the Federal Reserve, wage more wars, re-elect mobsters and murderers is going to ring so hollow that the sounds will resemble the biggest bell ever cast.</p>

					<p>The crony capitalist copyright monopoly has rolled out its latest delusional computer illiterate schizophrenic luddite, Jeremy Hunt, to try and cripple the internets.</p>
<p>First things first.</p>
<p>Culture does not need a secretary. The idea that the State should have a position to &#8216;have a say&#8217; in matters to do with culture is absurd on its face. Art galleries, artists, authors, music makers, sculptors and anyone involved in culture in any way do not need to be overseen, managed, given &#8216;guidance&#8217; or &#8216;represented&#8217; by a ministry. Only States like the USSR have traditionally had such corrosive, totalitarian and frankly, disgusting posts. Actually, France has a <a title="The Talk of the Town: Interview : The New Yorker" href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1991/08/05/1991_08_05_026_TNY_CARDS_000357096">Minister of Rock &amp; Roll</a>, but France doesn&#8217;t count.</p>
<p>Even if you accept that the State should have a &#8216;Culture Secretary&#8217; the internet is a <em>technical brief</em>, not a cultural one. No doubt there are moves afoot to create a new &#8216;Secretary for Digital&#8217;. The State should not be able to produce these new positions willy nilly, since they are <a title="BLOGDIAL  » Blog Archive   » What is a ‘public servant’?" href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=2258">public servants</a>.</p>
<p>OK, <a title="Leeroy Jenkins&lt;br /&gt;<br />
      - YouTube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkCNJRfSZBU">Lets do this</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Google should join fight on piracy, says Jeremy Hunt</strong></p>
<p>Culture secretary calls on advertisers and search engines to ‘make life more difficult’ for those that ignore copyright laws.</p></blockquote>
<p>What a disgusting, irrational and ridiculous call; to &#8216;make life more difficult&#8217; for people. The internet exists to make life <strong>easier</strong>. What Jeremy Hunt is calling for is to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cripple the internet</span>, to make service providers divert capital away from improving their services into something that no one but a tiny group of venal beasts want. This is not the call of a human being, this is a call from a monster that wants to destroy progress, inhibit the utility of the greatest invention since fire, and to harm millions of people all over the world. Absolutely repulsive.</p>
<blockquote><p>Jeremy Hunt, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, is to tell Google and other search engines that they should play a greater role in the fight against online piracy. Mr Hunt will ask them to “make life more difficult” for pirates.</p></blockquote>
<p>And they are all going to tell him, politely, to go straight to hell. Jeremy Hunt is in good company; he is spouting <a title="BLOGDIAL  » Blog Archive   » Whenever I hear the name Andy Burnham, I reach for my revolver" href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=1144">the same garbage that Andy Burnham used to</a> on this matter.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Copying music is not piracy. It is not theft. The BBC even said so, in a grovelling apology after they aired <a title="Bittorrent Item On BBCs Newsnight&lt;br /&gt;<br />
      - YouTube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq2PK2W-vVI">a scandalous, unforgivable, stupid, retarded and evil attack on Bittorrent</a> and were taken to task for it:</em></p>
<p>First though, an apology. File sharing is not theft. It has never been theft. Anyone who says it is theft is wrong and has unthinkingly absorbed too many Recording Industry Association of America press releases. We know that script line was wrong. It was a mistake. We’re very, very sorry.</p>
<p>If copyright infringement was theft then I’d be in jail every time I accidentally used football pix on Newsnight without putting “Pictures from Sky Sport” in the top left corner of the screen. And I’m not. So it isn’t.</p></blockquote>
<p>No where near enough of an apology, but as far as the BBC goes, this is grovelling, first class.</p>
<blockquote><p>He is expected to tell the Royal Television Society’s Cambridge Convention that “reasonable steps” will make a significant difference, and also make the suggestion that if the industry does not help the Government it will legislate via the new Communication Bill. “We intend to take measures to make it more and more difficult to access sites that deliberately facilitate infringement, misleading consumers and depriving creators of a fair reward for their creativity,” Mr Hunt will say.</p></blockquote>
<p>The world is changing. The number of people who know about crony capitalism, the abuses of the RIAA/MPAA and the rest is growing exponentially. Even the scumbag lying State shills at the BBC say that people like Hunt, &#8220;..(are) wrong and (have) unthinkingly absorbed too many Recording Industry Association of America press releases&#8221;.</p>
<p>Jeremy Hunt is on the wrong side of history, and he hasn&#8217;t got the brains to know it. If he does know that what he is saying is unfounded, illogical codswallop, then he is a coward for not stating the plain truth, which is that the internet has changed the way people consume media, these changes are benefits which will bring prosperity to everyone, and the old business models are dead as the Dodo.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Government wants search engines to penalise website whose content is ruled unlawful. Less prominent results would have a direct effect on revenues from advertisers as well as sales.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you removed all the links to any torrent site or site that provides links to other sites, what would happen is that someone would write an application that will absorb and re-distribute all those searches. It would spur the creation of a one stop place to find everything you need, and it could be designed in such a way that it can not be shut down. It would make the distribution of links more efficient, and this would mean more file sharing.</p>
<p>The internet sees Jeremy Hunt and his luddite ideas as damage and routes around him and them. Anything that is done to stop people communicating will cause more robust systems to be developed and deployed to bolster communication. We have seen this again and again. Napster was shut down and that caused gnutella to be developed. Then, the Bittorent protocol was developed as a direct answer to the problem of hosting files on central repositories. The same thing can be done with links. A distributed search engine, unstoppable, with no central point of attack will up the stakes and Jeremy Hunt would be the one that caused it to come into being. That is what is called an &#8216;own goal&#8217; in the UK.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr Hunt will argue that online businesses deserve the same legal protection as physical ones. “We do not allow certain products to be sold in the shops on the high street, nor do we allow shops to be set up purely to sell counterfeited products. Neither should we tolerate it online,” he is set to say.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a fallacious, straw man argument. Physical goods <em>are not the same as information</em> and it comes right out of the MPAA script. When you copy a file or an idea, nothing is lost, and more to the point, Google does not facilitate copying, it merely points to resources that may or may not &#8216;infringe copyright&#8217;. There is no reason whatsoever to call upon business to take proactive measures against links that <em>potentially</em> point to items that <em>are not even criminal in the first place</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>He will add, however, “The government has no business protecting old models or helping industries that have failed to move with the times. But those new models will never be able to prosper if they have to compete with free alternatives based on the illegal distribution of copyrighted material.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is double talk. Government is protecting the old business models by insisting that there is such a thing as copyright. It is helping industries that have failed to move with the times, explicitly, the music and film industry. Secondly, Hunt says &#8216;free alternatives&#8217; are bad; what if the new business model <em>is the free model?</em>. By saying that free is not acceptable, Hunt is picking winners, helping the dinosaur media and failing to move with the times. It is not the place of Jeremy Hunt or any public servant to determine which business models are and are not appropriate. Jeremy Hunt is talking <strong>nonsense on stilts</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite campaigns from internet freedom activists, the high court ruled in July, after a lengthy process, that the internet service provider BT should block a website that “flagrantly infringed” copyright, called Newzbin. Although the Internet Watch Foundation is able to use a sped-up legal process, it currently can only do so for sites relating to illegal online pornography. Google, however, claims that “takedown requests” from reliable copyright holders are dealt with in four hours. The government moving its pressure from ISPs to search engines marks a new approach to its multi-faceted attack on digital piracy.</p>
<p><a title="Google should join fight on piracy, says Jeremy Hunt - Telegraph" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/8759414/Google-should-join-fight-on-piracy-says-Jeremy-Hunt.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/8759414/Google-should-join-fight-on-piracy-says-Jeremy-Hunt.html</a></p></blockquote>
<p>They will fail.</p>
<p>Since the advent of modems running at 14.4k people have been sharing files, and it has grown year on year without fail every year. The mainstream media and the copyright monopoly have lost both the war and the argument. The movie studios still pull in hundreds of millions for their blockbusters, and so the much reported death of their industry has not materialised, as it never does whenever they whine that a new technology is going to wipe them out.</p>
<p>It is nothing short of absurd that Jeremy Hunt and his cohorts want to turn Britain into a leader of all things internets, but in the same breath, they do everything they can to cripple the companies that work with it. You cant have it both ways; either you want your East End Fantasy to take root or you do not. If you do, get out of the way, and let business flourish. If you do not, carry on as you are, making these ridiculous paid promotions for the copyright monopolists and watch everyone write you off as a potential place to locate.</p>
<p>In the past, anyone thinking about writing an innovative service, like a CD Ripping service, would have run a mile from the UK. Only now, as the CD is dying as a format will it become legal for a company like this to set up&#8230; or will it? Who knows? What is for sure is that if you plan on starting an internet business in the UK, you are taking a huge risk that Jeremy Hunt &amp; Co. are going to suddenly, at the behest of your competitors, put you out of business either by directly legislating against you, or scaring investors away by giving a speech.</p>
<p>One thing is for certain; the tide is turning against Jeremy Hunt and all the glove puppets who sound suspiciously similar. What do I mean by that? Hmmmm, Which one is Jeremy Hunt, and which one is Andy Burnham? can you tell?:</p>
<p><strong>Hunt or Burnham?:</strong><br />
<em>&#8220;We must ensure that copyright delivers maximum benefit to performers and musicians. That&#8217;s the test of any model as we go forward&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>Hunt or Burnham?:</strong><br />
<em>&#8220;Let me be absolutely clear so there are no misconceptions about where the Government is on this. We share a real support for artists and musicians.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>Hunt or Burnham?:</strong><br />
<em>&#8220;Music has been hit hard over the last ten years, and if we don’t do something there is a real danger that parts of the music industry will be washed away.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>Hunt or Burnham?:</strong><br />
<em>&#8220;Developments in communications have changed the music world and I think we are now at a time that calls for partnership between Government and the music business as a whole: one with rewards for both of us; one with rewards for society as a whole.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>Hunt or Burnham?:</strong><br />
<em>&#8220;My job – Government’s job – is to preserve the value in the system.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>Hunt or Burnham?:</strong><br />
<em>&#8220;What do we need to do to help our businesses grow and evolve between now and 2025? Where can regulation help and where is it a barrier? What can we do collectively to enhance the whole UK market?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>Hunt or Burnham?:</strong><br />
<em>&#8220;We have an extraordinarily strong and diverse media landscape in this country, combined with a remarkable wealth of talent in our creative industries.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>They are indistinguishable are they not?</p>
<p>Honestly, I dont care about what these people think; the only thing that matters is that they have the guns. As long as they have the monopoly on violence, they will be able to distort, destroy, corrupt and damage. If they did not have the monopoly on violence, Jeremy Hunt might be a school teacher somewhere, harmless, quiet and of no concern to anyone.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the market, the internet, and the people on it are more powerful than Jeremy Hunt. No matter what he says, no matter what he asks for, and no matter who he can bully into obeying his luddite wet dreams, the internet and the market will route around him and his disease and <em>the spice will flow!</em></p>

					<p>It is clear that the State is not going to quietly disappear into the night, and leave everyone to live as free men. Given that they still feel the need to preserve the illusion that they have the consent of the governed, we can expect any technology that threatens the State to come under legislative attack, after a carefully orchestrated series of media smears, hysterical news articles, straw man attacks and &#8216;real world&#8217; examples of harm where Bitcoin is presented as an enabling factor.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has the potential to severely disrupt the ability of the State to steal money from people. Bitcoin is being built by developers who want to preserve the privacy and security of its users. If Bitcoin and systems like it become wildly popular, as popular as the internet itself, then this will mean that financial transactions will &#8216;go dark&#8217; and the state will not be able to intercept, detect or steal money from citizens.</p>
<p>Email communications are routinely monitored by the state, both covertly and overtly. This eavesdropping could be stopped completely if the users of email encrypted their communications. The tools to do this are free and simple to use, and yet, mass adoption of encryption for email has not take off after over a decade of availability. Had encryption been built into email from its inception, privacy would have been the default for email.</p>
<p>The development of Bitcoin is being done with privacy in mind from the beginning. In order to make a Bitcoin transaction, a user must accept that her transactions have privacy features built in by default.</p>
<p>The mistakes and built in disadvantages and myriad security problems of email are not going to be repeated with Bitcoin, and if Bitcoin becomes as ubiquitous as email it will represent a significant step towards liberty for all people world-wide.</p>
<p>When the State is perturbed by new technological developments and sees them as a direct threat, they build a case for legislation either through a crisis, real or fabricated, or through an academic attack from its intellectual class.</p>
<p>The recently published paper, <i>&#8216;Shadowy Figures: Tracking Illicit Financial Transactions in the Murky World of Digital Currencies, Peer–to–Peer Networks, and Mobile Device Payments&#8217;</i> by John Villasenor Cody Monk and Christopher Bronk is an example of an academic attack of this type:</p>
<p>http://www.bakerinstitute.org/publications/ITP-pub-FinancialTransactions-082911.pdf</p>
<p>The paper works from the premiss that the State has rights, that it has a right to control and steal from individuals, it has the sole right to define what money is and is not through its legal tender laws and that it also has the right to forbid people from transacting in anything other than the currency it issues.</p>
<p>In short, it works from a position that takes the State and its power as a given. It is an excrescence of members of the class of &#8220;opinion moulders&#8221; in society as described by Murray Rothbard; men who&#8217;s alliance with the State is based on a quid pro quo, where in return for spreading and reinforcing the idea among the masses that the State and its rulers are wise, good, sometimes divine, and at the very least inevitable, with no conceivable alternatives, the State incorporates the intellectuals as part of the ruling elite, granting them power, status, prestige, and material security.</p>
<p>Lets begin with the executive summary:</p>
<blockquote><p>Almost no one would argue that governments do not have a right to track and trace digital financial transactions associated with activities such as terrorism and human trafficking. It is less clear, however, how governments can surmount the formidable technical and organizational challenges associated with detecting and monitoring these transactions. The solution will require a combination of self-regulation, government-industry collaboration, and change in both technology and culture within government agencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, there are many people who argue that not only does the state have no right to track and trace digital financial transactions, but that the state does not have any rights at all. Only man has rights. The State (under the American system of government) has <i>powers</i> that are delegated to it by the people through a carefully crafted Constitution, enumerating and limiting those powers.</p>
<p>Using the standard fear-mongering terms of terrorism and human trafficking in relation to this gives you a foretaste of what is to come in this shabby publication. The State uses terrorism as a pretext to surveil everyone&#8217;s transactions, <i>en masse</i>, not just those of terrorists, who are now defined as essentially anyone who breathes air. This is the only explanation for the millions of Americans who are listed on the State&#8217;s despicable &#8216;No Fly List&#8217;, whose explicit purpose is to prevent acts of terrorism.</p>
<p>This is also the pretext they are using as they are pulling off the pants of wheelchair bound 97 year olds at airports, looking for bombs in the diapers of infants and requiring banks to report on all transactions over arbitrary limits. No one who is in full possession of the facts of State surveillance under the guise of prevention of terrorism believes this line any more. These measures are solely and demonstrably designed for the control of the ordinary citizen.</p>
<p>Human trafficking is another straw man argument; anyone who is trafficking in human beings will quite sensibly be using cash to receive or make payments. This is the same bogus argument put forward when attempts were made to regulate cryptography in the 1990s; it was claimed that terrorists were using Steganograpy to hide messages in images. It was a completely false Hollywood movie plot of course, and the idea that human traffickers would take an electronic payment rather than large Euro notes or One Hundred Dollar bills is patently absurd. Once again, anyone who thinks even casually about this comes to the conclusion that these arguments for the legislation and control of digital money are weak at best.</p>
<p>This paper is littered with fallacious arguments:</p>
<blockquote><p>While there is a wide spectrum of views regarding the right to digital privacy, almost no one disputes the notion that the right to digital financial privacy does not extend to providing an impenetrable legal shield for the online financial activities of terrorist groups, human traffickers, or drug cartels.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once again, there are many people who argue that prohibition is immoral, and that the entire &#8216;War on Drugs&#8217; is a fiasco and a disaster on every level.</p>
<p>To say, &#8220;almost no one disputes the notion that the right to digital financial privacy&#8221;, is a pure example of <a title="Fallacy: Appeal to Belief" href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-belief.html">the appeal to belief fallacy</a>. Just because many people believe something, you cannot infer that their beliefs are correct or that an act based upon them is justified.</p>
<p>The State is most certainly not justified in surveilling everyone&#8217;s transactions to intercept money and goods that do not involve crimes where there is a victim. The matter of prohibition is a perfect example of this.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hawala and other informal value transfer systems long predate the advent of computers and the Internet, and, in more recent years, have been of concern to authorities because of their potential to be used for money laundering and terror financing</p></blockquote>
<p>I will not address every instance of the straw man of terrorism or human trafficking in this publication.</p>
<p>Money laundering is a <a title="Euphemism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemism">euphemism</a> for transactions out of view of State surveillance. Any transaction that takes place outside of State control is essentially &#8216;Money Laundering&#8217; according to the State. This means that, for example, people living in Greece, who are forbidden from making any transaction over €1500 in cash, even though the money is legitimately theirs and they are not engaging in any act that is defined as criminal activity by the State, is guilty of &#8216;Money Laundering&#8217; <i>by the mere fact that they are making a transaction above an arbitrary size</i>.</p>
<p>What the authors of this paper are suggesting is that digital money systems, by virtue of their built in privacy mechanisms are de-facto money laundering systems because they deny the State the ability to surveil them. This is classic State reasoning, Kafkaesque and irrational, of the kind that is used to justify every predation and immoral piece of legislation that the State cares to write, from the laws prohibiting you from growing certain species of plant, to eminent domain, the innumerable different licenses, regulations and compulsions of all kinds and beyond.</p>
<blockquote><p>tracing a specific suspect transaction that is intentionally buried “in the noise” can be like trying to find a pickpocket who just stole a wallet in a crowded market. The knowledge that the pickpocket is certainly among the hundreds of people within view is of little comfort if there is no practical ability to search every person in the market.</p></blockquote>
<p>Its interesting that the authors use the analogy of a pickpocket when describing the act of a citizen making a transaction of their own money to another person over an anonymous network. It is the State of course, that is the pickpocket and thief, not the citizen minding her own business and transacting voluntarily and in private.</p>
<blockquote><p>In l996, physician Douglas Johnson started spending his evenings writing software to create e-gold, a new digital currency that, though not issued by any government, would be fully backed by gold stored at various locations around the world. By 2001, there were nearly 300,000 e-gold customer accounts with an aggregate value of about $16 million.4</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyone who does not believe that the State is building a case to come after Bitcoin is deceiving themselves. They are already using the one size fits all <a title="Bitcoin: FBI Admits To Engaging In Infiltration, Disruption and Dismantling of Competing Currencies | Libertarian News" href="http://www.libertariannews.org/2011/08/30/bitcoin-fbi-admits-to-engaging-in-infiltration-disruption-and-dismantling-of-competing-currencies/">pretext of terrorism to shut down minters of physical coins like the Liberty Dollar</a> and this case along with the case of e-gold should be of interest to people who use Bitcoin. E-gold had assets worth 16 million dollars, and:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Liberty Dollar coins and precious metals, currently valued at nearly $7 million.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bitcoin is worth 10 times the amount NotHaus&#8217;s gold was worth, so I&#8217;m sure it is receiving 10 times the destructive attention from our glorious overlords.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><a title="Bitcoin: FBI Admits To Engaging In Infiltration, Disruption and Dismantling of Competing Currencies | Libertarian News" href="http://www.libertariannews.org/2011/08/30/bitcoin-fbi-admits-to-engaging-in-infiltration-disruption-and-dismantling-of-competing-currencies/#comment-299034968">Libertarian News</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin is bigger in dollar value than both e-gold and Liberty Dollar combined, and it is decentralised with no single company controlling it, unlike the e-gold and Liberty Dollar services. This academic paper is, I am quite sure, a direct result of this fact, and the fear that Bitcoin is sure to continue to grow in strength in every respect. This paper will be distributed widely among the State actors who will seek to understand Bitcoin within a framework of their own thinking and ideology.</p>
<p>You can expect that every trick in the book is going to be used to retard the growth of Bitcoin. You will see smears thrown at it that will include terrorism, human trafficking, and drug dealing (as we have already seen in this paper) but also expect child porn and paedophillia to be used to taint these systems. For those who are not persuaded by hysteria, the financial news networks are busy telling their viewers that Bitcoin is to be avoided at all costs. None of these attacks are logical or rational of course.</p>
<blockquote><p>While e-gold was backed by actual gold, Bitcoin is fully virtual, backed only by the confidence of the people who use it for transactions. A governmental entity attempting to shut down Bitcoin servers in its territory would almost certainly find that even more servers would spring up, Hydra-like, in other parts of the world. As of July 23, 2011, there were approximately 6.9 million Bitcoins trading at a value of more than $13 per Bitcoin, corresponding to a total supply of over $90 million.11</p></blockquote>
<p>And here we have another problem which this paper does not address; <a title="BLOGDIAL  » Blog Archive   » Bitcoins are Baseball Cards" href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=3135"><i>Bitcoin is not money</i></a>. This will be the first counter argument tilted against any attack by the State against a high profile company that trades in Bitcoins. E-Gold and Liberty Dollars had one thing in common; they both traded in objects that <i>are demonstrably money</i>, and which are in fact, better money than the Federal Reserve Notes that are legal tender in the United States.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is different in that it is not money, but is a protocol, like TCP/IP. I predict that this will be a successful argument, because if it falls, then the financial regulators will be given the power to regulate the resale of <i>any good or service</i> for which a token or recipt is issued simply because money is exchanged for goods and services.</p>
<p>If the State was staffed by actors who were rational, they would not be attacking these services; they would immediately accept them all as payment for taxes. In this way, they would ensure that whatever happens and whatever systems come to pass, they will have a stake in them and a stream of revenue. By trying to stamp out digital currencies, refusing to accept them and trying to force people to use their worthless and inflating fiat currencies, they will end up being starved of cash as people switch from bad currencies issued by central banks to digital money transfer systems.</p>
<blockquote><p>The potential Achilles heel of Bitcoin—that each server in the network contains a complete record of all transactions—will almost certainly be addressed in future systems that distribute transaction information so that no single server or small collection of servers contains a complete transaction record. It is also possible to envision systems in which the transaction records are not only distributed, but evanescent, so that even the collective information stored on all the servers in the system at any given time would not enable a complete reconstruction of transaction history.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is essentially what we have been saying; Bitcoin as a brand may or may not not succeed, but for certain if it does not, an improved successor in a following iteration is bound to be created. Solid Coin is one of the first challengers in this respect. They <a title="SolidCoin is ready for Bitcoin collapse" href="http://www.solidcoin.info//solidcoin-ready-for-bitcoin-collapse.php">claim that their client software and network, which are a fork of the open source Bitcoin source code, is superior to Bitcoin</a> and are not afraid to trumpet this claim.</p>
<p>For individuals using any digital system properly, the loss of a small working balance is not a deal breaker. When a digital money transfer network collapses and a new replacement network emerges, whatever fiat or non fiat currency you have to hand and wish to transmit can be sent through the new system. The companies that facilitate exchanges could be wiped out, but they will quickly be replaced by successors since some of the software suites used to run exchanges are open source software. This means that the digital money economy can survive multiple crashes no matter what the causes of those crashes are. The need for people to transact at a distance with very low fees is so great that it will never be possible to get rid of this idea, no matter what the inconvenience of a crash means in terms of short term losses.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is statistically inevitable that some fraction of the more than 300 million transactions performed using M-PESA in 2010, and of the much larger number of transactions that will be performed in 2011 and future years, will not be legitimate. And some fraction of those, in turn, may involve payments that bear on American national security or law enforcement concerns.</p></blockquote>
<p>The paper goes on to describe M-PESA and its spectacular growth, and then claim that a small fraction of the 300 million transactions performed in that system will be &#8216;of concern&#8217; to American national security or law enforcement.</p>
<p>This is not the problem of anyone in the world other than the U.S. Government, and if Ron Paul becomes president, it will no longer be the concern of the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>We must remember when we read these words that the phrase &#8216;law enforcement concerns&#8217; means <i>prohibition</i> and the bogus &#8216;war on terror&#8217; both of which are entirely illegitimate. In absentia of these two rationale, there is no concern of any kind when we talk about what the un-banked are doing in the middle of what most Americans would consider to be &#8220;nowhere&#8221;. These are artificially created problems looking for solutions, and they should be rejected by all right thinking people on principle.</p>
<blockquote><p>And, the 2008 financial crisis illustrated that the economic picture constructed by the organs of the U.S. government tasked with financial and commercial measurement, oversight, and regulation can have significant blind spots. These examples illustrate that the barriers to observing financial activity can be organizational as well as technological. Accordingly, successfully addressing the complexities of illicit financial transactions in cyberspace will require structural and technological steps taken by regulatory, intelligence, and law enforcement agencies, as well as the private sector.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is of course, completely ridiculous. The causes of the 2008 financial crisis were and are well understood by students of the Austrian School of Economics, and <a title="Peter Schiff Was Right 2006 - 2007 (2nd Edition) - YouTube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I0QN-FYkpw">were predicted, repeatedly on television</a>. There were no &#8216;blind spots&#8217; save in the eyes of the Keynesians and the slavish apologists for the Federal Reserve. Note also, how apologists for the State use the prefix &#8216;cyber&#8217; when they are talking about things on the Internet they do not like and &#8216;digital&#8217; when they are describing things they perceive as beneficial.</p>
<p>The economic pictures constructed by organs of the U.S. Government are nothing more than fairy tales. Take for instance the way that unemployment is measured. It is a fact that the way the counting is done has been deliberately manipulated to massage the numbers downwards. The website <a title="Shadow Government Statistics : Home Page" href="http://www.shadowstats.com/">Shadow Stats</a> specialises in presenting honest data rather than the skewed numbers generated by political needs of the State.</p>
<p>To claim that digital currencies make calculation difficult for government is absurd. If calculation is so critical for the State, they should force the Federal Reserve to publish &#8216;M3&#8242;, the number that describes the money supply, and they would not use statistics to lie about the true state of the economy. All of this is, of course, separate from the fact that the State has no legitimate purpose in generating these numbers and using them to engineer society in the first place.</p>
<p>The private sector has no interest in crippling their products so that the state can gain back door access to them and their customer&#8217;s data. Burdening them with these proposals is anti-business, anti-progress and anti-liberty and is illegitimate.</p>
<blockquote><p>In addition to fostering self-regulation within the various industry sectors involved in the movement of money, the U.S. government should establish an interagency government/industry working group or expand the charter of an existing group to focus specifically on emerging financial threats.</p></blockquote>
<p>These measures will not work to ameliorate the artificial problem of &#8216;financial threats&#8217;. Since all of the software, both in terms of clients, servers and exchanges are open source, any attempt to poison a digital currency will immediately cause a fork. Solid Coin is a perfect example of this; they have forked Bitcoin in advance of any threat from the State, based solely on the casually spoken words of Gavin Andressen at the first Bitcoin conference.</p>
<p>Should any involvement by law enforcement actually be confirmed, or the Bitcoin source go closed, Solid Coin will gain tremendous momentum. Digital currency sees the State as damage and routes around it, to re-purpose a venerable phrase. Like a physicist trying to know the location and energy of a quantum particle at the same time, any attempt to touch these systems will be self defeating.</p>
<blockquote><p>Another set of relatively low-tech but still useful solutions pertains to systems that can monitor the premises where MMT agents conduct business. Digital image and video recording is now routinely used in venues as diverse as banks, stores, and taxis. A properly designed system could aim to ensure that cash could only be accepted or disbursed when both the agent and the person providing or accepting the cash were on video.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here we have an example of the mindset of the State, and in this case, the rancid anti-Americanism that is at the heart of many thinkers in the U.S.A. All people are presumed guilty. You have no right to privacy. Surveillance should be universal and pervasive. All financial transactions should be treated as suspicious by default.</p>
<p>Look at the list in this section; they even approve of surveillance in <i>taxis</i> as a method of eliminating financial privacy. This is as far away from the American dram as it is possible to get, and people do not want the sort of world that the authors of this paper envision as necessary. This is why Bitcoin, E-gold, the Liberty Dollar and systems like it are popping up all over the place. If the State was legitimate and a force for good, there would be no need for people to spend their time developing currencies whose central feature is to get your money out of the clutches of the State. In fact, this might go some way to explaining why email was developed without encryption built in (apart from the fact that it pre-dates modern fast processor and the Public Key Cryptography systems that were developed after the advent of email). In the 1960s people&#8217;s faith in government had not been shaken to its core. Nowadays of course, there is little faith in the State; it is widely and correctly understood to be a malevolent and destructive force for evil.</p>
<blockquote><p>For the United States to ensure its national and financial security, the ability to understand the massive flow of digital information that is the global financial system today, from micro to macro, and from baht to Bitcoins, is of fundamental importance. Where once the numbered Swiss bank account, the wire transfer to a shell corporation, or, as in All the President’s Men, a paper bag containing $25,000 in cash were primary means for covert financial activity, the Internet and mobile phone networks are the potential setting for a vastly expanded set of new, digital avenues for conducting hidden transactions.</p>
<p>Given the rate of change of the digital landscape, any set of solutions constructed based on a single snapshot in time will quickly become obsolete. However, by creating the collaborations, regulatory frameworks, and technologies that reflect today’s more fluid and diverse financial transaction environment, government and industry will be better positioned to address illicit transactions today and to adapt to address those of the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>The conclusion of this paper amounts to wishful thinking. The jig is up for the State in its present form. They are going to have to adapt radically and philosophically if they are going to remain as the arbiters of anything at all.</p>
<p>Part of this radical change will be to address what exactly is meant by, &#8220;the United States to ensure its national and financial security&#8221;. What exactly <i>is</i> the United States financial security? The U.S. is a nation of people; if their money is secure, i.e. not being inflated away by the Federal Reserve, and they can transact locally and at a distance for next to nothing, what is the problem?</p>
<p>The problem is that the authors are not talking about <i>the people</i> of United States and <i>their</i> financial security; they are talking about the State, the Federal Government, and <i>its</i> financial security. In plain English, they are referring only to the Federal Government&#8217;s ability to levy taxes and collect them.</p>
<p>Digital currencies and peer to peer transactions are a direct threat to the Federal Government and its ability to tax. This is the only threat that they are truly concerned with; all of the other threats they list here are statistically insignificant compared to the trillions of dollars that could potentially be lost to them in a peer to peer digital currency world.</p>
<p>The statistical probability of being affected by terrorism is less than many daily fatal occurrences, like death from bee stings or anaphylactic shock from adverse food reactions. I do not even need to quote car accident statistics or even lightning strikes, or alcohol, or pharmaceutical related deaths, all of which happen at greater frequencies than terrorism by orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>Terrorism is not a pretext for trying to stop the future from being summoned. As for human trafficking and crimes against children, as ghastly and reprehensible as these crimes are, they are, mercifully, exceedingly rare and should not be used to destroy the tools, systems and free society that entrepreneurs and the creative are building.</p>
<p>It is completely inhuman, illegitimate, immoral and unethical to attempt to suppress and destroy people&#8217;s rights. In the 21st century, we have the tools, the understanding and the will to build the systems that will forever repudiate the claims of the State that it was ever needed to make everything run smoothly. Digital currencies like Bitcoin are only one tool in this movement, the writings of Murray Rothbard, Lew Rockwell, Ron Paul and the distribution systems that spread these ideas are the main ways that this revolution is taking place. No doubt, in private, the authors of this piece would call for the internet itself to be permanently and entirely shut down for the sake of ensuring the &#8216;security of the United States&#8217;. It is this irrational, un-American thinking that is behind the recent discovery that <a title="The FBI vs. Antiwar.com  by Justin Raimondo  -- Antiwar.com" href="http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2011/08/21/antiwar-com-vs-the-fbi/">Justin Raimondo has been under F.B.I surveillance, simply because he writes articles</a>.</p>
<p>It is a great tragedy that so many Americans have lost touch with the idea of what America was meant to be. Apart from that tragic loss, its interesting to note that this paper is concerned not with the plight of the poor in the &#8216;third world&#8217; and the unbanked millions who have no access to capital. They are not concerned with the human suffering that could be lessened by the new technologies that are being developed. They are only concerned with themselves, and their own narrow parochial interests, that are borne out of a fundamental misunderstanding of the proper role of government and what people&#8217;s rights are.</p>
<p>Its up to every person who can think and write and run software to refute these fallacious arguments, to use the new systems at whatever level they can and to spread the ideas of liberty. We simply must not let these wrong headed statist arguments go unchallenged.</p>
<p>I have refrained from explicitly detailing the thinking behind the assertions I have made in this piece that claim or infer that we do not need the State, that the State is illegitimate on its face, and that it has no rights in and of itself. I will leave it to the reader to visit the Ludwig Von Mises Institute website for the background, evidence and proof that these are all facts. There are posts on this Blog that go into this in detail also. You cannot go far wrong by reading Lew Rockwell&#8217;s blog for a complete rundown of these ideas and links to many scholars and philosophers. If you want to understand the basics of all of this, you should buy and read Murray Rothbard&#8217;s <i>&#8216;<a title="Amazon.com: For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto (9780930073022): Murray N. Rothbard: Books" href="http://www.amazon.com/New-Liberty-Libertarian-Manifesto/dp/0930073029">For a New Liberty</a>&#8216;</i> which is also available for free. To understand money and how the State has interfered in it to its near total destruction, you need to read <i>&#8216;<a title="What Has Government Done to Our Money? by Murray N. Rothbard - - Mises Institute" href="http://mises.org/money.asp">What has government done to our money</a>&#8216;</i>, also by Murray Rothbard.</p>
<p>With these tools in your hands you will be able to understand and prove to yourself that everything I have said in this piece is true, and why the paper that I have debunked is as wrong as something can be wrong.</p>
<p>It is incumbent upon you to demonstrate that you are not a part of the coercion and violence that the paper critiqued here espouses, and that you are willing to live with other human beings without them. If you are willing to co exist peacefully with your fellow man, then you should reject the basic premiss of this scandalous paper and its fallacious reasoning. If you do not, then you must concede that you are a violent person, that you approve of the coercion and violence of the State, and that the ends justifies the means.</p>
<p>Libertarians are willing and able to co exist with you. They are non violent; the very heart of their philosophy is that they can never initiate force against anyone. The measure and test of the ethical basis and morality of your philosophy should be wether or not you can co exist with others as the Libertarians can.</p>
<p>Many of you reading this will believe in democracy. You will use that word interchangeably with &#8216;fair&#8217;, &#8216;just&#8217;, &#8216;ethical&#8217; and &#8216;good&#8217;. It is none of those things. I put it to you that your society cannot survive as it is without coercion and violence, and that it is doomed to failure because it is based on coercion and violence.</p>

					<p>The Guardian helps to whip their idiotic readers into line in advance of regime change for Pakistan. All articles of the type that you read below are designed to discredit the governments, like them or not, of the target countries with lies, hypocritical attacks and pure propaganda.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/1999/01/15/france_to_end_severe_encryption/" title="France to end severe encryption restrictions • The Register">France &#8216;banned encryption&#8217; in the 1990s; Dominique Strauss-Khan ended the restrictions</a> Where were all the howling articles about interception then?</p>
<p>Where are the howls today about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A5/1" title="A5/1 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">deliberately weakened A5</a> GSM encryption? Where are the howls from the Guardian about ECHELON? Where are the howls about RIPA, which forces you to reveal your passphrase?  Where are all the howls about the German government&#8217;s attempts to break into Skype calls? Where are the howls about all the abuses going on from inside their precious &#8216;democracy&#8217;?</p>
<p>Before you attack Pakistan, <b>get your own house in order</b>. If you do not, then every foreign country in the world will point to you as an example of how to govern correctly. US/UK has full access to all land line phone calls, mobile calls, internet traffic that is not encrypted and a myriad of other &#8216;intelligence sources&#8217; which actually means immoral privacy violations on a mass scale. They also have access to <i>all of the communications taking place in Pakistan</i>.</p>
<p>It is only natural that Pakistan, who is not invited to share in the data collected by the west from &#8216;their own citizens&#8217; that they should take steps to get access themselves.</p>
<p>Lets do this!</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Pakistan to ban encryption software</b><br />
Internet service providers will be required to inform authorities if customers use virtual private networks in government crackdown</p></blockquote>
<p>This is no different to the moves in the west to force ISPs to retain data and cut off users who are sharing files. Once the French (for example) figure out that VPNs can be used to share files and beat their ban, they will move to outlaw them also. You dont think that France could possibly ban VPNs? they already did something just as stupid, <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/1999/01/15/france_to_end_severe_encryption/" title="France to end severe encryption restrictions • The Register">as you can see here</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Internet users in Pakistan will no longer be able to access the web through virtual private networks following the government ban.</p>
<p>Millions of internet users in Pakistan will be unable to send emails and messages without fear of government snooping after authorities banned the use of encryption software.</p></blockquote>
<p>The same is already true of users in the US/UK. Millions of internet users cannot send email without fear of government snooping, so what is the problem with Pakistan doing the same thing? I wonder if these Guardian shills can explain why they think that its OK for US/UK to &#8216;snoop&#8217; on communications but its NOT OK for Pakistan to do so. Of course, they would not call it &#8216;snooping&#8217; in the US/UK, they call it &#8216;security&#8217;. It is base hypocrisy turned up to eleven.</p>
<blockquote><p>A legal notice sent to all internet providers (ISPs) by the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority, seen by the Guardian, orders the ISPs to inform authorities if any of their customers are using virtual private networks (VPNs) to browse the web.</p></blockquote>
<p>Seen by the Guardian, but not by you. Pics or it didn&#8217;t happen. There is absolutely no reason why the Guardian should not publish this document so that we can see if for ourselves. But of course, the Guardian is a paternalist newspaper that rather than let you make up your own mind, presents a sugar coated, fact free <i>fait accompli</i> for you to swallow whole. Wether its articles on economics, <a href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=940" title="BLOGDIAL  &raquo; Blog Archive   &raquo; Security Breakdown: fear-mongering from The Grauniad">computer security</a> or anything else, they do not present you with all the facts. But lets move on&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Virtual private networks allow internet users to connect to the web undetected, meaning that they can access banned websites and send emails without fear of government interception.</p>
<p>Pakistan&#8217;s 20 million internet users have previously been banned from popular social networks, such as Facebook, because of blasphemous material about the prophet Muhammad. All internet traffic in the country travels through the Pakistan Internet Exchange, which can be intercepted by the military and civil intelligence agencies. The move echoes a crackdown against encrypted communications across the border in India and in China.</p></blockquote>
<p>And what is left out of this part is the fact that BBM is encrypted, and that back door access to it has been given to the State right here, the recent mass looting being the pretext. Lets also not forget that right here, it was seriously proposed that Twitter and Facebook be &#8216;shut down&#8217; in an &#8216;emergency&#8217; by the state.</p>
<p>Why are these journalists whining about China, Pakistan and India, when the same nasty things are being done right here? Those countries are acting rationally and following the example of the UK.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Pakistan Telecommunications Authority legal notice urged ISPs to report customers using &#8220;all such mechanisms including EVPNs [encrypted virtual private networks] which conceal communication to the extent that prohibits monitoring&#8221;. Anyone needing to use this technology needs to apply for special permission, the notice said.</p></blockquote>
<p>OUTRAGEOUS! Not.</p>
<blockquote><p>Authorities in Islamabad insisted that the ban on VPN access was intended to stem communications by terrorists.</p></blockquote>
<p>Terrorists do not use VPNs or GPG/PGP. Those of you who are up on this remember <a href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=817" title="BLOGDIAL  &raquo; Blog Archive   &raquo; Lucid thought breakout on Security Theatre">the bogus Steganography Threat that did the rounds years ago</a>. Bad journalists at papers like the Guardian claimed that terrorists were hiding secret messages inside photos posted on the internet. There has never been a single instance of this found; it was just pure hype, just like this article is pure hype, and like the pretext Pakistan is using to ban VPNs because of &#8216;Terrorism&#8217; is pure nonsense.</p>
<blockquote><p>However, banks, call centres and many other businesses use encrypted connections to communicate with their branches and customers, to protect sensitive data such as account numbers and passwords.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is why the French ban in the 1990s didn&#8217;t make sense, and this doesn&#8217;t make sense either.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is like banning cars because suicide bombers use them,&#8221; said Shakir Husain, chief executive of Creative Chaos, a Karachi-based software company. &#8220;You have to find out who these guys [extremists] are. This is a blanket, knee-jerk, response.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr Husain, you cannot possibly expect common sense out of these people. They exist in a parallel universe where logic, rational thought, morality, ethics and decency are poisons.</p>
<blockquote><p>There is strict regulation of internet traffic in Pakistan.</p></blockquote>
<p>LETS BOMB THEM! REGIME CHANGE! SPREAD DEMOCRACY!</p>
<blockquote><p>Last year, the authorities banned the entire Facebook website for months after a user launched a contest to draw a cartoon of the prophet Muhammad.</p></blockquote>
<p>LETS BOMB THEM! REGIME CHANGE! SPREAD DEMOCRACY!</p>
<blockquote><p>Accessing the internet on BlackBerry smartphones is problematic, because of the device&#8217;s high-security encryption software.</p></blockquote>
<p>But its not a problem for the US/UK, because they have back door access, and journalists at the Guardian do not care about that; instead, they care about a country thousands of miles away, where no one reads their rag, where only the elites use the internet, and where they cannot have any influence whatsoever. No, this article is designed to make <i>you</i> feel good about living in the &#8216;free&#8217; west, to pour scorn on Pakistan, and to loosen your resistance in advance of the day when the bombs start dropping on them.</p>
<blockquote><p>Recently the regulator made it impossible for Pakistanis to access the website of Rolling Stone magazine, after it published an article on the high proportion of the national budget in Pakistan that goes on its military.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/30/pakistan-bans-encryption-software" title="Pakistan to ban encryption software | World news | The Guardian">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/30/pakistan-bans-encryption-software</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>In Britain, you can be arrested for possessing books. Pakistan banning Rolling Stone is no different in any way.</p>
<p>Britain has the <a href="http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/governmentrequests/removals/" title="Content Removal Requests<br />
&ndash;<br />
Google Transparency Report">highest level of google takedowns</a> in the whole world. Blogs are amongst the most targeted. Of course, the Guardian has nothing to say about this whatsoever; all eyes on PAKISTAN!</p>
<p>This is warmongering, hypocrisy and nauseating, stinking garbage wrapped into one pice of filthy propaganda.</p>
<p>Anyone with an intact moral centre understands that the people in Pakistan have the right to live in whatever way they choose. It is not the place of anyone to point a finger at them and say that they are not living correctly; point your bony finger at your own State and its dirty dealings, immoral restrictions, privacy invasions, lies and mass murders and fix your own problems.</p>
<p>Lest we forget, people in Pakistan are not plagued by millions of CCTV cameras; you can walk all over the place there without being watched. Which country has the most CCTV cameras in the entire world, violating millions of people on a daily basis?</p>
<p>It seems today, that it is impossible to read any article in a newspaper that tells the truth.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter any more.</p>
<p>No one is getting their news from the war machine and its paid shill monsters. Take a look at this:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/CuBuKL7ismk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Look at the seething, roiling anger in the face of the murder machine apologist, face contorting like a cornered rat. These people <i>know</i> that the jig is up, no one trusts them anymore, no one is listening to them; all they have are straw men, ad hominems and syrupy appeals to emotion.</p>
<p>This is why we have the absurd stories of viagra fuelled rape squads and all the other completely bat-shit insane lies paraded by the lie machines. These stories, the manufactured propaganda smears are as sick as the people who repeat them. They need to go this far, because they have been caught lying so many times with the more reasonable sounding stories that only completely crazy scenarios will work to grasp anyone&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p>Sadly for them, thanks to the internet, these lies do not last more than a few days before they are completely debunked. They are running out of tools (plausible and implausible lies) that they can sell. This is why they are so angry; there is no higher volume to turn their lies to past eleven on the dial, and it is why, as you can see in the video above, they are so angry at Russia Today, who are playing better chess than them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/RussiaToday" title="RussiaToday&#39;s Channel<br />
      - YouTube">Russia Today</a> is outflanking all other news media by telling the truth using the mouths of people who have the truth in them.</p>
<p>They get on a wide variety of completely credible people to tell you the whole truth, and who, when you research what you have been told, can be verified every time as telling the whole truth.</p>
<p>Contrast this with what The Times, the BBC and The Guardian peddle, and you begin to understand why Russia Today has all the respect, attention and the traffic, and why the US/UK mainstream media is losing money, credibility and attention.</p>

					<p>Whilst roving around a major city in the UK, I was overwhelmed by the filth, the poverty, the <a title="" href="http://www.brianbolland.net/assets/pics/original_art/Cursed_Earth_postergraph_2.jpg">distorted faces</a>, the ground-in misery, the decay and the hopelessness in evidence whichever way you cared to look.</p>
<p>Contrast this with the shining, enthusiastic, clean, efficient, free, beautiful, soaked with hope and promise Internet, where everything is possible, if you can write software or operate a mouse.</p>
<p>Buying things in the streets is a disgusting experience. Not only are people ugly and rude, but the streets themselves are incredibly filthy, with layers of ground in grime from the feet and garbage of millions of people who leave every type of food and waste behind them like upright slugs trailing dirty slime behind them.</p>
<p>You may be lucky enough to need something from a shop that is clean and neat, and it may even have staff that can speak in a polite manner. When you enter, if you are <i>really</i> lucky, it could even have air conditioning. Even if that is the case, after you have done your business, for which you are robbed of an extra 20% on top of the price you pay for no good reason, you have to return to the pig-filthy streets to get anywhere, and you had to arrive by those same foul streets to get there in the first place, and when you leave, you are burdened with packages.</p>
<p>Contrast this with shopping on the Internet. You click through some beautifully laid out pages, compare and contrast prices from different &#8216;stores&#8217;, read the voluntarily donated opinions of other decent, literate people who are honest and who have your best interests at heart, and then, when you make your decision, you click a button to find that the next day your shoes arrive.</p>
<p>Even then, if you do not like your new shoes, you can return them and get your money back, no questions asked.</p>
<p>The online world is <i>much better</i> than the &#8216;real world&#8217;. It is <a title="" href="http://nihonshukyo.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/guild_highliner.jpg">travelling without moving</a>. It is connecting without effort. It presents a face to you that goes out of its way not to offend you. It is intelligent, cultured, educated, funny, humble, gentle, easy to get on with, inoffensive, useful and entirely beneficial.</p>
<p>What happens when you try and connect these two worlds, to try and bring the benefits of the online world to the &#8216;real world&#8217;? <a href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=3160#more-3160" class="more-link">Read the rest of this entry &raquo;</a></p>

					<p>The Grauniad has an astonishing report of a newsletter published by Belgravia police station, where people are advised to <i>report anarchists to the police.</i></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not making this up:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Anarchists should be reported, advises Westminster anti-terror police</b><br />
<i>Islamist terrorists also mentioned in briefing, as anarchists complain of being criminalised for their beliefs</i></p>
<p>What should you do if you discover an anarchist living next door? </p>
<p>[...] </p>
<p>the answer, according to an official counter-terrorism notice circulated in London last week, is that you must report them to police immediately.</p>
<p>This was the surprising injunction from the Metropolitan Police issued to businesses and members of the public in Westminster last week. There was no warning about other political groups, but next to an image of the anarchist emblem, the City of Westminster police&#8217;s &#8220;counter terrorist focus desk&#8221; called for anti-anarchist whistleblowers stating: &#8220;Anarchism is a political philosophy which considers the state undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful, and instead promotes a stateless society, or anarchy. Any information relating to anarchists should be reported to your local police.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What the <b>HELL?!</b></p>
<blockquote><p>The note was issued from Belgravia Police Station as part of Project Griffin which aims to &#8220;advise and familiarise managers, security officers and employees of large public and private sector organisations across the capital on security, counter-terrorism and crime prevention issues&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jul/31/westminster-police-anarchist-whistleblower-advice" title="Anarchists should be reported, advises Westminster anti-terror police | UK news | The Guardian">Grauniad</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Here is a page that has the actual report linked from it. The Grauniad didn&#8217;t think you should actually read the report for yourself:</p>
<p><a href="http://liberalconspiracy.org/2011/07/31/met-counter-terrorism-office-report-anarchists-to-the-police/" title="Counter-terrorist office &#8211; grass up anarchists!  |  Liberal Conspiracy">http://liberalconspiracy.org/2011/07/31/met-counter-terrorism-office-report-anarchists-to-the-police/</a></p>
<p>The first thing that is interesting about that document is (apart from its appalling graphic design) that <i>there is no named author</i>.</p>
<p>What <a href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=2258" title="BLOGDIAL  &raquo; Blog Archive   &raquo; What is a &#8216;public servant&#8217;?">public servant</a> was responsible for this gaffe, who told her to write this and why is she not accountable? You KNOW why.</p>
<p>Now lets think about this carefully.</p>
<p>Why has some uneducated person put this nonsense into that document?</p>
<p>From their point of view, the only exposure to &#8216;Anarchism&#8217; they have had is the agent provocateurs who routinely smash up McDonalds and bank windows. They equate this criminal behaviour with Anarchism because the people who do that violence <i>say that they are Anarchists</i>.</p>
<p>In fact, the truth is those people <u>are not Anarchists</u>, but are in many instances <b>members of the police, sent out to cause trouble.</b> This is <a href="http://www.infowars.com/police-used-agents-provocateurs-at-uk-bush-protests/" title="&raquo; Police Used &#8220;Agents Provocateurs&#8221; At UK Bush Protests  Alex Jones&#039; Infowars: There&#039;s a war on for your mind!">a well established fact</a>.</p>
<p>Now, not all the police are aware that their own force is being used as a tool in this way, and I imagine that they would be shocked, SHOCKED to find out that this was so; nevertheless, these compartmentalised, unnamed people are playing right along in their roles, obeying orders without any care or concern for their duties or the truth.</p>
<p>And they wonder why the ideas of Libertarianism are spreading like wildfire. All anyone has to do is read this Grauniad article to be completely outraged, as all of the comments on that article demonstrate.</p>
<p>Grauniad readers are staunch anti-Libertarians to a man, but they are not not stupid, and can tell right from wrong where their own rights overlap with the rights of others when it comes to free speech. They know that this statement is only one step away from applying directly to them and their ideas.</p>
<p>Thinking once again, from the point of view of an uneducated, low IQ man, how can you spot an anarchist? More importantly, how can you spot who is <i>not</i> an anarchist?</p>
<p>There is one easy way to tell who is or who is not an anarchist; anarchists are:</p>
<p><b>1/ Non violent</b>: Anarchists do not use violence to achieve their goal of a stateless society.</p>
<p>Thats pretty much it. Anyone who smashes a McDonalds window, or who engages in any violence of any kind <i><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQRO8via7uU" title="&#x202a;The Individual vs. the State: Institutionalized Coercion - Doug Casey in &#39;The Fall of America&#39;&#x202c;&rlm; - YouTube">is not an anarchist</a></i> by definition. The people who do that are <u>CRIMINALS, not anarchists</u>.</p>
<p>And for the record, the goal of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQRO8via7uU" title="&#x202a;The Individual vs. the State: Institutionalized Coercion - Doug Casey in &#39;The Fall of America&#39;&#x202c;&rlm; - YouTube">a stateless society</a> is a completely logical, moral, realistic and just goal, and that police report is correct in this single aspect;</p>
<blockquote><p>Anarchism is a political philosophy which considers the state undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful, and instead promotes a stateless society, or anarchy. Any information relating to anarchists should be reported to your local Police.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lets do this.</p>
<blockquote><p>Anarchism is a political philosophy.</p></blockquote>
<p>CORRECT.</p>
<blockquote><p>which considers the state undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful,</p></blockquote>
<p>WRONG.</p>
<p>Anarchists can PROVE, through logic, ethics and history that the state is harmful, unnecessary and undesirable. This is not something that anarchists <i>consider</i> or is something that is mere <i>opinion</i>, any more than people &#8216;consider&#8217; that the sky is blue; the state IS evil, is not needed and is toxic to humanity and that is a fact, not conjecture, a belief, an article of faith or any of those things.</p>
<p>Now, taking all of this into consideration, that the &#8216;anarchists&#8217; who attend demonstrations and smash things to pieces are not anarchists at all either because they are not philosophically anarchists or because they are agent provocateurs and given the fact that anarchists are non violent, and have the right to publish and espouse anything they like in writing or by any other means, if someone was to report an anarchist to the police at Belgravia station&#8230;</p>
<p>What are they going to do?</p>
<p>Arrest someone for reading a book? Or publishing a pamphlet? Or writing a blog?</p>
<p>Whoever they did that to, would be in line for <b>MILLIONS OF POUNDS in compensation</b>, after a sensational, high profile trial, which would be taken on a contingency basis by a line of Britain&#8217;s top law firms, who would queue around the block for a chance of easy money. Academics from all over the world would submit amicus briefs on behalf of the defense.</p>
<p>They would have a snowballs chance in hell of getting away with it.</p>
<p>I simply cannot believe that the police in Belgravia have so much time on their hands that they can even be doing this sort of infantile nonsense. No one wants these ridiculous, meaningless scaremongering reports. They do not prevent crime, cannot prevent crime, waste time and money and bring the profession of policing further into disrepute.</p>
<p>Of course, Libertarians have an answer to this.</p>
<p>Libertarians understand that the State should not have a monopoly on security. Security is a <i>service</i> that should be produced by the market:</p>
<blockquote><p>The market and private enterprise do exist, and so most people can readily envision a free market in most goods and services. Probably the most difficult single area to grasp, however, is the abolition of government operations in the service of protection: police, the courts, etc. — the area encompassing defense of person and property against attack or invasion. How could private enterprise and the free market possibly provide such service? How could police, legal systems, judicial services, law enforcement, prisons — how could these be provided in a free market? We have already seen how a great deal of police protection, at the least, could be supplied by the various owners of streets and land areas. But we now need to examine this entire area systematically.</p>
<p>In the first place, there is a common fallacy, held even by most advocates of laissez-faire, that the government must supply &#8220;police protection,&#8221; as if police protection were a single, absolute entity, a fixed quantity of something which the government supplies to all. But in actual fact there is no absolute commodity called &#8220;police protection&#8221; any more than there is an absolute single commodity called &#8220;food&#8221; or &#8220;shelter.&#8221; It is true that everyone pays taxes for a seemingly fixed quantity of protection, but this is a myth. In actual fact, there are almost infinite degrees of all sorts of protection. For any given person or business, the police can provide everything from a policeman on the beat who patrols once a night, to two policemen patrolling constantly on each block, to cruising patrol cars, to one or even several round-the-clock personal bodyguards. Furthermore, there are many other decisions the police must make, the complexity of which becomes evident as soon as we look beneath the veil of the myth of absolute &#8220;protection.&#8221; How shall the police allocate their funds which are, of course, always limited as are the funds of all other individuals, organizations, and agencies? How much shall the police invest in electronic equipment? fingerprinting equipment? detectives as against uniformed police? patrol cars as against foot police, etc.?</p>
<p>The point is that the government has no rational way to make these allocations. The government only knows that it has a limited budget. Its allocations of funds are then subject to the full play of politics, boondoggling, and bureaucratic inefficiency, with no indication at all as to whether the police department is serving the consumers in a way responsive to their desires or whether it is doing so efficiently. The situation would be different if police services were supplied on a free, competitive market. In that case, consumers would pay for whatever degree of protection they wish to purchase. The consumers who just want to see a policeman once in a while would pay less than those who want continuous patrolling, and far less than those who demand twenty-four-hour bodyguard service. On the free market, protection would be supplied in proportion and in whatever way that the consumers wish to pay for it. A drive for efficiency would be insured, as it always is on the market, by the compulsion to make profits and avoid losses, and thereby to keep costs low and to serve the highest demands of the consumers. Any police firm that suffers from gross inefficiency would soon go bankrupt and disappear.</p>
<p>One big problem a government police force must always face is: what laws really to enforce? Police departments are theoretically faced with the absolute injunction, &#8220;enforce all laws,&#8221; but in practice a limited budget forces them to allocate their personnel and equipment to the most urgent crimes. But the absolute dictum pursues them and works against a rational allocation of resources. On the free market, what would be enforced is whatever the customers are willing to pay for. Suppose, for example, that Mr. Jones has a precious gem he believes might soon be stolen. He can ask, and pay for, round-the-clock police protection at whatever strength he may wish to work out with the police company. He might, on the other hand, also have a private road on his estate he doesn&#8217;t want many people to travel on — but he might not care very much about trespassers on that road. In that case, he won&#8217;t devote any police resources to protecting the road. As on the market in general, it is up to the consumer — and since all of us are consumers this means each person individually decides how much and what kind of protection he wants and is willing to buy.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know anyone who does not think that there are not enough police on the streets. If the police had any sense, they would understand that in a Libertarian system, there would be <i>more</i> of them, doing <i>real police work</i> for <i>better money and conditions</i>, and they would not be wasting their time writing silly pamphlets and enforcing laws that outlaw victimless crimes like the statues covering the current round of insane prohibition. Even the police are <a href="http://www.leap.cc/" title="LEAP |<br />
Law Enforcement Against Prohibition">starting to wake up about that particular corner of the insane asylum</a>.</p>
<p>While we are at it look at this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Police to carry out on-the-spot fingerprinting in the street even for minor traffic offences</b></p>
<p>Police are now armed with a device that can scan fingerprints so they can correctly identify suspects who lie about their details.</p>
<p>In what sounds like something out of George Orwell&#8217;s dystopia 1984, suspects can now be finger printed in the street thanks to the new hand-held police gadget.</p>
<p>The mobile identification service scans a print, then checks it by trawling through a national database for the details.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2021074/Police-carry-spot-fingerprinting-street-just-seconds.html" title="Police to carry out on-the-spot fingerprinting in the street in just seconds<br />
 | Mail Online">Daily Mail</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Sound familiar? It should; we <a href="http://www.irdial.com/blogger/archive/2004_01_11_blarchive.html#107384391229545198" title="BLOGDIAL : We are the best">told you about this many years ago</a>.</p>
<p>There appear to be some people who are awake. Look at this top comment on the Daily Mail article:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you have never been finger printed by the police, and the vast majority of the population have not, then how can this device tell a roadside copper if you are lying or not?</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is exactly the point that we make in <a href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=2644" title="BLOGDIAL  &raquo; Blog Archive   &raquo; ID Cards: the coalition takes the Apartheid approach">this article</a>, and what we repeated <a href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?page_id=205" title="BLOGDIAL   &raquo; BLOGDIAL on ID cards">over and over in different variations</a> for <a href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?page_id=205" title="BLOGDIAL   &raquo; BLOGDIAL on ID cards">a decade</a>.</p>
<p>These devices exist not to protect you from criminals, but are there to make money for the vendors that manufacture them. Each one is connected to a Blackberry, and then there is the cost of the bespoke scanner attachment and the management of the database. This is nothing more than fleecing the population.</p>
<p>But I digress.</p>
<p>What these people are saying is that if you <a href="http://mises.org/rothbard/newlibertywhole.asp" title="For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto - Murray N. Rothbard - - Mises Institute">read a book</a> and then agree with what is in it, you are a criminal, a &#8216;terrorist&#8217;. Its completely absurd of course, but it is an indication of a fundamental shift that is taking place.</p>
<p>These people are scared. They are scared of <b>ideas</b>. If these people are so terrified by ideas the whole edifice must be crumbling invisibly before our very eyes, and in fact, this is a very clear sign of that happening.</p>
<p>A society that is secure in its beliefs and values, in this case, the right of free speech and the right to believe whatever you want to believe, has no cause to turn against its own fundamental principles in order to &#8216;protect itself&#8217;. The fact that they are now (and have been for over ten years) turning against the core values of their &#8216;society&#8217; is a clear sign that the system is slowly moving into panic mode. The problem for them is that they will not be able to stem the tide.</p>
<p>No power on earth can stop <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap4cZhtMwis" title="&#x202a;Ron Paul: State of the Union Address Part 1 of 3&#x202c;&rlm;<br />
      - YouTube">an idea whose time has come</a>. The reality is that all the violence is coming from <b>them</b> and the majority will do nothing while the edifice collapses. Then, one day, as it happened in East Germany, the State will simply <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjNz1lvXgzU" title="&#x202a;The Fall of the Berlin Wall (PART 1) - East Germany opens the gates (BBC News 9th November 1989 )&#x202c;&rlm; - YouTube">cease to exist</a>, only this time, there will be no &#8216;West Germany&#8217; to take the place of the dead State. The world will not end, violence will not break out, there will not be chaos or a breakdown of order. There will only be a end to coercion by the State.</p>
<p>Depending on who you are and what you have come to know is the truth, this is either a very good thing or a very bad thing. You cannot un-know a truth; Libertarianism cannot now be un-seen or un-read or un-published. The ideas are out there, anyone who encounters them, because they are crystal clear in their truths, observations, analysis and logic, is converted to them. The economic collapse, predicted by the Austrians and the anarcho-capitalists is coming true like clockwork. They have <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi-P-pLO0vY" title="&#x202a;The Kingdom of Moltz by Irwin Schiff&#x202c;&rlm;<br />

<p>This is inevitable, and will no doubt accelerate as a pound of butter goes to £5 in the supermarket.</p>
<p>Real anarchists <i>do nothing</i> except <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/blog/lewrw/archives/92262.html" title="Fascist Britain &laquo;  LewRockwell.com Blog">tell the truth day in and day out</a>.

					<p>It appears that Anonymous is not releasing its mothelode containing 4GB of News of the World emails, because it may &#8216;prejudice the case&#8217;.</p>
<p>This is an error.</p>
<p>Seeking justice from a court that is run by the State is not rational in this case, and here is why.</p>
<p>Lets say that News International is found guilty of a crime and then is fined 500,000 pounds, or 5,000,000 or 50,000,000&#8230; so what?</p>
<p>What if both the Murdocks are sacked; once again <i>so what?</i></p>
<p>News International continues to promote and lie on behalf of the bogus war on terror, the bogus war on drugs, democracy, lies in general, the erosion of liberty and it continues its unequivocal unquestioning support for the regime(s). A small fine is the most you can expect from any judgement a court might hand down, and of course, this is reasonable. Just because they have done some bad things, that doesn&#8217;t give a court the right to completely annihilate their business.</p>
<p>Justice in this case would be a total and completely effective boycott of News International by properly informed public. It would destroy them comprehensively and utterly, based on nothing more than their own words, as contained in the email motherlode.</p>
<p>No court in any country that wants to preserve its patina of &#8216;fairness&#8217; can ever deliver this deathblow result, which would be <i>real</i> justice. Consider what happened to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ratner" title="Gerald Ratner - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">the jewellers Ratner&#8217;s</a> who were almost put out of business overnight thanks to the honest words of its head in a single speech. That was all it took.</p>
<p>Anonymous has in its hands, a weapon that could be millions of times more powerful than the single utterance of the boss of Ratner&#8217;s. The News of the World has been listening in to the voicemails of thousands of people, now their communications are going to be probed. This is true, like for like justice. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retributive_justice" title="Retributive justice - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Retributive Justice</a>.</p>
<p>Libertarians understand that the State should not be the sole dispenser of justice, and that justice is a service, just like any other. The same people that murder men in other countries protect themselves with the courts that they effectively own. This is why Tony Bliar will never be brought before a British court to answer for mass murder, even though he is guilty of that crime as an accomplice and instigator.</p>
<p>Seeking justice from inside the matrix on its terms and inside its controls cannot, by definition, be real justice; it can only be <i>a simulation of justice</i>.</p>
<p>Anonymous can do whatever they like with the docs they have obtained. They took the risk to get them, and its up to them how they want to dispose of them, wether that is doling them out piecemeal, deleting them or releasing them in their entirety.</p>
<p>What they must understand is that they have the power to dispense justice themselves, by releasing the docs. The question that immediately comes to mind is are they being influenced by the media outlets they are working with:</p>

<p>who knows?</p>
<p>One thing is for sure; working with newspapers is retarding their movement, which is the job of the Mainstream Media gatekeepers like the Guardian.</p>
<p>For the record, justice does not mean violence. The State and its fear soaked control addicts conflate justice dispensed outside of its courts with violence to frighten people away from the idea that justice is a service. Justice does not mean hanging or imprisonment or other violence, it means (in general) <i>an equitable settlement of partie&#8217;s claims, based on the facts of a grievance, that is mutually satisfactory.</i></p>
<p>If the Anons wants justice, they should let everyone make up their own minds wether or not News International is a fit company to receive their money. The only way to do that is to release the documents in full.</p>
<p>Consider this. There must be information in that 4GB motherlode that might be useful to a victim of the State, that has no meaning to you as you gate-keep the gigabytes of information.</p>
<p>Imagine that some poor person without the connections or resources to fight the oligarchy / State has been suffering under their heel; lets say someone powerful wants his land or his house, and has framed him up to steal it from him. The evidence of this might be in a motherlode of files that you are poring over, that you might miss because it doesn&#8217;t seem important; <i>but it is important to that man who is being victimised</i>.</p>
<p>An even more germane example would be evidence that the News of the World has run a smear campaign against a person or company; the evidence is in there waiting to be released to vindicate the vilified person. Even more interesting would be an expose of all the PR companies that have been feeding stories to the News of the World. We all know that Facebook has been caught running a PR campaign against Google, can you even begin to <i>imagine</i> the number of emails from PR companies that must be in that motherlode, and how they will completely expose the way newspapers simply churn out stories that are fed to them? That would be a real public service, and no one would ever read a newspaper with the same eyes ever again. The spell of churnalism would be broken forever, and everyone reading a newspaper story would immediately, instinctively put up a barrier between them and the print that keeps the story from entering their consciousness uncritically. From then on, the first thing everyone reading a story would ask before and after reading it would be, <i>&#8220;Now, I wonder who is paying for this story&#8221;</i>. It would constitute an unprecedented healthy scepticism that would spread throughout the world.</p>
<p>All this from the release of <i>a single tarball</i>.</p>
<p>That is justice.<br />
That is moving forward and never going back.<br />
That is progress.<br />
That is solving problems.</p>
<p>Everyone needs to have access to everything for the dam holding back justice to be broken.</p>
<p>Finally, some who agree with the stance that Anonymous takes on things still believe that democracy is a good thing. They claim that the Norwegian president saying that the answer to violence is more democracy is correct. This is patently false. <i>Democracy itself is violence:</i></p>

<p>The answer to violence is to say &#8220;NO&#8221; to violence.</p>
<p>That means <b>&#8220;NO&#8221; to all violence and coercion, no matter where it comes from</b>.</p>
<p>Democracy is violence and coercion. You cannot be against violence and for the violence of the State at the same time. If you are for the State, and for democracy, then you are for all the bad things that come out it, its violence and all the bad stuff that you quite rightly want to see and end of. You cannot, or at least, should not, hold two opposing ideas in your mind at the same time. Unless you are a quantum physicist.</p>
<p>This is a difficult concept to understand at first, but once you grasp it, it becomes clear that the answer to violence can never be more violence, especially the unprecedented mechanised industrial scale violence of democracy and the State, which is more violent than any mafia gang or any organised entity in the history of the worl.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what happens to that 4GB file, especially when Topiary, who has apparently just been arrested, is made the next victim of the standard and insidious mainstream media character assassination that is done to everyone like that. You need only look at what happened to Julian Assange for a good example of how mainstream media deliberately sets out to poison the perception of people, and of course, evidence of a coordinated PR effort to smear Assange could very well be in that motherlode.</p>
<p><b>Think about it! </b></p>

</ul>
<p>	<b>Prologue</b> </p>
<p>	The extent of mankind’s primordial cultural activity stretches back at least half a million years, but thanks to repeated erasure by glaciation we start the notable cultural events calendar at 50,000<sub>BC</sub>. </p>
<p>	51,709 years later a nascent empire and its pampered press have the impudence to decide that mankind’s cultural commonwealth would be so much better if a law was created to prohibit people from copying each other.  </p>
<p>	There are a few words for the precursory, unbridled cultural intercourse that still remain in the English language, though they are almost obsolete: ‘folksong’, ‘folkmusic’, ‘folktales’, and ‘folklore’. These primeval springs are still known to a few among us and can be found seeping through the pre-renaissance foundations upon which our modern culture stands. </p>
<p>	Today we have the luxury of looking back over the last three centuries of ‘protection’ to see how much richer our culture has become, being effectively manacled and enclosed by corporations such as Disney. Permitted the liberty only to create purely original works, albeit with some tolerance for cultural cross contamination (if not too flagrant), we enjoy a far more creative and diverse culture. Or rather, this is what Queen Anne’s Stationers’ Guild and its descendant publishing corporations would persuade us is the consequence of her wise enactment of law to ‘protect’ published works from the grubby hands and mouths of the great unwashed. </p>
<p>	<em>Nothing to do with the printers’ monopolies then…</em> </p>
<p>	Let us see the historical accident of copyright in perspective: </p>

<p>	Seen in a proper perspective, copyright is a legislative misadventure borne of political expediency and commercial self-interest. It is a hiccup in mankind’s history and, in the face of the diffusive nature of information, is coming to an abrupt and natural end.</p>
