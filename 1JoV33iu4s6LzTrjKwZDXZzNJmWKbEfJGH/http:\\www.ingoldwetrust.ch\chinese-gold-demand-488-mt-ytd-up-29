class="post-content"><h1 title="Chinese Gold Demand 488 MT YTD, Up 29 %">Chinese Gold Demand 488 MT YTD, Up 29 %</h1><p>Although  last week <em>only</em> 34 metric tonnes of gold were withdrawn from the vaults of the Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE), down 6.52 % from the prior week, year to date there has been a staggering 488 metric tonnes withdrawn, up 29 % to compared to last year. Year to date demand will probably come on par with last year when we enter april, as withdrawals exploded in April 2013. What will happen after April is hard to say, this year&#8217;s average daily withdrawals stand at 6.7 metric tonnes, last years daily average was 6 metric tonnes (<a
title="Unprecedented Total Chinese Gold Demand 2013" href="http://www.ingoldwetrust.ch/unprecedented-total-chinese-gold-demand-2013">2197 mt</a> / 365). It will all depend on how much floating supply there is left&#8230;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span
style="text-decoration: underline;">At the current pace</span>, 6.7 metric tonnes a day, China will be roughly importing 1700 metric tonnes this year to meet SGE demand. My research has exposed that <a
title="Shanghai Gold Exchange Physical Delivery Equals Chinese Demand, Part 2" href="http://www.ingoldwetrust.ch/shanghai-gold-exchange-physical-delivery-equals-chinese-demand-part2">SGE withdrawals equal Chinese wholesale demand</a>. Not often, but sometimes we can read other analysts or media share the same findings. From the <a
href="http://www.gold.org.cn/detail_40_3591.aspx">Chinese media</a> (dated January 10, 2014):</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>China&#8217;s explosion in demand for physical gold in 2013 left a deep impression on international investors. The Shanghai Gold Exchange withdrawals for the year up till 27 December 2013 exceeded 2180 tons. <strong>Considering the exchange&#8217;s position as a hub for domestic gold circulation, in conjunction with a system that forbids withdrawn gold from re-entering inventory, to a large extent the withdrawals number can be treated as the best benchmark for physical gold demand in the Chinese market.</strong> Not to mention that the entire 2013 global mined gold production does not exceed 2700 tons. China&#8217;s massive demand has to a large extent remade the world&#8217;s gold circulation system. Newly mined and stocked gold is moving through trade links in London – Switzerland – Hong Kong – into China in a large scale orientation towards the East. The impact of China&#8217;s demand on international gold price will inevitably increase.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another quite interesting <a
href="http://www.gold.org.cn/detail_39_4229.aspx">headline in China</a> today:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>RMB Internationalization Requires To increase Gold Reserves</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A very  important condition for the internationalization of the renminbi is to increase Chinese gold reserves, because it increases the world&#8217;s confidence in the renminbi and expands it&#8217;s flow capacity.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It still beats me why not many other analysts, journalist and blogs have gotten involved in researching the Shanghai Gold Exchange an the Chinese gold market in general, as this unprecedented exodus of physical gold from West to East is talking place right in front of our eyes month after month.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kindly note, if someone could prove me wrong on my analysis about Chinese gold demand I would be happy the hear it.

Hong Kong has a booming jewelry industry, in the dense streets of The Special Administrative Region you can find  a jewelry store (mostly Chow Thai Fook) on every street corner. It&#8217;s estimated that half of all jewelry in Hong Kong is <a
href="http://www.ingoldwetrust.ch/gold-trade-numbers-2013-broke-records">sold to mainland</a> tourist, that can import as much as they like into the mainland. Mainland tourist prefer to buy jewelry in Hong Kong where there&#8217;s zero tax on jewelry, whereas in the mainland there&#8217;s a 22 % tax on jewelry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Plausible scenario: a Hong Kong jeweler imports bullion and exports it to the CSS area Shenzhen just across the border, that has a huge jewelry fabrication industry (cheap fabrication). In Shenzhen the jewelry is fabricated and exported back to Hong Kong to be sold in the shops. Note, for trading gold from Hong Kong in and out of a CSS area there is no PBOC permit required. To export gold out of a CSS area into the mainland a PBOC permit is required. I&#8217;ve been told this policy is airtight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, the inflating of import and export numbers from Hong Kong to the mainland does not influence net export to the mainland. Nor does it influence total mainland net import that supplies the SGE.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a

/> reached that conclusion for different reasons).</p><p><a
href="http://themindunleashed.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/earth-chakras1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://themindunleashed.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/earth-chakras1.jpg</a></p><p> The preponderance of evidence determines that “the Omega plan”<br
/> (described in the video), is running behind schedule. They have to keep<br
/> trying, but they are far from infallible, in fact, from my read of it,<br
/> they are so disconnected from “the source”, (God, or a universal<br
/> intelligence), they can&#8217;t possibly achieve their objectives.</p><p>It is only their   egotistical arrogance that drives them at this<br
/> point, they are working a plan hatched thousands of years in antiquity,<br
/> and do not have the capacity to accomplish their goals, because they are<br
/> opposed to the very source of spirit (God).</p><p>I do profoundly believe that human beings are spiritual entities<br
/> having a human experience, but it is only through a conscious contact<br
/> with the universal intelligence (the source, or God), that intentions<br
/> can come to fruition.  (Intentions that violate universal laws, cannot<br
/> come to fruition).</p><p>When Jeremiah Jr. posted the 3 min. video of Wayne Dyer declaring the<br
/> three final words of a 12 chapter book, (we are God), it is easy to<br
/> take such a statement out of context without  fully comprehending the<br
/> preceding 12 chapters. (Especially when it is in direct conflict with<br
/> biblical interpretations).</p><p>The “intelligent universe theory” also only works when you understand<br
/> that the universe is self organizing, and uses this intelligence for<br
/> creation and growth. It automatically opposes destruction. It promotes<br
/> love and peace, and it works against hate and chaos. (I have heard  evil<br
/> defined as separation from the source).</p><p>Granted, Lucifer declared that we are equal to God, but has no<br
/> comprehension that there are in fact universal laws, those that worship<br
/> and do the will of Lucifer, are doomed to failure. (They fail as soon as<br
/> they are exposed)</p><p>Even with the amazingly large conspiracy that dates back thousands of years to build a “one world order”,</p><p>using every technological advancement known to the universe, it still has no chance at all.</p><p>That&#8217;s why things seem to be at such a standoff right now.</p><p>Why I must believe what I do:</p><p>Although this is mildly off-topic, an explanation of my experience<br
/> might give you a window into my mind as to why I am past the point of no<br
/> return of  a particular biblical/church doctrine discussed on previous<br
/> pages.</p><p>The one thing that drove me into the depths of despair, in fact, into a suicidal depression, was loneliness.</p><p>When I was very, very young, I was quite capable of entertaining<br
/> myself, and  never knew loneliness, (this is despite the fact that I was<br
/> always alone).</p><p> After only a few years in Catholic school,  with the compulsory<br
/> Bible study, I learned that The  Creator was somewhat harsh, judgmental,<br
/> and used threats of eternal damnation to make sure I follow rules which<br
/> seemed primarily geared towards worshiping him, and supporting his<br
/> church.</p><p>Previously, I just innately felt a connection to my Creator, and<br
/> made the assumption that my creativity was my creator working through<br
/> me, or my spirit that has always been connected to him, and always would<br
/> be.</p><p>I know that we were taught that due to original sin, no such<br
/> connection could exist, but if we worshiped Jesus Christ as God, and<br
/> followed what sounded like a shit load of rules and regulations, then<br
/> after we died, (, and if we weren&#8217;t too bad),  we could camp out in<br
/> purgatory for an undefined amount of time, and then when God judged  us<br
/> worthy, we could finally meet our maker.</p><p>This philosophy damn near killed me, because I lost the connection that I had prior to this programming.</p><p>Shortly into recovery, I regained the connection with the universe,<br
/> became consciously aware of it, apply its principles of love,<br
/> synchronicity, and through meditation could always find the guidance<br
/> that I needed to solve whatever challenges  were put in front of me.</p><p>It quickly became apparent that if I was within harmony with “universal law”, (also defined as God&#8217;s will),</p><p> living my life is now relatively smooth sailing, and all that I<br
/> required would be freely available. Just this belief alone made poverty<br
/> impossible. Focusing on helping others, instead of helping myself,<br
/> provided job security without a job, and a sense of abundance in my<br
/> life.</p><p>Most importantly, knowing that we are all connected through “the<br
/> source”, and that we are in fact all one with it, (whether we realize<br
/> that or not),  made a lifelong and overwhelming sense of loneliness<br
/> simply evaporate.</p><p>I knew now at the core of my being, that I am never alone. I am not a<br
/> human being, separate from God and everyone else, trying to figure out<br
/> how to be spiritual,</p><p>I am in fact an eternal spiritual entity, connected to the universal<br
/> consciousness, along with all other matter in the universe, and at this<br
/> moment in time, I am having a human experience.</p><p>I live with a sense of wonderment, a desire to learn and  grow in<br
/> spirit, through practicing meditation, and even interpreting my dreams,<br
/> doing the right thing has become intuitive. I simply choose to live in<br
/> the solution,  and  strive to abide by universal law.</p><p>Puck T Smith was big on keeping it simple, he only had two laws:</p><p>Don&#8217;t lie, and don&#8217;t take other people&#8217;s stuff. I personally have<br
/> just a couple of more, because living a life in service of others has<br
/> massive benefits.</p><p>According to Puck T Smith,  such an ideology defines me as an atheist.</p><p>Recently, I have grown tired of labels, because prior to showing up here at TF metals, I never took the time to define myself.</p><p>All in all, I think it was better that way.</p><p>I do know, that if you do the right things, the right things happen. The universe requires that.</p><p>This is why what we have come to know as the evil empire can not, and will not succeed.</p><p>The universe will not allow it.  (God&#8217;s intervention)</p><p><a

/> will. But evil generally only triumphs over other evil,  to put it in<br
/> plain English, the parasites will be culled.  (Those living outside of<br
/> universal/God&#8217;s law).</p><p>This is why I believe “we win in the end”.</p></div></div></li><li

id="dsq-comment-message-2092" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This is DayStar (DS) with the Friday Harvey Report.</p><p>News and Commentary</p><p>Mark O’Byrne (GoldCore): Gold traded near the lowest in almost three<br
/> weeks as momentum traders and nervous longs pushed prices lower. Some<br
/> participants interpreted the Fed’s policy statement as more hawkish than<br
/> expected. Traders weighed the U.S. Federal Reserve’s indication that it<br
/> may raise interest rates next year against the crisis over Ukraine. The<br
/> short term trend and momentum is now down and gold is vulnerable to<br
/> further falls. Gold had become overbought after its surge to 6 month<br
/> highs and was due profit taking and a correction. Indeed, gold’s 6 month<br
/> highs last week had led to a 14% gain so far in 2014 which if it had<br
/> retained those gains, would have been gold’s best start to a year and<br
/> the best first quarter for gold since 1985. Gold is up 11% this year and<br
/> reached a six-month high of $1,392.22 an ounce on March 17 as turmoil<br
/> over Ukraine left Russia and the West embroiled in their worst<br
/> confrontation since the Cold War. The abatement of unresolved tensions<br
/> between Russia and the West has contributed to gold bullion’s pullback.</p><p>Harvey: Gold was thrown under the bus again today as soon as the<br
/> first fix in London was announced at 3 am and gold continued to falter<br
/> to $1321 until 8 am when gold advanced during the physical times zones<br
/> to $1332, only to be beaten down again in the paper phase of the<br
/> precious metals market to finish at $1330 Comex closing time at 1:30 pm<br
/> and $1328.00 access closing time. The big news today is the fall in the<br
/> Chinese yuan to over 6.229 yuan to the dollar. This collapses the yuan<br
/> /dollar carry trade by hedge funds and many Chinese investors. Copper<br
/> fell again today as collateral values are dropping like a stone. Chinese<br
/> investors are in a mad scramble for cash as they are selling their off<br
/> shore properties in London and Hong Kong . Today also saw the collapse<br
/> of the largest steel trust in Shanzi province, in the centre-west of<br
/> China. On state side: We have been pointing out continually, the<br
/> deteriorating condition inside the USA. Even today, another<br
/> bell-weather, Caterpillar missed expectations. Housing continues to<br
/> disappoint and today we witnessed a rise in unemployment claims. Not<br
/> only that but beef prices are rising as inflation seems to be soaring.<br
/> GLD and SLV: Today, the gold inventory at the GLD was unchanged at<br
/> 812.78 tonnes and the silver inventory at SLV remained constant<br
/> 10,164.74 tonnes. GOFO rates are now in the positive in all months and<br
/> are increasing.</p><p>GoldCore: Banking operations globally, including ATMs throughout the<br
/> world, are threatened as support from Microsoft for Windows XP operating<br
/> system will end from Tuesday, April 8. Windows XP also powers medical<br
/> devices, industrial control systems and some of the hardware used for<br
/> swiping credit cards. More than 95% of ATMs also run the operating<br
/> system, according to NCR, the largest provider of ATMs globally. It<br
/> expects only a third of ATM providers will upgrade before Microsoft’s<br
/> April 8th cut-off according to the Financial Times. Banks are being<br
/> asked to take immediate steps to prevent their ATMs becoming inoperable.<br
/> The end of support for Windows XP is likely to increase the probability<br
/> of attacks on such antiquated systems and may affect ATM operations<br
/> according to Microsoft. They are being advised both by Microsoft and<br
/> indeed by some central banks to take immediate steps to implement<br
/> appropriate systems and controls. DS: As I understand<br
/> it, what will happen is that MS will stop making bug fixes and<br
/> vulnerability fixes. The software will continue to run, and if the users<br
/> keep their virus checkers current, it should not be any more vulnerable<br
/> after the expiration of MS support than it was before. MS probably<br
/> wants the banks to install an operating system that has better support<br
/> for the NSA.</p><p>Jamie McGeever (Reuters): British regulators are examining evidence<br
/> relating to a 2012 meeting of currency dealers and Bank of England<br
/> officials that potentially challenges the central bank&#8217;s assertion it<br
/> had not condoned sharing details of client orders. The practice of<br
/> sharing details about such orders is at the center of a global rigging<br
/> probe. Transcripts of a foreign exchange chatroom, now in the hands of<br
/> Britain&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority, reveal that an unnamed senior<br
/> dealer who attended the meeting told fellow traders the next day that<br
/> Bank of England officials had agreed that there were advantages to<br
/> sharing client order information to minimize market volatility around<br
/> daily reference rates known as &#8220;fixings,&#8221; two sources familiar with<br
/> their content told Reuters. By sharing information during these fixings,<br
/> traders are able to match trades and minimize price swings, thereby<br
/> lessening the risk they take on big transactions.</p><p>Siddesh Mayenkar and Neha Dasgupta (Reuters): India has allowed five<br
/> domestic private-sector banks to import gold, in what industry officials<br
/> say could be a significant step toward easing of tough curbs on the<br
/> metal imposed last year to cut the country&#8217;s trade deficit. The move<br
/> could boost gold supplies and bring down premiums for the metal in the<br
/> world&#8217;s second-biggest consumer after China. The Reserve Bank of India<br
/> has allowed gold imports by HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank,<br
/> IndusInd Bank, and Yes Bank, officials at the respective banks told<br
/> Reuters.</p><p>Chris Powell (GATA): Chinese gold market researcher and GATA<br
/> consultant Koos Jansen has been interviewed for Matterhorn Asset<br
/> Management&#8217;s GoldSwitzerland Internet site by the German financial<br
/> journalist Lars Schall. Jansen sees the growth of China&#8217;s gold market as<br
/> the manifestation of the shift of economic power from the West to the<br
/> East. He explains how Western news and research reports about Chinese<br
/> gold demand underestimate it.</p><p>Hans Bentzien (The Wall Street Journal): European central banks may<br
/> end a 15-year-old restriction on sales of their gold holdings this year,<br
/> a top German central banker said. &#8220;The negotiations are still ongoing,&#8221;<br
/> Deutsche Bundesbank board member Carl-Ludwig Thiele said in a recent<br
/> interview with The Wall Street Journal. &#8230; Mr. Thiele indicated that<br
/> one reason the agreement may not be extended is because over the past<br
/> five years central bank gold sales have decreased significantly.</p><p>Shivom Seth (Mineweb): Even as gold imports fell substantially last<br
/> year, those of silver soared to a new high in 2013. India imported<br
/> around 5,500 tonnes of silver, 180% more than the previous year, a<br
/> sectoral analysis of the white metal has shown. As of 2012, India had<br
/> brought in 1,900.39 tonnes of silver. This was however, a massive drop<br
/> from the 4,087 tonnes of silver imported in 2011. In 2009, India<br
/> imported just 1,284 tonnes of silver, which then shot up to 3,029 tonnes<br
/> the next year. India&#8217;s 2013 silver imports are similar to those back in<br
/> 2008 when India imported around 5,048.02 tonnes, recent data shows With<br
/> lower prices as compared to gold jewellers restocked on silver to<br
/> ensure cheaper silver jewellery and smaller pieces are available to<br
/> consumers, traders said. &#8220;The price of silver averaged $23.85 an ounce<br
/> in 2013, from $31.17 in 2012, leading to higher demand. In the<br
/> international market, the price of silver has climbed a modest 10% in<br
/> 2014, but in India, the price is further down now,&#8221; said Pradeep<br
/> Rajeshnath, a bullion analyst with a broking house. However, in February<br
/> 2014, imports of silver were down by more than 60% at 24.43 tonnes as<br
/> compared to 80.86 tonnes of silver imports recorded in February 2013.<br
/> The drop has been attributed to the recent increase in import duty on<br
/> silver. Moreover, a note of caution was added by Premnarayan Pascale,<br
/> bullion analyst with a foreign institutional brokerage. &#8220;With more banks<br
/> allowed to import gold, the price of gold is bound to decrease. This<br
/> could eat into the sales of silver bars and jewellery from here on,&#8221; he<br
/> said.</p><p>Bill Holter (Miles Franklin): In a paper called &#8220;Money Creation in<br
/> the Modern Economy&#8221;, co-authored by three economists from the Bank&#8217;s<br
/> Monetary Analysis Directorate, they stated outright that most common<br
/> assumptions of how banking works are simply wrong, and that the kind of<br
/> populist, heterodox positions more ordinarily associated with groups<br
/> such as Occupy Wall Street are correct. In doing so, they have<br
/> effectively thrown the entire theoretical basis for austerity out of the<br
/> window. The world&#8217;s various currencies are in fact not money, they are<br
/> IOU&#8217;s. While I applaud the BOE for being forthright, I must ask &#8220;how in<br
/> the world did this happen&#8221;? While a few understand bankig, and the truth<br
/> about banks may be &#8220;obvious&#8221; to some of us, maybe 5% or even less, but<br
/> the other 95% either don&#8217;t understand or don&#8217;t have a clue. As I&#8217;ve<br
/> mentioned before in other writings, the &#8220;elite&#8221; feel that it is &#8220;bad<br
/> form&#8221; to destroy someone without &#8220;prior warning&#8221;&#8230;this may just be<br
/> their way of &#8220;warning the peasants&#8221; and fulfilling their own &#8220;good<br
/> manners&#8221;? [DS: Sounds a bit ominous when phrased like<br
/> that, but bankers can print all the money they need. Right?] So what&#8217;s<br
/> the problem? Central banks can create as much money as they&#8217;d like<br
/> right? Yes they can&#8230;but, they need someone, somewhere to borrow<br
/> it&#8230;and that is where we are today. There are not enough borrowers left<br
/> to borrow in the amounts necessary to hold &#8220;asset values&#8221; up. We are<br
/> already seeing this in China with their very first defaults. Less than<br
/> $10 billion has defaulted so far in 3 separate tranches yet their<br
/> &#8220;wealthy&#8221; are already out selling luxury properties all over the<br
/> world&#8230;to raise cash. This is because their shadow banking system went<br
/> from creating $160 billion in new loans in January to a big fat ZERO in<br
/> February! The credit spigot has simply been shut off. Why? For two<br
/> simple reasons, lack of collateral to lend or borrow against and that<br
/> phrase I keep repeating &#8220;debt saturation&#8221;. As to &#8220;why&#8221; the BOE decided<br
/> that &#8220;now&#8221; is the time to &#8216;fess up and explain what money is &#8220;during<br
/> normal times&#8221;, I can only guess that they &#8220;know&#8221;. They know that the jig<br
/> is up. They know that the Chinese are &#8220;running their bank&#8221; and<br
/> withdrawing too much money (gold). They know that they will be forced to<br
/> close their doors but &#8220;you were warned&#8221; so if you didn&#8217;t &#8220;get it&#8221;?<br
/> &#8230;Well then, it&#8217;s your own fault!</p><p>Zero Hedge: The Yuan has weakened over 250 pips in early China<br
/> trading. Trading at almost 6.22, we are now deeply intothe<br
/> significant-loss-realizing region of the world&#8217;s carry-traders and<br
/> Chinese over-hedgers. Morgan Stanley estimates a minimum $4.8bn loss for<br
/> each 100 pip move.However, the bigger picture is considerably worse as<br
/> the vicious circle of desperate liquidity needs are starting to gang up<br
/> on Hong Kong real estate and commodity prices. For those who see the<br
/> silver lining in this and construe all this as a reason to buy more<br
/> developed world stocks on the premise that the money flooding out of<br
/> China (et al.) will be parked in the S&amp;P are overlooking the fact<br
/> that the purchase price of these now-unwanted positions was most likely<br
/> borrowed, meaning that their liquidation will also extinguish the<br
/> associated credit, not re-allocate it. this is about forcing the<br
/> shadow-banking system to shrink before the bubble becomes totally<br
/> untenable&#8230; unfortunately, we suspect it already has&#8230;Oh dear,<br
/> remember the Chinese corporation that untenably insolvent but &#8220;promised&#8221;<br

/> *BAODING TIANWEI BOND TRADING SUSPENDED BY SHANGHAI EXCHANGE. Uh<br
/> oh&#8230;All the carry-funded idiocy of the world is starting to uwind. The<br
/> bigger issue is that the Chinese housing bubble is set to burst both<br
/> domestically and abroad, as we reported yesterday. And lest readers are<br
/> left with the impression that merely operational companies with direct<br
/> exposure to the deleveraging carnage that is taking place in China &#8211; at<br
/> least until such time as China unleashes another multi-trillion stimulus<br
/> &#8211; are exposed, also overnight financial firm Southchina Futures<br
/> announced it is terminating it business on &#8220;major operation risks.&#8221; We<br
/> wonder how long until the US stock market, floating in its cloud of<br
/> manipulated, centrally-planned oblivious innocence, realizes that a<br
/> China on the verge of all out deflationary recession is not a good<br
/> thing?</p><p>Tyler Durden: &#8220;Many mainland buyers bought lots of properties in Hong<br
/> Kong when the market was red-hot three years ago,&#8221; said Joseph Tsang,<br
/> managing director at Jones Lang LaSalle. &#8220;But now they want to cash in<br
/> as liquidity is quite tight in the mainland.&#8221; Once the Hong Kong<br
/> liquidation frenzy is over, and leaves the city in a state of shock,<br
/> watch as the great Chinese selling horde stampedes from Los Angeles, to<br
/> New York, to London, Zurich and Geneva, and leave not a single 50% off<br
/> sign in its wake. The good news? All those inaccessibly priced houses<br
/> that were solely the stratospheric domain of the ultra-high net worth<br
/> oligarch and criminal jet set, will soon be available to the general<br
/> public. Especially once the global housing bubble pops, which may have<br
/> just happened.</p><p>Zero Hedge: Following the default of 2 more corporations last<br
/> night,Hang Seng&#8217;s index of China Enterprises plunged to 8-month lows and<br
/> officially entered bear market territory. Overnight angst in the<br
/> Chinese currency markets (which saw the Yuan trade back to 1-year lows)<br
/> has sparked broad commodity weakness (as CCFD unwinds en masse) with<br
/> copper giving back most of yesterday&#8217;s major short squeeze gains back.<br
/> Chinese corporate bond prices also tumbled to one-month lows.</p><p>Tyler Durden: It would appear the IMF&#8217;s dirty little fingerprints are<br
/> all over this latest piece of legislation in Ukraine. The Ukraine<br
/> Finance Ministry is proposing to take a very-similar-to-Cyprus approach<br
/> to bailing in its despositors: *UKRAINE PROPOSES NEW TAX ON DEPOSITS<br
/> EXCEEDING 100,000 HRYVNIA. *UKRAINE TAX PROPOSAL WOULD INCLUDE 1.5% OF<br
/> ALL DEPOSITS. This would appear a measure designed to stabilize the<br
/> budget for potential IMF negotiations and fits perfectly with what the<br
/> IMF has consistently hinted as the next steps for many nations.</p><p>SRSRocco Report: So where is China getting all of its gold? One of<br
/> the large sources turns out to be the United States. The U.S.<br
/> experienced another record year of net gold exports in 2013. Not only<br
/> were gold exports at record levels, imports into the U.S. fell nearly<br
/> half compared to 2010. U.S. gold exports in 2010 were 383 metric tons<br
/> (mt), however by 2013, they increased 81% to 692 mt. In addition, U.S.<br

/> the March silver contract month.</p><p>In gold:</p><p>Quote:</p><p>In order to calculate what will be standing for delivery in March, I<br

/> little gold enter the dealer except from Brinks and adjustments.</p><p>Dealer Inventory Summary:</p><p>i) the total dealer inventory of gold settles tonight at a very dangerously low level of only 19.83 tonnes.</p><p>i) a) JPMorgan&#8217;s customer inventory rests tonight at 618,605.808 (19.24 tonnes).</p><p>ii b) JPMorgan&#8217;s dealer account rests tonight at 214,097.318 oz (6.659 tonnes).</p><p>iii) the 3 major bullion banks (JPMorgan, HSBC, and Scotia) have<br
/> collectively only 16.319 tonnes of gold left in their dealer account,<br
/> and what is totally remarkable is the fact that little gold entered the<br
/> dealer Comex vaults despite December and February are the busiest months<br
/> for the gold calendar. Another oddity is that the only gold that does<br
/> enter the customer account are kilobars and kilobars are generally of<br

href="http://www.tfmetalsreport.com/comment/393069#comment-393069" rel="nofollow">http://www.tfmetalsreport.com/comment/393069#comment-393069</a>.</p><p>Mark O’Byrne: Gold traded near the lowest in almost three weeks<br
/> as momentum traders and nervous longs pushed prices lower. Some<br
/> participants interpreted the Fed’s policy statement as more hawkish than<br
/> expected. Traders weighed the U.S. Federal Reserve’s indication that it<br
/> may raise interest rates next year against the crisis over Ukraine. The<br
/> short term trend and momentum is now down and gold is vulnerable to<br
/> further falls. Gold had become overbought after its surge to 6 month<br
/> highs and was due profit taking and a correction. Indeed, gold’s 6 month<br
/> highs last week had led to a 14% gain so far in 2014 which if it had<br
/> retained those gains, would have been gold’s best start to a year and<br
/> the best first quarter for gold since 1985. Gold is up 11% this year and<br
/> reached a six-month high of $1,392.22 an ounce on March 17.</p><p>Harvey: Gold was thrown under the bus again today as soon as the<br
/> first fix in London was announced at 3 am and gold continued to falter<br
/> to $1321 until 8 am when gold advanced during the physical times zones<br
/> to $1332, only to be beaten down again in the paper phase of the<br
/> precious metals market to finish at $1330 Comex closing time at 1:30 pm<br
/> and $1328.00 access closing time. The big news today is the fall in the<br
/> Chinese yuan to over 6.229 yuan to the dollar. This collapses the yuan<br
/> /dollar carry trade by hedge funds and many Chinese investors. Copper<br
/> fell again today as collateral values are dropping like a stone. Chinese<br
/> investors are in a mad scramble for cash as they are selling their off<br
/> shore properties in London and Hong Kong.</p><p>GoldCore: Banking operations globally, including ATMs throughout the<br
/> world, are threatened as support from Microsoft for Windows XP<br
/> operating system will end from Tuesday, April 8. Windows XP also powers<br
/> medical devices, industrial control systems and some of the hardware<br
/> used for swiping credit cards. More than 95% of ATMs also run the<br
/> operating system, according to NCR, the largest provider of ATMs<br
/> globally. It expects only a third of ATM providers will upgrade before<br
/> Microsoft’s April 8th cut-off according to the Financial Times. Banks<br
/> are being asked to take immediate steps to prevent their ATMs becoming<br
/> inoperational. The end of support for Windows XP is likely to increase<br
/> the probability of attacks on such antiquated systems and may affect ATM<br
/> operations according to Microsoft.</p><p>Jamie McGeever: British regulators are examining evidence relating<br
/> to a 2012 meeting of currency dealers and Bank of England officials that<br
/> potentially challenges the central bank&#8217;s assertion it had not condoned<br
/> sharing details of client orders. The practice of sharing details about<br
/> such orders is at the center of a global rigging probe. Transcripts of a<br
/> foreign exchange chatroom, now in the hands of Britain&#8217;s Financial<br
/> Conduct Authority, reveal that an unnamed senior dealer who attended the<br
/> meeting told fellow traders the next day that Bank of England officials<br
/> had agreed that there were advantages to sharing client order<br
/> information to minimize market volatility around daily reference rates<br
/> known as &#8220;fixings,&#8221; two sources familiar with their content told<br
/> Reuters. By sharing information during these fixings, traders are able<br
/> to match trades and minimize price swings, thereby lessening the risk<br
/> they take on big transactions.</p><p>Siddesh Mayenkar and Neha Dasgupta: India has allowed five domestic<br
/> private-sector banks to import gold, in what industry officials say<br
/> could be a significant step toward easing of tough curbs on the metal<br
/> imposed last year to cut the country&#8217;s trade deficit. The move could<br
/> boost gold supplies and bring down premiums for the metal in the world&#8217;s<br
/> second-biggest consumer after China. The Reserve Bank of India has<br
/> allowed gold imports by HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank,<br
/> IndusInd Bank, and Yes Bank, officials at the respective banks told<br
/> Reuters.</p><p>Chris Powell: Chinese gold market researcher and GATA consultant<br
/> Koos Jansen has been interviewed for Matterhorn Asset Management&#8217;s<br
/> GoldSwitzerland Internet site by the German financial journalist Lars<br
/> Schall. Jansen sees the growth of China&#8217;s gold market as the<br
/> manifestation of the shift of economic power from the West to the East.<br
/> He explains how Western news and research reports about Chinese gold<br
/> demand underestimate it.</p><p>Hans Bentzien (The Wall Street Journal): European central banks may<br
/> end a 15-year-old restriction on sales of their gold holdings this year,<br
/> a top German central banker said. &#8220;The negotiations are still ongoing,&#8221;<br
/> Deutsche Bundesbank board member Carl-Ludwig Thiele said in a recent<br
/> interview with The Wall Street Journal. &#8230; Mr. Thiele indicated that<br
/> one reason the agreement may not be extended is because over the past<br
/> five years central bank gold sales have decreased significantly.</p><p>Shivom Seth (Mineweb): Even as gold imports fell substantially last<br
/> year, those of silver soared to a new high in 2013. India imported<br
/> around 5,500 tonnes of silver, 180% more than the previous year, a<br
/> sectoral analysis of the white metal has shown. As of 2012, India had<br
/> brought in 1,900.39 tonnes of silver. This was however, a massive drop<br
/> from the 4,087 tonnes of silver imported in 2011. In 2009, India<br
/> imported just 1,284 tonnes of silver, which then shot up to 3,029 tonnes<br
/> the next year. India&#8217;s 2013 silver imports are similar to those back in<br
/> 2008 when India imported around 5,048.02 tonnes, recent data shows With<br
/> lower prices as compared to gold jewellers restocked on silver to<br
/> ensure cheaper silver jewellery and smaller pieces are available to<br
/> consumers, traders said. &#8220;The price of silver averaged $23.85 an ounce<br
/> in 2013, from $31.17 in 2012, leading to higher demand. In the<br
/> international market, the price of silver has climbed a modest 10% in<br
/> 2014, but in India, the price is further down now,&#8221; said Pradeep<br
/> Rajeshnath, a bullion analyst with a broking house.</p><p>Tyler Durden: &#8220;Many mainland buyers bought lots of properties in<br
/> Hong Kong when the market was red-hot three years ago,&#8221; said Joseph<br
/> Tsang, managing director at Jones Lang LaSalle. &#8220;But now they want to<br
/> cash in as liquidity is quite tight in the mainland.&#8221; Once the Hong Kong<br
/> liquidation frenzy is over, and leaves the city in a state of shock,<br
/> watch as the great Chinese selling horde stampedes from Los Angeles, to<br
/> New York, to London, Zurich and Geneva, and leave not a single 50% off<br
/> sign in its wake. The good news? All those inaccessibly priced houses<br
/> that were solely the stratospheric domain of the ultra-high net worth<br
/> oligarch and criminal jet set, will soon be available to the general<br
/> public. Especially once the global housing bubble pops, which may have<br
/> just happened.</p><p>Zero Hedge: Following the default of 2 more corporations last<br
/> night,Hang Seng&#8217;s index of China Enterprises plunged to 8-month lows and<br
/> officially entered bear market territory. Overnight angst in the<br
/> Chinese currency markets (which saw the Yuan trade back to 1-year lows)<br
/> has sparked broad commodity weakness (as CCFD unwinds en masse) with<br
/> copper giving back most of yesterday&#8217;s major short squeeze gains back.<br
/> Chinese corporate bond prices also tumbled to one-month lows.</p><p>SRSRocco Report: So where is China getting all of its gold? One of<br
/> the large sources turns out to be the United States. The U.S.<br
/> experienced another record year of net gold exports in 2013. Not only<br
/> were gold exports at record levels, imports into the U.S. fell nearly<br
/> half compared to 2010. U.S. gold exports in 2010 were 383 metric tons<br
/> (mt), however by 2013, they increased 81% to 692 mt. In addition, U.S.<br
/> gold imports fell 48% from 604 mt in 2010 to 313 mt in 2013.</p><p>All this and more on&#8230;</p><p>The Harvey Report!</p><p>DayStar</p></div></div><ul

/> default was delayed by Western central planners, but it is coming, despite the West’s frantic efforts to avoid it.  Below is what Maguire had to say in Part I of an incredibly powerful series of interviews that will be released today.</p><p>Maguire:  “The net result of all of this (gold) leasing activity means that the bullion which is still showing on the central banks’ books as an asset has more than one claim on it.  Worse, the bullion banks don’t have the gold to repay them.</p><p>“And as they’ve sold this bullion into the market, and it’s now vaulted outside of the closed loop of the LBMA system, never to return, this is areal problem.</p><p> Now this activity over the years has created a major mismatch.  This has placed these LBMA bullion banks in jeopardy, particularly now that it’s clear they are not getting this touted and relied upon dip into the $1,000 range that they keep trying to talk into existence.  The level ofrigged discount would be the minimum amount needed to even partially bail them out of this ever-growing position mismatch.</p><p> It’s now inevitable that there will be an LBMA bullion bank default &#8212; it’s just been delayed.  And as I’ve noted now for over 18 months, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is no longer providing any real bullion to the bullion banks.  They are just issuing them credit by way of a book entry to sell bullion bank ‘owned’ gold, unallocated gold, on the spot market.  And when deliveries are demanded, they are actually forced to borrow gold from their own unallocated inventories.</p><p> And courtesy of a lack of regulatory oversight, they are able to rehypothecate bullion from their clients allocated accounts.  Even in the unlikely event that gold were driven to the bullion banks’ target of $1,050, the resulting discount would only cause China, Russia, India, and all of these other countries to take all (of the physical gold) that was offered, allowing very little bullion to be repaid.  So that would be a lose/lose situation.</p><p> They (the bullion banks) are not going to allow what happened last year, when a Fed sanctioned raid resulted in a mass exodus of bullion to China.  Either way, discount or not, we are approaching a forced LBMA cash settlement (which they will try to call a ‘non-default’).</p><p> Western central banks are increasingly being forced to compete against each other to look after their own interests now.  It’s become apparent that the BIS and the Fed don’t have the gold they claim to have, despite the paper claims to gold being shown as a physical asset (on their books).  This very act neuters the Fed’s ability to control the gold leasing.</p><p>In short, the bullion banks will be forced to mark paper gold positions to market, creating a (massive) gap up in the gold price as true supply/demand fundamentals are finally realized.”</p></div></div></li></ul></li><li

Then the $60/oz fall this week and now confirmation that Chinese demand declined rather significantly, presumably including savvy profit-taking contributing to falling premiums. My guess is savvy Chinese demand picked up again during last week&#8217;s drop.  Will the cobasis foretell it?</p></div></div><ul

/> Better to quote Weiner directly, which accompanies your chart:</p><p><i>&#8220;The cobasis dropped like a base metal brick! Here we are in the middle of March, and the April contract is already under heavy selling pressure a few weeks before first notice day. And despite this, the buying pressure on the April contract was great enough to push the cobasis down to -0.40%. And the basis peaked up above zero—contango!—for the first time since November.&#8221;</i></p><p>Going back through Weiner’s reports the cobasis has fallen from +0.35 in early January when supply was tight to -0.35 by mid March as gold became more available/abundant with a $200 higher price.  Then Chinese demand appears to have pulled back in the very short term, resulting in this significant price drop/correction.</p><p><a

If you&#8217;re a &#8216;blogger&#8217; who also happens to have, or be part of, the highly competitive &#8216;financial services industry&#8217; in any capacity that involves selling products other than gold investments, talking about gold can be ~very~ bad for business&#8230;   Which leads right into:</p><p>#2. Talking about &#8216;gold&#8217; has become akin to being tarred with the &#8216;Conspiracy theorist&#8217; brush.   I.e., it&#8217;s the &#8217;3rd rail&#8217; of any &#8216;above board&#8217; discussion about economics or monetary policy in general.   The &#8216;conspiracy theory&#8217; attack is a highly effective one &#8211; similar to the use of class warfare/envy as a weapon or wedge to divide and finally, marginalize.   After years and years of undeniable proof, they are still highly effective weapons, because people would rather be told what to think, rather than think for themselves, and they don&#8217;t want to experience something else, which segue&#8217;s beautifully into:</p><p>#3. Fear.   Gold today is Fear personified.   It shouldn&#8217;t be.   In a sane, upright economic/monetary world, Gold should be Embraced&#8230;!   Alas, we live in anything but an upright economic/monetary sphere.   The ramifications of what gold today stands for and reveals are simply too much for the average person stuck in a Twilight Zone episode of complacency-bias, to wrap their head around.   Therefore, ignorance is bliss, and the market will always sort it out.   Perhaps so&#8230;?   Given that we have never been down the road of fiscal/monetary excess, political chicanery and outright $$$Fraud that we are experiencing today, my guess is that the outcome of the past 30 years &#8211; or even since August of 1971, may prove to be just ~slightly~ different this time.</p></div></div><ul

You’ll notice that to the left of the firm name, there is a “C” or an “H.”  This represents “Customer” or “House” accounts.   However, House account trades can be related to customer activity also, via swaps and other structured trades.   We’ll come back to that in a moment.</p><p>The warehouse inventory report shows each depository’s inventory of registered metal and eligible metal.  It looks like this: <a
href="http://kiddynamitesworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/comex_warehouse.png" rel="nofollow">http://kiddynamitesworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/comex_warehouse.png</a><br
/> .</p><p><b>The COMEX rulebook</b> explains the difference between registered and eligible metal:</p><p>“Eligible” shall mean, with respect to any metal, that such metal is acceptable for delivery against the applicable metal futures contract for which a Warrant has not been issued”</p><p>“Registered” shall mean an Eligible metal for which a Warrant has been issued.</p><p>“Warrant”shall mean a document of title issued by a Licensed Facility, meeting the requirements of Article 7 of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”), and demonstrating that the referenced quantity of the covered metal , stored in the Licensed Facility referenced thereon, meets the<br
/> specifications of the  applicable metal futures contract”</p><p>Are you with me so far?  OK – now here’s where Harvey Organ just starts making stuff up:  he looks at the total delivery notices issued by JP Morgan’s House (H) and Customer (C) accounts,<br
/> and tries to compare them to the warehouse inventories of eligible and registered metal.   This is an apples to oranges comparison which is invalid, and it’s why Harvey gets the wrong conclusion.   Harvey thinks that eligible metal is “customer” metal and registered metal is “house” metal.    This is false.   This is not debatable – it’s wrong.   All deliveries are made with warrants for registered metal.  Customer (C) deliveries are not made from eligible metal.</p><p>However, in the delivery process, the metal need not move.   Let me explain:  the delivery process consists of the issuer (short) delivering a valid warrant to the stopper (long).   That’s it.<br
/> It doesn’t mean that the short drops metal off at the long’s door.   It means that short gives the long a warrant which is valid title to the underlying contract metal.</p><p>Now,after the long takes delivery, the long can do whatever he wants to with the warrant.  He may</p><p>1) detach the warrant (converting the metal from registered to eligible), he may</p><p>2) take the metal out, bring it home, and bury it in his backyard, or he may</p><p>3) simply hold it as is and sell his warrant next month.</p><p>What will we see in the depository inventory spreadsheet in each of those scenarios?</p><p>1) registered metal decreases while eligible metal increases.</p><p>2) registered metal decreases.</p><p> 3) no change in either category.</p><p>If you want to read an example of Harvey’s misunderstanding in his own words, you can read this old post of his (which happens to be a good one, since a commenter – Fred – on Harvey’s own post explained the reality of the process to Harvey yet again, and Harvey refused to acknowledge reality).   Or, if you like, you can read Harvey’s blog for any day since that June 3rd post I just linked to.  He repeats the same bad analysis *daily*.</p><p>So what happened is Harvey Organ made up his own reality and came up with false conclusions.   That’s nothing new in precious metals-land: it happens all the time.   But what’s great about this nonsensical fantasy is that it exposes many *other* metals prognosticators who clearly do not understand what they are talking about.   We know that they don’t understand what they’re talking about because they regurgitate Harvey’s falsehoods without correcting them.</p><p>This post arose because I, as a result of my “inability to withstand gross ignorance” compulsion, tried to explain the situation to Bill Holter of Miles Franklin, who sells precious metals for a living.<br
/> <b>Since the guy sells precious metals for a living, one might expect him not to spout falsehoods in an effort to further those sales</b>, which is why I explained it to him.   One would, of course, be mistaken.</p><p>Our conversation, in the comments of Holter’s own blog with moderated comments, went like this:</p><p>Holter wrote:</p><p><i>“P.S.  I will give it one more day to see if JP Morgan delivers from both their dealer inventory and from the customer side.  They are contracted to deliver roughly 100,000 ounces more gold IN JUNE than they had in their inventories as of Friday afternoon.  As I see it,they need to completely empty their inventory AND deliver another 100,000 ounces to honor contracts.  It is still not even clear that delivery was made on the 1,000 call options from May.  This is a very big deal if you believe in contract law, if not…oh well, there’s always Dancing with the Stars or the America’s Got Talent to watch.”</i></p><p>I commented:</p><p><i>“Mr. Holter –</p><p>the postscript of this post makes it quite clear that you have absolutely no understanding of how the COMEX delivery process works. I would suggest that you seek out sources other than Harvey Organ to explain it to you.</p><p>If you don’t wish to seek out the facts/reality, I beg you to stop misinforming your readers with charlatan nonsense.</p><p>warmest regards,</p><p>KD”</i></p><p>Holter replied with simple regurgitations of Harvey Organ’s inaccuracies, in typical metals-charlatan fashion:</p><p><i>“vault inventory has moved very little in the last month, nothing has entered the dealer side and 217,000 ounces exited the customer side. They have issued almost 6,000 contracts or about 600,000 ounces of Gold for June delivery…where is it? Did it move? Was it delivered? How was it accounted for? Did “settle” in cash…that would be illegal. Or did it settle in GLD shares?”</i></p><p>I explained it politely:</p><p><i>“Bill –</p><p>there is no “Dealer” side or “customer” side. Again – if you “learn” about the COMEX from Harvey Organ, everything you know will be inaccurate.</p><p>there is “registered” metal and “eligible” metal.</p><p>and there is no reason why the numbers in the COMEX warehouse inventory spreadsheet need to change when deliveries are made – that is NOT what COMEX deliveries mean. Several people have tried to explain this to Harvey Organ in the past. This is my first and last effort to try to explain it to you. You can re-quote nonsense from Harvey all you want – it will not get any less false.</p><p>so to answer your questions:</p><p>the 6000 delivery notices issued from June: yes, they were settled. what happens is that the warehouse receipt is given (From the short, the“issuer”) to the new owner (the long – the “stopper”). No metal moves in this transaction. It’s like a coat check – the claim tag has been given from one party to another. IF and only if the new owner decides tomove or reclassify the metal, you will see the warehouse inventories change.</p><p>.</p><p>No, it did not “Settle in cash” or “in GLD shares”.<br
/> .</p><p>I suggest you familiarize yourself with what an EFP (Exchange for Physical) is, and with the concept that JP Morgan and their customers can hold metal at other COMEX vaults (don’t forget: JPM’s vault didn’t even exist until a few years ago, yet they still traded on the COMEX before then, right?). Then you’ll understand how these delivery notices are issued month after month.”<br
/> </i></p><p>Bill Holter replied again with another misconception, which I again politely corrected, but he refused to publish my comment.   I would have hoped that Holter had understood my very simple explanations,but he continues to spout this nonsense in subsequent posts:</p><p><i>“Unless someone can show me where JP Morgan has concluded their May deliveries or delivered anything at all on their June deliveries I will assume that I have read their reports correctly and are in serious arrears.  Please, send me data that illustrates the movement of gold<br
/> from JP Morgan to those contractually entitled to receive it.”</i></p><p>The question is: <b>is Bill Holter misinforming you out of ignorance?  or out of malice?   And which is worse?</b> I’ll leave that to you to debate… let’s move on, since Holter is not the only one exposing himself by re-quoting Harvey Organ’s ignorance.</p><p>Let’s look at who else clearly doesn’t understand what they are talking about:</p><p><b>Turd Ferguson</b> – in a post today – demonstrates that he doesn’t understand the process, but rather is a Harvey Organ regurgitator.</p><p><b>Jim Willie</b> – via Turd Ferguson’s comments – is in the same boat.</p><p><b>Russ Winter</b> – does not understand the COMEX markets – note that Russ also refused to acknowledge reality when a commenter (Kohala Kid, who is not me) tried to explain it to him clearly.</p><p>Even your favorite – <b>Zerohedge</b> – alludes to this false meme: “For over a month, JPMorgan  managed to mysteriously avoid matching up the gold held in its (world’s largest) vault with the Comex delivery notice update.”  (KD: no – no they have not…)</p><p>Of course, we already know that Jesse of <b>Jesse’s Cafe is a charlatan</b>, as is Dave In Denver. (My note &#8211; <b>GATA is another, Max Keiser another, as are ALL of the KWN talking heads</b>) There are a plethora of others – this post is giving you the tools to recognize nonsense when you see it.   ANYONE who is repeating Harvey Organ’s false analysis and conclusions lacks an understanding of the COMEX metals markets.</p><p>I’m sure that someone will falsely accuse me of ad-hominem attacks onthese poor misinformed bloggers.  Nothing could be further from the truth:  these bloggers are DEMONSTRATING (and I am explaining…) a gross lack of understanding of the markets they are purporting to be able to<br
/> explain to you.   This is a gift to you, dear reader, as you can clearly see that they do not know what they are talking about.   Again, the Sophie’s Choice lose-lose question you have to ask yourself is:</p><p><b>Are they misinforming their readers out of ignorance?  Or out of malice?</b></p><p>And oh by the way – despite the fact that the analysis of JP Morgan’svault inventories with respect to delivery receipts is blatantly inaccurate, JP Morgan’s gold inventories at the COMEX are indeed decreasing.  Is this a sign of impending doom for the bullion banks?   I will point out a few *facts* for you:</p><p>1) JP Morgan’s depository accounts for only 6 percent of the COMEX stocks.</p><p>2) JP Morgan opened their COMEX depository a few years ago (in 2010 Ithink)… Do you think that they didn’t trade gold on the COMEX before they had their own depository?  Do you think that only firms with their own depository can trade gold?</p><p>Perhaps JP Morgan is winding down their vault/warehousing business?   Perhaps related to this recent story?</p><p>This post would be incomplete if I didn’t explain the title.   I was listening to the Digital Underground classic “Freaks of the Industry” this weekend, and a line resonated with me:</p><p><i>“Now if there’s a cure for this, We don’t want it, we’ll run from it.”</i></p><p>The precious metals charlatans, as evidenced by the comment thread discussions I pointed to above on their own posts (mine with Holter, Fred’s with Harvey Organ, and KohalaKid’s with Russ Winter) don’t WANT to know the truth – they just want to spread a story like financial herpes… There’s a cure for their gross ignorance, but they don’t want it – they run from it.</p><p>and so it goes…</p><p>In closing, I’d like to quote myself:</p><p><i>“I will simply repeat this fact:  when your theses are based in false foundations, you can only be “correct” out of dumb luck.   One shouldn’t be surprised when the predictions made by charlatans who rely on nonsense themselves turn out to be nonsense.”</i></p><p><b>Facts: The Enemy of the Precious Metals Blogger</b></p><p>Precious Metals Charlatans Are Going To Destroy Your Net Worth</p><p>-KD <a

The current discount in Shanghai gold<br
/> is down primarily due to a weak Dollar/CNY (yuan) cross.  The differencebetween a 6.07 exchange rate (6.07 yuan for 1 U.S. dollar), which we saw in January, vs. the 6.228 exchange rate we saw today as Shanghai closed, makes a $30 an ounce difference (in terms of the gold price).</p><p> So instead of a $3.80 discount that we saw this morning, it would effectively have been, from a Chinese perspective, close to a $30 premium (for gold).  That’s bullish.  The Chinese retail buyer couldn’t care less what the dollar price of gold is.  And as far as the PBOC (People’s Bank of China), with a 500 year view on gold, and not a one minute bar (chart) view, they (simply) want to unload their dollars without disrupting the markets.  How fast they can exchange their dollars for gold is really the only question.”</b></p><p>Now, I know a true professional when I see one, and this guy takes the ticket &#8211; not for analysis of the Gold market (about which he clearly knows fuck all), but for total bullshit spouted in a supercilious and pontificating manner. Quite how the current exchange rate is not really the current exchange rate baffles me &#8211; but maybe that was the intention all along</p><p>You already know the source of this nonsense, surely you do, but here it is anyhow &#8211; <a

/> good points but I got about half way through his last book and had to stop reading.</p><p>I don’t see the second coming all the way off to 2033. Also, IMO, The time of Jacob’s trouble is synonymous with the 70th week of Daniel, and it is 7 years in length.</p><p>I also posted on the 322 date and the King of Babylon’s visit to Israel last March in 2013, he arrived on Palm Sunday, riding a donkey (The democratic party) and was rumored that he would be visiting the Temple Mount, but never went there.</p><p>That IMO, that could not have been the abomination of desolations for he did not ascend up onto Mt Zion, enter a tabernacle or temple and proclaim himself god. I’m sure he would have liked to, but it did not happen, not yet.</p><p>I have long believed that the rapture (translation) could/most likely will occur on some future Rosh Hashanah, be it 2014-15-16 or 2017. It is the next feast day in the sequence and the first four have been fulfilled already.</p><p>My problem with Skiba is he doesn’t yet doesn’t know who America is, and for the life of me, I can’t understand why, he has been sent the scriptural and proof text showing who we are, yet still thinks ‘Iraq’ is the Final Babylon of the last days. He see Iraq coming back to be the major world power, the old city of Babylon being rebuilt, and the Iraqi Dinar becoming the dominant world currency</p><p>Like I have said, <b>if a teacher or Biblical ‘scholar’ cannot yet see America in scripture, I think they are irrelevant to any real discussion on what we see unfolding.</b> [<b>N.B.</b> There certainly were Americans around in the Holy Land during the time of the Gospel - including Mel Gibson and entire film crews shhooting "Passion of the Christ" in Aramaic and Hebrew although Mel Gibson is Australian, of course]</p><p>The reason I see the next few years being key is for the following reasons.</p><p>In Matthew 24, Luke 21 and Mark 13 Jesus gave us the parable of the fig tree, It is the only parable he told us to learn and Jesus himself tied the last generation or the final generation to those that saw the rebirth of fig tree  and, The Fig Tree is the Nation of Israel. She became a sovereign nation again on May 14th, 1948.</p><p> <i>Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:  So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors. Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.  Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.</i> Matthew 24:32-35</p><p><a

The window it you add 67.5 and 70 would give you a time frame of 2015.5 to 2018, give or take.</p><p>I also see a lot of other cycle’s culminating around the 2017-2018 time period as well.</p><p>- In 1897 was the First Zionist Congress.

id="dsq-comment-message-2181" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Excerpt: (China News) “A very important condition for the internationalization of the renminbi is to increase Chinese gold reserves”</p><p>This is all for the sake of a ‘different’ brand of Plantation Scrip to steal our Labor with? I guess it really is time for a Grass Roots Monetary Revolt! Spartacus Movement anyone?</p><p>Over the past year or so I’d harbored the (whimsically hopeful?) speculation that China could be assembling wherewithal to spearhead re-establishment of the historically stable and honest poly-metallic monetary scheme, observing they’ve already been stockpiling huge quantities of gold and copper; now recently begun to further also show increasing interest in silver. Why not? Knowing their history, the signs seem apparent enough. It would simply be a re-run of their 1450s<br
/> salvation from the economic devastation wrought by ‘flying money’ of that time … an already proven path back to stability.</p><p>The dichotomy then arose in discussion during these recent months, as to the blatantly un-natural extensive phenomenon of strength in ‘valuing’ paper issues (particularly the American brand) above these metals, despite immense combined Indian and Chinese demand for them in<br
/> stated deference to scrip. Most folks attribute this to Exchange Stabilization Fund effort in combination with central banks; respectively shorting futures and disgorging bullion while buying the ESF’s naked sales contracts, thus pushing credit note ‘value’ up in relation to paper gold claims. A ‘numbers racket’, having no correlation with real-world circumstances.</p><p>Then, in the past week, Koos Jansen picks up on the Goldman-Sacks story purporting that Chinese entities are active in the paper shorting scam to facilitate ‘shadow banking’ finance ponzis, hypothecating copper and probably gold to pyramid huge amounts of currency borrowing,<br
/> leading me to wonder if the Chinese government is not after all, seeking to ‘take the high road’ on sustainable monetary reform, but instead, surreptitiously removing these metals from world<br
/> circulation to bolster the force by which all governments can continue propagating their allied global banknote scheme.</p><p>Regardless, whether the Chinese are doing this selfishly, to propel renminbi-yuan into ‘reserve status’ in contention against the American banknote, or working under secret collusion with other governments … only acting out faked enmity so the world’s gullible ‘masses’ won’t suspect the ultimate goal … the end result is to preserve the damnable banknote scheme’s theft of Labor from the entire Earth’s Peoples, while their standards of living slowly descend into inextricable Feudalist penury.</p><p>For over six hundred years, we’ve had repeatedly demonstrated to us that circulation of credit utterly destroys economies by ever-expanding corruption of accurate price (rational value-worth) discovery, until credit and debt becomes so thoroughly disjointed from naturally pervasive fundamental economic process that the credit has no other course but to implode … destroying a huge percentage of people’s misguided ‘savings’ in that credit. Once again proving history’s<br
/> empirical lesson, that government is the very worst enemy of The Peoples of all countries, throughout all time.</p></div></div></li></ul></div></div><script type="text/javascript">
