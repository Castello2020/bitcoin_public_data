class="post-content"><h1 title="New Physical Gold Exchange In Singapore">New Physical Gold Exchange In Singapore</h1><p>I was tipped of by one of my readers on a new gold exchange operating in Singapore; Allocated Bullion Solutions Singapore. After taking a look on their <a
href="http://allocatedbullion.sg/en">website</a> I asked their public relations desk for the details of their business. Websites can be incomplete and I wanted to be sure on what kind of exchange it was. They kindly responded whereupon a comprehensive Q&amp;A followed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p

/> There is no way this business fits the definition of an exchange, in that it does not allow direct client to client trading (see answer to you question where they say they are a &#8220;broker&#8221;).<br
/> I don&#8217;t think one has to be regulated to be an exchange. In that respect I think the only true non mainstream, non formally regulated precious metal exchange is Bullion Vault.</p></div></div><ul

/> farther than an Interfax update blasted moments ago by Bloomberg:<br
/> &#8220;Gazprom Considers &#8216;Symbolic&#8217; Yuan Bond Issue, Interfax Says.&#8221; Bloomberg<br
/> adds that the gas giant is considering proposals from potential<br
/> organizers to market bonds in yuan, Interfax reports, citing people with<br
/> knowledge of the matter. Gazprom unlikely be able to gain more than<br
/> $300m due to market volume, Newswire reports. There are no mandates or<br
/> deal timelines yet. The bond issue may add new investors and become a<br
/> “topical” public relations act amid tensions with the U.S. and the EU.<br
/> Well, yes. It&#8217;s called &#8220;symbolic&#8221; for a reason. More importantly, it is a<br
/> symbol of what happens when one can &#8220;create&#8221; money de novo without the<br
/> presence of the world&#8217;s increasingly defunct reserve currency, either<br
/> secured by gas or by future cash flows, i.e., unsecured.</p><p>Zero Hedge: In a victory for banks, global financial regulators<br
/> backed away from earlier guidelines that the firms had warned would<br
/> destabilize the $693 trillion derivatives market. The Basel Committee on<br
/> Banking Supervision’s final rule, released today, will require banks<br
/> that broker swaps trades to set aside much less money to protect against<br
/> a default versus a proposal published last year. The plan now applies a<br
/> minimum 20 percent risk weighting to money deposited at clearinghouses,<br
/> which are third-party guarantors that back the transactions, down from<br
/> 1,250 percent in the original proposal. The change takes effect on Jan.<br
/> 1, 2017.</p><p>James Rickards (jimrickards): James Rickards, author of the new book,<br
/> &#8220;The Death of Money,&#8221; foresees big inflation because the U.S. dollar&#8217;s<br
/> buying power will shrink. Rickards predicts, &#8220;Imagine gas at $20 a<br
/> gallon and bread at $10. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re talking about.&#8221; So, if big<br
/> inflation is coming, what about gold? Rickards says, &#8220;When I say the<br
/> price of gold is going to $7,000 or $9,000 per ounce, which I expect it<br
/> will, what I am really saying is the dollar is going to collapse 80% or<br
/> 90% or more.&#8221; It did in the 1970&#8242;s. None of this is unprecedented. It<br
/> all happened before.&#8221; Rickards says, &#8220;When a collapse happens it will<br
/> happen quickly. You won&#8217;t see it coming. There won&#8217;t be time to run out<br
/> and buy gold, and it probably will not even be available at that stage.<br
/> You need to prepare now.&#8221;</p><p>Michael Snyder (The Economic Collapse) &#8211; Part 3 of 6. Signs that most<br
/> Americans are completely unprepared for the coming economic collapse:<br
/> #3 Another study found that less than one out of every four Americans<br
/> has enough money stored away to cover six months of expenses. #4 Some<br
/> people are actually trying really hard to get ahead, but admittedly that<br
/> is really tough to do when we are all being taxed into oblivion. In<br
/> fact, it was reported this week that Americans now spend more on taxes<br
/> than they spend on food, clothing and housing combined.</p><p>****************</p><p>Harvey&#8217;s comments on Thursday price action (basis 1:30 PM EST)</p><p>Quote:</p><p>Gold closed up $14.60 at $1320.10 (Comex to Comex closing time).</p><p>Silver was up 28 cents to $20.08.</p><p>In the access market tonight at 5:15 PM:</p><p>Gold: $1319.00</p><p>Silver: $20.05</p><p>Wednesday, Apr 9th Gold and Silver Action (basis 1:30 PM EST)</p><p><a

id="dsq-comment-message-2421" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This is DayStar (DS) with the Thursday Harvey Report.</p><p>News and Commentary</p><p>Jim Willie (via SilverDoctors): A global clash of nations is in full<br
/> gear. The time is finally right. The urgency is acute. The banking<br
/> system insolvency is widespread. The illiquidity has reached the<br
/> surface. The geopolitical chessboard has busy movements of many pieces,<br
/> even with a delayed check in Ukraine after a devious capture of the<br
/> Cyprus castle but not the Syrian knight. The Saudi support via OPEC for<br
/> the Petro-Dollar has fallen out of view, dragging its pummeled chin on<br
/> the desert sands. The Eastern superpowers are marching arm in arm, ready<br
/> to challenge the West. It seems the Western leaders, in particular the<br
/> robot sock puppets of the Untied States, see the end of the USDollar.<br
/> They appear to wish to lay blame on Russia for the death of the dollar.<br
/> The global rejection began with the Iran sanction workarounds, where<br
/> India bought Iran’s oil &amp; gas, but paid with Turkish gold, delivered<br
/> to Tehran banks. The global rejection will achieve escape velocity with<br
/> the acceptance of Russian Rubles for its energy products. The global<br
/> rejection will achieve additional escape velocity with the acceptance of<br
/> Chinese Yuan payments for Saudi crude oil (then all OPEC oil). Coming<br
/> is the launch of both the gold-backed Russian Ruble and the gold-backed<br
/> Chinese Yuan. The global rejection will be final, and the funeral will<br
/> be announced.</p><p>Harvey: Gold and silver advanced today but still they were held in<br
/> check by our banker friends. The world is beginning to understand that<br
/> the Fed has no clue as to how they can get growth out of the USA<br
/> economy. This is putting a torch under gold as the stupid bankers<br
/> believe that more monetary stimulus is underway. You will note from<br
/> China, even though they are having massive problems, the Chinese<br
/> leadership will not engage in added stimulus. In other news, the big<br
/> news Gazprom will price a new bond issue in yuan. This is not very good<br
/> news for the USA dollar. Also tensions are escalating to a very high<br
/> pitch in Eastern Ukraine. The front one month GOFO&#8217;s rates went into<br
/> backwardation with a negative GOFO. However the rates are so low in all<br
/> months, as it is still signaling a lack of London good delivery bars<br
/> that the criminal bankers use to attack gold. GLD: Gold lost 0.26 tonnes<br
/> today and stands at 806.22 tonnes. SLV: Silver was unchanged and stands<br
/> at 10,228.97.</p><p>SRSrocco (srsroccoreport): Something interesting took place at the<br
/> Comex and Shanghai silver warehouses over the past month. Silver stocks<br
/> at both these warehouses peaked at about the same time, March 10th.<br
/> However, for the past month, a substantial amount of silver was removed<br
/> from both warehouses. Total silver inventories at the Comex grew from<br
/> 160 million ounces in September of 2013, to 183.3 million ounces on<br
/> March 11th. This was a 23 million oz build in seven months. In just one<br
/> month after the Comex inventories peaked (March 11th), 6.1 million oz of<br
/> silver were withdrawn. This is the largest one month decline in over a<br
/> year. Now, if we look Shanghai Silver Stocks, we see the same trend.<br
/> During the same time period the Comex saw its inventories decline 6.1<br
/> million oz, the Shanghai silver stocks declined from 566 metric tons<br
/> (March 10th) to 373 metric tons today. Thus, there was a net withdrawal<br
/> of 193 metric tons of silver from the Shanghai inventories. We have 6+<br
/> million oz withdrawals from both warehouses at the same time period. It<br
/> will be interesting to see how events in the world unfold in 2014 as<br
/> Russia and China develop their financial markets around the U.S. Dollar.<br
/> I imagine silver at $20 an ounce will seem like a steal a few years<br
/> down the road.</p></div></div><ul

id="dsq-comment-message-2422" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Investment Research Dynamics: It is becoming increasingly clear – at<br
/> least to me – that the U.S. economy is now a walking corpse. The housing<br
/> market is about to go into free-fall like it did starting 2006. How do I<br
/> know this? Because of the exhaustive analysis I’ve been doing on the<br
/> housing market data and because the homebuilder stocks are now diverging<br
/> significantly to the downside from the rest of the stock market. The<br
/> homebuilder stocks behaved this way starting in mid-2005, about 6 months<br
/> before housing market reflected the deteriorating fundamentals of the<br
/> housing market back then. The homebuilder stocks similarly peaked in May<br
/> 2013. There is a big “accident” in motion for which impact could occur<br
/> at any time. The stock market action from Friday thru Tuesday is an<br
/> obvious signal. The quick reversal from its recent dead-cat bounce is<br
/> another. The dollar is in big trouble and the Fed is trying desperately<br
/> to fight that by suppressing the metals. When that fails, I bet we’ll<br
/> see an escalation in military operations.</p><p>SHTFplan: Word on the street from sources close to the militia<br
/> movement is that up to 5,000 armed militia members will be arriving in<br
/> Bunkerville, Nevada sometime today. SHTFplan.com Editor’s Note: It is<br
/> apparent that the Federal government was under the impression that they<br
/> could simply move into the ranch land surrounding Bunkerville, NV and<br
/> have their way with the property and livelihood of the Bundy family.<br
/> What they didn’t count on was the outcry from Americans across the<br
/> country. And now things may be headed to the next level. As Kim Paxton<br
/> of The Daily Sheeple notes, citizen militias in several states have been<br
/> called up. Many members of those organizations are taking up arms and<br
/> are making their way to Nevada. And it’s not just the citizen militias<br
/> that are preparing to take action. The governor of Nevada has officially<br
/> condemned the federal government’s actions, though he has yet to take<br
/> any steps afforded to him under State law. Sheriff Richard Mack of<br
/> Gilbert, Arizona has weighed in and calls the actions “terrorism.” At<br
/> last count there were some 200 federal agents from various agencies on<br
/> the ground in Nevada and it appears that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of<br
/> armed militia members will soon arrive to confront them. The Federal<br
/> government will no doubt step up their efforts, as they are facing the<br
/> possibility of a widespread rebellion resulting from their actions<br
/> against a private citizen whose only “crime” was to graze his cattle on<br
/> the land his family has used for this purpose for over a century. It<br
/> would not be at all surprising to see the President of the United States<br
/> call up National Guard troops and more militarized law enforcement<br
/> officials for fear of having this spiral out of control. A declaration<br
/> of martial law to go along with already established First Amendment<br
/> Areas is not out of the question. We may well be on the cusp of a<br
/> serious stand-off involving thousands of people. Keep in mind that most<br
/> of them will be armed. Given the circumstances, things could turn very<br
/> bloody very quickly.</p><p>Silver Doctors: Former Assistant Treasury Secretary, Dr. Paul Craig<br
/> Roberts says, “Gold and the dollar are in a fight to the death.” Dr.<br
/> Roberts explains, “The Fed, in order to save a handful of banks too big<br
/> to fail that are the mindless deregulation of the 21st century, the Fed<br
/> has had to create a tremendous number of new dollars. Despite the fact<br
/> the price of gold has been pushed down since 2011, it still has about<br
/> the highest rate of return of just about anything in the 21st century.<br
/> The Federal Reserve, in order to protect quantitative easing, which is<br
/> necessary to save the banks, began manipulating the gold price in a new<br
/> and more intense way. They used their bullion banks to short the gold in<br
/> the Comex futures market. The trouble with this policy is that it’s<br
/> been going on long enough that it’s being recognized by people who<br
/> formerly thought ‘the Federal Reserve would never do anything like<br
/> that.’ Of course they would and people are catching on.” Dr. Roberts<br
/> goes on to say, “This is why the Federal Reserve is so irresponsible.”<br
/> So are the Fed and Obama Administration trying to crash the dollar on<br
/> purpose? Dr. Roberts says, “No, they are just stupid and arrogant. . . .<br
/> If you add up the IQ of the White House and you add up the IQ of the<br
/> Fed and multiply it by a thousand trillion it might equal 50. These are<br
/> stupid policies designed to completely destroy the U.S. dollar. . . . I<br
/> don’t think the United States can win the war against gold.” DS: Dr.<br
/> Roberts says O is irresponsible and stupid and backs it up by<br
/> hyperbole. If frustration is the basis for saying the administration is<br
/> stupid, when clearly their campaign and MOPE is not, and their<br
/> operations to destroy the dollar are right out of Saul Alinsky&#8217;s Rules<br
/> for Radicals (&#8220;There is only one way to kill capitalism &#8211; by taxes,<br
/> taxes, and more taxes&#8221; &#8211; Karl Marx), I would say crashing the dollar is<br
/> more likely purposeful rather than due to stupidity.</p><p>Lawrence Williams (Mineweb): Silver investors will have been a little<br
/> disappointed by the metal’s performance vis-a-vis the gold price<br
/> following the latter’s gains after the release of the latest U.S. FOMC<br
/> meeting minutes. The minutes suggested that the low interest rate regime<br
/> may well continue longer than expected and resulted in a major boost to<br
/> the stock market and a significant uptick in the gold price. But it had<br
/> rather less impact on silver which initially remained stuck below the<br
/> $20 mark, although this morning’s trade has at last see it move up above<br
/> this mark. Perhaps European investors are less pessimistic about<br
/> silver’s investment credentials. Now silver usually moves with gold, but<br
/> in a more exaggerated manner so the silver investors could have been<br
/> forgiven for expecting that the near 2% rise in the gold price since<br
/> Tuesday would be accompanied by an even greater rise in silver in<br
/> percentage terms. This may yet happen should the gold price continue its<br
/> latest mini-surge, but silver has been more volatile and indeed the<br
/> price actually fell back sharply on some adverse comment in the U.S.<br
/> before recovering quite well in this morning’s trade… But over the same 3<br
/> day period that gold rose the 2% mentioned above the silver price was,<br
/> in effect, following a very sharp temporary dip yesterday. The prospects<br
/> for silver to perform better than gold remain strong. However it should<br
/> be borne in mind too that silver is a very small market in the overall<br
/> scheme of things and thus perhaps more subject to potential market<br
/> manipulation than for any other major traded metal we know as it does<br
/> not take a lot of money to move the market up or down. This will<br
/> continue to make investment in silver probably more risky than in gold –<br
/> it’s not known amongst traders as the Devil’s metal for nothing.</p><p>DS: There is a great deal of dark gold that has been<br
/> sequestered in hidden hoards (e.g. the Knight&#8217;s Templar gold, Solomon&#8217;s<br
/> treasure, Golden Lily, etc.) for millennia, and a lot of it briefly<br
/> came to light during WWII. Some of this dark gold is probably being bled<br
/> into the system to support the present gold market. Unfortunately for<br
/> the elites, no such stashes exist for silver, as vast quantities of<br
/> silver have been consumed in industrial processes, and that silver is<br
/> unrecoverable at today&#8217;s prices. We also note that even though silver is<br
/> a much smaller Comex market than gold, retail sales of silver are<br
/> greater dollar wise than gold. The claim that silver is just an<br
/> industrial metal because central banks don&#8217;t hoard it or don&#8217;t use it in<br
/> monetary transaction is just a claim. Silver was used as a currency as<br
/> late at the 20th century, and it probably still would be if the elites<br
/> had not forced it out of circulation so they could steal the wealth of<br
/> the world through a pure fiat system. Silver is hoarded as a monetary<br
/> metal the world over by the same people that value gold as a store of<br
/> wealth. The idea that silver is a primarily an industrial metal is pure<br
/> MOPE. The facts speak for themselves, and the facts say people value<br
/> silver as a store of wealth. On a different note, I had a thought today<br
/> regarding the Chinese and their gold accumulation. China is clearly<br
/> accumulating vast quantities of western gold while the West watches it<br
/> disappear into Chinese vaults. I recently read an article about the<br
/> Nationalist Chinese exporting their gold to the Fed before Mao Tse Tung<br
/> and the Japanese could get it. Rumors of tens of thousands of tonnes of<br
/> dark gold being shipped to the West in exchange for enormous amounts of<br
/> US Treasury bonds and western repatriation of Yamato&#8217;s Treasure of<br
/> looted eastern gold have floated around the web for decades. What if<br
/> these rumors are more fact than fiction? Would not China wish to have<br
/> the gold returned that was stolen from them? What if the replacement of<br
/> this vast quantity of lost dark gold with economically visible gold was<br
/> the price for China not crashing the fiat system? The flow of gold to<br
/> China may in fact be a form of repayment for this lost gold.</p><p>Hubert Moolman (HubertMoolman): We are about to see the end of our<br
/> current international monetary system. Based on the evidence, this<br
/> appears to be a certainty. The systematic build-up of this current<br
/> monetary order went together with the gradual phasing out of silver from<br
/> the monetary order. The rise of silver and the collapse of the monetary<br
/> system is inescapably linked. Therefore, if the collapse of the<br
/> monetary system is not orderly, then the rise of silver’s value will not<br
/> likely be orderly. Collapse by definition suggests: to break or fall<br
/> suddenly. This would suggest that when the time comes, silver will<br
/> explode higher suddenly; for example, it could be possible that it rises<br
/> $10, $20, $100 a day, until you can suddenly not buy it with fiat<br
/> money. Interestingly, that actually means that silver and gold will<br
/> reach the same price in fiat currency. So, if you are buying physical<br
/> silver to hedge against the collapse of the monetary system, you are not<br
/> buying it, and looking for the price to rise to about $30 at the end of<br
/> this year. No, you are expecting a sudden explosion of price, you just<br
/> do not know exactly when. The approach of the silver “stackers” is<br
/> therefore, the best approach, given that a monetary collapse is<br
/> inevitable. The rise of silver and the collapse of the monetary system<br
/> is inescapably linked. Therefore, if the collapse of the monetary system<br
/> is not orderly, then the rise of silver’s value will not likely be<br
/> orderly. Collapse by definition suggests: to break or fall suddenly.<br
/> This would suggest that when the time comes, silver will explode higher<br
/> suddenly; for example, it could be possible that it rises $10, $20, $100<br
/> a day, until you can suddenly not buy it with fiat money.<br
/> Interestingly, that actually means that silver and gold will reach the<br
/> same price in fiat currency. There are more indicators that support the<br
/> likelihood of a sudden and massive spike in silver due to collapse of<br
/> the monetary system.</p><p>Jay Taylor (via The Gold Report): I don&#8217;t know about QE lasting<br
/> forever, because nothing lasts forever, but the premise is largely<br
/> correct, because the discontinuation of quantitative easing would be so<br
/> painful it&#8217;s a pretty good assumption that it will continue for a long<br
/> time to come. It will probably end only when the system breaks down,<br
/> which is inevitable because it is becoming increasingly insolvent. The<br
/> private sector too is dependent on the narcotic of easy money. As I say,<br
/> QE and ZIRP won&#8217;t end until the system breaks down and forces the<br
/> creation of a different monetary regime. What we call &#8220;the economy&#8221; is<br
/> really more of a casino. The money that is created isn&#8217;t getting into<br
/> the real economy. The Wall Street guys with the Ph.Ds in mathematics<br
/> have built pick-pocketing machines that misallocate capital into their<br
/> wallets, into endlessly bigger government and further military action on<br
/> the part of the United States. It&#8217;s going to end very badly. All we can<br
/> do is try to prepare as best we can to protect ourselves and our<br
/> families. We saw the first hint of the break down of the system with the<br
/> Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008. Generally, the banking system goes<br
/> first. They can pretend that they&#8217;ve fixed it, but I see that Citicorp<br
/> just failed its stress test. After the banking system fails, the<br
/> commercial system fails because you can&#8217;t stock the shelves in stores.<br
/> Then you can&#8217;t pay the fire and police departments. Then you have chaos.</p><p>Mark O&#8217;Byrne (GoldCore): Gold extended gains to a third session<br
/> today, scaling to fresh two week highs above $1,320/oz. Silver surged<br
/> 2.5% to $20.26/oz. Gains were due to geopolitical tensions, dovish<br
/> sounds from the Fed and the very poor exports data from China which led<br
/> to concerns about the Chinese and global economy. Minutes from the<br
/> Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy meeting which showed that officials were not<br
/> keen on increasing interest rates anytime soon are also supporting gold.<br
/> Low interest rates, which cut the opportunity cost of holding non<br
/> yielding bullion above other assets, have been an important factor<br
/> driving prices higher in recent years. Real interest rates are set to<br
/> remain negative for the foreseeable future which will be supportive of<br
/> precious metals. Silver continues to be favoured by contrarian investors<br
/> who see it as oversold and very undervalued vis a vis other assets<br
/> including gold.</p><p>GoldCore on Bail Ins: The landmark EU agreement on a common rulebook<br
/> for handling bank failures, including bail-ins, is in danger of<br
/> unravelling over the fine print restricting when a state can intervene<br
/> to rescue a struggling bank according to the Financial Times. Britain is<br
/> facing objections from several other EU member states as it scrambles<br
/> to revise a political deal, hastily reached in December. The FT reports<br
/> that it is “an attempt to protect the Bank of England’s emergency role<br
/> as covert lender of last resort.” The political stand-off over the bank<br
/> resolution directive – including bail-ins of bank depositors &#8211; comes<br
/> days before the European parliament is supposed to adopt the agreed text<br
/> of the legislation. While London insists it is belatedly rectifying a<br
/> technical discrepancy, other diplomats suspect it is revisiting a<br
/> fundamental element of the reforms, which aim to spare taxpayers from<br
/> the costs of bank failure. “This is a complete mess, a nightmare and we<br
/> have to decide what to do fast,” one person involved told the FT. At<br
/> issue is what form of support a state can provide to a lender in<br
/> difficulty without triggering a so-called bail-in, where losses are<br
/> imposed on bond holders who lent money to a bank and on depositors &#8211;<br
/> both household and corporate. The British want to clarify that central<br
/> banks can extend liquidity even when relying on a specific government<br
/> guarantee, without triggering haircuts on bondholders. The position is<br
/> acceptable to parliament but, since Friday, has prompted several member<br
/> states to raise concerns. At this late stage any revisions to the text<br
/> require unanimity. It is important to realise that not just the EU, but<br
/> also the UK, the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and most G20<br
/> nations have plans for bail-ins in the event that banks and other large<br
/> financial institutions get into difficulty again. This seems likely<br
/> given the lack of effective and real reform.</p><p>James Turk (JamesTurkBlog): Turk points out that gold has moved up<br
/> together with the S&amp;P 500. Only through the manipulation of the<br
/> central planners has gold decoupled from the stock market and had fewer<br
/> gains. Turk believes, however, that the correlated movement will<br
/> reemerge, and to make this correlation again, gold would have to double.<br
/> Accordingly, the expert expects at least as good second quarter of 2014<br
/> as the first. Over the next twelve months, the price could even be more<br
/> than 100 per cent down to produce the trend favorable towards the Fed&#8217;s<br
/> balance sheet again.</p><p>Zero Hedge: Apparently doing away with diplomatic pleasantries, the<br
/> Chinese have been directly clear with Chuck Hagel as he lays the<br
/> groundwork for President Obama&#8217;s Asia trip later this month (scheduled<br
/> to visit Japan, Malaysia, and the Philippines &#8211; all in direct<br
/> territorial conflicts with China). As Reuters reports, &#8220;Obama needs to<br
/> pay serious consideration to this issue when he comes to Asia&#8230; China<br
/> has already put this message across during the meetings with Hagel,&#8221;<br
/> said Ruan Zongze, a former diplomat with the China Institute of<br
/> International Studies in Beijing, a think tank linked to the Foreign<br
/> Ministry. &#8220;The United States is moving in a direction we don&#8217;t want to<br
/> see, taking sides with Japan and the Philippines, and China is extremely<br
/> unhappy about this.&#8221;</p></div></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li

It needs to quote gold in the BRICs currencies to take advantage of the new Forex exchanges that will blossom with the new physical only gold exchanges. The dollar will be left out of this arrangement as a pricing mechanism. It is the currencies that are correctly priced by gold as a reference point that will form the new robust trading blocs and have relative exchange values that diverge from the old Forex debt currency exchange system. The new currency alignment will pivot its core values around the negotiated settlement of oil for gold, and these currency values will be extrapolated from this pricing mechanism, not the dollar.</p></div></div><ul

/> the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, which was recently annexed by Moscow<br
/> to widespread international condemnation.</p><p>McDonald&#8217;s said the move was due to unspecified manufacturing reasons &#8220;beyond the company&#8217;s control&#8221;.</p><p>The chain say they hope to resume work as soon as possible, but<br
/> offered to help relocate staff to mainland Ukraine, signalling it did<br
/> not expect its Crimean business to reopen in the near future.</p><p>In response, pro-Kremlin figure Mr Zhirinovsky called for<br
/> McDonald&#8217;s to shut all over Russia &#8220;so there is not a scent of them<br
/> left&#8221;, saying he was ready to lead a campaign to force the closure.</p><p>He added: &#8220;It&#8217;s very good that McDonald&#8217;s is closing its branches in Crimea. Let them close their branches over here too.</p><p>&#8220;As a form of sanctions, they have agreed not to poison Crimeans in Crimea.&#8221;</p><p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p><p><a

/> Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said, adding that the nation has enough<br
/> space and resources to produce organic food.</p><p>Moscow has no reason to encourage the production of genetically<br
/> modified products or import them into the country, Medvedev told a<br
/> congress of deputies from rural settlements on Saturday.</p><p>“If the Americans like to eat GMO products, let them eat it then.<br
/> We don’t need to do that; we have enough space and opportunities to<br
/> produce organic food,” he said.&#8221;</p><p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p><p><a
href="http://rt.com/usa/china-gmo-corn-ban-120/" rel="nofollow">http://rt.com/usa/china-gmo-corn-ban-120/</a></p><p>&#8220;China has been blocking shipments of American corn from its<br
/> market since November. This was caused by the presence of the MIR162<br
/> genetically modified corn strain in the shipments. It was developed by<br
/> the company Syngenta and has not been approved by the Chinese government<br
/> since an application was submitted in March 2010.</p><p>China has sharply increased corn imports since the late 2000s,<br
/> with purchases increasing from 47,000 tons in 2008 to an estimated 5<br
/> million tons last year. It was the third-largest importer of American<br
/> corn before the imports of Syngenta’s GMO strain were blocked.</p><p>US traders want seed companies to shoulder some of the losses.<br
/> They also say seed companies should not introduce new varieties of seeds<br
/> to farmers until they are approved by major markets, including China.&#8221;</p></div></div></li><li

id="dsq-comment-message-2434" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Happy Monday Koos, Would like to clarify re my comments as I have since realised that I have had dialogue with one of the principles in ABS over the last year or two &#8211; Seamus Donoghue . I did not realise that this was the company he is involved with. Otherwise I would not have been so cautionary and negative in my comments. I can vouch for his bona fides and believe his company is legitimate. We are not and never have been in the business of bad mouthing or negative PR on competitors. Quite the<br
/> opposite &#8211; as we do not see the competition as other bullion dealers but rather bullion banks, banks, others in the financial services industry and purveyors of paper gold .  At the same time, we have a healthy distrust of bullion banks and I suppose it is testament to the ABS website that it has a corporate/ bank &#8216;feel&#8217; to it that made me think they may be a bullion bank entity. I wish ABS best of luck with the new business and hope there are synergies that we can work on.<br
/> Have a good week folks !</p></div></div><ul
