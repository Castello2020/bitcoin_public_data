Spectacular Gold Demand (79 Tons) on SGE in Week 2, 2014 Skip to Contentad-728×90-arrow-goldAdsense Header 2 InGoldWeTrustResearching the physical gold market Search for: "Only labour can create wealth - gold is condensed labour"Anglo Far-East sponsors In Gold We Trust for it's research that has highlighted physical gold demand from China. We consider his findings to be some of the most accurate available.HomeBest ReadsChartsTranslationsHistoricArchiveAbout / Contact Spectacular Gold Demand (79 Tons) on SGE in Week 2, 2014 In the second weekly report, that covers the five trading days from 6-1-2014 to 10-1-2014, today released by the Shanghai Gold Exchange we can read a spectacular amount of physical gold has been withdrawn from the vaults; 79 tons. Last week I wrote withdrawals were down, but could well pick up this month as China will celebrate Chinese new year on January 31, 2014 according to the Chinese Lunar calendar. And withdrawals did pick up.. This type of demand puts the physical gold market under severe stress, hence the scramble for gold in London a few days ago. “There is a shortage of big bars, especially good-delivery 400-ounce bars”, said Bernard Dahdah from Natixis “One part of the problem is that large quantities of these bars that have come from ETFs, have now been moved to be re-refined into three-nines bars of smaller sizes and are therefore no longer available to the London market.” The 1 month Gold Forward Offered Rate has been negative throughout the entire week Chinese demand was this strong. Until January 31 demand for physical could remain elevated, after which it will likely return to its average strong levels. Next to insatiable physical gold demand from China, these are interesting times in the gold market as the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, Bafin, made allegations at banks saying "possible manipulation of currency rates and prices for precious metals is worse than the Libor-rigging scandal", on January 17. The Financial Times reported in December, citing sources, that Bafin demanded documents from Deutsche Bank as part of a probe into suspected manipulation by banks of benchmark gold and silver prices. Maybe it's not a coincidence that Deutsche Bank, one of five banks involved in setting these benchmark gold and silver prices, stated today that they will stop participating.

For more information read this, this, this and this. This is a screen dump from Chinese SGE trade report; the second number from the left (本周交割量) is weekly gold withdrawn from the vault, the second number from the right (累计交割量) is the total YTD. This chart shows SGE gold premiums based on data from the Chinese SGE weekly reports (it’s the difference between the SGE gold price in yuan and the international gold price in yuan).

We could still beat them militarily, but only for another few (or less) years. In Gold We Trust The US and (inter alia) China have been in a financial warfare for many years now. The US still has the best weapons, but China is catching up quickly. Bill197511 China has bought a lot of gold the past couple of years. The sources of some of the gold are unaccounted for. I wonder how much gold the US has left. 7 years to return 300 tons of Germany’s own gold? The only reason gold is this cheap is due to massive Fed backed naked short sales. The Fed really shot itself in the foot, but Ben the beard says he doesn’t understand the gold market. What a bunch of buffoons. lorkoos In a drawn-out conventional war, China could kick our asses right now. The USA won WWII in a large part by out-manufacturing the Germans… guess who’s the manufacturing king now? Bill197511 Excellent point, and you’re right. I fear though, that if two nuclear powers go at it, it will go nuclear. I think we would beat them now, but five years from now I’m not so sure. Grée Solitaire No, China wants Taïwan and China Sea …. For now ! Why would China break the back of its biggest clients ? All is manufactured there ! USA and Europe and Russia, where fool enough to let this happen … IF and only IF, in twenty years, the chinese manage to have a inner richness of its own “bourgeois” population, with “residence secondaire” and tuti quanti, will we have to be afraid of a war, or a sort of “locust invasion”. A tiny example : the way the “Occident (USA, Europe, Russia)” let bug countries like Qatar, and Emirats, get into our economies by the banking business’, and eat us within by terrorism – or the threat of it ! Kent Ah I would like to inform you that it was Russia and not the US that was is the prime lead in the breaking of the Nazi regime. The Russians broke the back of Hitler at the Battle of Stalingrad and finished him off at the Battle of Kursk. This was in 1943. We the West weren’t even in the land battle until the Normandy landings June 6 1944. 24 carat First Rothschild left the London gold fix in 2004 when the goldprice accelerated to its intermediary high in 2011. Maybe they knew that a new freegold era had started with the birth of the euro and that heavyweight freegold advocates (China/Russia/etc) were embracing the concept. And that the Zoellick Gold Reference Point (pseudo goldstandard) was going to be internationally accepted. Deutsche Bank & C° have (again) been fasifying the goldprice benchmark to the profit of the priviliged in the financial industry ! The comex inventory show (eligible & registered gold) is circumstantial evidence of an inner treadmill goldprice manipulation. Contract gold that circulates around the moneymasters (cartel). The only way out of this papergold hell is the continued accumulation of physical gold by those who want to break this inferno. In the mean time, the declining Western economies diverge further and further from their own repressive financial industry manias. That will break the back of the manipulative mismanagement of the financial and monetary affairs.« Previous PostNext Post » Follow In Gold We Trust Keep this site publicly available,please donate!
