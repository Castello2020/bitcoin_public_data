			<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><p>With a little observation, the very first thing you will notice about kink in the public communities these days is that <a href="/2007/08/28/the-kink-culture-of-fear/">it&#8217;s all about what you can do or have done to you</a>. It&#8217;s about skills, abilities, and stamina. It&#8217;s a sport when played in public. And, just like sports, there are winners and there are losers.</p>
<p>How do you win at the sport of kink? What do you have to do to get the prizes? Your two options are very straightforward: become very competent at the requisite skills, or make people think you are very competent at these skills. They both work, even though I think one is abhorrent.</p>
<p>In point of fact, there&#8217;s very little I think is wrong about the necessity of competence. Competence is a good thing. It is so necessary a thing, in fact, that it&#8217;s probably the main reason why I have so relatively few play partners&mdash;more common a reason than the supposed <a href="/2007/08/04/what-sexuality-might-taste-like-if-you-were-a-submissive-man-in-2007/">Femdom Demographic Issue or submissive-male-phobia</a>, for instance. I judge most of the people I meet to be <em>in</em>competent, and I have very little interest in playing with people who don&#8217;t prove their skills to me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a competence snob, but I think I <em>should</em> be. I think <em>everyone</em> should be, and it should be (at least partly) obvious why: I don&#8217;t want to be harmed, physically, legally, or emotionally&mdash;regardless of whether I am bottoming or topping. I think of myself as too important to me to risk my well-being in acts of recklessness or irresponsibility even as <a href="/2007/07/16/dont-be-nice/">I strongly desire to be hurt and to suffer</a>. I feel as though this is obvious; I would need but to hold up a mirror to you to show you why such an attitude might be important.</p>
<p>I wish competence were recognized by people as being one of the most important factors in choosing a partner for a scene, or for a relationship. (They recognize the importance when choosing a doctor, yet <a href="/2007/07/30/how-to-make-my-space-bigger/">when it comes to sex and education otherwise smart people behave in very dumb ways.</a>) It&#8217;s clear that being competent makes you attractive because it gives you some value that you can provide to your partners. However, it&#8217;s also clear that most people are constantly fumbling about trying to discern what this value they are seeking actually is. They don&#8217;t know what it looks like or how to find it. I don&#8217;t think most of them are even aware of their own search for it in the first place (at least not concretely).</p>
<p><a href="//tes.org/">Classes</a> and <a href="//gmsma.org/">workshops</a> present so thin a slice of the big picture with such <a href="//lesbiansexmafia.org/">frequent repetition</a> that after attending them for a while you may quickly assume you have seen all there is to see. A Martian (or a naive young newbie) using such resources to learn about BDSM might assume all there is to kinky sex is ropes, chains, whips, and sharp objects, with the occasional actual sex act thrown into the mix. In such an atmosphere, it&#8217;s no wonder that the skills deemed most necessary to win this sport are those such as how accurately you throw your singletail whip, how securely and prettily you can tie a bottom up in ropes, or how much attention you pay to the safety best practices during a needle-play scene.</p>
<p>Yet not everyone attends classes and workshops. Those who don&#8217;t typically engage in kinky sex blissfully unaware of their own ignorance. Few &#8220;bedroom kinky&#8221; people I have heard of have ever shown a concerted effort to pick up an anatomy book with a mind towards safer rougher sex&mdash;though it&#8217;s obvious, even to them, why they might want to consider it. These are the kinds of people I have never found attractive. They never take the time to analyze their own successes or their failures, and consequently sentence themselves to lives of mediocre experiences at best or, more commonly, continuous bewildered failure.</p>
<p>I am very specific about what I consider to be factors of competence, and about how I value these various things. I am also utterly ruthless in my appraisal of the things I see. I have a similar reaction to badly executed rope bondage as <a href="/2007/08/17/what-every-big-sexuality-community-web-site-does-wrong/">I do to bad web sites</a>. It thus behooves me to say that I find consistently executed safety best practices, exceptionally functional and simultaneously aesthetically pleasing rope-work, and accurately administered whippings all to be valid and useful earmarks of competence, and I use such criteria as part of a standard barometer for a certain kind of competence all the time.</p>
<p>Similarly, it also behooves me to make explicit mention of the fact that it is one thing to <em>preach</em> these things and quite another to <em>practice</em> them. I find nothing impressive about intentions alone; intentions can not be competent.</p>
<p>It is for that reason why I have never been interested in listening to such sermons as the proper disposal of bloodied needles given by people who keep no sharps container in sight when they play. They are only proving themselves charlatans to me, because I know how to spot such a fraud. If I did not know how to do this, as was the case for me and for everyone else at one point in life, then I have always been better served by withholding final judgement <em>as well as trust</em> until I became better educated in the skill and the person both.</p>
<p>In other words, to trust without knowing shows me your ineptness. That&#8217;s one way I evaluate the competency of other bottoms. Incompetent bottoms act before they think; little wonder so many of them end up in situations they later regret.</p>
<p>It bugs me, viscerally, when I see people who are clearly not skilled (or not any more skilled than an average fellow is, anyway) being misrepresented or, worse, misrepresenting themselves as having a level of competence that they clearly do not have. What bugs me most of all, however, is that this sort of false aggrandizement is something that is accepted, unquestioningly, when dominants do it (by either <a href="//bitchyjones.wordpress.com/2007/08/11/unicornucopia-or-why-are-all-dominant-women-are-such-fucking-ass-hats/">dominant female asshats</a> or dominant male assholes) and is allowed to proceed unabated, but is instantly recognized and rightfully shot down when submissive people do the same.</p>
<p>I know of more than a handful of male tops who have a quite sizable number of (typically young, usually naive, almost always seriously troubled) groupies for reasons I can not even begin to fathom. These men are almost always significantly older than their groupies, and though not necessarily ill-intentioned or malicious, they are so unremarkable to me that I would blithely ignore their existence for the most part. They have no great skills as far as I can tell, they are not strikingly physically attractive, they speak of no rare or enthralling things, and I can find no particular intelligence, empathic ability, or other quality that makes them deserving of such long-lasting attention.</p>
<p>What seems most unusual to me is that, had these people not been <em>dominants or tops</em>, everyone else would <strong>and does</strong> think of these people the way I just described that I do. The <em>submissive or bottom</em> men&mdash;the older, not necessarily ill-intentioned or malicious, remarkably unremarkable men&mdash;<em>are</em> blithely ignored, by pretty much everyone. I imagine, with no experiencial evidence, that the same is true for women in complimentary roles, though finding evidence one way or another would certainly prove additionally enlightening.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but find this odd, and my theories as to why this is so center around my observations of the simplistic notion most people have about competence. Most bluntly, that competence is something to be admired without analysis, that it&#8217;s something only tops have, and that it can be displayed merely with intention. How ignorant, and dangerous, I find this to be.</p>
<p>Competency is gained through experience, practice, and questioning. It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s acquired not through some spontaneous or uncontrollable happenstance of luck and fate but by very deliberate efforts. In other words, you have to care about having it, or you won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>In this entire discussion I have tried to refrain from using examples or language that were orientation-specific. That&#8217;s because competence is not a one-way street. I have seen just as many, if not more, incompetent bottoms as I have seen incompetent tops. This is possibly because as a bottom it&#8217;s far easier to get away with being woefully incompetent at just about everything you do than it is for a top. Alternately, perhaps this is because of the unfortunate misconception that bottoming is inherently a passive act and that the entirety of a valid kinky encounter involves a purely active top and a purely receptive bottom.</p>
<p>In some competencies, this makes obvious sense. When you&#8217;re on the tail end of the whip as opposed to the handle, you don&#8217;t need the dexterity to be able to throw the whip perfectly. But you do need to understand what is happening. You should know how to breathe, how to move, how to scream (if it&#8217;s good), and how to communicate what you need, if you need something. Your top is not a mindreader. (And they probably like the screaming.)</p>
<p>The point is clear: competence in bottoms is just as attractive as it is in tops, and vice versa. Competence is sexy. What does a competent bottom look like? I think competent bottoms are self-reliant, emotionally hardy individuals who have a discerning eye, and have the presence of mind to act responsibly&mdash;to be willing to get things wrong and make things right again&mdash;and to act with empathy and generosity towards their partners. In other words, the same exact qualities that competent tops share. Try that on for size.</p>

<p>On a personal level, I&#8217;ve learned more playing with you than with any other specific person, precisely because you vocally demand competence. I wonder if my demands create the same learning drive in you?</p>
<p>The demand for competence seems to create a desire to gain competence, from any orientation.</p>

You touched on a lot of things I was thinking about when I prepared my “bondage bottoming” presentation, especially the idea that bottoms also have to have actual skills, that bottoming is not passive and requires its own level of knowledge and competence, and that bottoms must choose a partner they trust (and that trust is not based on “I know him, he’s a nice guy” but on competence).  I think you’ve done a great job at defining a competent bottom (and with it, a competent scene participant).  I would also add that a competent bottom is willing to learn and take on the skills necessary for what they want to do, even if that only amounts to mental preparation.  </p>
<p>Of course, I have many more thoughts on this:</p>
<p>First, I’m not sure that I see play – especially public play – as a sport. I see it more as a performance.  (I would go into the whole analogy, but I think you get it.) And as someone who works in theater, I can tell you that competence is just as important in performance; and competition is just as prevalent.</p>
<p>“I wish competence were recognized by people as being one of the most important factors in choosing a partner for a scene, or for a relationship. (They recognize the importance when choosing a doctor…”</p>
<p>Come on, May &#8211; not everyone DOES keep this in mind when choosing a doctor.  Some people pick a name out of their healthcare book, or someone whose office is close to their home.  Same thing for the scene.  Some people pick based on looks, or convenience, or a friend’s recommendation. These are the same people who don&#8217;t take care when picking a play partner.  It goes to the heart of your issue &#8211; some people don&#8217;t know HOW to make a good choice, or don&#8217;t know the factors to look for.  And rather than educating themselves, they go the easy route and just&#8230; pick one.</p>
<p>“In other words, to trust without knowing shows me your ineptness.”</p>
<p>But do we have to agree on what we must “know” in order to judge competence?  I’m like you – I have a very small group of play partners.  Nearly all of them are people who I have developed friendships with over a number of years, and in nearly every case, I knew them for months before we played. I need that. I need the time to develop a real-life connection (which for me, leads to the connection I need in the scene, to submit even for a small time period – I bottom in order to submit), to develop trust and a form of love, and yes, to gage their competence. I rarely go into a scene saying, “It’s a flogging scene.”  Like many experienced bottoms, I often go into a scene with someone I trust not knowing what they’re going to do to me.  Which is why the trust is so important. It’s not enough to know that this person is competent with a flogger. I need to know that he or she is competent in general, and that they are smart and safe enough to know how to use every tool they have in their toybag, mental and physical.  When I play with someone, I may not know how good he is with that cane he just pulled out.  But I know his reputation, I know his affection for me and his belief in playing safe and being skilled, I know if something goes wrong, he&#8217;ll take care of it (and me) and not try to pretend it never happened.  And that’s enough for me.  At the last BR, I played with someone I just met. I saw him do a rope suspension class. I met him through mutual friends.  I saw his skills and then backed it up with his personal reputation and a conversation in which I felt we clicked. That was also enough for me for the type of scene we did. (However, I would not have gone into that scene with a &#8220;do anything to me&#8221; mentality. We specifically negotiated a suspension scene, with some surprises.)  I had a great time.</p>
<p>I am as clueless as you as to why certain dominants (especially, but not limited to, males) attract the type and number of people they do. I can picture several of these men, and I just don&#8217;t get it.  However, I would disagree that submissive women are &#8220;blithely ignored.&#8221;  Men, yes.  Straight, submissive men are often ignored.  But women? I&#8217;m not sure. I think submissive women are treated with more respect in the hetero scene in general.  I, for one, don&#8217;t feel ignored. Except by the &#8220;domly dom&#8221; types, who I don&#8217;t give a rat&#8217;s ass about.</p>

I was hoping you&#8217;d share some of your thoughts on this. :)</p>
<blockquote><p>Come on, May &#8211; not everyone DOES keep this in mind when choosing a doctor. [...] rather than educating themselves, they go the easy route and just… pick one.</p></blockquote>
<p>True, lots of people don&#8217;t know how to make good choices at all and so their choices are typically the result of the &#8220;just pick one&#8221; method. Still, every one of those doctors in the health insurance book have at least some level of <em>perceived</em> competence signified by the fact they&#8217;re in the health insurance booklet to begin with. This makes people feel as though their choices aren&#8217;t in fact as random as they are but instead have already been pre-screened for them.</p>
<p>There is arguable value in this, but the point remains that this is not the case when choosing scene partners or girlfriends or boyfriends or one-night stands. In other words, in the doctor example, people assume competency and thus don&#8217;t consider it part of their own selection criteria (which is unfortunate for a whole host of different reasons)—so the recognition of competence <em>is</em> there—but in the sex example competency doesn&#8217;t seem to enter into the picture at all. That&#8217;s the problem.</p>
<blockquote><p>But do we have to agree on what we must “know” in order to judge competence?</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course not! ;) I think the precise criteria you may use to evaluate someone&#8217;s competencies is not nearly as important as being aware of your own  evaluation process in the first place because the success of the former is dependant on the latter. That, and because everyone has their own opinions about what kinds of competencies are valuable to them (which is as it should be). Your example of your experience playing at Black Rose is a perfect example of this.</p>
<blockquote><p>However, I would disagree that submissive women are “blithely ignored.” Men, yes. Straight, submissive men are often ignored. But women? I’m not sure. I think submissive women are treated with more respect in the hetero scene in general. I, for one, don’t feel ignored. Except by the “domly dom” types, who I don’t give a rat’s ass about.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would hypothesize that this is because of the commoditization of women in the scene. That is, submissive women (and women in general) are frankly always in demand in heterosexual kink communities. Submissive men, not so much. Thoughts?</p>
<p>Furthermore, I suspect you are only ignored by the &#8220;domly dom&#8221; types who already know they have no shot with you. ;)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks, Lolita. And, yes, you&#8217;re absolutely correct when you say that some people are so desperate for play of any kind that the notion of &#8220;how good&#8221; the play can be doesn&#8217;t even enter into their thought process.</p>
<p>One of the most blatant recurring examples of this is the fact that a significant portion of pro-dommes <em>clearly</em> don&#8217;t know how to use the tools of their trade. (Which is pathetic for so many reasons, especially since it really doesn&#8217;t take a long time to learn to use a flogger. Hint number one: it&#8217;s not a yo-yo!) Luckily for them, most clientelle are not so discerning.</p></blockquote>

(For example, my friend actually picked her doctor because he had a Jewish last name and her mother always told her to trusth Jewish doctors, and because his first name is &#8220;Eric&#8221; so he would likely be young. I now see the same doctor, mainly because my friend recommended him after she saw him.  Same doctor, two totally different reasons for choosing him.) Anyway, enough of that. I think we essentially agree on this.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would hypothesize that this is because of the commoditization of women in the scene. That is, submissive women (and women in general) are frankly always in demand in heterosexual kink communities. Submissive men, not so much. Thoughts?&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree with this, but I don&#8217;t think it paints the whole picture.  You may not like this, but here goes: from what I&#8217;ve seen, submissive women are more likely to be outspoken, opinionated, and in short, complete individuals when they&#8217;re not playing or in-role with their dominant or partner. Submissive men will sit there at a diner and continue to be submissive, whether that&#8217;s a general trait (staying quiet, feeling like he can&#8217;t speak unless spoken to), or more obvious behavior (not sitting at the table but kneeling beside a dominant instead).  This is a huge generalization, but it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve noticed.  Submissive men need to speak up and be more than &#8220;submissive men&#8221; &#8211; just be men, be equals, be someone we can talk to and listen to &#8211; or they&#8217;ll never be noticed.</p>

<p>Yeah; the issue isn&#8217;t with the doctor&#8217;s actual competence but rather with one&#8217;s evaluation process to determine whether or not this doctor should be trusted. Yeah, we&#8217;re agreeing. :)</p>
<blockquote><p>You may not like this, but here goes: from what I’ve seen, submissive women are more likely to be outspoken, opinionated, and in short, complete individuals when they’re not playing or in-role with their dominant or partner. Submissive men will sit there at a diner and continue to be submissive, whether that’s a general trait (staying quiet, feeling like he can’t speak unless spoken to), or more obvious behavior (not sitting at the table but kneeling beside a dominant instead).</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen exactly the same thing. (Why do you think I &#8220;may not like&#8221; you say that? It matches all of my experiences, and it&#8217;s why <a href="/2007/04/08/the-sex-trade/" rel="nofollow">I have so low an opinion of most other submissive men</a>.) But this still begs the same question: why?</p>
<p>In my experience, (especially submissive) women who don&#8217;t speak up for themselves get mistreated on far more regular a basis than submissive men who doesn&#8217;t speak up for themselves do. It seems to me that being a woman in the public kink communities can be quite a bit more challenging than it is for men; men are expected to be there, and women are the exception. See previous comment on commoditzation of women.</p>

<p>I am so glad you said that instead of me, because I <em>really</em> wanted to but thought no one would have the requisite domain-specific vocabulary to understand me. I&#8217;m glad to see some of my readers are of a technical ilk.</p>
<p>Anyway, you&#8217;re absolutely right, and you are expanding upon Lolita&#8217;s comment, above, when you say the finding satifiscing play is often all people are willing to do. This is true, nor surprising, but still frustrating because it means most of the tops I see don&#8217;t have the skill level that I find truly attractive. The ones that do, of course, are fantastic, and not all of them have the same skill levels in the same areas, so this creates a lovely variety, but the point remains, there are far too few of them.</p>
<blockquote><p>People are out there looking to be harmed.  People are out there looking to harm.  I&#8217;m not sure how to spot either of these on first sight.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s true. In my experience, many of these people make up the adoring droves of bottoms that (for lack of a politically correct word) unworthy tops have. That&#8217;s a shame, really, though I see little I can do about it except to continue to conduct myself with pride and self-respect and hope these people eventually catch on that they can do the same. I simply haven&#8217;t known anyone who respects themselves completely to seek out being harmed.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve seen play that is some combination of sport and performance and sensationalism &#8211; &#8220;Watch me do this extreme thing!&#8221; play. Almost like something out of the Jackass movies. I have felt like competance was actively exiled from such play.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen this too. There is certainly a distinction to be drawn between performance, sensationalism, and play. Sometimes an activity can be a combination of these things, and if the participants are all aware of this, then I see little real issue with it, even if I won&#8217;t necessarily be impressed. I have always been far more impressed by watching extremely competent players, though, so the best way to make me stop and look at a scene is to do it well. I literally stare at the scenes of some tops I know because they are just so good at what they do. (You know who you are. ;)</p>

<blockquote><p>The interesting thing is how much straight sexual relationships incorporate elements of BDSM, both in terms of dominance and submission, as well as ritual and even the need for pain. How many couples do you know where one of them is at a distinct disadvantage (in terms of sex, power, satisfaction, attention or even love) and yet they soldier on?</p></blockquote>
<p>Hey, thanks for dropping by. And of course, a good point you made there. I think a lot of people have some kind of incapacity to understand a need for pain as anything but detrimental to their lives, and so many of these people end up finding ways to enact that need which are, unsurprisingly, detrimental to their lives.</p>
<p>Answering directly: yes, I&#8217;ve known quite a few straight and vanilla couples whose relationships remind me of so many kinky things, though the mention of such a thought would be blasphemous in their minds. Can&#8217;t say I understand how the disconnect happens in their minds, but then again I still don&#8217;t understand a lot of things about basic math that probably makes me sound like an idiot to other people.</p>
<p>To each their own, I suppose. I just wish more of them would find a way to make themselves happy. Granted, that&#8217;s easier said than done; I would know.</p>

<p>I like the Don&#8217;t Make Me Think comparison.</p>
<p>For me, a lot of this is really about <i>paying attention</i>.  Technical skills are one thing, but it&#8217;s not so much (for me) about being able to do X accurately, as about doing it accurately <i>and right</i>.  Having said that, people doing it inaccurately pisses me right off :-)  But all the technical accuracy in the world doesn&#8217;t mean shit if it&#8217;s not done in the right way for those people and that situation.  </p>
<p>I think this may be getting onto emotional competency.</p>
<p>The analogy that springs to mind for me is DJing.  Beatmatching is a skill, and that&#8217;s one thing.  But what actually makes a good DJ is putting the right tracks (or bits of track) in the right order, for <i>that</i> crowd on <i>that</i> evening.</p>
