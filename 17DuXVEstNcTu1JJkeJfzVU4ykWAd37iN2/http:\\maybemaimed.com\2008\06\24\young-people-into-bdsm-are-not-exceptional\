			<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><p>Every so often, such as last Saturday night, I get to talking with a bunch of people in the BDSM scene. Most of these people are almost always decades older than me. At some point in the conversation, which usually turns into a friendly debate of sorts (because those are the kinds of conversations I enjoy having), I get complimented on my &#8220;exceptional&#8221; nature.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but May, not everyone who is your age has the emotional maturity that you do to handle BDSM,&#8221; they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;You&#8217;re exceptional.&#8221; And then they&#8217;ll go on to tell me countless stories about how they saw some young people totally fuck up their lives by not &#8220;being ready&#8221; for BDSM play.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s kind of nice to be complimented on my emotional maturity, or my intelligence, or whatever it is they feel will drive their point home the strongest, but the truth of the matter is that it&#8217;s total bullshit. I am not that exceptional. Very few people are.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the lie: to be &#8220;ready&#8221; for BDSM, you need lots of life experience, commitment, maturity, and intelligence in droves. They say you will need these things so that you won&#8217;t freak out over what you&#8217;re getting into, so that you can spend the years it&#8217;ll take you to find the (increasingly less) underground culture that is the scene, and then enough intelligence to &#8220;get it&#8221; when you&#8217;re finally there.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the truth: BDSM is just like anything else and you&#8217;ll get out of it whatever you put into it. That means if you&#8217;re an idiot and you think being kinky is the next bi, you&#8217;re going to do stupid shit and you&#8217;re going to regret it. But you know what, that holds true if you&#8217;re 15 or if you&#8217;re 40 years old. Age has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>It is true that 15 year olds have a lot less life experience than 40 year olds (duh). However, I think it&#8217;s just plain dumb to assume that because of this lack of life experience these younger people have less emotional maturity (or intelligence, or what-have-you) than older people. Just because you&#8217;re 40 doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re more mature than me, it could mean you&#8217;ve just been acting really immature for 40 years. Come on, you all know the kinds of 40 year olds I&#8217;m talking about.</p>
<p>People often use my mere presence in the community as proof that you do need to be exceptional to be a <a href="//bloodylaughter.com/2007/06/28/baby-face/">23 year old with a healthy BDSM lifestyle</a>. &#8220;Where are all the other 23 year olds in several year long committed D/s relationships?&#8221; they ask. Indeed, I&#8217;ve asked that very same thing, too. Since there are so few of us, that <em>must</em> mean people like Eileen and I are exceptional. Right?</p>
<p>Well, maybe in some respects (we do write pretty cool blogs, after all), but what&#8217;s exceptional about my being heavily involved in the BDSM community isn&#8217;t how exceptional <em>I</em> am, it&#8217;s the fact that I&#8217;m involved <em>despite the odds</em>. In other words, the circumstances themselves are rather remarkable, but that does not mean that the cause of those remarkable circumstances is solely of my own doing.</p>
<p>Though I could easily take all the credit for being one of the few young people out and about in the scene, most of the credit belongs to the rest of the community that doesn&#8217;t see young people like me as capable members in equal standing. With consistent decrees that we need all that largely useless life experience to really be a part of the scene, how could young people ever hope to be engaged?</p>
<p>What&#8217;s even more bewildering to me is that this apparent necessity for life experience makes no sense. Not only is that kind of disrespectful (albeit in a good-natured sort of way), it&#8217;s also contradictory: more often than not, you&#8217;ll hear people tell newbies that they need to &#8220;unlearn&#8221; lots of <a href="/2007/12/12/the-rules-of-flirting-are-sexist-and-wrong/">cultural and social programming</a> to feel comfortable with BDSM. Well, gosh, unless the unlearning itself is the goal of BDSM (which would make for a really really boring kink if you ask me), then doesn&#8217;t that put younger people in a far more advantageous position to be &#8220;ready for BDSM&#8221;?</p>
<p>The inaccurate representation that BDSM requires some kind of special life journey, different or unique from other, &#8220;less intense lifestyles&#8221; is really nothing more than the older generation&#8217;s self-consoling opinion. &#8220;It&#8217;s okay that it took me thirty years to come out to the community and start having kinky sex,&#8221; they tell themselves, &#8220;because I needed all that life experience to be able to handle it now.&#8221; On the other hand, for them, maybe that was really true. If I were born in the 60&#8242;s instead of the mid-80&#8242;s, I also might have needed quite a few more decades to get my head around the fact that masochistic or submissive urges are not sick.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not what I needed as a young boy, though, because with information about sexuality finally freed from the stranglehold of large organizations (such as governments and <a href="/2007/12/12/love-sex-or-fear-god-that-is-the-question/">religions</a>), young people are way more capable of exploring their own sexuality safely than almost anyone gives them credit for. Most of us are also smarter than people give us credit for, and we&#8217;re also way more emotionally mature than they think.</p>
<p>As long as people like <a href="/2007/12/14/an-exemplar-of-conservative-hypocrisy/">Miriam Grossman</a> don&#8217;t get their way, this means younger people like me (and, hell, even younger people than me—damn, now I feel old) will be able to find our sexual comfort zones at much younger ages than the previous generations. And really, how can that be bad?</p>

Excellent points.  I started getting into kink (more mildly, true) at 16 or 17.  And got more heavy probably at 19 or 20. And much heavier (piercing, service, etc) at 22. I&#8217;m in the same boat; most people at things I go to are significantly older (although if I had a dollar for each younger person I knew that said &#8220;I&#8217;m into BDSM, but don&#8217;t go to group things because I&#8217;m always the youngest person there,&#8221; I&#8217;d have a lot of money, and a younger generation munch). I always feel patronized; &#8220;Wow, it&#8217;s wonderful that you&#8217;re so mature and ready to handle this.  There aren&#8217;t many people out there like you.&#8221;  Well, how many younger people do you talk to in general?  Maybe they just don&#8217;t come to events because they don&#8217;t like the reaction they get.</p>
<p>Ok, you&#8217;ve got me started. Maybe I should post about this..</p>
<p>Anyways, great post.  Well thought out, and I agree.</p>

<p>I got <i>exactly</i> that from the poly community, though.</p>
<p>My favorite example was the person with no poly experience who rejected my advice because I was nineteen or so at the time &#8212; never mind that it was advice for a problem that I would never have had because I&#8217;m not a damned fool and wasn&#8217;t even when I was nineteen &#8212; on the basis that I wasn&#8217;t old enough to know how to advise someone who had been married for umpty years.  The same advice from someone fifteen years older was fine, though.</p>
<p>Did you ever get, &#8220;You can&#8217;t possibly know what you want in your personal life yet, you&#8217;re too young?&#8221;</p>

If people are orientationally one way or the other, that&#8217;s the way they&#8217;re going to be&#8211;all they have to do is find the information they need in order to identify what it is they&#8217;re feeling and seek out a community of like-minded people. Just as I had a mad crush on my (female) seventh-grade teacher for three years, but didn&#8217;t have enough information until I was 16 to call myself bisexual, so it took me until 17 or so to identify feelings that I&#8217;d had since elementary school as inherently submissive-oriented. But without the Internet, and the openness of other teenagers today, I would still not know what I am or why I have the feelings that I do. </p>
<p>This is the way society evolves. Maybe someday we&#8217;ll have a society where everyone is open-minded and accepting and information is non-stigmatized and freely accessible.</p>

<p>Thanks. FYI, I think I&#8217;m behind an HTTP proxy, but every time I load your blog I get Blogger&#8217;s &#8220;adult content warning&#8221; page and then, even though I hit &#8220;accept and continue,&#8221; it just reloads the adult content warning page. Again, I think it&#8217;s because of the HTTP proxy, but just thought you should know that you&#8217;re probably losing quite a chunk of audience possibilities because of that.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t tested routing through something like TOR yet, so maybe it&#8217;s not a proxy….</p>

<blockquote><p>Did you ever get, “You can’t possibly know what you want in your personal life yet, you’re too young?”</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been getting that my whole life, starting when I was in second grade and trying to get my parents and the school administrators to let me out of school. (I ended up dropping out of high school and it was one of the best things I ever did for myself.) Obviously this is happening less now, but now everyone knows that I&#8217;m &#8220;exceptional.&#8221; Pfffffft.</p>

<p>Exactly. Thank you for adding that. By the way, you were one of the young people I was thinking about while writing this post. Hope you&#8217;re well.</p>

<p>Well, where are all the other 23-year-olds in several year long committed relationships, regardless of whether d/s or vanilla? Most 23-year-olds simply haven&#8217;t had a chance to be in such a relationship, especially not if they started dating rather late in life, for whatever reason. And those I&#8217;ve known who were did not always strike me as such a good example to others, either.<br />
Yes, living longer gives you more experience, in that more things happen to you. Long relationships give you more experience of relationships, in the same way. But it all comes down to whether you learn from said experiences, and that does not come automatically with age.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m eventually (once I&#8217;m done moving) going to move to WP, but not this very second, as my life is super busy. Damn warning.  I never had one till I put up a nude picture wrapped in the American flag, and then BAM.  Hmmm&#8230;</p>

And to use those computer thingies, too? How precocious. Back in my day, of course, we had to scrape the top layer off some old parchment and use goose quills dipped in berry juice.</p>

These same people who are remarking on how <i>exceptional</i> a 23 year old is don&#8217;t understand that the younger crowd is simply not coming to their events.</p>
<p>The reasons why are convoluted, but I&#8217;m going to mostly chalk it up to anti-young ageism.  Some examples include: skanky intergenerational come-ons, a tendency to drown out younger voices, young people not wanting to deal with the goofy homophobia or gender essentialism of their elders, and of course a complete failure to actually target events at a younger crowd or even notice when the younger crowd does not show.</p>

<p>Actually, no. We just keep clicking, and it just keeps redirecting. I even tried going through the terms of service and clicking through all the links. It&#8217;s very frustrating! Once your move settles, I also suggest that you look into what&#8217;s going on there. Also, could you Twitter your RSS feed&#8217;s address? </p>

I remember 10 years ago in college, there were students there who&#8217;d been doing kink, reading all the books, talking the talk and walking the walk since their teens in the late 80&#8242;s.  That young people do it isn&#8217;t new &#8211; I think the people who say that it is, forget how many gay leathermen started out at 17 year olds in motorcycle clubs in the 50&#8242;s.  </p>
<p>That said, it took me 15 years from my initial contact with S&amp;M erotica to coming out into the scene.  Much of that time was deprogramming, emotional growth, etc.  Honestly, I&#8217;m still not truly comfortable with BDSM, or with my bisexuality.  I&#8217;m 31, I&#8217;ve been out in the scene for 3 years, I&#8217;ve been saying I&#8217;m bi for 6 years, and I&#8217;m not OK with it.  I am sad and angry about that, but it does make me think there&#8217;s something to the idea that self-acceptence can take a lot of time.  </p>
<p>I think you have a point on the deprogramming not necessarily taking as long anymore, because of exposure.  I think you&#8217;re totally right there.  However, I think more people have more to de-program than you might think.  I think the more there is to deprogram, the more energy that deprogramming will take.  That can be spread over time, or it can be done intensively and quickly &#8211; and more traumatically.  Maybe that&#8217;s why there are as many flameouts and recklessly self-damaging people as there are.</p>

<blockquote cite="#comment-14839"><p>How common is someone like me??</p></blockquote>
<p>Don&#8217;t fret; you&#8217;re not an anomaly. Guys like you are pretty common, some even argue <em>more common</em> than any other kind of guy, although I tend to believe things are more equally balanced than most people think.</p>
<blockquote cite="#comment-14839"><p>i feel like i know more than most adults</p></blockquote>
<p>You may have certainly done more <em>thinking</em> about specific kinds of sexually exciting thoughts than many adults have, but I would urge you to remain humble about what you actually think you know. The people who know the least often think they know the most. Don&#8217;t become one of those people; if you stop asking questions or stop actively trying to learn more, you&#8217;ll easily turn into one of those much older idiots I reference in this post. Remember the <a href="http://www.businessballs.com/consciouscompetencelearningmodel.htm" rel="nofollow">stages of learning</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unconscious incompetence—when you don&#8217;t even know that you don&#8217;t know something. (You might remember a few years ago when you didn&#8217;t even understand why you thought some things were sexy.)</li>
<li>Conscious incompetence—when you know enough to know that you don&#8217;t actually know a whole lot about it.</li>
<li>Conscious competence—when you&#8217;re experienced enough to see what you know and how much more you have to go.</li>
<li>Unconscious competence—when you&#8217;ve gotten so much practice that things are second-nature and you realize you need to put effort into checking what you know against new standards to keep getting better instead of simply going through repetitive motions.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote cite="#comment-14839"><p>Please give me some ideas on how to fufill my need.</p></blockquote>
<p>You&#8217;ve started off on the right foot by doing a lot of thinking about the matter, and you&#8217;re clearly looking for useful resources on the subject as well—both steps in the right direction. Be mindful, humble, and communicative:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go read a ton of <a href="http://bloodylaughter.com/" rel="nofollow">other blogs</a> (there are lots of good ones listed on my blogroll under the heading &#8220;People with interesting things to say&#8221;) and ask them questions by commenting on posts you found interesting.</li>
<li>Start a blog of your own and ask questions in your posts, soliciting feedback from others.</li>
<li>Talk to friends of all sexes face to face (including both fellow girls and boys).</li>
<li>Read books like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bound-Be-Free-Sm-Experience/dp/0826410472" rel="nofollow">Bound to be Free</a> (which I first read at 15), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Different-Loving-Sexual-Dominance-Submission/dp/0679769560" rel="nofollow">Different Loving</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Come-Hither-Commonsense-Guide-Kinky/dp/0684854627" rel="nofollow">Come Hither</a>, and other BDSM resources of similar quality. If you can&#8217;t buy copies of these books, <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33405087" rel="nofollow">look for them in a library</a>.</li>
<li>Look at and listen to the free audio and video resources about BDSM available online, such as <a href="http://vimeo.com/tag:kfanyc" rel="nofollow">KinkForAll videos</a>. You might find the audio recordings of classes such as <a href="http://www.upload-mp3.com/files/20123_13azq/Sascha.mp3" rel="nofollow">&#8220;The Submissive &#8216;No&#8217;&#8221;</a> particularly interesting. (There are even more <a href="http://kinkforall.pbworks.com/KinkForAllNewYorkCitySchedule" rel="nofollow">links to free audio/video from KinkForAll New York City available here</a>.)</li>
<li>And while you&#8217;re reading, talking, and learning about all this, remember that <strong>not everything you read, hear, or see, is good information for <em>you</em></strong> even if it is good information for somebody else.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always stay physically safe at all times. <em>Know what your physical abilities and limits are</em>, and if you&#8217;re not sure what they are, be even more careful. Like <a href="http://maybemaimed.com/2009/02/27/8-things-submissive-men-want-from-a-dominant-partner/#you-are-confident-and-independent-in-your-dominance" rel="nofollow">I say in the post about 8 things submissive people want</a> from a dominant partner:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://maybemaimed.com/2009/02/27/8-things-submissive-men-want-from-a-dominant-partner/#you-are-confident-and-independent-in-your-dominance"><p>[A dominant person] need[s] to have and be constantly developing a sense of [their] own skills so that [they] know what [they] can and can’t realistically and safely do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<blockquote><p>im not sure how my opinion matters seeing on how im a male sadist not a female masochist.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regardless of what it is, your opinion will always remain an opinion. I&#8217;m not certain I understand why you seem to be implying that your opinion would &#8220;matter&#8221; any less or different because of who you are.</p>
<blockquote><p>And yes, i know this comment will probably be deleted because im a minor.</p></blockquote>
<p>A final thought: I hope that when you encounter other people, they will treat you with the same respect and willingness to share information with you as they might treat people of their own age. Sadly, <a href="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/115054159/a-naked-young-boy-is-restrained-on-a-circular" rel="nofollow">this is very rarely the case</a> when adults interact with minors: <q cite="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/115054159/a-naked-young-boy-is-restrained-on-a-circular">I sincerely believe that hiding sexual information (including imagery) from youth is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/14/child-pornography-sexting" rel="nofollow">a bigoted, adultist act</a>. There is an important distinction between sexualizing children and providing sexual information to them.</q></p>

<p>I&#8217;m probably overreacting a tad because I honestly did not believe anyone I would consider a friend could feel otherwise on this and I&#8217;m in an emotionally vulnerable frame of mind for unrelated reasons, but it hurts, and I&#8217;ve been drifting away from those I care about because I&#8217;ve seen far too much narrow-mindedness going on for a long time.  Maybe they would consider me narrow-minded for not accepting their traditionalist views, also.  Anyway, I apologize for venting on your blog when I do not, in fact know you except in being a fan of your site.  I also post elsewhere as Viverrine, but I&#8217;m already tired of having a secret identity that can&#8217;t really stay that way anyway.</p>

Local flavor may be extremely bitter in one place and sweet the next. Sadly, I&#8217;ve not found any TNG groups to my liking. The one in NYC is the one I have most experience with, although I&#8217;ve also met many of the folks involved in the Boston as well as the DC area ones. Frankly, while I appreciate all of their efforts, I find their methods outmoded and largely off-putting. Nevertheless, I try to support them through encouragement and partnership with <a href="http://conversiovirium.org/author/maymay/" rel="nofollow">Conversio Virium</a> as much as I can.</p>

Well, I came across this looking for information. I&#8217;m sixteen, and a girl, and I&#8217;ve had interest in BDSM for a while now. I&#8217;m mostly a sub, I guess, but I&#8217;ve read a lot and I guess I&#8217;d be called a switch? Sometimes I&#8217;m interested in both? (dominating and being submissive). Anyway&#8230;I feel so wrong and weird, and I thought, after reading some comments, this would be a good place to ask where to find better information. </p>
<p>Am I too young to be interested? Especially because I&#8217;m a girl? I generally feel very alone, in this. Like there aren&#8217;t other people like me, or at least now, at my age.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never told anyone or talked about it, but I&#8217;ve read lots of articles and read stuff&#8230;</p>
<p>And I just keep thinking &#8216;I can&#8217;t wait until I&#8217;m 18&#8242; when it would be more okay to ask or talk about.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m not exactly sure what my question is or what kind of answer I&#8217;m looking for and I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m rambling. I&#8217;m sorry; this just seemed like a place where I wouldn&#8217;t get yelled at for asking, since I&#8217;m young.</p>

<p>First off- you&#8217;re not too young to be interested, and DEFINITELY not especially because you&#8217;re a girl. I was interested in kink from an early age myself!</p>
<p>I had a difficult time coming out about it to my friends, even my gay best friend, so I get why it can be hard to tell anyone offline. But you can bet there are other people who are into it around your age- they just might be afraid to come out, afraid of what it means, afraid of being rejected. </p>
<p>Personally the way I handled it was by talking to my lover about wanting to try some things- a little spanking here, a little bondage there. The best thing you can do for yourself in my experience is learn how to negotiate- how to say no, how to say yes, figuring out what you like and how to describe that to someone else. Negotiation is invaluable! And, in my experience, be wary of people who offer to &#8220;take you under their wing&#8221;. :)</p>
<p>Scarleteen has a tag for BDSM, which might be helpful to you: <a href="http://www.scarleteen.com/tags/bdsm" rel="nofollow">http://www.scarleteen.com/tags/bdsm</a></p>
<p>Without knowing what you&#8217;ve read I&#8217;m not sure what to suggest or where to direct you&#8230; but in summary? You&#8217;re not weird, you&#8217;re not alone, and you don&#8217;t have to wait to explore kink til you&#8217;re 18. Just consider that communication is the best lubricant and work from there. :) Best of luck!</p>

<p>You know, I&#8217;m not totally sure what the legal situation is here in the US about exactly this kind of conversation.  It&#8217;s possible that it&#8217;s illegal for an adult and a minor to have a frank exchange about sex online, even if that exchange is entirely educational and not salacious in any way.  </p>
<p>In any case, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;d say:  </p>
<p>1. Scarleteen and the San Francisco Sex Information Service are great and reputable resources about sex.  You can google both of them.  </p>
<p>2. As someone who is kinky, I can say that I was aware of being kinky pretty much from the earliest times I had sexual feelings, and that was well before I was 18.   I had no idea if my sexual fantasies were like anybody else&#8217;s, because there was absolutely nobody for me to have that conversation with.  At the time, I was more worried about the fact that I was bisexual than that I was kinky.  </p>
<p>3. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with you.  Kinky people can and do have loving, healthy relationships with other people.</p>

<p>Hey there, hun &#8211; while I can&#8217;t really provide much of anything in the way of information, I just thought you should know that you are NOT the only teenaged girl who&#8217;s into stuff like this.  Both myself and someone I know have shared our stories about the fantasies we had as young as 12 and 13, of very clearly (in retrospect) BDSM type situations.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not alone, you&#8217;re not weird, and I wish you all the best. &lt;3</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re weird, I&#8217;m weirder. I tried to tie myself up with my Ribbon Dancer when I was about 5 or 6, and I got really excited about playing cops and robbers with toy handcuffs. I&#8217;ve had rape fantasies as long as I&#8217;ve known how to masturbate. I started looking at bondage porn the first time I had Internet access in my bedroom, when I was 13. </p>
<p>More experience only leads to more wisdom if you don&#8217;t let shame cloud your perception. Self-acceptance is the most mature thing a person can practice.</p>
<p>Also, I would recommend the New Topping Book and/or the New Bottoming Book for anyone examining their BDSM identity. </p>

Hearing from actual people is so much better than reading &#8220;it&#8217;s okay&#8221; on random articles and such. I&#8217;m so happy I decided to comment (I totally almost didn&#8217;t) and happy I had the opportunity (I&#8217;ve known how to get around my parents&#8217; parental controls for awhile, but never the bravery or the insurance that they aren&#8217;t home). </p>
<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you. Even just that made me feel so much better.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had my mom catch me googling stuff before (hence the heavy parental controls) and she&#8217;s only said enough to yell at me/say she&#8217;s disgusted, and then put stronger controls, or take the computer away, etc. </p>
<p>I really just wanted some honest answers or information or just support, really. Thanks again.</p>

<p>You sound pretty much exactly like me! Including the being there at 16 bit. I don&#8217;t have any particular &#8220;great&#8221; resources, but I&#8217;m now 21 and still kinky and having a lot of fun &#8212; being out of state at school most of the time has helped with the parents thing, although most of my BDSM community experience was over a summer when I lived at home. </p>
<p>If you want to find good, kinky, written porn, I suggest exploring fanfiction. Some of it doesn&#8217;t even require knowledge of the source material. Kink Bingo on Dreamwidth is a good place to start &#8212; they have a lot of good stuff, tagged by kinks. If you like an author, click on their journal to read more. Hopefully Dreamwidth/LJ aren&#8217;t caught in your filters somewhere, but you might still use incognito mode in Chrome to keep history clear.</p>

I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;d describe myself as kinky or not, but as a 20 year old, I was sixteen not too long ago, and in my experience, it&#8217;s not at all too young to know what turns you on, what sexual things you&#8217;re into.  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t come across as somebody you&#8217;d expect to be possibly kinky if you met me in person, so I&#8217;m sure there are other people out there like me who may seem shy, or innocent, or such, when in reality they aren&#8217;t.</p>

When you don&#8217;t feel like you think you &#8216;should&#8217;, it is confusing and it is hard to escape the &#8216;wrong&#8217; feeling when those around you don&#8217;t seem to share it.</p>
<p>I think many of us have been there, and in fact your comment has prompted me to write <a href="http://www.domme-chronicles.com/2011/07/how-old.html" rel="nofollow">a post about what we do to help young people</a> who are essentially kept out of all the places where there might be resources and information that will help them to find support and others &#8216;like them&#8217;.</p>
<p>I have a booklist on my blog if you are interested to take a look and I am more than happy to lend an ear if you want to email with someone who is old enough to be your mother (my contact email is in my blogger profile).</p>

<p>Thanks for helping (and the rest of you too) I really appreciate it. </p>
<p>I also had a question: I tried to click &#8220;email&#8221; on your blog, but it says I don&#8217;t have the something something installed correctly so it won&#8217;t let me. Any suggestions? Sorry if I&#8217;m a nuisance.</p>

<p>Like Kitty said, you&#8217;re not too young to know what you&#8217;re interested in, especially not because you&#8217;re a girl. There are quite a few people at my local munch who are 18 or 19, and I&#8217;m pretty sure that a switch didn&#8217;t suddenly flip in their heads when they turned 18.</p>
<p>Please try not to take what your mother says to heart &#8211; she probably  just doesn&#8217;t understand kink and is worried about your safety. People worry far more about women who bottom because if you don&#8217;t understand BDSM, an awesome scene where everyone has fun looks a lot like domestic violence.</p>
<p>In terms of information resources, I really like reading people&#8217;s blogs. They aren&#8217;t necessarily as informative as a site like scarleteen, but I find them a lot easier to relate to. It took me a long time to get into kink because I didn&#8217;t relate to the stereotypes at all, but once I started reading forums, I found out that kinky people are actually not that weird :)</p>

I appreciate this article very much. It finally shows that SOMEONE can understand that minors can understand adult-centered topics. I am 16 and submissive and I have been castigated and bullied for it for a very long time. I have also been told over and over again that I am either &#8220;delusional&#8221; or &#8220;not ready&#8221; to decipher where I stand with the whole issue of Kink in general. I also think that it s very true that age does not decipher the amount of life experience that you&#8217;ve had. When I was 7, my mother caught a fatal illness and almost died. She also became paralyzed from the waist down for many years. I was put in charge of not only so much of the household but also the emotional burden that this experience would put on a seven year old. When I was 9, my entire family separated and I was not allowed to see any member of my family except for my mother. I have not seen their faces to this day. When I was 11, I became morbidly obese. I was bullied and teased until I tried to commit suicide. In that year, I tried to commit suicide seven times. I lost the weight. I lost 123lbs. I went from 238lbs to 115lbs in only one year. And with this newfound slimness, I gained friends. After that, things got better. I&#8217;ve known that I&#8217;ve been submissive since I was very young. I remember the first signs of it coming up when I was 4. I discovered what I was called and more about it when I was 11. I am proud to say that I am submissive. Since I am female, I also get harassed by many radical feminists who consider me &#8220;weak&#8221; or &#8220;brainwashed&#8221;. I don&#8217;t care if one thinks that I don&#8217;t have life experience. I know that I do. I&#8217;m not going to try to get myself into the BDSM community at this point in my life for it is not only unsafe for a 16 year old but also could get some fellow Kinksters in trouble with the law. Although, I would like to find a Dom who is my age who I could be in a long-term relationship with. I would like to find a Dom who would truly love me as well as satisfy the desires that I do have. I am so glad that you wrote this article. This article advocates for me and my desire. It advocated for every Kinky teen who wants somebody to stand up for their desires. Thank you for daring to write this beautiful article. You are amazing.</p>

Age isn&#8217;t everything. Eva Ardenson&#8217;s comment is similar to my situation! Except I&#8217;m fifteen and just starting to get into the bdsm side of things. I guess I would consider myself a submissive but I&#8217;ve never really done anything about it and have no idea where to begin. If I could find a Dom to help teach me, love me and satisfy me needs that would be great! I&#8217;m really glad you wrote this article because it gives me hope that I&#8217;m not alone with these feelings at such a young age! Keep up your awesomeness :)</p>

It&#8217;s kinda lonely. Always heard more about people getting interested in this when they&#8217;d been married a few years and they were less inhibited. Nice to know even though I&#8217;m only dipping my toes in the pool, there&#8217;s still some younger people in there swimming. ^_^</p>

I&#8217;ve called my self a top for 5 years but truely started to understand it in the past 3. I know this may go against taboos and rules but my generation is the most connected since the last. So I was bound to happen. I agree with what you say. But also want to say that the community doesnt come across as very welcoming to anyone who&#8217;s young. I know I&#8217;m a dom I&#8217;ve had 5 bloody years to really think about it all the while having my expronces with other teens through the internet. The odd time I encounter an adult they shy away from me and wont talk. I have questions that no one will answer. I would expect a community made up of people who know how difficult it is to accept yourself and understand who they are would be more helpful but all I&#8217;ve been met with is closed doors. My questions are simple things like; what does a normal day look like for a dom and sub? How do you get over loosing your partner. I also recently realized that I&#8217;m a daddy dom. Yes shocking but I looked at what it meant and my last relationship. It cliked I felt releazed and over joyed in my journey of finding out who I am I&#8217;m a daddy dom. As for life experince, are you kiddin me my generation is the most accepting, understanding, openminded and free thinking out of the past dozen. I know that I will be met with disapproval, but why? I found who I was, why am I being punished by being denied the right to know, does it matter if the submissvie picks the movie or not? Lastly it&#8217;s nearly impossible to find other teens who want the lifestyle and live near me.</p>

I want and need a good Dom or Master but I don&#8217;t want to get ppl in truble. I mean y is there an age limit set for the online if we r just talking to ppl like us it makes no sense.</p>

If you haven&#8217;t yet done so, it is important that you read my other postings, &#8220;<a href="http://maybemaimed.com/2012/12/08/submissive-people-dont-need-dominants-period/" rel="nofollow">Submissive people don&#8217;t need dominants</a>&#8221; as well as &#8220;<a href="http://maybemaimed.com/2014/04/17/heterosexuality-is-a-fetish-why-wasnt-it-ever-in-the-dsm/" rel="nofollow">Heterosexuality is a fetish</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with your age. No submissive person of any age needs a dominant person. That you think you do <em>is</em> a problem and something I think you should examine extremely closely for your own sake.</p>
<p>Please also read my post, &#8220;<a href="http://maybemaimed.com/2013/01/23/national-bdsm-organizations-own-survey-admits-a-consent-crisis-in-bdsm-scene/" rel="nofollow">National BDSM organization&#8217;s own survey admits consent crisis in BDSM Scene</a>.&#8221;</p>
