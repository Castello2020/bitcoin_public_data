			<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><p>Imagine my pleasant surprise when <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2009/11/14/online-reputation-management-for-sex-bloggers-when-a-tweet-wont-do/">my Internet radar</a> picked up a great post by a thoughtful new feminist BDSM blogger. <a href="http://afeministsub.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/good-girl/">FeministSub has a thing or two (or three) to say about the phrase &#8220;good girl&#8221;</a> worth pointing out:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://afeministsub.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/good-girl/"><p>“Good girl.”</p>
<p>I don’t think there’s anything that captures my mixed feelings about submission like that phrase. There’s so much in there. </p>
<p>Until very recently, it was one of my least favorite things to hear. So condescending. Patronizing. Paternalistic.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>[W]hat feminist wants to be a Good Girl? After all, every feminist knows that <a href="http://www.carryabigsticker.com/btn_well_behaved_women.htm">Well-Behaved Women Seldom Make History</a>. And then there’s the whole <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Madonna–whore_complex">madonna-whore complex</a> thing, which will certainly be a subject of its own post at some point.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>So that’s why I don’t like “good girl.” Or rather, why I don’t want to like “good girl.” Because, honestly? I fucking love it. It makes my pussy wet and my heart sing. The first time a dominant partner called me a “good girl,” I felt like I had just taken a shot of morphine. And I wanted more.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>[T]he very fact that I like it so much[…]is a little, well, humiliating. And that just adds an extra frission of erotic stimulation and emotional intensity. As <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/07/16/dont-be-nice/">maymay said once</a>, ”I don’t want to be <em>tortured</em>, but I <em>want</em> it.” Obviously, being called a “good girl” is not exactly torture, but I think maymay perfectly captures that paradox of being submissive for me—of <em>wanting the things I don’t want</em>. I want them both in spite of and because of the fact that I don’t want them.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is, indeed, so much in there. Others&#8217;s comments are good, too. <a href="http://afeministsub.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/good-girl/#comment-7">I left a comment</a>, which turned into <a href="http://afeministsub.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/good-girl/#comment-10">two comments</a>, both of which are relevant enough to this space that I&#8217;m cross-posting the ensuing exchange:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://afeministsub.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/good-girl/#comment-7"><p>Huh. Interesting.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, being a &#8220;<a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/03/14/new-erotica-good-boy-good-pet/">good <em>boy</em></a>&#8221; has been <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2008/01/08/fantasy-worlds/">one of my favorite things to hear</a> for as long as I can remember. Reading your uncomfortableness towards the phrase makes me inclined to attribute our differing feelings about it to our <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/12/12/the-rules-of-flirting-are-sexist-and-wrong/#comment-128964">gendered experiences in the world</a>. <ins datetime="2011-03-31T19:13:59+00:00">(For another example, see also <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/12/20/the-sexism-of-sex-and-smarts/">The Sexism of Sex and Smarts</a>.)</ins></p>
<p>When you say:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://afeministsub.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/good-girl/"><p>Oh, and of course, there’s the fact that it’s “good <em>girl</em>.” I know it’s pretty commonplace to refer to grown women as girls, and I do it all the time. But there’s no denying that it adds to the patronizing tone.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m reminded of the <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=pretty">examples many dictionaries cite to explain the meaning of the word &#8220;pretty&#8221;: pretty song, pretty room, pretty <em>girl</em></a>. These are <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2009/09/14/freeing-sexuality-information/">(sexist) sexual standards</a>. <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/08/21/i-want-to-be-a-pretty-boy/">They hurt me</a>—and <a href="//maybemaimed.com/playground/malesubmissionartcom/praise/">many others, too</a>.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="http://afeministsub.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/good-girl/#comment-5">Leah</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://afeministsub.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/good-girl/#comment-5"><p>I like the powerlessness of the experience. […] Sometimes it embarrasses me to ask for a thing, but I do so out of desire — because I want. Although I am not the one in control, I nevertheless consider myself an equal partner, fully complicit in the sex.</p></blockquote>
<p>In my (not so) humble opinion, extricating <em>control</em> from <em>power</em> is what claiming sexually submissive agency is about. We are not often taught, as bottoms in the BDSM Scene, how to do this and <a href="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/215415525/a-shirtless-man-whose-hands-are-tied-at-the-back">I think that&#8217;s because most of the BDSM community at large has an unacceptably poor understanding of the systemics of power itself</a>, sexual and otherwise. It seems to me that your desire for <em>the experience of</em> powerlessness feels at odds with your claim of &#8220;complicity&#8221; precisely because you wish to abdicate your control of the sexual situation in order to serve the fantasy of &#8220;not being in control.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s totally cool (and fun), but by your own admission of being &#8220;an equal partner,&#8221; that&#8217;s not really what&#8217;s happening. Put another way, the liminal space of &#8220;wanting what we don&#8217;t want&#8221; problematizes dichotomized notions of control to a degree that threatens much of the powerful/powerlessness fantasies intrinsic to most BDSM discourse. <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2011/03/20/fetlife-considered-harmful/">The BDSM community, writ large, enjoys either/or thinking to an astonishingly damaging degree</a>—not to mention how <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2009/10/02/dont-you-fret-sexism-is-alive-and-well-in-bdsm/">disgustingly sexist they are</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s develop <a href="http://KinkOnTap.com/?p=1803">a deeper understanding</a> so more of us can approach these issues using both/and thinking, instead.</p></blockquote>
<p>FeministSub briefly <a href="http://afeministsub.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/good-girl/#comment-10">responded</a> asking for clarifications:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://afeministsub.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/good-girl/#comment-10"><p>This comment will take me a while to work through. :) But thank you! I did stop and think while I was writing this about whether or not male subs enjoy “good boy.” It actually made me think about how much of the language of domination and submission is at least subtly gendered.</p>
<p>Do you mind explaining what you mean by this?<br />
<blockquote cite="http://afeministsub.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/good-girl/#comment-7">Put another way, the liminal space of “wanting what we don’t want” problematizes dichotomized notions of control to a degree that threatens much of the powerful/powerlessness fantasies intrinsic to most BDSM discourse.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Since she asked, I went ahead and risked explaining without sugarcoating:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://afeministsub.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/good-girl/#comment-11"><blockquote cite="http://afeministsub.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/good-girl/#comment-11">I did stop and think while I was writing this about whether or not male subs enjoy “good boy.” It actually made me think about how much of the language of domination and submission is at least subtly gendered.</p></blockquote>
<p>Subtly? :) It&#8217;s quite overt. &#8220;<a href="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/364865244/a-young-man-leashed-between-the-legs-of-a-young">Sissy</a>,&#8221; &#8220;bitch,&#8221; &#8220;slut,&#8221; etc., all usually treat femininity as intrinsically submissive.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just gendered. Sexually dominant and submissive lingo frequently puts underprivileged (oppressed) populaces in the submissive role while putting privileged populaces in the dominant one. See, for example, &#8220;<em>little</em> girl/boy,&#8221; which highlights both size and age—<a href="//maybemaimed.com/2009/11/23/sexual-adultism-at-kinkforall-washington-dc/">youth are arguably the most consistently disadvantaged populace on the planet</a>—or &#8220;who&#8217;s your daddy,&#8221; for the reciprocal perspective. In other words, if &#8220;power is an aphrodisiac,&#8221; then <a href="//status.maymay.net/notice/14926">oppression is a sexual performance enhancing drug</a>.</p>
<p>In my experience, most <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2011/02/01/in-which-i-am-an-asshole-about-sexual-authoritarianism/">BDSM&#8217;ers like to avoid thinking about this potentially uncomfortable truth</a> because they either think it might ruin their fun or that they&#8217;re not complicit in the damage this can cause. But turning a blind eye to this is as idiotic as saying <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/9780553251821?&#038;PID=35175">talking about sex (e.g., negotiating) &#8220;ruins&#8221; the fun</a> of playing or it&#8217;s narcissistic to the point of being inhumane. Yes, some BDSM&#8217;ers say that and are those things, too, and they&#8217;re usually idiots or privileged shits.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://afeministsub.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/good-girl/#comment-10"><p>Do you mind explaining what you mean by this?<br />

</blockquote>
<p>Oh, all I mean is that most BDSM&#8217;ers enjoy treating &#8220;What It Is That We Do&#8221; as <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2010/02/08/on-dichotomies/">a dichotomy</a> of power wherein bottoms/submissives have none (they are powerless) and tops/dominants have all of it (they are powerful), as if it&#8217;s all some kind of zero-sum, either/or game. The way the community talks about this (i.e., its discourse) typically fails to acknowledge or delegitimizes <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2008/10/25/equating-passivity-with-sexual-submissiveness-is-a-stupid-mistake/">situations in which bottoms have power</a> and tops do not (regardless of whether or not they also have &#8220;control&#8221;).</p>
<p>For instance, &#8220;service top&#8221; is a vague pejorative in the BDSM community precisely because it threatens the &#8220;powerfulness&#8221; of a top. Conversely, &#8220;do-me bottom&#8221; is similar because it threatens the &#8220;powerlessness&#8221; of a bottom. I think this is why expressing desire in the form of &#8220;wanting what I don&#8217;t want&#8221; is complicated; it problematizes my own fantasy of absolute powerlessness and my top&#8217;s absolute powerfulness, which can feel threatening to many ignorant or simple-minded BDSM&#8217;ers.</p>
<p>Since so much of the way the BDSM community and, in fairness, contemporary overarching society, couples submission with femininity and femininity with powerlessness, it should come as no surprise that <a href="http://subversivesub.wordpress.com/2009/02/23/sexism-in-bdsm/">most BDSM&#8217;ers are profoundly sexist</a> and, worse, often willfully ignorant of that. Sadly, the petulant self-righteousness with which many of them go about espousing their &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; can easily obscure a greater understanding of both the <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/08/28/the-kink-culture-of-fear/">problems</a> with and <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/11/15/the-closet-and-the-importance-of-others/">benefits</a> of &#8220;The Scene.&#8221; <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2010/11/27/community-fuck-the-community-this-isnt-for-them-anyway/">They certainly obscured them from me</a> for a long, long time.</p>
<p>I hope that wasn&#8217;t too brash a comment for your blog. I think your post was really good.</p></blockquote>
<p>As is always the case, the best places to see idiocy and inhumane narcissism of the kind I described is to go to the places where idiots and privileged shits talk amongst themselves. The Internet is amazing for this because few people have the technological know-how to shield their internal discourse from prying eyes—not to mention that <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2011/03/29/anti-censorship-best-practices-for-the-sex-positive-publisher-atlanta-poly-weekend-2011/">such shielding is often antithetical to the point of telecommunication in the first place</a>. In this sense, <a href="http://days.maybemaimed.com/post/3580615781/photographers-on-fetlife-and-their-precious">FetLife offers ideal grounds for privileged-shit-spotting</a>, and <a href="http://www.manboobz.com/">David Futrelle&#8217;s blog <cite>Man Boobz</cite></a> consistently offers awesome roundups and priceless quotes from inside the pro-sexism MRA forums.</p>

<p>Apple doesn&#8217;t fall far from the tree. When someone can explicitly and obviously violate the most sacred rules of a kink establishment and not only get away with it but be actively protected because they run a website, it says a lot about privilege. </p>
<p>On a similar note, you&#8217;d tweeted something about being invited to invite only events. As far as I can tell, sans internet fame, such invites are usually determined by whom one is fucking and how fabulous one&#8217;s wardrobe is.</p>

<p>A few interesting things:</p>
<p>- I&#8217;d always wondered what the disdain for &#8220;service tops&#8221; and &#8220;do-me bottoms&#8221; was (I mean, honestly, what is the problem with bottoming because it brings you pleasure or topping because it brings your partner pleasure?!), and I think your idea about it being rooted in attitudes towards power is really interesting. </p>
<p>- I really like the idea of &#8220;extricating control from power,&#8221; and it&#8217;s not something I&#8217;d thought about before. </p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, I think the most problematic aspect of &#8220;wanting what I don&#8217;t want&#8221; is that of consent, especially the feminist idea of &#8220;enthusiastic consent.&#8221; I&#8217;ve always been a big believer in enthusiastic consent, but it does seem a bit at odds with wanting what I don&#8217;t want.</p>

The phrase made me think (which I really liked&#8211;thank you!), but I don&#8217;t completely understand it.  </p>
<p>Also, about &#8220;good girl&#8221;.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d describe myself as being into BDSM, but I&#8217;m on the submissive side of the middle, and I think being called &#8220;good girl&#8221; could be very arousing if a boyfriend and I were experimenting with some light BDSM, so long as I loved and trusted him.  </p>
<p>Everybody&#8217;s different, but for me personally, there&#8217;s something I think I&#8217;d like a bit about the power dynamic that I associate with it.  It isn&#8217;t the sexist associations that it has, but the subservience (but not inferiority, to be clear) that it implies to me; it&#8217;s a positive affirmation, but it also reminds me that there&#8217;s a power structure (I hope I&#8217;m not using power where I should be using control) at play.</p>

<p>Not at length at the moment, <a href="#comment-133512" rel="nofollow">Natalie</a>, but this is a great writing prompt and I&#8217;d like to come back to it one day. In a sentence, though, it means acknowledging that performances of powerlessness—or powerfulness, for that matter—are just that (performances), and since this power is not intrinsic to either the action nor the actor in question, such a performance does not necessarily offer any indication of who or what has a majority (&#8220;controlling&#8221;) share of the influence in affecting the outcome of a particular engagement (like a scene, or a relationship, or more generally, a sexual encounter). A simple example is <a href="http://maybemaimed.com/2007/08/10/the-first-blowjob-ive-ever-bottomed-to/" rel="nofollow">bottoming to a blowjob</a>.

since this is my first time here I&#8217;d like to give you a word of appreciation for what you do here. Much of what I&#8217;ve read seems to express many of my feelings about male submission and the BDSM scene (I am a submissive male). And some of the photos are absolutely beautiful.</p>
<p>But when I read through this post I stumbled across something that surprised and disappointed me:</p>
<p>Those &#8220;pro-sexism MRA forums&#8221; you talk about are not all pro-sexism you know. Some of them are fighting for equality against vicious sexist bigotry that is causing a great deal of harm. I read some of David Futrelle&#8217;s writing and he seems to want to paint a particular image of them and then goes about attacking that image. Not exactly the method of a truth seeker.</p>
<p>I would have expected someone like you to be more open to the issues that face men in today&#8217;s time. I learned a long time ago that being male was a big hindrance to living openly submissive. While I doubt that MRA&#8217;s have all the answers, I do believe they are right about one thing which is that, just as women have a lobby, men need one too. Don&#8217;t you think so?</p>

<p>MRAs do not lobby for gender equality, <a href="#comment-136662" rel="nofollow">anit</a>, they lobby for hate against women. So, no, I don&#8217;t think they deserve a &#8220;lobby.&#8221;</p>

I said men need a lobby. </p>
<p>I assure you I&#8217;m quite aware of the problems with many MRAs. But I&#8217;m not saying they&#8217;re right or wrong per se. Such a judgement would be silly considering that MRA is just an acronym that you also ascribed to your self too now. Calling anyone who fights for men&#8217;s rights a sexist is sexism itself, don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<p>And as for your challenge, that was quite misplaced and rude. Just because I don&#8217;t blanket accuse people who call themselves MRAs as sexist, doesn&#8217;t say anything about me and certainly shouldn&#8217;t demand that I justify it or be labeled &#8220;dangerously pacifistic&#8221;. It reminds me of the &#8220;prove that god doesn&#8217;t exist or I continue to believe you&#8217;re an atheist bigot&#8221; &#8211; kind of demands. It&#8217;s a no-win road because you can interpret sexism into pretty much anyone&#8217;s view &#8211; even alone for being heterosexual. If anything, it is your sweeping generalizations that require justification but I&#8217;m not so interested in that.<br />
I&#8217;d rather still like to know whether you think men need a lobby?</p>

<p>No, <a href="#comment-136696" rel="nofollow">anit</a>, men don&#8217;t &#8220;need a lobby.&#8221; We &#8220;men&#8221; are quite well over-represented without one, thank you very much. The only reason women &#8220;need a lobby&#8221; is because they, as a group, are actively suppressed. I support womens&#8217; political action groups precisely because groups that don&#8217;t explicitly identify themselves as such are overwhelmingly male-dominated to the detriment of women and even men like me (and &#8220;MRAs&#8221;).</p>
<p>Moreover, if men and women were treated fairly, the notion of needing a lobby based on sex would hopefully sound as absurd to you as your commentary here sounds to me.</p>

I may be wrong, but it seems to me that the prejudice and stereotypes would be better combated by opposing gender essentialism as a whole, or gender stereotypes within sex as a whole rather than splitting it up into genders.  The women&#8217;s rights/feminist movement addressed and addresses areas which are problematic specifically to women, while gender and sexual role essentialism are issues both men and women deal with.  </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not referring to men being in non-traditional roles in sex, then could you explain how men are discriminated against?  Granted, there still seem to be certain social standards of men acting masculine and all that, but that isn&#8217;t an issue of men being oppressed by another group, so the best response isn&#8217;t the same as the best response to, say, women getting paid lower wages than men for the same work.</p>

"No, anit, men don’t “need a lobby.” We “men” are quite well over-represented without one, thank you very much. "</p>
<p>Overrepresented? Where? The only place I see men overrepresented possibly as a result of discrimination, is in the highest corporate positions. A very small minority and solving that problem would only affect a minute number of already very successful women. Not exactly representative of the general population. </p>
<p>"The only reason women “need a lobby” is because they, as a group, are actively suppressed. "</p>
<p>Can you be a little more specific, because I don't see that active suppression of women - at least not in Western democracies. </p>
<p>"I support womens’ political action groups precisely because groups that don’t explicitly identify themselves as such are overwhelmingly male-dominated to the detriment of women and even men like me (and “MRAs”)."</p>
<p>What about female-dominated fields such as education? Are they detrimental to men and why do they not justify a lobby for men?</p>
<p>"Moreover, if men and women were treated fairly, the notion of needing a lobby based on sex would hopefully sound as absurd to you as your commentary here sounds to me."</p>
<p>If there were not illnesses, we'd not need doctors and if there was no crime, we'd not need prisons. Your point is?</p>
<p>I'll try to explain my position without going on too long.</p>
<p>Firstly, I've seen a number of examples of discrimination against men of the kind that I have not seen women face. One such example was conscription (where I live, that means 1 year service for men). Another was a quota based policy for women in public institutions which directly resulted in a close friend not getting a professorship and having no representative to turn to. And yet another is teachers at school openly declaring resentment of boys for being boys and even giving them lower marks for the same performance. Sadly I just came across a recent example of that so it hasn't gone away - despite boys slipping in education.</p>
<p>Those were just personal experiences. On a social scale, looking at the statistics that compare living standards of the genders (most importantly life expectancy, health and education) one cannot arrive at any other conclusion that men are averagely in bigger trouble than women in modern Western societies. If we really do want to treat the sexes with the same value, then we cannot ignore that. I hope that gives you an idea why men need some form of lobby. </p>
<p>That the pay gap is a result of discrimination is largely a myth that has been refuted many times. Even if it were true, it would only be discrimination or systematic oppression if it were legal which it's not. </p>
<p>I turned away from feminism because I feel it no longer empowers women as was originally intended. That shouldn't surprise us though since most political activist movements eventually deteriorate into a racket headed by fanatics. Or, try to see it this way, what do you think would happen if we did achieve harmonious equality between women and men? Do you think the feminist representatives would fold their arms and say "well, my work is done here and I'm not needed anymore". Course not, they'd keep looking harder and harder for increasingly absurd reasons to be needed (and paid). The problem is, we won't know when we've passed that point since the only recognized authority on gender equality is feminism itself.</p>
<p>Bottom line, all my life I've been for genuine women's empowerment and equality of the sexes and because of that, I cannot support modern feminism. Even the word 'feminism' is supremely sexist.<br />

<p>Luckily my b/f and I are both emancipated and very aware of gender roles/sexism. But that makes playing with these roles just more fun.<br />
For example it has a stronger appeal for him to f*ck me when I&#8217;m wearing an apron and high heels in the kitchen, BECAUSE it&#8217;s a stereotype that doesn&#8217;t reflect my feminist personality. </p>
<p>Exaggerating stereotypes and tinkering with them can be fun and can be empowering because you (as a couple) are in control of them it the situation you create. Of course what you find humiliating / makes you feel powerless/ pushes your buttons is still influenced by stereotypical associations. But BDSM can and I think SHOULD increase your awareness for stereotypes and power in real life</p>
<p>Playing with d/s can mean juxtapositioning the non-political correct unconcious with an awareness of power and that can be exiting &#8211; and make you more aware at the same time.</p>
<p>I think the &#8220;complexity&#8221; of feelings you describe comes from the juxtaposition and contradiction and that for some people it creates a friction that perhaps is a driving source for exitement.</p>
