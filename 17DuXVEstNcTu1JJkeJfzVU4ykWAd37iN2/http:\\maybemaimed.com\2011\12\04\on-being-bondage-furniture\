			<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><p>I don’t know what it’s like to be bound to most bondage furniture. But I do know what it’s like to <em>be</em> bondage furniture.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this when I showed up as a volunteer for <a href="https://fetlife.com/users/9088">Mark</a>’s Dungeon Crew, part of <a href="https://fetlife.com/groups/1901/group_posts/1950350">the group who had offered to help set up</a> the <a href="http://www.portlandleather.org/">Portland Leather Alliance</a>’s <a href="https://fetlife.com/events/69463">post-Thanksgiving Play Party at the TA Events Center</a>. I’d volunteered in exchange for free entry to the $20 per person party that evening, but when I got to the Events Center and stood at its doors as the big U-Haul with all the bondage furniture backed up towards us, <a href="https://twitter.com/maymaym/status/140608348524515328">I was overcome with an active disinclination to help</a>.</p>
<p>This wasn’t laziness or freeloading; I didn’t just not want to help, I actively wanted to <em>not</em> help. The feeling came over me in a wave and I was briefly confused. I stood at the doorway to the party space, silent, motionless, with my hands in my pockets.</p>
<p>“Do you want to not help because you’re not sure if you’ll have a good time at the party?” <a href="http://days.maybemaimed.com/post/7222621647/via-mind-to-media-the-dangers-of-sappiness">Mish</a>, who I’d convinced to come with me and with whom I was ostensibly volunteering for free entry, asked me after I found some awkward words for my feelings.</p>
<p>“No….” I said it softly, and slowly, thinking. My mouth had trouble forming the word. I felt less like I was answering her question and more like I was trying the answer on for size. “No,” I said again after a moment, more self-assured this time, for now I knew why that was not the answer.</p>
<p>“This needs two people,” the man unloading the U-Haul called out. He pushed a padded bondage chair toward the edge of the truck. Several volunteers appeared near him. They lifted the chair a few inches off the ground and began moving it towards the party space.</p>
<p>The chair was facing me head-on. I stared back at it, and that’s when <a href="https://twitter.com/maymaym/status/140609610141798401">I saw her</a>. She was naked, and ugly. Her flesh was molting like a sick bird’s feathers and her bony face and hollow cheeks made her whole head resemble a skull. Her eyes were large and what thin layer of skin was stretched across her jaw curled into a mean smile. Her legs and arms were bound to the heavy wooden frame of the chair the volunteers were carrying and as they moved it into the play space the ghost turned her head, locking her eyes on mine.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/creep-lyrics-radiohead/e9b013a7caf5eec148256866000da819"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7hBf2wXmjA">Your skin makes me cry</a>.<br />
You float like a feather<br />
in a beautiful world.<br />
I wish I was special.<br />
You&#8217;re so fucking special.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m a creep,<br />
I&#8217;m a weirdo.<br />
What the hell am I doing here?<br />
I don&#8217;t belong here.</p></blockquote>
<p>“No way I’m helping,” I said aloud to myself. I turned my back and walked to the street corner without ever saying goodbye to anyone on the PLA dungeon crew.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/maymaym/status/140611319513616384">Most submissive men hate themselves</a>. That makes it easy for us to <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2011/01/13/what-porn-companies-can-learn-from-the-giffords-shooting/">hate other people</a>. That also makes it easy for other people to hate us. <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2011/07/16/on-letting-the-world-burn/">The BDSM Scene wouldn’t have it any other way</a>; <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2011/10/05/re-caste-ing-alternative-sexuality-a-class-analysis-of-social-status-in-the-bdsm-scene-arse-elektronika-2011-screw-the-system/">The Scene-State’s corrupt plutocrats have too much riding on it</a>.</p>
<p>I hated myself for a long time because <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/03/08/bdsm-as-an-emotional-sexuality-all-its-own/">I want to be sexually submissive</a> and yet I was unable to access a relationship that felt good to me. I didn’t hate myself because I wanted to be sexually submissive, I hated myself because I felt incapable of being attractive and I felt incapable of being attractive <em>because</em> I wanted to be sexually submissive; no one wants a submissive man.</p>
<p>The hatred didn’t start that way. It started as hope. <a href="http://days.maybemaimed.com/post/12680925708/submissivesecrets-image-close-up-of-3-braided">I used to keep a coil of rope beneath my pillow</a>, and I would wrap it around my wrists to comfort myself at night. I hoped that one day someone who loved me would sleep next to me, our naked skin keeping one another warm, the weight of their arms on the sides of my exposed chest as my own arms were kept above my head by the ropes.</p>
<p><a href="//maybemaimed.com/2010/11/27/community-fuck-the-community-this-isnt-for-them-anyway/">When I first joined the BDSM Scene in 2002, I naïvely believed people there gave a shit about me</a>. By the time my then-partner, Cookie, had burned through two relationships, I was still coiling rope under my pillow hoping I could be sexy like she was. I saw Cookie on a trailer for Kink, Inc.’s Wired Pussy porn site before I ever really played.</p>
<p>That’s when the hope dissipated, never to return. In that moment of invasive surprise at unexpectedly seeing my ex-partner show up on my screen as I browsed for porn, all the hope I had mutated into confusion: <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2011/05/19/story-of-how-to-improve-the-future-always-hate-the-status-quo/">Why doesn’t anyone want to play with me the way I really want</a>? <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/08/21/i-want-to-be-a-pretty-boy/">Why am I not attractive</a>? <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/12/12/the-rules-of-flirting-are-sexist-and-wrong/">What am I doing wrong</a>? <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/03/14/tell-me-im-yours-and-tell-me-im-good/">What’s wrong with me</a>?</p>
<p>Years pass.</p>
<p>It was getting late, but neither Eileen nor I were tired. We cast about the group, conducting an informal poll of who wanted to continue bar-hopping. The Professor was up for more, and so was C, so we said goodbye to the others as the four of us headed to the bars near St. Mark’s Place in New York City. It was an area where The Professor said he knew where to find the cheap drinks.</p>
<p>The Professor was a (straight) dominant man who, despite his age and <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/08/14/more-men-need-to-cry-on-the-big-porn-screen/">ingrained ignorances</a>, was far cooler than most of <a href="http://kinkontap.com/?p=20">us young BDSM’ers who hung out at Conversio Virium in 2007</a>. C was a college student, and a sex worker—a self-identified switch, a fetish model who semi-regularly bottomed for various Kink, Inc. sites, and a pro-domme. <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/08/26/a-moment/">Eileen—my live-in partner</a>, <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2008/02/06/one-night-i-fell-in-love/">love of my life</a>—was a dominant woman. And, well, you all know <a href="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/136225950/a-young-man-is-shackled-and-leashed-to-spreader">I’m a submissive man</a>.</p>
<p>The four of us drank, talked, and eventually headed home to mine and Eileen’s apartment. The conversation had become flirty at the last few bars, implicitly sexual on the ride home, and explicitly so back at the apartment. I fetched us all more to drink. I remember returning to find C making out with Eileen. It wasn’t much longer before C’s clothes were on the floor. Eileen held C’s hands behind her back as they kissed, The Professor fondled C’s thighs and legs and cunt, and I stood back, smiling awkwardly and feeling very out of place in my own bedroom.</p>
<p>“Do you want to put an ice cube in her pussy?” The Professor asked me, taking one out of his drink and handing it to me.</p>
<p>I thought maybe he was being generous, trying to include me in the play scene that had “<a href="http://jezebel.com/5857078/the-trouble-with-it-just-happened">just happened</a>.” It wasn’t just a question, it was an invitation. But it was an invitation <em>to top</em>. I knew how to say “no, I don’t want to put an ice cube in her pussy,” but I didn’t know how to say, “I’d rather you tie me up and put the ice cube in my ass.”</p>
<p>So I said nothing and slipped the ice cube I’d been handed past C’s vulva anyway. I hoped I’d feel some kind of erotic charge, but as C reacted to the cold with lustful gyrations and her perfect, practiced, pornonormative moan, I just felt worse. It was as though I was now out of place in my own skin, not just my own bedroom. The <em>wrongness</em> of what was happening right in front of my eyes, <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2011/05/02/my-unreal-experience-on-the-kink-inc-armory-tour/">the <em>stereotype</em> that the love of my life was embracing, the offensive <em>cliché</em></a> I had so casually let enter my home, and then my bedroom, and then my bed, had now <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2011/03/10/its-foggy-today-how-bdsm-and-sex-can-be-emotional-self-medication-in-a-cruel-world/">snuck its way into <em>me</em></a>. I was no longer an observer; I was a participant in something I actively wanted no part of.</p>
<p>The play intensified. They moved to the living room so C could feel the single-tail whip. My whip. The one that had been gifted to me for my birthday the prior year. There were no good places to throw it in our apartment so The Professor held C against his body, tits facing Eileen, near the middle of the room. Eileen ranged herself to the four-and-a-half-foot single tail. I watched it all, paralyzed, literally voiceless, like it was a train wreck in slow motion.</p>
<p>Bright red stripes appeared on C’s breasts and torso as Eileen singletailed her. C twisted in The Professor’s grip, lifting her legs. “Stay still,” the co-tops said several times, before finally concurring, “We need to hold her ankles in place.”</p>
<p>That’s when I did the most shameful thing: I prostrated myself on the floor, face down on the wood, laying myself between Eileen and C, under the range of the single-tail whip. I held onto C’s ankles with my fists and kept them in place. Eileen began to throw the whip again. Every time she did, I heard C yelp.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when Eileen threw a vertical strike, the follow through would land weakly across my back. It was nothing like <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/06/24/pride-and-marks-and-marks-of-pride/">actually being hit with the thing</a>, nothing of consequence. But I remember wishing for it to continue, pining for just one thing: <a href="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/63627789/a-man-wearing-ripped-clothes-stands-against-a">more—<em>play with me more</em></a>. There I was, a ridiculous fool, splaying myself out on the floor, doing my best imitation of bondage furniture, and feeling all but <em>grateful</em> for accidental swishes of single tail strikes. Strikes that weren’t even meant for me!</p>
<p>She wasn’t even aiming for me.</p>
<p>I felt so stupid. I felt so used. I felt so bad. I just wanted so much to be played with the way they were playing with C. In the moment when what I had seen in so much porn on my computer was actually happening in my own home, I was “<a href="http://days.maybemaimed.com/post/7041813168/im-used-to-unfair-and-painful-but-i-had-for">counting my blessings</a>,” hungrily <a href="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/91994257/a-half-dressed-man-stares-across-a-room-at-a-woman">lapping up whatever regurgitated bits of eroticism fell from the feast above me</a> like the forgotten <em><a href="http://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/01/02/men-dont-deserve-the-word-creep/">creep</a></em> I’d become, when I should have at least said, “No way I’m helping,” turned my back, and walked away.</p>
<p>Later, Eileen would praise me as being “so good and helpful” during the scene, and a painful pang would explode in the middle of my chest, the emotional puncture wound in my heart draining it of blood. It would be all I could do to feign another smile.</p>

<p>I had failed by not speaking up. I hated that I participated, and then I started hating myself for participating. And then <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2011/04/20/we-are-all-victims-even-the-revolutionaries/">I hated Eileen, C, and The Professor for being so ignorant</a> of the <a href="http://kinkinexile.wordpress.com/2011/11/25/restless/">societal pressure that had built up against the thing I wanted</a>; for not knowing how long I’d kept a rope coiled under my pillow; for making me <a href="http://www.notjustbitchy.com/?p=169#comment-292">sacrifice my wants for their orgasms—again</a>.</p>
<p>My hate became <a href="http://celebritysubmissive.blogspot.com/2010/12/fury-of-righteous-link-time.html">righteous anger</a>. A few days later, I wrote <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/08/04/what-sexuality-might-taste-like-if-you-were-a-submissive-man-in-2007/">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://maybemaimed.com/2007/08/04/what-sexuality-might-taste-like-if-you-were-a-submissive-man-in-2007/"><p>A lot of things are wrong and were never right; these things have hurt me from the first moment I interacted even remotely sexually with another person, but they are especially painful right now because of a few personal experiences that I’d much rather not go into on such a public forum. I mention that now to tell you, dearest reader, that these things are not solely the belligerent words of an angsty youth. These things <em>do happen</em>. They happen all the time.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>I wanted to write about how submissive men will pretty much always, without fail, lose a race for sexual satisfaction out of any gender/sex/orientation combination you can come up with. Always. I’ve had a sex life that any submissive man you point at would kill to have, yet stick me in a room with other orientations and I’m still the first one sidelined, the last one standing by the fruit punch and chips, so to speak. It’s not like it hasn’t happened before, and it’s certainly going to happen again.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>I’m way too angry […] to make any kind of coherent sense. So like I said, move along, keep channel surfing. There’s nothing to see here that you haven’t seen a million times before.</p></blockquote>
<p>I used to have hope because I couldn’t imagine what it would be like to expect exclusion, to predict <a href="http://days.maybemaimed.com/post/9951118029/on-epistemic-violence-theres-the-power-of-the-threat">ostracization</a>. Then <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2010/10/13/its-not-changing-the-world-thats-hard/">it happened</a> with <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2009/04/01/now-i-remember-why-i-love-and-hate-new-york-citys-bdsm-scene/">such disturbing regularity</a> that <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2009/08/18/there-is-no-bdsm-mecca/">I became unable to imagine</a> what it would be like <em>not</em> to expect exclusion, what it would be like not to be pining for <a href="http://days.maybemaimed.com/post/5906309135/i-thought-this-was-interesting-in-and-of-itself">that unattainable thing forever barricaded on the other side of societal pressures</a>: <em>more—<a href="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/87525962/an-undressed-man-lays-on-a-bed-with-his-hands">play with me more—PLEASE</a></em>. And it doesn’t just happen out there, in the world outside my bedroom, but in here, at the core of <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2009/02/27/8-things-submissive-men-want-from-a-dominant-partner/">my relationships</a>, during all of my sex: every time <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/11/26/while-fucking-i-prefer-to-get-fucked/">one of my well-meaning partners, in their lust, whispers “please fuck me”</a> in my ear.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for <a href="https://twitter.com/maymaym/status/141313107459969024">the calm horror</a> to set in, <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2011/06/02/signal-boost-the-devaluation-of-male-submission/">the realization that I’m broken</a>, and—worse—that everyone I ever love is going to suffer this pain because unless I see them empathize with this misery, I could never feel seen enough to love them.</p>
<p>I tried to maintain the pretense of friendship with The Professor and with C, but I couldn’t. Every innocent remark about playing that night in my apartment punctured my heart all over again. I smiled back at them, and they never seemed to suspect anything amiss. Over time, remarks about that night faded along with their memory of it, but by then their mere proximity—C’s beauty and the marks she loved showing off, The Professor’s suave flirting and his wild stories of the submissive women he was dating—were intolerable because <a href="https://twitter.com/maymaym/status/64108579346583552">my heart never healed</a>. I started avoiding them at parties, declining invitations to events to which they had expressed an interest in attending. I don’t hate them, but I don’t miss them.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Cookie left me a voicemail. She said she was writing a memoir of her coming out to the BDSM Scene, a story that is intricately entangled with my own story of the same, since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/RYGY659LFD6I2/ref=cm_cr_dp_perm?ie=UTF8&#038;ASIN=0826410472&#038;nodeID=283155">her initial exposure not just to the BDSM Scene but to BDSM itself was through me</a>. I told her I had no interest in revisiting the portions of my life with her in it and that she should not contact me unless I chose to contact her again, and good luck on her memoir.</p>
<p>These are some of the earliest people whose stories in my life end with, “<a href="//status.maymay.net/notice/23605">And now we don’t talk to each other anymore</a>.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, sometimes I see their faces when I least want to; Cookie’s, C’s, countless other women I’d seen bottom, their partners’, <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2011/06/07/the-bus-driver-and-the-gadfly-what-my-activism-looks-like-at-bdsm-parties/">the privileged shits, like Cookie’s dom, who thinks I’m “like an annoying five year old” asking too many questions</a>. They were there, all of them, a composite in ghoulish form with that sick, molting flesh and that mean smile on the bondage chair that the PLA Dungeon Crew were moving in front of me: “<a href="//maybemaimed.com/2007/12/24/unwelcome-the-emotional-effects-of-social-injustice/">Displays of privilege unshared are forever painful to the underprivileged</a>.”</p>
<p>I hate bondage furniture. I wish I knew what it was like to be bound to it, and played with in it, and loved in it. But I hate the thought of it now, because I used to love the hope for it.</p>
<p>I hold my hatred close because I loved my hope too hard, and for too long, to be indifferent about wanting to have the kind of sex I want with the people I love. I can’t be indifferent, no matter how often I try to convince myself I’m being petty. Because <a href="http://malesubmissionart.com/post/328542139/a-young-man-reclines-on-a-couch-in-the-sunlight">it’s <em>not</em> petty to want the sex you like with the people you love</a>. <a href="//maybemaimed.com/2011/10/19/non-monogamy-a-human-internet-for-compassionate-payloads/">It’s not a luxury, it’s a necessity</a>.</p>
<p>And that’s <a href="http://days.maybemaimed.com/post/13519572386/this-3-part-venn-diagram-theorizes-sexuality">what The Scene doesn’t want you to know</a>.</p>

I&#8217;ve left a few not-very-deep comments before, but I believe it&#8217;s time to really tell you just how much all you write resonates with me.</p>
<p>I may be a top, dom, whatever you want to call it (I&#8217;m not too hung up on or even that comfortable with the scene labels), but I&#8217;m also a trans man and I desire other men. Submissive men, whom I consider strong and amazing and beautiful and infinitely desirable! (I could indeed start to flatter you here, because add your critical mind and intelligence to the mix and yeah. But that&#8217;s not the point of this comment.)<br />
I see what you describe happen to the men I have loved before (as a woman), I see it now with the men I desire or want. </p>
<p>I also see it mirrored in the way I, too, am undesirable, have long learned to expect rejection and being on the outside because of who I am. The wrong kind of man. Which is where the true parallel becomes clear.</p>
<p>I could rattle a lot on about sexism and gender stereotyping and all the things we both know. I won&#8217;t. As I said, you know and I know. But I want you to know that your blog is very important. Both because critical voices are incredibly valuable, but also because it&#8217;s one of the very few places that have kink as theme where I can see myself reflected in some way. You have also inspired me to question the very things you write about here when I see them. You also give voice to the feelings I share, even if from a slightly different viewpoint. Nevertheless, when you say that &#8220;it is not petty to want the sex you like with the people you love&#8221; then all I can do is nod.<br />
I ended up recently writing a post on my journal called &#8220;Maymay is right&#8221; &#8211; it is locked as I am not comfortable writing all of this in public, not strong enough, perhaps. But should you ever want to read it, I&#8217;ll email you. (I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;d be that interesting to read, after all ;-) So really, don&#8217;t feel obliged in any way! I am serious.) </p>
<p>Most of all, I just wanted you to know that you are also heard and seen and valued out here. Because that&#8217;s the kind of thing I need to know. One of the best responses to the aforementioned post was a friend who wrote &#8220;I hear you and see you and I understand how you feel&#8221;. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to tell you.</p>
<p>PS: &#8216;Creep&#8217; is one of those songs that often echo in my head too. I kind of like it.</p>

I just moved to the Bay Area. On the one hand, I&#8217;d love to get involved with the BDSM scene here.On the other hand, by your account, it&#8217;s loveless. What would you suggest? What do you wish you&#8217;d known at the start of your journey? What would you tell your younger self to avoid the pitfalls and heartbreak you&#8217;ve gone through?</p>

<p>I know how hard it can be to share personal pain so publicly, and I am grateful that you did specifically because so many people stay in the shadows allowing one another to believe they are the only ones.</p>

<p>I feel for you.  I really do.  I, myself, feel like I&#8217;m living off crumbs, wishful thinking, fantasy, and hope . . . and none of it is enough.  And the hope is dying.</p>
<p>I want so much, but it&#8217;s not too much to ask for; it&#8217;s not more than anyone asks for.  It just isn&#8217;t there.  A combination of my small-town &#8220;scene,&#8221; my natural introversion, my mental illness, my lack of emotional spoons, means it may never be there.  I&#8217;m so lonely.  And I hate that anyone, anywhere, has to feel the same way.</p>
<p>I am so sorry, MayMay.  I am so fucking sorry.  And I don&#8217;t say that with pity, but in sympathy, and that kind of love one orphan must always feel for another, the solidarity of wolves in the same trap.</p>
<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t alone&#8221; is something I hear often in relation to my own issues, when I discuss them online.  It is cold comfort at best, but it&#8217;s what I have to give.</p>
<p>I often hear &#8220;Your words have made a difference to me&#8221; too, and that&#8217;s also a comfort, not as cold.  It doesn&#8217;t put something beautiful in my hands, it doesn&#8217;t give me anything to hurt and cherish, but it&#8217;s good to know that maybe I&#8217;ve drawn some of the pain from another&#8217;s wounds, even if I can&#8217;t heal my own.  And that is something you have done for me.  You helped me realize what I am.  What I am isn&#8217;t really a happy thing to be, much of the time, but I am infinitely better for knowing this part of me, for finally being able to see it.</p>
<p>Thank you.  And I am so sorry.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still crying.  The part with the single tail . . . yeah.  Crying.</p>

<p>However, my comment turned out so long and my musings started to talk more about me than about you&#8230; Because you make me think.</p>
<p>And so I turned my first comment into a blog entry of my own: <a href="http://sexualramblings.blogspot.com/2011/12/this-started-out-as-comment-answering.html" rel="nofollow">http://sexualramblings.blogspot.com/2011/12/this-started-out-as-comment-answering.html</a></p>

Integrity can be relentlessly painful. Honesty can be so isolating. And leadership is often lonely. Your writing models to me how I feel about many things in a surgically precise, unyieldingly accurate show of cold and painful awareness. Sometimes I wish badly to slip already into a blissful stupor of stupid abandon, even for a short second or two, just enough to stop the pain, but I can&#8217;t shake the awareness&#8230; Not yet, anyway. I have known for a long time how much you ache in your apparent intelligence and integrity, and it is as heartbreaking, as it is comforting to know that you CAN process it all after all, despite the challenging pain. And you must know that while your struggle is yours and very real, there is plenty of real love of other kinds for you. Thanks for your inspiring courage, which, as many who respond to you here prove, is helpful to many.</p>

Denying our authentic sexuality and minimising our dsires under social pressure is something I&#8217;d imagine most of us with invisible sexualities have done at some or many points in our lives. It&#8217;s good to see the effects articulated.</p>

Particularly posts like this. I too am crying at reading this particular post because it is exactly how I feel. I&#8217;m a female top but it is, I fear the same. the isolation, the desperation, the lonliness, the need for love and nourishment and just to know that someone else understands you and compliments you in a way that is true and kind and loving. Needing basic human connection in a way that makes you feel strong and alive and edified and not being able to find it because the scene chooses to ignore it, scaring away people or making them turn away in horror. And, as a dominant woman, I am so angry that you feel this way, that the scene for all that it is allegedly worth treats you like this, because, as you well know, as I have read on your blog over and over, when your sexuality is devalued then my sexuality is devalued and it is shit, I know how you feel. I cry and think that I too, am broken and that no man will want me. But, thank you for sharing your pain because I still believe that if you kick and fight and shout and buzz around long enough then things will get better. When I first realised I might be kinky and toppy, about 5 years ago there was barely anything for girls like me. And now there is a small, but growing community of people online who talk and debate and fight against the cliches of the scene and who have taught me and made me laugh and cry and, ultimately comfortable and gradually, I&#8217;m starting to feel pride in my sexuality. You&#8217;re one of the biggest influences on my thinking because your words cut to my cliched core, they really do. So thank you for everything, I wish you didn&#8217;t hurt. </p>

I read this and it made me want to hit something. As a female switch, I have topped and bottomed, and there are few things more gratifying than the trust that comes when you willingly place your body in someone&#8217;s hands, or when someone places their body in yours. Submission is a beautiful, scary, powerful gift to be given. It takes an immense strength and power to really go deep with someone and submit completely, and how could anyone not realize that?</p>
<p>I guess what I mean to say is that you, and what you are offering, you are valuable and amazing and you have so much courage to keep trying even after experiences like this. I hope you find someone who realizes how brave you are.</p>

<p>As a Dominant, I require a submissive to fully expressive that part of myself.  Many male and female dominants do *prefer* submissive men as partners. It&#8217;s a complementary set: Dominant &amp; submissive, salt &amp; pepper, shoes &amp; socks, sweet &amp; sour.</p>
<p>As spiritual beings having human experiences, we are imperfect.  Our personal moods and disappointments color our view and cloud our judgement at times. </p>
<p>Submissive men are an integral part of the BDSM scene and I, for one, value them.</p>

MayMay, here&#8217;s hoping that the dark times are only temporary, and that the future holds more love, more openness, and more joy.</p>

I&#8217;ve always been so moved by your writing and your passionate dedication to what you want to see changed.  And it feels awful to know, over and over, that your and other submissive men&#8217;s experiences in the scene have been so horrible.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started sort of seeing a submissive man recently who is in therapy in part because he thought he must be trans, because the things he wanted and the behaviors he favored were not things he saw in the larger culture as acceptable for a man.  Thanks in part to you, he has changed his label on Fetlife from GQ to M, because of realizing that he is a man, and wanting to be a part of the movement that shows other possibilities for men, instead of having to come up with some new category.  Your work continues to inspire.  I just wish you didn&#8217;t have to pay for it with so much pain.</p>
<p>And I wish, too, that I could personally bring to you some of that touch, and play, and healing that you talk about <a href="http://maybemaimed.com/2011/03/10/its-foggy-today-how-bdsm-and-sex-can-be-emotional-self-medication-in-a-cruel-world/" rel="nofollow">in this post</a>.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always wanted to tell you that I find you beautiful, and compelling, and that I&#8217;d happily play with you if I ever had the courage to ask, or felt that you wouldn&#8217;t see it as a cheap offering.  When I finally met you, I didn&#8217;t even know how to begin to bridge that gap.  </p>
<p>I doubt that that helps, either, but I just wanted to tell you.  Because you deserve so much better than you&#8217;re getting.  Love, and play, and everything good.</p>
<p>Sorry if this comment is completely incoherent.  My head is full of phlegm.  But my heart is full of love.</p>

And I&#8217;m a guy who admires you a lot and probably agrees with 90 percent of what you write. And you&#8217;ve been sexually successful (at least as far as your submissive parts) in ways I&#8217;ve never been.<br />
I also see you are traveling and might not read this for a long time if ever -and hell, I&#8217;ll probably at least send some $ your way.<br />
And I definately know your pain to an extent. I wasn&#8217;t even as popular as a normal kid in HS, I never fit in with ANY clique. And when I first got into BDSM I thought I was a male submissive. I was shy and awkward. Add the fact this was the early to mid 90&#8242;s, I was poor and for most of that time I had no internet, so there WAS no dissenting voice. None at all.</p>
<p>Did I experience the rejection in the BDSM world that you talk about often here? Did I wish that more people would fucking touch, or hell play with me? Yes, I did. Did I feel the disdain, condescension, PITY even that you have so often felt? Yes. I suffered a lot and spent tons of tears. Tears alone, tears I could shed to only myself and tell to no one, not friends, not family.</p>
<p>But for all that, I think time has taught me some wisdom that seems lacking to you in this post. Now maybe I&#8217;m misunderstanding, and if so, I apologize but there&#8217;s two things that it seems to me that you assume in this post that dehumanize the other people in your life:</p>
<p>1. You seem to assume that sexuality is malleable and should always be abrogated to your moral choices. Like it was somehow WRONG that the Professor, Eileen, C, all of them were enjoying a type of sexual play that you could not.<br />
2. When the Professor invited you to join in the play , you kept your reservations to yourself and went along. Then you appeared to be helping the scene along and were so good at it that NONE of the three friends of yours picked up on your resentment and pain. You failed to speak up and make your needs/desires known and then you punish your friends for not being mind/heart readers and not playing in a way that you felt was enjoyable to you.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve also got this terrible habit of thinking that its somehow wrong that there should be a &#8220;majority&#8221; sexuality, as if somehow the fact that there aren&#8217;t the same number of images of male subs as female subs in highly popular venues is a crime against humanity.  This criticism does not invalidate all your legitimate concerns about the practically compulsory sexual practices at many popular playspaces or the many other issues (such as how submissive men are portrayed in popular sexual media etc) you&#8217;ve brought up. But you demand something from people that I think is impossible when you try to colonize their sexual space for your own ends to fit strictly personal ideological and sexual goals.</p>
<p>I feel you are a good guy who has and will do much good in the world, but there&#8217;s a part of you that is fascist /entitled in its own right and that part is dangerous and often counterproductive. I don&#8217;t feel you were a very good friend to the three people in this story based on the fact that you felt it a good practice to hold unexpressed grudges against them, and to be fair, I&#8217;d be scared shitless if I was a Domme and was your sexual partner because I don&#8217;t know if I would be able to trust you to make your limits and wants known.</p>

I wish that I didn&#8217;t have to be the one to respond to it, because frankly I haven&#8217;t the emotional stamina to handle it. Your comment angered me because it is reminder of how much <em>time</em> I need to effect the change I want.</p>
<p>More specifically, you reveal enough about yourself to inform me that you are probably older than I am and have had similar experiences without so much as the flimsy support structures I had access to:</p>
<blockquote cite="#comment-294061"><p>[Y]ou’ve been sexually successful (at least as far as your submissive parts) in ways I’ve never been.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>[W]hen I first got into BDSM I thought I was a male submissive. I was shy and awkward. Add the fact this was the early to mid 90′s, I was poor and for most of that time I had no internet, so there WAS no dissenting voice. None at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a way, I&#8217;m lucky that I came &#8220;of age&#8221; after you. Your misunderstanding—to put it diplomatically—about me is therefore not &#8220;your fault,&#8221; but it still stings to hear because it reminds me that older self-identified submissive men are arguably the worst possible allies that I have.</p>
<p>In other words: The fruits of my work will not fully blossom until enough time passes for older people, like you, to die. And for my own sake, I hope that time comes swiftly, since I haven&#8217;t the patience, energy, nor inclination to continually try to make myself legible to people like you who seem so thoroughly resigned to the status quo. Your very existence is stop energy and I currently see no use for the presence of people who say things like what you said in your comment.</p>
<blockquote cite="#comment-294061"><p>Now maybe I’m misunderstanding, and if so, I apologize</p></blockquote>
<p>I accept your apology. You&#8217;re forgiven, but I&#8217;ll never forget you said what you did.</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<blockquote cite="#comment-294061"><p>I feel you are a good guy who has and will do much good in the world, but there’s a part of you that is fascist /entitled in its own right and that part is dangerous and often counterproductive. I don’t feel you were a very good friend to the three people in this story based on the fact that you felt it a good practice to hold unexpressed grudges against them, and to be fair, I’d be scared shitless if I was a Domme and was your sexual partner because I don’t know if I would be able to trust you to make your limits and wants known.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fuck you. Seriously, that&#8217;s possibly the most obvious case of internalizing repressive bullshit I&#8217;ve ever read. That you try to dress up your stop energy in fancy language about &#8220;being a good friend&#8221; is a misdirection that may catch a lot of people off guard, but not me.</p>
<p>I have <em>zero</em> obligation to be a &#8220;good friend&#8221; to anyone. I have an obligation to respect others humanity, but that is a very different thing. And I even went further than that in my post:</p>
<blockquote><p>I started avoiding them at parties, declining invitations to events to which they had expressed an interest in attending. I don’t hate them, but I don’t miss them.</p></blockquote>
<p>So fuck you and your attempt to hide behind narrow-minded accusations of sexual colonialism.</p>
<p><ins datetime="2012-02-11T00:34:28+00:00">Oh, and also, you&#8217;re right that I didn&#8217;t have the ability to make my limits and wants known in 2007, when this story took place. But I&#8217;m not who I was in 2007, and I&#8217;ve put a lot of work into making my limits and wants known, and even beyond that, I&#8217;m now aware of how many people aren&#8217;t even given <em>the opportunity to explore</em> their limits and wants. That&#8217;s why it took me five years (and that&#8217;s actually surprisingly quickly) to find my voice about all this. So I don&#8217;t appreciate the implied dismissal of the work of self-reflection I&#8217;ve put into being able to articulate my limits and wants. And since you&#8217;re not a play partner of mine, <a href="http://kinkinexile.wordpress.com/2011/11/07/competence/" rel="nofollow">fuck you for assuming that I&#8217;m uncommunicative about those things to those people I <em>do</em> choose to play with</a>.</ins></p>
<p>That said, you&#8217;re forgiven. And so you know, I&#8217;m choosing right now to send your future comments on this post into the trash bin. I&#8217;m uninterested in hearing from you again about this matter.</p>
<p>Thanks for whatever material support you choose to offer me. (Really.) But I want you and everyone else who may read this to know that being offered money won&#8217;t soften me. Ever. I don&#8217;t give a shit about money, I only care about making a future where the kind of oppressive &#8220;politeness&#8221; you seem to believe is an obligation is deemed laughable because it&#8217;s immediately recognized as the abusive silencing tactic that it is.</p>

<p>like the first commenter i am trans; i have been unplayed-with, and had to accept such situations, in group situations; this has been the exception and not the norm; but it is always remembered. like you i am a rare flavor &amp; i wish i were not. i&#8217;d like to be the very most popular flavor around, but honestly many people haven&#8217;t got a taste for me. like ice cream, i&#8217;ve got the peanut butter and chocolate and carmel. And I attract people who like the peanut butter or the chocolate or the carmel but only rarely and preciously all three together, without fetishization.</p>

This is far from the first piece to elicit an emotional response from me, but it&#8217;s the first that caused me to pause in the midst of reading so I could get hold of my sympathy and general upset before finishing the article. I can&#8217;t *not* comment. Your hurt (even though it&#8217;s years past) hit me on a visceral level that continues to ache.</p>
<p>No one is perfect or infallible or incapable of misreading or not noticing another person&#8217;s reactions, so it&#8217;s not my place to vilify the other people who were involved. I can&#8217;t even guarantee I wouldn&#8217;t make the same mistake (though I certainly hope I wouldn&#8217;t), as I&#8217;m regrettably human. But I hurt for you as I read this. Not as a dominant woman (who gets to live through her own consequences of not fitting the patriarchal, heteronormative, socialized-gender-norms rulebook), but simply as a fellow human being. I&#8217;m so very sorry for the hurt this caused you and the marks it left.</p>

<p>I respect that kink is kind of like ice cream and people are allowed to like different flavors of it.  Some people aren&#8217;t wired to like your flavor and that is okay.  But there are people whose flavor you definitely are.</p>

I needed to read this. Reading this opened my eyes, gave me an interpretation I&#8217;ve never heard from the mouth of a submissive man. I know someone who feels this way, I just couldn&#8217;t figure out that this is what he was feeling until reading your story. I&#8217;ve been looking for days for an answer and stumbling across this was what I needed. Thank you for being able to express your fear, anger and pain. I wish you all the best and sincerely hope you are being given the kind of love you deserve.</p>

Capitalist jobs—including sex work—are premised on the scarcity of a thing. The thing that’s scarce for your particular clients might be “access to partnered sex,” or something else, but regardless of what it is, if the thing they lack is a thing they want that you have, you have a power over them.
