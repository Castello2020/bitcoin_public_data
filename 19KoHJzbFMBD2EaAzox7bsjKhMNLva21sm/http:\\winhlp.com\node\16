<p><a href="/node/96">Result statistics</a>&#151;please report your results.</p>
<h1><a id="The_Problem" name="The_Problem">The Problem</a></h1>
<h2>General</h2>
<p>The system tray (in short: systray, nowadays also called taskbar notification area) 
is the icon strip normally located near the right end of the task bar, next to 
the clock.</p>
<p>Some Windows XP installations show a peculiar defect in that some systray icons 
disappear or, rather, do not appear, when the system is booted and the user logs 
on. The problem is even more prevalent on systems with autologon. The most frequently 
affected icons seem to be the speaker icon (sound volume) and the power/energy 
icon.</p>
<p>Please note that the problem has been completely solved. You can find the solution in the next chapter, <a href="#Main_problem_and_complete_solution">Main problem and complete solution</a>.
<h2>Hide inactive icons</h2>
</p><p>This has nothing to do with the hide inactive icons settings. The defect shows 
up when you don't have any icons set for hiding.</p>
<p>In any case, please make sure for now that you haven't activated that setting. 
Right-click the task bar, click on Properties, uncheck the last check box. You 
can reactivate it later if all other problems are identified or solved.</p>
<p>In Vista, if the Clock, Network, Volume and Power icons have disappeared and
when you go into properties on the taskbar and look at "System Icons" under the
"Notification Area" tab, Volume, Network, and Power are greyed out, then visit
<a href="http://www.paulsxp.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=152">Paul's Forum</a>
and run his fixing program.</p>
<p>2006-08-14 â Glenn S. reminds us that, if other icons disappear for good and 
never reappear, we should check first whether the programs are started at all.</p>
<p>Check your Startup folder and the starter registry entries through Start, Run..., 
type: msconfig, press Enter, to check whether the programs are really started 
at system start, or use Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) to see whether the processes 
are running.</p>
<h2>Sound volume</h2>
<p>A particular and special problem is that only the sound volume icon disappears, 
but the others are there. In this case the main solutions below will not work. 
Instead you have to look at the sound driver. Try to reinstall it. But first read 
the chapter &quot;Other known causes&quot; further below for some specific symptoms and 
solutions.</p>
<h2>Task Manager</h2>
<p>There are a few other problems that can cause similar behavior and can mislead 
you into believing that they are the same problem. If you are not sure, read the 
entire article first, because a few more are described later. The ones concerning 
Task Manager are described in the next chapter, because they can be too easily 
mistaken for the main problem described in the other chapters.</p>
<h2>Entire taskbar</h2>
<p>If, however, your entire taskbar or any major part of it is missing altogether, 
then the rest of this article is irrelevant to you. Instead the Kelly's Korner 
tool <a href="http://www.kellys-korner-xp.com/taskbarplus!.htm">Taskbar Plus!</a> 
may or may not help you. I don't know what exactly it does and can only recommend 
to use it carefully and to use only the function that pertains to solve your immediate 
problem, then test the result.</p>
<h2>UPnP and some general remarks</h2>
<p>Often, but not always, the phenomenon of the missing systray icons seems to be
triggered by the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/expert/crawford_02july22.mspx">
UPnP</a> User Interface, but more on that later. (By the way, don't mistake
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/expert/crawford_02july22.mspx">
UPnP</a> for <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/plug_and_play.html">PnP</a>, 
Plug-n-Play, which is mostly a different thing.)</p>
<p>Microsoft has not taken notice. The causes are obscure. Some users report successes 
with various changes that influence the boot and logon timing, but these changes 
do not reliably solve the problem. Often they make the problem occur less often 
though and make it bearable.</p>
<p>Be careful not to be fooled by others or by your own brain that may see causality 
where there is none. People try the weirdest things, then they get all their icons 
and conclude sharply, but wrongly, that whatever they did solved the problem. 
About the weirdest and totally wrong recommendation I have seen was to switch 
off your computer and let it sit without power for three hours. Don't fall into 
such a trap. The web has a lot of snake oil, particularly in relation to the problem 
of the disappearing systray icons.</p>
<p>Then there is the fact that some change solves the problem, just by changing 
the boot and logon process sequence or timing a little bit. Thus I receive hundreds 
of emails, detailing ever more different solutions to the problem, each of which 
has been tried and worked on one computer. We have to suspect that each of these 
many solutions works only on a few computers. If defragmenting the hard disk can 
solve the problem for some, then anything can solve it, and the solution may not 
be long-lived either.</p>
<h1><a id="Main_problem_and_complete_solution">Main problem and complete solution</a></h1>
<p>2010-10-09 &ndash; <a href="/user/3651">nars</a> has posted a <a href="#comment-2246">patcher tool</a> (<a href="http://nars.aloj.net/download/shell32patch.zip">direct download link</a>, also attached hereâsee below) that solves the problem even for future versions and makes patching very easy and quick. Thanks a lot, <a href="/user/3651">nars</a>!</p>
<p>The main cause of the more common problem is that the systray program 
is temporarily unable to process icon inclusion requests. An earlier 
hypothesis, that systray.exe is loaded too late, has been refuted by Thomas 
Gregory Platt (see his email below).</p>
<p>According to the excellent analysis in the
<a href="/node/16#comment-406">Problem analysis and proposed solution</a> comment by
<a href="/user/868" title="View user profile.">tasmanian</a> this is caused by a timing
defect in the Windows function Shell_NotifyIcon in shell32.dll, which has a timeout fixed
at 4 seconds. Combined with an unfavorable Windows API message this causes the
problem, which befalls many heavily loaded computers that don't have ultra-fast hard
disks. Changing the timeout to one minute and removing the unwanted message solves
the problem, and in the <a href="/node/16#comment-822">Complete solution</a> comment user <a href="/user/1618" title="View user profile.">depassp</a> has perfected the
procedure of patching shell32.dll to solve the problem, at least until a new version of
that DLL is delivered by Microsoft that re-introduces the problem and requires another
patch session. In fact, exactly this has happened around July 2010, but the solution is already here: <a href="#comment-2155">Offsets for NEW 6.0.2900.6018 file</a> by <a href="/user/3428">mcrealize</a>, corrected by <a href="/user/3466">TeaRex</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately patching a system DLL is not an entirely simple procedure and can only be done with a certain minimum of computer handling experience, but this is the best we can offer for now.</p>
<h1><a id="Task_Manager_problems" name="Task_Manager_problems">Task Manager problems</a></h1>
<p>A few special problems concern the Task Manager and its systray icon only, 
the green one that dynamically shows the CPU load. If your problem is the disappearing 
Task Manager icon, then read on. If, however, other systray icons disappear as 
well, then you should first skip this chapter and continue with the next.</p>
<p>Mike Newhall contributed the following information on 2005-12-10. Thanks a 
lot, Mike!</p>
<p>One problem is the disappearance of the Task Manager systray symbol when you 
start Task Manager the second time or subsequent times.</p>
<p>This problem appears to be related to the Classic desktop theme. When you change 
your desktop to the XP style, the problem no longer occurs. Do this for a test.</p>
<p>The cause is as yet unknown. The simplest workaround is to never close Task 
Manger.</p>
<p>Another problem is that the icon or the entire Task Manager never appears at 
all. This can be caused by a registry setting that is not present in a default 
installation:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER<br />
&nbsp;\Software<br />
&nbsp; \Microsoft<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; \Windows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \CurrentVersion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \Policies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \System<br />
&quot;DisableTaskMgr&quot;=dword:00000001</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can set this value to zero or, to recreate the default situation, remove 
the value entirely. To have the value removed automatically,
<a href="/tools/task_manager_enable.reg">click here</a> and give permission when 
asked.</p>
<p>In fact, the entire System key does not exist in a default installation, so 
you can even delete that key if you are sure there's nothing in it that you need.</p>
<h1><a id="Two_simple_workarounds" name="Two_simple_workarounds">Two simple workarounds</a></h1>
<p>If any of these solve your problem,
<a href="/node/96">please report here</a>.</p>
<h2>Log off, log on again</h2>
<p>Now we're getting back to the main problem, the sporadic missing of various 
icons, particularly after the first logon after booting. Typically missing are 
the power icon or the sound volume icon, but many others can be affected just 
as well.</p>
<p>The immediate workaround is to log off and log on again (do not reboot, only 
log off). In many cases the icons then reappear. If not, you can try to repeat 
the procedure until you have all of them.</p>
<p>If this works, then most likely you have the central problem described in this 
article.</p>
<h2>Wait a minute!</h2>
<p>The other workaround is, the next time you boot your computer, wait for a full 
minute after the logon dialog appears or, better, watch the hard disk light and 
wait until disk activity subsides entirely for at least 5 seconds. Only then log 
on and check whether this solves your problem.</p>
<p>On two of my computers this solves the problem entirely, even though other 
workarounds, like the systray_cleanup.reg file mentioned below, don't work. This 
also means that you have to log on as quickly as possible when you're trying to 
test other workarounds.</p>
<p>2006-02-03 â Eric Maier mentioned that you can only delay the logon when you 
have at least two active user profiles to log on to, or one with a password. If 
you have neither, the logon prompt wouldn't appear, and there would be no delay.</p>
<p>And, as a final remark, retest from time to time whether the problem has
disappeared on its own, particularly after installing a service pack.</p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold">Some excerpts from the many earlier mails I have received (for later responses see <a href="#Comments_vote">Comments, vote</a> below)</p>
  <p>Wow, after over a year of having this problem. And general 
  slow/buggy operation of winxp. I finally reinstalled, only to have the same 
  problem on a clean machine (made even worse by SP2 this time). Weeks of steady 
  research into this problem and I came across your page ... I disabled upnp almost 
  2 weeks ago and have had no problems with my computer since. This has solved 
  strange out of memory errors, dialog boxes missing buttons, and many other strange 
  issues. I don't know why it happens on my particular hardware, and the solution 
  does not make _any_ sense, but it solved it.</p>
  <p>I have tried virtually every so-called &quot;fix&quot; I could find online, 
  and NONE of them worked, until today, when someone pointed me to your site. 
  I tried the &quot;uninstall the UPnP User Interface&quot; fix, and am happy to report 
  that it worked. All tray icons appeared on reboot.<br />
  I have had an ongoing dialogue with Microsoft Tech Support about this situation, 
  and they seem absolutely clueless. Needless to say, my next email to them will 
  report the fix.</p>
  <p>Thanks for the very helpful and time saving article I found 
  on the internet</p>
  <p>Amazing that the solution from Francesco Saverio Ostuni, such 
  an obscure and seemingly unrelated setting would restore the icons to the system 
  tray. My hat is off to him.<br />
  Now if only the setting to hide inactive icons would work I would be pleased 
  indeed.<br />
  Thank you for helping to save what little hair I have.</p>
  <p>Thank you so much for your web page on solving the disappearing 
  system tray icons problem. I've looked all over the internet for advice on how 
  to solve the problem and what you wrote was the only thing I found that worked!</p>
  <p>I am very glad to read your article concerning the Systray 
  problem. I have been struggling with exactly the same problem for long and Microsoft 
  could not get at any reasonable solution.<br />
  On the net ... I found the trick removing &quot;UPnP User Interface&quot; from Windows 
  Components and and that worked perfect: everything in the Systray is now in 
  perfect order.</p>
  <p>UPnP worked for me! Thanks to all. It was driving me crazy 
  ...</p>
  <p>The Ostuni Workaround<br />
  Worked fine on a quite a few ( ~ 10 ) Dell GX110's with AC97 audio, we use at 
  work - Thanks for posting this info</p>
  <p>This article was a relief to me - I thought I was the only 
  one suffering from &quot;disappearing icons&quot;.</p>
  <p>After years of having my systray icons disappear and playing 
  with very limited success with msconfig, disabling services and re-installing 
  apps and numerous rebuildsâ¦â¦.<br />
  I tried the Ostuni Workaround, and all of my icons instantly came back and are 
  now stable !!!!<br />
  Very happy !</p>
  <p>The UPnP suggestion worked for me, amazingly. I have no idea 
  how something so seemingly unrelated could cause such an annoying and difficult 
  to diagnose problem, but many thanks for posting this info on your site!</p>
  <p>Great! This problem was driving me crazy since over one year 
  and most people didn&#39;t even understand what the issue was. Now it works perfectly 
  and I&#39;m really grateful for this tip! Thanks a lot.</p>
  <p>This problem has been bugging me off and on for many months, 
  and none of my computer savvy friends and associates could offer any practical 
  solutions (I figured FDISK was a bit over the top). However, a Google search 
  brought up about 352,000 hits - and yours was the second.<br />
  I applied the Ostuni Workaround this evening and my errant icons have returned. 
  Many thanks to all contributors.</p>
  <p>Thanks for putting together this page. The Ostuni Workaround 
  lives up to the hype. You've ended months of frustration and computer problems!</p>
  <p>Thanks for your article on this, tried the Ostuni method and 
  it totally resolved my missing icons on reboot. Many reboots later no more missing 
  icons. Quite brilliant.</p>
  <p>I want to thank you for your website and the solution to my 
  missing systray icons. It is a very rare occasion that I google to an immediate 
  solution (you were number one using &quot;systray icon missing&quot;!). Usually these 
  sort of problems are a month long search.<br />
  For the record, the UPnP solution worked ... and brought back the speaker icon 
  as well! This was on a Gateway P4 laptop.<br />
  I like people that help others. You just saved my Saturday so I can have fun.<br />
  Thanks again.</p>
  <p>very very useful<br />
  worked first time<br />
  ? why has microsoft not fixed disappearing icons in one of their many sp's and 
  upgrades</p>
  <p>Tried the Ostuni Workaround, so far it's solved the problem.<br />
  My god man, THANK YOU for providing this information. I was about ready to do 
  like that duck with the hammer you always see on people's desks...</p>
  <p>Man, if I hadn't found your site I would have gone crazy over 
  this. It's the most anoying I've ever experienced.<br />
  But then I found your site and <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold">The Ostuni Workaround</span><br />
  I have never been happier in my life (well thats not entierly true), but anyway 
  it works fine!<br />
  Thanks for a great site!</p>
  <p>The Ostuni workaround is awesome. I have been trying to figure 
  this out for ages, since I had XP home and it seems to have carried over to 
  XP Pro and it is so annoying. I love having a full system tray, and now with 
  this somewhat fix, it has worked for me!! Like a dream come true, :-)<br />
  Thanks So Much, [...]<br />
  P.S. It works, it really really works!! ;)</p>
  <p>Many thanks for this. The Ostuni workaround worked for me. 
  It was driving me crazy! Great help!!!!</p>
  <p>The Ostuni Workaround did work for me 100%. I had that problem 
  for months and it was getting worse â¦ finally decided to try to fix it today 
  and found your page â¦ my 10 icons are now showing up at every reboot.<br />
  Thank you very much for your page!</p>
  <p>My good-man Hans,<br />
  I want to thank you so much for having this page online! I was getting so annoyed 
  about those missing icons in the system tray. I used <span style="font-weight: bold">The 
  Ostuni Workaround</span> simply by going to My Network Places and then clicking 
  on Hide UPnP Devices. A simple restart and everything was there. Normally I 
  had to kill the 'missing-icon' programs and restart them. And some of them you 
  can't kill with Task Manager, e.g. ZoneAlarm Pro v6.1.737 [zlclient.exe]. Or 
  another trick I did was logging off and back on. Most of the time it restored 
  all icons, but not always. So:<br />
  Thank you so much! You really made my day.</p>
  <p>I've tried the systray.reg script and the vbs hack that 
  delays the startup to avoid &quot;unable to create shell notification icon&quot; error. 
  Both tricks seem to have worked just fine!<br />
  The systray.reg has restored the always missing volume icon as well as the occasionally 
  missing outlook icon (outlook is started automatically &quot;minimized to tray&quot; on 
  system startup).<br />
  The delay trick works excellent with Asus Probe.<br />
  This is absolutely brilliant!<br />
  Thanks a lot!</p>

<h2>The Ostuni Workaround</h2>
<p>2004-11-11 â Francesco Saverio Ostuni wrote: &quot;... I found a solution for me 
that works perfectly. I simply went to My network Places and on the left pane 
I chose to Hide
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/expert/crawford_02july22.mspx">
UPnP</a> devices. This operation does not disable the service (which I need).&quot;</p>
<p>To see this choice, you have to have Tools, Folder Options, Show Common Tasks 
selected.</p>
<p>This is still one of the most successful and not very intrusive workarounds, 
so you could try it first. I keep getting emails stating that the Ostuni Workaround 
worked well and solved the problem.</p>
<p>See also the subchapter on some more details below.</p>
<h2>Cleaning up the registry</h2>
<p>The following text contains links to registry setting files, which, except 
for the first one, are a bit stronger than the straight Ostuni workaround. If 
you want to check what they do before actually applying them, you can right-click 
on the link and elect to save the file to your hard disk. Then you can open it 
with a text editor like the Windows notepad editor and see what they do.</p>
<p>After two emails (see emails from Mark Medrano and Ingo Schupp below), the 
suspicion grows that the PastIconsStream registry entry can grow beyond proportions 
and hinder the systray icons. The solution is to click on
<a href="/tools/systray_cleanup.reg">systray_cleanup.reg</a>, confirm the execution, 
then confirm the registry change, <span style="font-weight: bold">reboot your computer</span> 
and test.</p>
<p>These registry entries can safely be deleted, because Windows automatically 
recreates them after the next two reboots. By the way, this registry file does 
about the same as running systray.reg and then systray_undo.reg (see below).</p>
<p>2007-01-16 â Thanks to Haris J. S. for the following information: This and 
the fixes below reset the inactive icons timers, so for some time like a week 
or two there will be no inactive icons. They will come back later on their own.</p>
<h2>More radical: stop UPnP services</h2>
<p>If the workarounds described don't work for you for any reason, read on. Before 
we go into the details, if you still want a quick solution and don't mind that 
a few settings, including any Explorer policies, are reset to their defaults, 
you can click on <a href="/tools/systray.reg">systray.reg</a>, confirm the execution, 
then confirm the registry change, <span style="font-weight: bold">reboot your computer</span> 
and test. Unlike the softer Ostuni workaround this disables both services, SSDP 
and
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/expert/crawford_02july22.mspx">
UPnP</a>, altogether and also cleans up the registry as described above. Since 
the Windows Media Player network sharing service depends on the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/expert/crawford_02july22.mspx">
UPnP</a> service, it also gets stopped, so if you need that, you cannot use this 
workaround.</p>
<p>If this still doesn't cut the bill, you can try this stronger one:
<a href="/tools/systray_plus.reg">systray_plus.reg</a>, and again confirm, reboot, 
and test. However, the old poll results show that few users actually did this successfully,
so we may consider this workaround undesirable and not waste time on it. I leave it here
just in case somebody wants to experiment with it.</p>
<p>You need to do this only once. The changed registry settings are permanent, 
until you undo them.</p>
<p>If none of the above works for you or if you later need the UPnP services, 
you can undo the nonstandard changes and reset them to their defaults with
<a href="/tools/systray_undo.reg">systray_undo.reg</a>, but note that any previously 
removed non-standard settings, like Explorer policies, cannot be reinstated. In 
a normal installation there shouldn't be any such settings. A reboot is again 
required to make the change effective.</p>
<p>If you've tried these, <a href="/node/96">please report here</a>
which one worked or didn't work for you. Please try them in the order below, like this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Apply the file by double-clicking on it and giving permission for the change.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Reboot</span>, log on.</li>
  <li>Check whether all icons are there.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please test more than just once if the problem is sporadic. It is important 
for all of us to also learn which one didn't work.</p>
<p>Results from since 2006-11-10:</p>
<ul>
  <li>systray_cleanup.reg : 16</li>
  <li>systray.reg : 13 (earlier reports: 26)</li>
  <li>systray_plus.reg : 1 (earlier reports: 3)</li>
  <li>neither, i.e. both failed : 0 (earlier reports: 1)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to know what these files do or if you just want to keep them, you 
can store them by right-clicking on the above links and choose to save the target 
on your computer. Then you can open each file with the Notepad editor (Open with 
...) and, if you like, make the registry changes by hand. They do a bit more than 
what is described below. The minus signs in the files indicate deletions.</p>
<h2>A new program</h2>
<p>Alex Milner has written the new program
<a href="http://am.vghost.ru/TrayIconsOK.zip">TrayIconsOK!</a>, downloadable from
<a href="http://am.vghost.ru/">http://am.vghost.ru/</a>, which purportedly solves 
the problem permanently (but not the sound volume problem). Thanks, Alex! The 
program delays desktop loading by some adjustable seconds, and that seems to do 
the trick for many installations, but not for all.</p>
<p>This is shareware with a single-digit $ price. The unregistered version is 
fully functional for 30 days and has a nag screen. You can test it thoroughly 
before having to pay up.</p>
<p>If you've tried this program, <a href="/node/96">please report here</a>
if it worked for you. Older results of 2007-02-06 to 2007-07-21:</p>

<h2>The Diez Workaround</h2>
<p>2006-06-30 â Steve Kreideweiss wrote from Cairns, Australia: &quot;I tested the 
tip from Jose Luis Diez setting SSDP and UpnP to Automatic. This seems to work 
fine for me as well. I was wondering why it was on Manual at all?&quot;</p>
<p>So please read the hint from Jose Luis Diez below or just read on. Apparently 
this changes the boot and logon timing enough on some computers to make things 
work. On one of my computers just setting the SSDP service start type to automatic 
did actually solve the problem.</p>
<p>Here's the quick way to test it. Click on the desired setting, then confirm 
as often as needed, then <span style="font-weight: bold">reboot</span> and test.</p>
<p>Change settings to automatic:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/tools/ssdp_automatic.reg">ssdp_automatic.reg</a> (test this first)</li>
  <li><a href="/tools/upnp_automatic.reg">upnp_automatic.reg</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Change them back to their default setting of manual:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/tools/ssdp_manual.reg">ssdp_manual.reg</a></li>
  <li><a href="/tools/upnp_manual.reg">upnp_manual.reg</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You have to <span style="font-weight: bold">reboot</span> each time to apply the settings 
and test.
</p><p>If any variant of the Diez workaround solved your problem,
<a href="/node/96">please report here</a>.</p>
<p>Emails received before 2007-07-21:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ssdp_automatic.reg â 3 successes, 1 failure</li>
  <li>Both â 2 successes, 3 failures</li>

<h2>More details of the Ostuni Workaround</h2>
<p>Francesco Ostuni further mentioned that the same can be done through Control 
Panel, Add or Remove Programs, on the left side: Add/Remove Windows components; 
select Networking Services, click on the Details... button, remove the checkmark 
for the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/expert/crawford_02july22.mspx">
UPnP</a> User Interface, then click on OK. The result is the same. Now the icons 
are back every time at each reboot.</p>
<p>This has meanwhile been confirmed by many other users and consistently kept 
a success rate of well over 90%, so we can conclude that this solves the problem 
on all but the most unusual Windows XP installations.</p>
<p>Thanks, Francesco, in the name of the many systray users you've made happy!</p>
<p>Apparently this option is only there after Service Pack 2 is installed. I'm 
not sure whether and how this would work in Windows XP installations without SP2.</p>
<p>It is as yet unclear what exactly the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/expert/crawford_02july22.mspx">
UPnP</a> User Interface does, beside opening two ports. Any information is welcome.</p>
<p>Several people including myself suspect that the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/expert/crawford_02july22.mspx">
UPnP</a> interface does not directly cause the problem, instead there seems to 
be something wrong with the load order or timing. Perhaps the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/expert/crawford_02july22.mspx">
UPnP</a> interface hogs the system in a way that blocks the systray for too long 
on some computers.</p>
<p>2005-03-13 â Volker Severt wrote that a side effect of having the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/expert/crawford_02july22.mspx">
UPnP</a> User Interface installed already makes the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/expert/crawford_02july22.mspx">
UPnP</a> devices visible, namely that the relevant ports are opened in the firewall. 
If you uninstall the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/expert/crawford_02july22.mspx">
UPnP</a> User Interface, these ports are automatically closed, but you can reopen 
them by hand. They are TCP 2869, subnet, and UDP 1900, subnet. Thus you can still 
have the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/expert/crawford_02july22.mspx">
UPnP</a> devices visible.</p>
<p>2005-06-15 â Jose Luis Diez wrote the following intriguing email (see also 
the subchapter &quot;Diez workaround&quot; above for the short step by step instructions).</p>

  <p>I had been dealing with this problem for a week and followed all the hints

  either. (SSDP and

  UPnP</a> were already disabled.)</p>
  <p>I tried the Startright program and it worked great. I highly recommend that

  <p>Hoewever, I got bored about having an extra loader and kept playing with

  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/expert/crawford_02july22.mspx">
  UPnP</a> still shows in the Services settings under Administrative Tools.</p>
  <p>All in all very strange.</p>
  <p>After playing with my system for a while I agree and I'm 100% sure that the 
  problem of the icons disapearing is due to the systray not ready to place the 
  icons when the application loads. SSDP and
  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/expert/crawford_02july22.mspx">
  UPnP</a> just fix this by a collateral of changing the way things boot.</p>

<p>Done, but instead of using a big, obscure program, you can just as well use

  <p>Greetings from Lynnwood, WA USA â</p>
  <p>I'm e-mailing with a success story for r2 Studios' Startup Delayer (<a href="http://www.r2.com.au/software.php?show=startdelay">http://www.r2.com.au/software.php?show=startdelay</a>) for a 
  self-built dual-core (AMD) computer put together Dec. 2005, running Win XP Pro 
  SR2 and all recent patches. All went swimmingly until around the end of March 
  2006, when certain program icons supposed to show up in the system tray began 
  not loading at boot, usually in groups of three. After much frustration uninstalling 
  and reinstalling, Google (is my friend; yes, I should remember that) provided 
  the background on this weird and <span style="font-weight: bold">very</span> annoying Win 
  XP bug.</p>
  <p>After no success whatsoever from the registry hacks and the manual log-in 
  method, I tried Startup Delayer with a jaundiced eye, thinking that delaying 
  loading of just the four programs in my Startup folder wouldn't do much good. 
  I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the program could take over control 
  of <span style="font-weight: bold">all</span> startup programs. Delaying my Startup folder 
  programs along with one program controlled by a registry entry, plus a delay 
  to load my antivirus software <span style="font-weight: bold">last</span> did the trick. 
  The initial delay before the first program allows SystemTray to get going and 
  deal with the basics, and <span style="font-weight: bold">then</span> it's able to properly 
  bring up those icons for subsequent programs. I think the key is to have Startup 
  Delayer delay only as many programs as needed to allow others to load their 
  icons properly. I'm fairly certain my antivirus software (GMHB Avira AntiVir) 
  was hogging resources from the get-go that prevented a number of icons from 
  being loadedâincluding its own!</p>
  <p>Now, all ten icons show up in the system tray. Additionally, Startup Delayer's 
  small graphic bar gives me time to kill certain programs at boot if I just don't 
  need them to load for whatever reason. I'm very grateful to r2 Studios for making 
  this nifty little program available as freeware, given that the two alternatives 
  I found cost $20-$25. Would that everyone else could achieve icon happiness 
  with this program. As they say, it did the trick. ;-D</p>

<p>If disabling the

ports on the router directly. If you use a router that allows you to assign a fixed IP address to a certain 
computer (by MAC address), fine. If not, simply give the computer a fixed address 
outside the router's DHCP range.</p>

  <p>I just wanted to write in. I've been having problems getting systray icons

  I got to the &quot;PastIconsStream&quot; key that it was positively huge. So long that 
  I could not scroll to the bottom of the &quot;edit binary data&quot; window (each time 
  it would snap back up to the top for some bizarre reason).</p>
  <p>I manually deleted about 1/4 of the screen at a time (as much as it would 
  let me scroll the window) until I could select the rest of it and erase it entirely. 
  On a hunch I stopped there and lo and behold everything comes up perfectly again. 
  I suspect that at least in my case that key was just grown way beyond what was 
  expected for it's size. I suspect sys tray icons that change frequently may 
  be a contributer (like wireless card settings) or applications that create tray 
  icons only when they're running (ffdshow filters for instance, sometimes if 
  a system filter is used by a game I can see 30 or 40 of these icons in the tray 
  at once, usually they disappear before the game exits and you'ld never see them), 
  perhaps even applications that use the tray for active notification, like color 
  coded icons and the like, I'm not entirely sure, but I do think that most of 
  the people who have written in that Systray.reg worked for them probably only 
  needed to drop the &quot;PastIconsStream&quot; key. I will be sure to keep an eye on it, 
  though it's taken 2 1/2 years for the problem to occur originally, so I don't 
  expect it'll be happening again soon :)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you very much for your fine work with the webpage concerning the disappeared 
  systray icons. I can only confirm what Mark Medrano wrote on 2006-11-10: the 
  critical registry entry actually seems to be &quot;PastIconsStream&quot;.</p>
  <p>I tried manually deactivating SSDP and UPnP before, which did not work for 
  me. Then, I wanted to manually edit my registry entries one by one, starting 
  with the aforementioned one, but after logging out and in again directly after 
  this, the icons reappeared! This was not the case before - a break alone did 
  not do the trick.</p>

<p>2007-05-19 â Thomas Gregory Platt confirms that cleaning out these registry 
entries solves the problem for him too. He also wrote the following, 
intriguing message, whose core, I believe, is true or close to the truth and 
refutes my earlier suspicion that systray.exe is loaded too late. Thanks, 
Thomas! I have already amended this whole web page accordingly, so the 
following message now no longer appears as a correction:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I have to make one correction to what you and others seem to suspect is going 
  on with the systray application. From my observations of boot-time behavior 
  here, I honestly don't think the problem is that systray isn&#39;t loaded yet when 
  the icons that fail to appear are posted. On the contrary. From what I've seen, 
  I can plainly <span style="font-style: italic">see</span> that systray
  <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> present and has been active for some time because 
  it already HAS icons IN the tray (some of them like Network Connection, System 
  Volume Control and the &quot;Safely Remove Hardware&quot; icon were visible in the tray) 
  when the &quot;Clipmate-loads-but-its-icon-doesn&#39;t-appear&quot; problem occurred on my 
  system. So I&#39;m convinced you&#39;re wrong in assuming systray isn&#39;t active yet.</p>
  <p>One scenario that would explain part of what&#39;s going on is that the system 
  and systray are so BUSY in the midst of the startup bedlam (perhaps systray 
  is processing or rebuilding that long-long list of old icons?) that systray 
  fails to finish processing the request from one app (like ClipMate) fast enough 
  before another app (like the starting antivirus) comes in and issues a SECOND 
  request to add an icon to the system tray. It could be that the second incoming 
  request clobbers the first one and knocks it completely out of systray&#39;s queue. 
  That assumes of course that systray even HAS a queue. It could be systray app 
  wasn't designed to queue requests because its designers assumed it would be 
  able to process incoming requests to add a new icon VERY fast (within a few 
  CPU cycles). If the designers made that assumption, systray might only provide 
  a few memory locations where other apps can &quot;poke&quot; a copy of their icon and 
  the name and location of the program to be called when that icon is clicked 
  and then flip an in-memory switch that tells systray &quot;Here's a new icon for 
  you to process.&quot;. Without queuing, if two requests from different apps occur 
  in rapid succession while systray is &quot;busy&quot; doing something else (e.g. updating 
  that long list of prior icons, perhaps?), the arrival of a second request might 
  just obliterate the first one thus causing the earlier request to get lost.</p>
  <p>There's a second scenario that would also explain both this behavior AND
  <span style="font-style: italic">another</span> phenomenon I've observed that no one else 
  on your site has explicitly mentionedâthe now-you-see-it-now-you-don't system 
  tray icon glitch. It appears that some apps (like Clipmate) are designed to 
  issue a request to add their icon to the System Tray and just go on without 
  waiting (i.e. they're not designed to wait for a confirmation that their icon 
  was added), while others (e.g. anti-viruses) seem to be designed so that, if their 
  request <span style="font-style: italic">isn't</span> <span style="font-style: italic">acknowledged</span> 
  by systray within a few clock-ticks, they &quot;get impatient&quot; and issue a
  <span style="font-style: italic">new</span> START request for systrayâthus causing it 
  to lose track of ALL earlier &quot;add my icon&quot; requests. THIS scenario would explain 
  why some requests seem to get lost. It would <span style="font-style: italic">also</span> 
  explain why some icons can be seen to appear in the tray for a brief moment 
  or two, but suddenly disappear from it later. That's EXACTLY what was happening 
  on MY system with both the speaker volume control and the &quot;Safely Remove Hardware&quot; 
  icons. One second those icons would <span style="font-style: italic">appear</span> in the 
  system tray and moments later they would <span style="font-style: italic">vanish</span>! 
  I&#39;ve seen remarks from several posters (including you) that suggest they assume 
  lack of a fast reply from systray means it &quot;hasn&#39;t started yet&quot; or that it &quot;should 
  start earlier&quot;. Knowing how programmers think, that tells me some developers 
  might decide to &quot;take matters into their own hands&quot; and issue their
  <span style="font-style: italic">own</span> request to start systray if they don&#39;t get a 
  reply from it fast enough. If systray is already running but BUSY, issuing a 
  second start request probably causes systray to lose track of all icons it has 
  previously loaded â thus producing the &quot;now-you-see-it-now-you-don't&quot; vanishing 
  icons phenomena and the &quot;my icon never appeared&quot; phenomena too. If I was a betting 
  man, I&#39;d bet on this scenario. Programmers are notorious for such high-handed 
  tactics.</p>
  <p>Call it an EWAG (Educated Wild Ass Guess) Hans, but as a 40 year software 
  pro, what I see suggests that if the CPU is busy enough and the prior icons 
  list systray must process is LONG, systray can't react FAST enough before a 
  second request arrives. When that happens, for SOME reason (whether it's lack 
  of queuing or an impatient programmer who tries to start systray) a second request 
  that arrives while systray is <span style="font-style: italic">busy</span> wipes out the 
  requests that preceded it â both the one systray hasn't finished processing 
  yet AND any that HAD been completed earlier and were already in the tray.</p>

<h1><a id="Cannot_create_shell_notification_icon" name="Cannot_create_shell_notification_icon">Cannot create shell notification icon</a></h1>
<p>This is an error message that some programs, apparently all written in Delphi, 
show when they cannot reach the systray task to put their icon into the system 
tray. The most prevalent of these programs is Asus Probe. Most other programs 
don't throw an error message, but instead simply forgo creating an icon if they 
can't do it instantly. Both behaviors are insufficient, as we know.</p>
<p>This problem can be solved with Startup Delayer (see below) and by other means 
of delaying the startup. One of the simplest is to enable a splash screen like 
described here:</p>
<p>2006-09-14 â Eric-Jan Damen writes that his problem with the Asus Probe systray 
icon appeared after he removed the check mark to &quot;show up on next execution&quot; in 
the splash screen. The delay caused by the splash screen may be enough to make 
it work.</p>
<p>To re-enable the splash screen for Asus Probe, after you've already disabled 
it, click on <a href="/tools/AsusProbeShowSplashScreen.reg">AsusProbeShowSplashScreen.reg</a>, 
confirm as often as needed, then log off and log on again to test it. (Works only 
for Asus Probe, other programs have their settings at a different location in 
the registry or elsewhere.)</p>
<p>If that doesn't solve the problem and if you want to do it yourself, you can 
do it as follows.</p>
<p>Write a little program in Visual Basic Script that delays the start. Create 
a text file (File, New, Text file, or just open an Editor) and copy the following 
two lines into it:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Wscript.Sleep 240000 ' 4 minutes</p>
  <p>WScript.CreateObject(&quot;WScript.Shell&quot;).Run &quot;&quot;&quot;C:\Program Files\Asus\Probe\AsusProb.exe&quot;&quot;&quot;, 
  2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The delay time is in milliseconds, 240,000 in the example. Everything to the 
right of the apostroph (') is only a comment, has no function, and is not required. 
To solve the problem here, a delay of 30 to 60 seconds suffices, but if you also 
have the problem that a regulated fan triggers an alarm when cold-started, 4 to 
8 minutes may be required.</p>
<p>Save the file under the name DelayedStartup.vbs into the folder where the AsusProb.exe 
file resides. If the path is different from the one in the second line, change 
it accordingly. Actually, the file can be anywhere else, if you like, if only 
you enter its path into the registry as described below.</p>
<p>Test it. Close Asus Probe, then double-click on the VBS file in Windows Explorer, 
but double-click only once. There is no apparent reaction and no window opening. 
You have to wait for Asus Probe to appear after the given time. If you're in a 
hurry, you can shorten the time to a few seconds for the test, then change it 
back after the test.</p>
<p>Open regedit (Start, Run..., regedit) and change the following value.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<br />
&nbsp;\SOFTWARE<br />
&nbsp; \Microsoft<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; \Windows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \CurrentVersion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \Run<br />
  &quot;ASUS Probe&quot;=&quot;C:\Program Files\ASUS\Probe\AsusProb.exe&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Double-click on &quot;ASUS Probe&quot; on the right side and change the value to read:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;ASUS Probe&quot;=&quot;C:\Program Files\ASUS\Probe\DelayedStart.vbs&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The path given in the above example may not be the same as on your computer. 
Adapt it accordingly.</p>
<p>Log off and log on again to test the change. Asus Probe should appear after 
4 minutes or after whatever time you entered.</p>
<p>If you want to use this program to start several programs delayed, use the 
following example.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Set WsShell = WScript.CreateObject(&quot;WScript.Shell&quot;)</p>
  <p>Wscript.Sleep 240000 ' 4 minutes</p>
  <p>WsShell.Run &quot;&quot;&quot;C:\Program Files\Asus\Probe\AsusProb.exe&quot;&quot;&quot;, 2</p>
  <p>Wscript.Sleep 20000 ' 20 seconds</p>
  <p>WsShell.Run &quot;&quot;&quot;put the path to the next program here&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Repeat the last two lines as needed.</p>
<p>Note that some programs may reinstate the original situation when they are 
installed, reinstalled, or updated. Then you have to make the changes to the registry 
again.</p>
<p>User <a href="/user/1210">ClearAsMud</a> remarked that this method can be used for systray icons as well, if you write the program such that it starts the respective programs with delays. Of course, the normal start of the programs would have to be disabled and the delaying program amended whenever a new program with a systray icon is installed or an old one removed.</p>

<p>It is easiest and safest to just delete that value, but if it is all zeros, 
it should have no effect either. If it is non-zero, that may be the cause of your 
problem.</p>

<p>If this value is set to 1, that may be the cause of the problem. Search the 
registry for other instances of that setting, particularly in HKEY_CURRENT_USER, 
and set those to 0 also. Then reboot. In many installations this value doesn't 
even exist. In fact, in many normal installations the entire registry key Explorer 
does not exist. You can try to back up that key by exporting it, then delete the 
entire key for a test.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the absence or presence of these keys and values does not guarantee 
that it all works, and it is not clear whether some of these values work only 
for some people because they change the logon timing.</p>
<p>Also make sure that you don't have the taskbar set up the wrong way. Make sure 
that the quickstart icons are on the left side, not on the right, and the running 
programs area is in the middle of the taskbar. If they are arranged the other 
way around, then unlock the taskbar and drag the program icon area far to the 
right, between the quickstart icons and the system tray (system notification area). 
Then use the sliders to use the available space optimally and relock the taskbar. 
If this solves your problem, be happy. The problem for which most people visit 
this web page is much more intractable.</p>

<p>New information is added at the end of this chapter, so you can read on, but 
skip to the last paragraphs if you get bored. Thanks to everybody who contributed 
useful information!</p>
<p>In spite of the apparent effectiveness of the Ostuni workaround, I'm still 
looking for a way to make the systray icons show up without having to disable 
or uninstall anything. So the search is still continuing.</p>
<p>Anything that streamlines or delays the boot and logon process appears to help 
in many cases, though not all, for example thoroughly defragmenting the hard disk 
with a good defragmenter like PerfectDisk by Raxco. Other examples keep being 
reported, but none is a real solution. They all work on some computers, but not 
on others, usually by disabling something and thereby changing the boot timing. 
Typical culprits are slow, inefficient virus checkers that are set to automatic, 
like Norton Antivirus 2005 Pro.</p>
<p>First give your user account a password, so the computer cannot rush through 
a quick auto-logon.</p>
<p>It clearly helps (on at least one of my own computers) if the user waits until 
he actually logs on. You may enter your password, but do not immediately press 
return or click on the OK button. For a few thorough tests wait at least a full 
minute before logging on, or wait until disk activity subsides. You could watch 
the hard disk light, memorize the rhythm of the bursts, which is usually always 
the same, and the next time wait until after the last big loading burst. If this 
helps, it probably does so by getting some system (particularly network) loading

<p>As mentioned above, disabling the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/expert/crawford_02july22.mspx">
UPnP</a> (Universal Plug and Play) service or the
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ssdp+discovery">SSDP</a> (Simple Service 
Discovery Protocol) service or both solves the problem. Microsoft proposes the 
latter in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/841571/">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/841571/</a>. 
However, this is not a very good solution because you may want to have these services 
running. Another proposal is to set the start type of these services to Automatic. 
They are by default set to Manual, and at least the
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ssdp+discovery">SSDP</a> service is nonetheless 
started automatically by other means. Setting the
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ssdp+discovery">SSDP</a> service to Automatic 
would likely let this service start earlier, so it doesn't get in the way of other 
software that is loaded later.</p>
<p>2005-03-10 â Rob Nunn wrote that his Systray icons fail to appear exactly on 
those days when his antivirus program, NOD32, updates its virus definitions, which 
it does after first being loaded, i.e. just after system boot. This, of course, 
uses the network connection. My first thought is that, if one could delay the 
antivirus update by a minute, the problem might not show up.</p>
<p>2005-04-10 â Stein Bjorndal reported: &quot;... a process named sdmcp.exe crashed 
on me. After a bit of investigation, this turns out to be a part of the DesktopX 
application by Stardock (<a href="http://www.stardock.com/products/desktopx/">http://www.stardock.com/products/desktopx/</a>), 
...&quot; Uninstalling the program didn't work for him either, so he just erased all 
traces that could be found, including the start of the exe file. That solved his 
problem.</p>
<p>This has meanwhile been confirmed by two other users, Gary Melady and David 
Perry. The culprit may be Stardock Central.</p>

<p>2005-06-14 â Ansgar Nell sent an intriguing hint, originally written by Guloso 
on a discussion boardâjust restart systray.exe, for example by putting a shortcut 
to it into the startup folder. No need to provide a path, since the program is 
in the search path. I have meanwhile received an email confirming this, but it 
doesn't work at all on my own computers. Another of those solutions that work 
for some, but not for most. I have heard of one case in which systray.exe didn't 
get loaded at all, and using this method or the one below fixed the problem.</p>
<p>A similar, possibly better method to start systray.exe is through the Run key 
in the registry. Unfortunately this also doesn't bring any missing icons back 
on my computers, but if you want to try it nonetheless, the procedure is as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<br />
&nbsp;\SOFTWARE<br />
&nbsp; \Microsoft<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; \Windows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \CurrentVersion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \Run<br />
  &quot;systray&quot;=&quot;systray.exe&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step-by-step instructions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on Start, Run..., type: regedit</li>
  <li>Press return</li>
  <li>In Registry Editor, navigate the left directory tree to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</li>
  <li>Right click in the right window pane, select New, then String value.</li>
  <li>Give the new string value the name: systray</li>
  <li>Your new value should now have the name &quot;systray&quot;, the type &quot;REG_SZ&quot;, and 
  no data. Right click on this new systray value and select: Modify</li>
  <li>Enter the value: systray.exe</li>
  <li>Click: OK</li>
  <li>Close Registry Editor.</li>
  <li>Restart your computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another of these hints (thanks to John Erikson) is that emptying the Prefetch 
folder (C:\WINDOWS\Prefetch in a normal installation) helps. The file Layout.ini 
is automatically recreated at some later time and is not essential anyway. Just 
cleaning out the prefetch folder did not solve the problem on my test computers 
and I also get reports from other users that it doesn't solve the problem there, 
so it is obviously not a universal solution. I guess that it merely speeds up 
the logon process a little.</p>
<p>2006-10-23 â WvU wrote that deleting Prefetch\Layout.ini, then defragmenting 
the hard disk, solves the problem for him. He supposes that the defragmenter has 
a defect in relation to rearranging the boot files according to Layout.ini.</p>
<p>Yet another hint came from Harold Collins. He used the MSCONFIG utility to 
disable the Adobe Reader Speed Load, which solved the problem for him. This is 
apparently yet another way to accelerate the loading process for the other systray 
icons and may work for some.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tech-pro.net">www.tech-pro.net</a> provides a tool set 
named Tech-Pro Utilities Startup (<a href="http://www.tech-pro.net/startup.html">http://www.tech-pro.net/startup.html</a> 
Version 1.1 as of 2004-11-22), which contains one tool named Startup Manager. 
You need only the Startup Manager for this particular problem. This program can 
delay the loading of programs from your Startup menu and allegedly solves the 
missing systray icon problem.</p>
<p>I have my doubts though, because most of the possibly offending programs aren't 
started from the Startup menu at all, mine is empty, for example. I guess we need 
something to delay the loading from the Run key in the registry. But if you try 
any of these programs, please let me know your results.</p>
<p>2005-01-26 â Found a program named SysTrayHack at
<a href="http://desktopian.org/addons/systray2kfix.zip">http://desktopian.org/addons/systray2kfix.zip</a> 
and tested it. It claims to solve the problem of not appearing systray icons when 
another shell is used in place of Windows Explorer. I tried it, although I do 
use Windows Explorer. As expected, it didn't solve the problem for me, but I have 
received 2 confirmations that it worked for other users.</p>

<p>Thanks, Lutz! This is indeed promising. The program is try-before-you-buy shareware

<p>2005-02-17 â Cliff Cawley of r2 Studios contacted me and recommended his freeware 
program Startup Delayer, available from
<a href="http://www.r2.com.au/software.php?show=startdelay">http://www.r2.com.au/software.php?show=startdelay</a>. 
2005-04-01 - Bruce Sylvester reports that he tried Startup Delayer after the Ostuni 
Workaround hadn't helped. His statement: &quot;Voila! Works perfectly and problem gone.&quot; 
2005-10-12 â I finally got to testing it myself and can recommend it with some 
reservations. The program itself works very well and does exactly what it should 
doâdelay starting the automatically started programs. Unfortunately it does not 
solve the entire problem on my computer. Some of the missing or disappearing icons 
will still not appear if delayed, or they will never appear when delayed. Examples 
are the Bluetooth icon and other icons that depend on it, like that of the Nokia 
PC Suite. Startup Delayer seems to work well with the SoundMan icon though (the 
speaker symbol to control the sound volume) and with several others, like Asus 
Probe. It also appears to have a perfect installer and uninstaller, so there is 
apparently no risk in trying.</p>

    enter explorer there)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This brings back the missing icons 99% of the time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I cannot confirm this. Sometimes it works for me, but usually 
it doesn't. Some icons do not return, even if I repeat the procedure. But try 
it anyway, perhaps it works well enough for you.</p>

<p>A remaining problem is any software that had been installed for this user only,

a way out.</p>
<p>2006-01-16 â Larry Bowman wrote about a last resort workaround. You can create 
shortcuts to the programs that belong to the missing icons. For example, you can 
create a shortcut to sndvol32, so you can always get the volume control, albeit 
the big one. Or you can right-click the Sounds and Multimedia applet in Control 
Panel and create a shortcut to that, so you can get your volume icon back with 
a few more mouse clicks (disable the icon, apply, enable the icon, OK). With similar 
shortcuts you may be able work around all or most missing icons. Another example 
for such a shortcut is this, which you could call Hardware Unplug:</p>
<p class="center">rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL hotplug.dll</p>

<p>2006-11-28 â Lawrence LaCroix wrote about an interesting point again:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the taskbar properties menu, there is an option to control the systray 
  icon properties, like &quot;show always&quot; &quot;hide when inactive&quot; and &quot;hide always&quot;. 
  Below the active icons is a cache of recently used systray icons that for some 
  reason Windows likes to remember. Over time this list can get longer and longer 
  if you have installed and removed a lot of applications that have systray icons. 
  In this storage area, there are also sometimes &quot;folder&quot; icons. These can represent 
  temporary information that was in the tray that never had an icon, or it can 
  represent deleted program icons for which Windows no longer has the original 
  icon available to display, so instead Windows simply displays the standard Windows 
  folder icon with a description.</p>
  <p>When I use the registry fix with the two keys that are deleted (IconStreams 
  and PastIconsStream), all of the recognized icons are deleted, but I still had 
  at least 20 of the &quot;folder icons&quot; described above that were not removed. Even 
  after rebooting these were still there, and even after rebooting I had some 
  current systray icons that were still missing from the notification area. When 
  I used the longer method to use Task Manager to shut down Windows Explorer and 
  restart it in the current session (Run: explorer), all of the &quot;folder icons&quot; 
  disappeared and my systray icons started working properly again. I am fairly 
  sure that this missing systray icon issue has something to do with how Windows 
  reads that list of systray icons, current &amp; recently used, held in this taskbar 
  properties file.</p>
  <p>Instead of steps 1 to 4 below, you can also run
  <a href="/tools/systray_cleanup.reg">systray_cleanup.reg</a> or another of the 
  related registry fix files described in the chapter &quot;The most successful workarounds&quot; 
  above. They all remove the two registry keys.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Click Start &gt; Run &gt; Regedit</li>
    <li>Navigate to<br />
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER<br />
&nbsp;\Software<br />
&nbsp; \Microsoft<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; \Windows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \CurrentVersion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \Explorer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \TrayNotify</li>
    <li>Delete the IconStreams and PastIconsStream values.</li>
    <li>Close Regedit.</li>
    <li>Open Task Manager, click Processes tab, click explorer.exe, then click 
    End Process.</li>
    <li>Still in Task Manager, click File, click New Task, type explorer, then 
    click OK.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>I think that the other fix [see above] that rearranges the default network 
  search order worked on one of my computers because it changed the order that 
  the icons were loaded, again this points toward some quirk or glitch in that 
  icon storage information. This fix also has some interesting side effects, on 
  my home computer the systray now loads about twice as fast since I moved the 
  1394 network adapter down the list and put my local network at the top. Now 
  figure that one out!</p>

  <div class="content"><p>After having this happen to me twice, I think I may have some insight into what triggers this.</p>
<p>The first time was with a dual core HTPC build. At the time I didn't associate the dual core with the problem. However after I got a six core the problem came back in spades.  </p>
<p>It had been quite a while since the first occurrence, so I'd completely forgotten that I'd patched it prior. I wasted hours fiddling around with my startup items figuring one of them in particular was causing a problem before giving up and searching the net for a solution - hence arriving here. In the process of trying to fix it I discovered it was already patched.</p>
<p>Since it wasn't working (and knowing how long startup takes now with the six core) I quadrupled the timeout value (version 6.0.2900.6242 offset 00069ac4: 80 A9 03) and after some wrestling to replace shell32.dll (never thought I'd appreciate my dual boot Win8) got back all my icons. Some I hadn't seen in months!</p>
<p>Conclusion: The reason most people don't see this is twofold - they are running a single core or are not running enough heavy startup items. In the past I'd always kept my startups to an absolute minimum and never seen this problem even on dual cores. It was only after setting up this particular system with lots of heavy startups (email, ftp, Plex, PlayOn, Motocast, webcam, Bluetooth, process lasso, NPVR, etc.) that I saw this problem. </p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>In a situation like this, with a range of bigger programs being started, perhaps starting them with much longer delays would solve the problem better. The helper program mentioned in an earlier comment below, that does exactly this, may solve the problem. Or one could program individual solutions, perhaps using batch files.</p>
<p>But if an additional patch to shell32.dll indeed solved the problem and if the solution is stable and reliable, then that may be good enough.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>I had been struggling with the disappearing-icons problem for a week, and searching the Net in vain to find the solution. Finally, Google got me to winhlp.com, and the rest is simple history. The *nars* 2010 fix did the trick perfectly. Thanks to all of you who worked on this pesky problem. When it attacks your *frequently used tool* icons, it's especially frustrating. Like an earlier poster, I depend on a clipboard-extender every day, and I was going nuts without its icon in the tray, even though the program was running. I have Win 7 and Win 8 running on two of my household machines, but I still use a pair of older XP SP3 machines most frequently, and they were the sad victims of this sudden icon-absence. Fixed! Merci toute la gang!</p>

  <div class="content"><p>shell32.dll was updated on my system on 8 June 2012 to version 6.0.2900.6242 from version 6.0.2900.6072.</p>
<p>The new offsets and changed bytes (in hex) for the patch are as follows:</p>
<p>00069ac4 change a0 to 60<br />
00069ac5 change 0f to ea<br />
00069ac9 change 03 to 01</p>
<p>I'm sure the patcher tool documented will work fine for the updated shell32.dll. I have a dual-boot system and boot into Linux and edit shell32.dll with the binary file editor GHex. I make a backup copy of the original shell32.dll and take a belt-and-braces image backup of my Windows system first before making such changes!</p>
<p>One again, I noticed that various tray icons were missing again at Windows start-up recently, so I checked shell32.dll and, it came as no surprise to me that shell32.dll had been updated on my system on 8 June 2012. The above patch is the only thing that will reliably fix this bug on my system. I have tried writing various programs over the years to fix this problem, the most successful being start-up delay programs; but even they don't work with 100% reliability.</p>
<p>I find it incredible that this problem has been around for so many years, and I understand that it even appears to have been carried forward to Windows 7. I tend to use Linux these days for most of my work and just keep a copy of Windows XP going to run programs I can't port to Linux.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Thanks for the good information!</p>
<p>Yes, I can confirm that the patcher tool works fine on my German version of Windows XP.</p>
<p>Generally I am stunned by the number and severity of software errors in most software, particularly in widely used systems like Windows. On one side the software enables us to get things done, on the other side we waste an immense effort to identify and work around these defects, flaws, gaps in the functionality, etc. It is eye-opening to try to calculate the damage in a common currency. The cost of fixing a defect is probably minute compared to the damage it otherwise does.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>I was having trouble with quite a few icons being missing on loading Windows 7 and then I just happened to read about the fact that it might be due to having a lot of programs trying to launch all at once (I do have a lot of applications on my PC). I thought I was probably on the right track when I discovered that if I logged off and back on again, the missing icons would reappear. I then noticed a suggestion about trying Startup Delayer (a program I used to have on my PC a long time ago but which I removed during the switchover to the latest version as some of the older features at that time had not been carried over to the new version). So I navigated to the developers web site and had a look at the latest version. I was pleased to note that all the missing earlier features were back and many new ones too, so I decided to give it a try. Well, I can report that using that little utility has completely solved my missing icons problem. I would probably still be looking for a solution if I hadn't spotted it on this site, so I'm very glad to have found this web site. Thank you to all who contribute - you are doing a fine job.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>I'm on Vista Business, but had exactly the same problem of the volume icon not appearing, and the checkbox greyed out.  I just clicked the "ssdp automatic" registry patch.  That didn't work on its own.  Rebooted and then clicked the "Upnp automatic" registry patch.  Reboot and it's been working for several weeks with no failure.  No need to patch and then keep repatching shell32.dll at all.</p>
<p>Thanks also for the analysis that it's just a problem with timing between startup and user logon.  I could not figure out why it was so seemingly random.  Yes indeed if I just wait for boot to complete before logging on, everything is fine. Now with the registry patches I don't need to wait.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>You were lucky. Reading this discussion you will find dozens of similar solutions that worked on one computer, but sadly not on the next. The idea behind all of them is to do something that changes the timing.</p>
<p>On a particular computer, changing the timing may lead to a relatively stable solution, so what you did is something everybody could try firstâfollow some of the hints and see whether they suffice.</p>
<p>If it works, fine. But there is no guarantee that it will still work after you install the next piece of software, not even that it will still work tomorrow. But anyway, as long as it works, enjoy.</p>
<p>If such trials don't lead to a solution, or if the solution does not survive the passage of time, you would have to go to the fundamental solution and patch shell32.dll.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>I have the 6.0.2900.6072 version.</p>
<p>By stopped working I mean that after I did the windows updates awhile back, when I log into the computer right as I turn it on, all the icons do not load in the tray, but if I wait around 2 minutes and then log on, they will. Also if I log on fast, and then log off and log back on around a minute later it fixes.</p>
<p>The nars patch fixed this before so that I can log on immediately and then all the icons would load.</p>
<p>I used to be able to run the patch in normal mode but now it gives me errors that the unit was already patched or unrecognized version. Going into safe mode works and I was able to restore original and then repatch. The windows file protection never came up in safe mode, even though the patcher said it should.</p>
<p>This still did not work.</p>
<p>Temporarily I have disabled the SSDP service for the network discovery and have used BootVis optimize system along with the patch and it is now working. If I re enable the SSDP service it does not work anymore.</p>
<p>Before I could keep it on and now I can not. Therefore I don't think the patch did anything as that service is affecting me now. Or maybe they are working together?</p>
<p>The ideal solution would be to have the service on and have all the icons load still.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Installed Windows Essentials &amp; Comodo Firewall. Icons would not appear in notification area. Contacted Microsoft help who seemed to think I had a virus and had me run full scans with MalWareBytes, ( which I already had installed on my system ) Vipre Online Scan, Norton Power Eraser and finally Microsoft Safety Scanner. ( None of them found a problem ). This took about 30 hrs due to the amount of files on my system. They then had me check my date and time settings. ( which were ok ) This was followed by running a trouble shooter to "fix" windows. Then it was uninstall and re-install Essentials. After all this the icons were still missing. Then I posted a request for help on Comodo support which directed me to a patch for solving this problem developed by Paul &amp; Nara and available on this site. I duly installed the patch and immediately the Essentials and Comodo icons appeared along with the safely remove hardware and volume icons which were missing for 2 years. My deepest thanks to those who developed this patch and to this site for making it available. Its a pity Microsoft could not be honest and acknowledge this XP problem and direct people to this site if they themselves are unable to develop a problem solving patch. Good one Winhlp. Bad one Microsoft.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Don't listen to these people telling you to disable plug/play and other such services, all you will do is screw things up even further, they don't have a clue what they are talking about. All you need to do is password protect your username then when the startup screen containing your username comes up simply let the computer load until all hard drive activity stops, punch in your password and windows will load all system tray icons as it should. very simple. I have done this on two very different machines that I was having this exact same problem with and it works perfectly every single time without exception. No need for all this techno babel and poking around the registry. Like to old saying goes........"Keep it simple stupid!"</p>

  <div class="content"><p>HipServ Agent (media storage) returned "Could not set icon" error message at startup on 1 of 2 XP SP3 home computers.  After much searching I found this thread on missing icons.  After reading (and multiple re-readings) of this thread I tried 2 approaches.  First, I disabled all the unnecessary startup programs and that "fixed" the problem.  Being the inquesitive type I then re-enabled all my startup programs and received the same error message upon restart.  I also stopped and restarted explorer.exe after startup and found that my HipServ icon was restored via that process.  I then applied Nar's process to patch and replace the shell32.dll (ver 6.0.2900.6072).  Worked well for me.  Thank you all for the incredible amount of time spent on this problem.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Thanks for this article. At home, I use mostly Linux, but I have this systray problem at my Windows computer at work. The Ostuni workaround did not work for me. Additionaly, I am not comfortable with patching a system DLL library in our corporate environment: I am capable to do this, but our sysadmins will not be happy after that I guess - so my workaround is this:</p>
<p>When the computer boots, I log in. I wait after all the icons appear, they are wrong. After the system sort of "settles", all desktop icons are loaded etc. I log off and then I log in again. After that, the systray icons are displayed correctly. </p>
<p>Because I boot my computer only few times a week, I am sort of happy with this workaround.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>After years of ghostly events in my Systray regarding a few disappearing icons including VOLUME (speaker thing) and annoying PC sound 'beeps' which automatically took the place of some usual windows sounds (alerts, warnings, etc.), everything is now sorted out. I tried to apply the Ostuni which seems very popular around here, but the option was already correct on my system, so Ostuni got me nowhere. I read a comment about 'startright' software and decided to give it a try. Result: wow! SOundi icon is back, windows sounds have taken the place of the annoying PC "beeps". Miracle. Me not being a computer expert, I can only say thanks Startright :D!</p>

  <div class="content"><p>First I would like to say thanks to tasmanian for the real solution for this problem, and shame on MS that didn't fixed it...</p>
<p>I do use the suggested patch for more than 1 year now and it works perfectly! however tired of applying it each time MS updates shell32.dll, or on new Windows installs, I did decided to create a small patcher tool, I think it can be useful for other people having the same problem, you can download it at:</p>
<p><a href="http://nars.aloj.net/download/shell32patch.zip" title="http://nars.aloj.net/download/shell32patch.zip">http://nars.aloj.net/download/shell32patch.zip</a></p>
<p>The patcher tool should work with every new version of shell32.dll as it will find offset automatically and will take care of Windows File Protection obviously...</p>
<p>If anyone finds any problem with the tool please let me know.</p>

He caused the problem playing with "registry optimizing" tools; people please stay away from those products!  I had followed some of the registry entries shown in this forum with a little success but this patch TOTALLY fixed the issue of the notification icons (speaker, network, power/battery and more) that had disappeared.  He was VERY close to a reformat and fresh install!  Microsoftâs tech site is useless in solving this icon disappearing issue.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>For months I had been trying to recover the volume control icon permanently.  I had tried most of the solutions listed on the topic but although some of them worked for possibly one re-start the icon was soon missing again.  Like previous reports when I downloaded from the link: <a href="http://nars.aloj.net/download/shell32patch.zip" title="http://nars.aloj.net/download/shell32patch.zip">http://nars.aloj.net/download/shell32patch.zip</a>  and tried to un-zip the file I received the error:  'The Compressed (zipped) Folder is invalid or corrupted'.  My file version is 6.0.2900.6072.  I used the very useful information provided by sob8 and the Hex editor recommended earlier to modify my shell32 file.  I needed to install the file in âsafe modeâ.  All was then correct and the icon appears all the time.</p>
<p>I then contacted ânarsâ and informed him that the link was not working or the file was corrupt.  He kindly sent me the file.  This file unzipped correctly.  I restored the original shell32 file applied the patch and the changes were made and all is well with the volume icon. </p>
<p>All the above was on my main computer which is running Windows Professional XP SP3.  Today I am using another one of my computers with Windows 7 Ultimate.  I do not have an issue with the volume icon on this machine but out of curiosity I tried the link above and it un-zipped perfectly.  Today it still gives the un-zipping error on my XP computer!   Most curious! </p>
<p>The link: <a href="http://nars.aloj.net/download/shell32patch_src.rar" title="http://nars.aloj.net/download/shell32patch_src.rar">http://nars.aloj.net/download/shell32patch_src.rar</a>  gives the error 404 on both computers when trying to download it.</p>
<p>Thank you sob8 for writing down the changes but most of all thank  you nars for the patch.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Had this issue in the past but the UPnP trickery had worked for me - until I ditched AVG and started using Comodo as my AV (already using it for firewall). I do like Comodo, it has alleviated issues I was having with AVG, it just happened to slaughter my startup programs. I was starting to lose hope, and actually contemplating a Windows flush (and a faster system drive too)...</p>
<p>And then I found this site. *Gold*.</p>
<p>[XPSP3] I backed up my original shell32.dll (6.0.2900.6018) then patched another separate copy of my shell32.dll with the values TeaRex posted using Hex Editor Neo (good freeware hex editor btw). DLL Replacer didn't work for me, so I installed the recovery console and 1) Browsed to C:\windows\system32   2) Deleted the shell32.dll   3) Copied shell32_patched.dll to shell32.dll   4) Reboot and happiness ensued.</p>
<p>Systray icons working %100 since (three days now, random reboots/shutdowns just to see) and no side-effects have been noticed.</p>
<p>Thank you to tasmanian (you sleuth you!), depassp, mcrealize and TeaRex, and of course to WinHlp.com for bringing all this together.</p>
<p>See you when SP4 is released :)</p>

  <div class="content"><p>The most utilized utility I have is Thronsoft's Clipmate, and its systray icon started disappearing after a MS update some months ago. The problem was intermittent. The solution was to uncheck all items related to Startup on the Clipmate<br />
Tools-&gt; Options-&gt; General screen. Clipmate will then fail to load at startup. When loaded manually, Icon always appears and remains in the systray.  - Therefore, as mentioned in several places above, it is a timing problem.</p>
<p>Just deleting it from the Microsoft or "Starter" startup list is insufficient.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>If you suffer from this problem there are many fixes to choose from. The best one i have tried only works if taskmanager is showing the relevant startup process is running but the systray icons are missing. I use a free startup manager from r2 studios <a href="http://www.r2.com.au/software.php?page=2&amp;show=startdelay" title="http://www.r2.com.au/software.php?page=2&amp;show=startdelay">http://www.r2.com.au/software.php?page=2&amp;show=startdelay</a></p>
<p>Just click on the items that are loading but not showing up in the systray and insert a delay time for each each affected program. I have found, that to get this to work properly, you should not set any of the delay times to less than a minute and leave a minimum 10 second gap between each process.</p>
<p>If you have a lot of missing icons, then obviously your total boot time will increase. So you may have to just choose the most important items you need. Or be prepared for boot times to increase.</p>
