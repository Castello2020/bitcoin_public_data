<h1>News</h1>
<p>Nokia PC Suite keeps showing new defects version after version after 
version. The message store seems to be totally messed up. I was unable to 
restore messages saved on the computer back to the phone, not even by sending 
it to my own phone. Nokia has a track record of not valuing user data.</p>
<p>Version 6.83.14.1 introduced a new problem of an <strong>endless installation loop</strong>. The 
defect has not been corrected in later versions.
The file <a href="/tools/wpd_disable.reg">wpd_disable.reg</a> solves this 
problem in some cases after a reboot. If it doesn&#39;t, or if you want to do further testing, perhaps with a 
newer version of Nokia PC Suite, you can restore the original state with
<a href="/tools/wpd_enable.reg">wpd_enable.reg</a>. To use one of these 
files, click on its link, then confirm twice. To look into one of them without 
applying it, right-click on the link, then save the target to your hard disk 
and open it in editor/notepad.</p>
<p>Warning: The install loop creates lots of temporary folders and files, but never removes them.</p>
<p>To stop the install loop, if the method above doesn't work, open the Device Manager and deactivate the offending driver for the Windows Portable Device.</p>
<p>If you still have the problem, you may have an older Nokia Windows Portable Device driver on your hard disk. You can try to find all relevant files %systemroot%\inf\oemXX.inf, where XX is a number. Look into the oemXX.inf files, beginning with the last one, or use the search function. Look for all oemXX.inf files that begin with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>; Nokia Windows Portable Device Driver, Copyright 2005,2006, 2007</p>
<p>; PCCSWpdDriver.inf</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rename all of these files' extensions from .inf to anything else, like: .txt</p>
<p>Don't stop after you've found one. Look for at least a second one. Now you should get the regular install dialog, which may again not work.</p>
<p>Go into Control Panel, Add/remove programs, start the Nokia PC Suite installer and select to repair the installation. The driver will again install and may again go into the install loop. In that case, open Device Manager and deactivate the driver.</p>
<p>Test switching the phone off and on and test rebooting with the phone switched on. If everything works well, you can delete the .txt files along with their corresponding .PNF files.</p>
<p>If all of this fails to solve the problem, delete the driver information from the registry.</p>
<h1>General</h1>
<p>The Nokia PC Suite software comes with the quite popular Nokia phones, 
but, as usual these days, also with many big and little flaws, shortcomings, and 
defects. This page tries to help you with these and also needs your feedback.

<h1>Nokia PC Suite&#151;general remarks</h1>
<p>Nothing is perfect. The synchronizing software sometimes hangs 
and has to be killed. The WAB records addresses in 5 fields, while it's only one 
in the phone, so city, state, zip, and country all end up in the street address 
when you make a change to the address in the phone. Certain fields, like the company 
name, are not represented in the phone and thus get lost in the phone. And the 
catchall remarks field is limited to 60 characters in the phone, so you have to 
be careful not to write anything important beyond these in the computer, because 
it would be cropped. As usual, all these things have the quality of a first demo 
version, but that's all we get these days. It's still progress.</p>
<p>The following chapters concern these and other weaknesses, flaws, and defects 
from a less enthusiastic perspective, after having used the phone for a few months.</p>
<p>Check the Nokia web site regularly for new versions of PC Suite. Usually every 
new version solves at least one nagging problem. It is getting better, though very 
slowly. The current version on 2006-04-22 was 6.80.20.</p>
<p>The program, or rather, the collection of programs, is very buggy and unreliable, 
particularly when the phone gets out of reach, comes back, and tries to reconnect. 
Older versions were even worse, with some features not working at all, and things 
are only improving at a glacial pace.</p>

I just installed some software called <a href="http://www.mobiledit.com/">www.mobiledit.com</a>. 
It does all the Nokia stuff in a less bloaty manner, and seems to reconnect quite 
cheerfully.</p>
<p>2005-05-10 – Shantanu Chand mentioned Oxygen Phone Manager from
<a href="http://www.oxygensoftware.com/">www.oxygensoftware.com</a>.</p>

  via the IR port, whereas previously it had been blocked. I do not know the 
  reason why this occurred.</p>
  <p>The program provides an excellent interface with a remarkable amount of 
  information about your phone on screen. You can select individual or groups 
  of SMS messages for storage as text or Excel files, etc.</p>
  <p>I have only tried the program once again after the attempts mentioned 
  above. It worked perfectly, even though the Nokia suite is installed and 
  noticed the phone. Windows also notices it, but I tell it to ignore it, 
  knowing the other software does not require any special Windows driver.</p>
  <p>Now I am going to uninstall the Nokia suite.</p>

Oxygen Phone Manager solves the Nokia PC Suite problems, please add a comment or reply below.</p>
<h1>Not loading PC Suite automatically</h1>
<p>If you don't want to have Nokia PC Suite loaded automatically, remove or disable 
all autorun entries for the programs, a one time act, and to log off from Windows 
and log on again, which removes the programs. I initially did that, but later changed 
my mind and now have Nokia PC Suite loaded at all times. But if you don't agree 
with me, please read on.</p>
<p>The autorun entries are in the Windows registry:</p>
<pre>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
 \SOFTWARE
  \Microsoft
   \Windows
    \CurrentVersion
     \policies
      \Explorer
       \Run</pre>
<p>The two values on my computer are:</p>
<p>Name: PCSuiteTrayApplication<br />
Type: REG_SZ<br />
Value: DISABLED C:\Programme\Nokia\Nokia PC Suite 6\Launch Application 2.exe -onlytray</p>
<p>Name: DataLayer<br />
Type: REG_SZ<br />
Value: DISABLED C:\PROGRA~1\GEMEIN~1\PCSuite\DATALA~1\DATALA~1.EXE </p>
<p>The word DISABLED and the subsequent space has been inserted by me to prevent 
the automatic startup of these two programs. You can do that too, if you are sufficiently 
conversant with the program regedit.exe. After you disabled these entries, you 
can log off and log on again to throw Nokia PC Suite out of the memory. Of course 
you could also delete the two values entirely, but then you would have to write 
everything down elsewhere or reinstall Nokia PC Suite to reenable them.</p>
<h2>Unloading, reloading</h2>
<p>Several problems of PC Suite, like a persistent &quot;Phone disconnected&quot; message, 
can be solved by unloading all its modules from memory and reloading them.</p>
<p>First of all, Nokia PC Suite cannot connect to the phone when it has a GPRS 
data connection established. If you don't start it automatically, but want both 
connections at the same time, you have to start Nokia PC Suite first, then establish 
the GPRS connection. This is another one of the many defects.</p>
<p>Nonetheless you will probably get into the situation that Nokia PC Suite announces, 
&quot;Phone disconnected&quot;, although the telephone is within Bluetooth (or infrared) 
range. Normally the phone reconnects when you walk away and come back later. However, 
frequently this does not work, perhaps when you go in and out of range in quick 
succession, when you're at the border of the range, when you go out and in again 
several times, or when you simply let everything sit for some time (my guesses).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are three parties to this problem, the phone, the Nokia 
PC Suite software, and the Bluetooth driver and management software. But in most 
cases the problem is only in the Nokia software, and unloading and reloading it 
solves the problem.</p>
<p>The most radical, though inconvenient method is to log off and on again. If 
that's too awkward for you, read on.</p>
<p>2005-02-23 - Thomas Kobler sent me a workaround to offload and reload Nokia 
PC Suite:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>@echo off<br />
  pskill &quot;Launch Application 2.exe&quot;<br />
  pskill VFSWRA~1.EXE<br />
  pskill SEUPDA~1.EXE<br />
  sleep 1<br />
  pskill DataLayer.exe<br />
  pskill DATALA~1.exe<br />
  sleep 1<br />
  start &quot;Restarting Nokia PC Suite&quot; &quot;\Program Files\Nokia\Nokia PC Suite 6\Launch 
  Application 2.exe&quot; -onlytray</p>
</blockquote>
<p>pskill is a free tool from <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/">www.sysinternals.com</a>. 
If you don't have sleep, you can also use:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">ping -n 1 localhost</p>
<p>Instead of pskill you can also use taskkill.exe, which seems to be included 
in Windows XP and is usually already in the system32 folder. For older versions 
of Windows you can perhaps download it with a Resource Kit—I have not checked this.</p>
<p>I experimented with this and wrote the following batch file to unload and reload 
Nokia PC Suite 6.8 as thoroughly as possible. Copy the following lines into a text 
editor and save the file as NokiaReload.bat :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>rem Reload Nokia PC Suite</p>
  <p>taskkill /im ContentCopier.exe /f /t</p>
  <p>taskkill /im TextMessageEditor.exe /f /t</p>
  <p>taskkill /im PcSync2.exe /f /t</p>
  <p>taskkill /im LaunchApplication.exe /f /t</p>
  <p>taskkill /im LAUNCH~1.EXE /f /t</p>
  <p>taskkill /im VFSWRA~1.EXE /f /t</p>
  <p>taskkill /im SeUpdateDb.exe /f /t</p>
  <p>taskkill /im SEUPDA~1.EXE /f /t</p>
  <p>taskkill /im MPAPI3s.exe /f /t</p>
  <p>taskkill /im MPAPI3~1.EXE /f /t</p>
  <p>taskkill /im ServiceLayer.exe /f /t</p>
  <p>taskkill /im SERVIC~1.EXE /f /t</p>
  <p>taskkill /im DataLayer.exe /f /t</p>
  <p>taskkill /im DATALA~1.exe /f /t</p>
  <p>taskkill /im ApplicationInstaller.exe /f /t</p>
  <p>sleep 8</p>
  <p>start &quot;Restarting Nokia PC Suite&quot; &quot;\Programme\Nokia\Nokia PC Suite 6\LaunchApplication.exe&quot; 
  -onlytray</p>
  <p>rem Finished</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Nokia PC Suite versions before 6.6 change &quot;LaunchApplication.exe&quot; into &quot;Launch 
Application 2.exe&quot;.</p>
<p>The sleep 8 command allows you to press Ctrl + C or close the windows to abort 
before reloading.</p>
<p>2005-03-24 – Mark Matheson adds: If you like, you can add the following line 
before rem Finished to restart the Synchronizer as well:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>start &quot;Restarting Nokia PC Sync&quot; &quot;\Program Files\Nokia\Nokia PC Suite 6\PCSync2.exe&quot;

<p>Initially I couldn't bring myself to restart the program automatically, because 
I didn't want to keep it loaded, but I soon changed my mind and now have it loaded 
automatically, keep it loaded and reload it if it fails.</p>
<p>2005-03-09 – Jim Margolis writes, related to a cable connection: The solution 
to make it re-connect that I've found is to open the PC Suite &quot;Manage Connections&quot;, 
highlight the CA-42 cable, press &quot;configure&quot; and change the port from the one that 
is the correct one for the USB (COM3 in this instance) to one of the other com 
ports in the list (COM1 works for this) and hitting OK. PC Suite then pops up two 
messages about how it can't use that port. I click OK to both. At this point PC 
Suite finally says the phone is not connected (even though it is still plugged 
into the cable). – Now I can hit &quot;configure&quot; again, and I go set it back to com 
3, and tell it OK. – Since the phone is still plugged into the cable, it takes 
about 5 seconds, and PC Suite re-discovers that it's there, it says connected now 
and this time it really is. This has not been tried with any other connection type 
like Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Occasionally the cause of a disconnection is in the Bluetooth system, rather 
than in the Nokia software. In this case it helps to recycle (disable and re-enable) 
the Bluetooth hardware or the USB controller if the Bluetooth hardware is external 
and connected through USB. This can be done with a batch file using the devcon 
tool available from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Please add a comment below, if you find any improvement.</p>
<h2>Error message: Search Engine – Unable to create Contact Finder. Please reinstall 
PC Suite.</h2>
<p>This is a defect in version 6.6 before release 18. Download and install the 
latest version of Nokia PC Suite to repair it.</p>
<h1>Synchronization</h1>
<p>Nokia PC Suite contains a program to synchronize phone data with data in your 
computer's organizer, usually Microsoft Outlook. Interestingly, the synchronizer 
can also synchronize your contacts (only the contacts) with Outlook Express or, 
more precisely, with the Windows Address Book (WAB) that Outlook Express also uses.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this program has at least one terrible defect, leading to the 
loss of user data without the user being alerted. Clandestinely erasing user data 
is about the worst crime a programmer can commit, but these days we have to put 
up even with this.</p>
<p>What happens is that at least one field in the WAB, the comments field, is fairly 
long, which it usually needs to be if you want to store arbitrary information with 
your contacts. The phone or the synchronizer crops this field to a mere 60 characters 
and doesn't tell you that all the rest has been destroyed.</p>
<p>If you make any change to a contact in the phone, even if you don't touch and 
don't even look at the comments field, the next time you synchronize, the entire 
contact record will be copied back to your computer, and the cropped data is gone 
for good, because the field is overwritten in your computer with the cropped 60 
character field as well. In effect, the phone destroys data on your computer. An 
interesting proposition!</p>
<p>There are several more problems. When I use the Nokia Phone Browser, it shows 
a lot of obsolete contacts that have long been deleted, but the phone itself does 
not show these contacts. I first thought that a crude workaround could be to delete 
all contacts in the phone from time to time, then resynch all of them from the 
computer, but this doesn't work either. The current workaround is not to use the 
Contacts in the Nokia Phone Browser.</p>
<p>Another problem is that the phone doesn't distinguish between the several address 
fields and puts them all into one, separating them by a comma and a space. When 
you synchronize in the other direction, back into the computer, it doesn't go the 
opposite way and splits this field up again, using the commas it inserted earlier. 
Instead it keeps the entire address in the street field. This is bearable, though 
incredibly stupid.</p>
<p>What's worse, when you enter or change a contact name in the phone that includes 
a middle initial, the synch program considers the middle initial to be part of 
the last name and puts it in front of the last name in the last name field in the 
WAB.</p>
<p>A crude workaround for this is to connect the middle initial to the first name 
by an underline character and thus write it into the first name field in the first 
place, always leaving the middle initial field empty.</p>
<p>The general workaround for all these problems is to make changes only on the 
computer and thus synchronize only one way, from computer to phone. Obviously this 
diminishes the funcionality of the phone severely, but that's how it is. If you 
have to make a change on the phone, write a note instead, then copy the change 
into the contact on your computer later. Very stupid, but I cannot find any better 
way.</p>
<p>The other alternative is to restrict yourself already on the computer, i.e. 
don't use middle initials, never write 61 characters into the comments field, and 
put up with the address being squeezed into the street field.</p>
<p>I have a procedure to export the WAB to Excel, but it is somewhat awkward. If 
there are many requests for this, I may one day be willing to write it down in 
step-by-step fashion. In short, it entails exporting the WAB to a CSV file, creating 
an empty Excel sheet, setting all cell formats to text, not standard, copying the 
CSV file into the first column, then using the text-to-data function of Excel to 
spread the data out into the cells. You cannot simply load the file into Excel, 
because it will take telephone numbers as numbers and reformat them into garbage.</p>
<p>This procedure also works the other way, but when you do this, you lose all 
groups information and have to recreate the groups by hand.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>Syncing with the 6230 can be done&nbsp;natively (for the address book) using 
	iSync, a free part of OS X 10.4,&nbsp;and the Address Book on the Mac.</p>
	<p>Mac users also have another package called PhoneDirector that can sync a 
	LOT more of the&nbsp; phone—pretty much all of what PC Suite does.</p>
	<p>PC Suite works well in Parallels using XP Pro and a USB cable to 
	the&nbsp;phone.</p>

<p>Thanks for the good information, Paul!</p>
<h1>Nokia Phone Browser – Messages</h1>
<p>The Nokia Phone Browser is a catastrophe when it comes to text messages. If 
you have set your phone to automatically overwrite the oldest messages in both 
the inbox and the sent items folder, which to me seems the only sensible setting 
that doesn't require babysitting the phone, then the Nokia Phone Browser will do 
very ugly things.</p>
<p>As soon as the phone's text message store is full and the phone begins to replace 
old messages automatically, the Nokia Phone Browser will fail every time any folder 
is replicated between computer and phone. The error message will say that the phone's 
memory is full (an obvious lie) and that you should delete some messages from the 
phone.</p>
<p>If you do that, things get even worse. Since the replication process starts 
automatically after any change or after some time, you cannot prevent it when you 
make changes, like deleting messages, on the computer.</p>
<p>The Nokia Phone Browser will then double and triple many messages on the phone, 
not only in the folder you're viewing, but in all folders. I've seen all messages 
tenfold in the archive folder, which had only a few messages in it. As soon as 
you try to delete messages on the computer or on the phone, the freed space will 
be filled with more duplicates.</p>
<p>It is difficult to recover from this, short of ignoring and never again entering 
the messages of the Nokia Phone Browser. As soon as you inadvertently enter it 
again, it will immediately begin to replicate and produce more errors.</p>
<p>The only way I have found to recover from this situation at all is to delete 
all messages from the mirror folders in the computer, which are in your user profile 
in the folder Phone Browser, but leave the folder.xml file in place. Then delete 
many messages in the phone, so only a few remain.</p>
<p>This will make it work, but only for a short time. As soon as more messages 
accumulate in the phone, the same defect will crop up again.</p>
<p>I must admit that I have never seen any software in my whole life that was so 
destructive to my personal data and so idiotically programmed, not to mention that 
this is a version 6.6 that has gone through many updates and fixes. Not that other 
software is perfect, but Nokia takes the currently widespread unreliability of 
computer software to new heights.</p>
<p>If anybody has tried a similar function on a mobile phone from another maker, 
like Motorola or Sony Ericsson,
please report here. Add a comment or reply below.</p>

<p>This was posted by Miksu on the Nokia discussions:<br />
(discussions.europe.nokia.com), under /discussions/board/message?board.id=connectivity&amp;message.id=6267</p>
<p>"If that did not help, could you check this:<br />
1. Click Start &gt; Run &gt; give command RegEdit.exe &gt; OK<br />
2. Open key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\R oot\<br />
3. Select WPD &gt; Edit &gt; Permission<br />
-&gt; could you list what permission you have in there ?</p>
<p>(I have everyone with Read permission and SYSTEM with full Control &amp; Read permission) "</p>
<p>Well, I had no entry for Everyone. So I added one, with only read permission.</p>
