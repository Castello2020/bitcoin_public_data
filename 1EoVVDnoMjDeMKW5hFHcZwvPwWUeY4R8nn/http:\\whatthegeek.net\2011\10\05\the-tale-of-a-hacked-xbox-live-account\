<p>On September 6th, just after 9 AM, I received an email informing me that my purchase of 1600 Microsoft points had been unsuccessful. This was something of a surprise, as I had not attempted to buy any Microsoft points that day, so I logged into my Xbox Live account to find out what was going on.<span id="more-86"></span></p>
<p>Sure enough, all of the Microsoft points that were stored in my XBL account had been spent on in game items for FIFA 11 (I don&#8217;t own that game&#8230; hell, I don&#8217;t even like soccer video games) and whoever spent my MS points had then tried to purchase more. Presumably, when that purchase failed, they abandoned my account and went on to steal from some other unsuspecting gamer.</p>
<p>Upon making this discovery, I promptly called Xbox customer support. An apathetic young man who&#8217;s name escapes me at the moment answered, and after asking me a long series of questions designed to verify my identity, he told me that my account would be locked for &#8220;up to 25 days&#8221; while the issue was investigated.  He ended the call by reminding me to check out Xbox.com for more information on all the cool services I wouldn&#8217;t be using for the next month, adding insult to injury.</p>
<p>After about two weeks had passed, I decided to call in just to see if there was any news on the investigation. After navigating through the series of prompts 1-800-4-MY-XBOX had to offer, a woman with a thick Indian accent informed me that it would actually take 21 business days, not 25 calendar days, and she said I&#8217;d probably hear back sometime in October.</p>
<p>Finally on Monday October 3rd my Xbox Live account was reinstated, and Microsoft provided a code for a free month of XBL without my having to ask for it. Unfortunately, after following the instructions provided by Microsoft&#8217;s customer service department via email, I was unable to redeem that code. It turns out that by recovering my gamertag to my console I actually flagged the account to be locked again. Fortunately, this issue was corrected by a five minute phone call to customer service.</p>
<p>Once my account was back in order, I replied to the email I received with several questions I wanted answered. Below is an excerpt from that email.</p>
<blockquote><p>First, how was my account breached? I don&#8217;t do anything with my windows live ID other than visit Xbox.com, and log into my Xbox 360, and I don&#8217;t give out passwords. For my protection, I&#8217;d like to know how the breach happened so I can take any necessary actions to prevent it in the future.</p>
<p>Second, which parts of my account were accessed by the hacker? If they accessed my credit card information in any way, I need to know about it so that I can contact any of the cards that may have been affected in order to prevent fraudulent charges.</p>
<p>Third, how do I go about removing all of my credit cards from my account? I will use cards purchased from stores to up my XBL subscription, and to purchase MS points &#8211; I no longer need, nor want any credit cards associated with this account, as it has proven to be insecure. email.</p></blockquote>
<p>All of those points seemed like reasonable requests to me. Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal would most likely agree with me, given that he had some <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2011/04/26/sonys-failure-to-report-data-breach-incurs-ct-senator-blumentha/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.joystiq.com']);">choice words</a> for Sony earlier this year when the Playstation Network was hacked, and millions of customers had their personal information stolen. In a letter to Jack Tretton, president and CEO of SCEA, Senator Blumenthal said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>When a data breach occurs, it is essential that customers be immediately notified about whether and to what extent their personal and financial information has been compromised. Additionally, PlayStation Network users should be provided with financial data security services, including free access to credit reporting services, for two years, the costs of which should be borne by Sony. Affected individuals should also be provided with sufficient insurance to protect them from the possible financial consequences of identity theft.</p></blockquote>
<p>Microsoft doesn&#8217;t quite see eye to eye with me, or Senator Blumenthal, as evidenced by their response to my request.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Xbox LIVE Customer:</p>
<p>We apologize, but we are not at liberty to explain our investigation process. However $ 16.03 has been refunded to your account. Refunds could take up to 5-10 business days prior to displaying in your billing activity. It may take 30 days or longer to appear on your statement, depending on your financial institution&#8217;s policies.</p>
<p>If you have any concerns regarding this notice, you may either reply to this message or contact Xbox Customer Support directly using the information available at http://www.xbox.com/support/contact and reference the Service Request number above.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Xbox LIVE Escalations Team</p></blockquote>
<p>I emailed them back to let them know that I did appreciate the refund, but that I&#8217;d still need to know how my personal information was accessed in order to take any necessary precautions, and as of this writing, I haven&#8217;t received a response (though I&#8217;ll update this post if I do).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that they completely dodged the bit about removing credit cards from my XBL account. That&#8217;s because you have to have at least one payment method associated with your Xbox Live account. If you want to remove the credit card associated with Xbox Live autobilling, you&#8217;ll first have to associate a different card, or your Paypal account with XBL.</p>
<p>So, after a month long investigation, Microsoft will only acknowledge what I knew on September 6th &#8211; that someone other than myself accessed my Xbox Live account. They are either unable, or unwilling to give me any information about how my account was accessed, or about which (if any) pieces of my personal information were taken by the hacker. In other words, someone gained access to my account, may or may not have accessed my personal information, and spent my Microsoft points, and Microsoft does not intend to help to protect me from any of the potential hazards associated with having my personal information accessed.</p>
<p>At least when Sony gave out my personal information they offered identity theft protection to make up for it.</p>
<p>I reached out to Xbox Live&#8217;s Director of Policy and Enforcement Stephen Toulouse prior to writing this article for information on Microsoft&#8217;s end of the investigation process, but unfortunately, he did not return my email.</p>
<p>With no word from Microsoft on what information the hacker may have accessed, and no concrete information from Toulouse on Microsoft&#8217;s hacked account investigation process, I&#8217;m left feeling like my Xbox Live account may wind up being a security liability.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Both <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/10/xbox-live-users-experiencing-hacked-accounts-fifa-11-and-12-purchases.ars" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://arstechnica.com']);">Ars Technica</a> and <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5849835/xbox-live-users-are-being-hacked-for-virtual-fifa-gear" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://gizmodo.com']);">Gizmodo</a> have received the following response from Microsoft after inquiring about the recent rash of XBL hacking:</p>
<blockquote><p>We do not have any evidence the Xbox LIVE service has been compromised. We take the security of our service seriously and work on an ongoing basis to improve it against evolving threats. However, a limited number of members have contacted us regarding unauthorized access to their accounts by outside individuals. We are working with our impacted members directly to resolve any unauthorized changes to their accounts. As always, we highly recommend our members follow the Xbox LIVE Account Security guidance provided at www.xbox.com/security to protect your account</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, at least the entirety of Xbox Live wasn&#8217;t hacked &#8211; that&#8217;s good news, right? This is still a fairly widespread issue if the comments and forums across the internet are any indication, and Microsoft would do well to <a href="http://whatthegeek.net/2011/10/14/dear-microsoft-please-plug-these-holes/" >consider additional security measures</a> to prevent future hacking attempts from being successful.</p>

<p>A few days later someone stole my GT name (it&#8217;s not something you can just make up) SO I rang back MS and said Ummm I want my name back too why didn&#8217;t you block anyone from taking it??? The thing on the line said OH you want everything back? I&#8217;ll make a note and we might be able to get it back for you.</p>
<p>Now this might not seem like a big deal to you but it is to me, I have decide if I do not get everything back I&#8217;m talking to my lawyer. I want to know why this is happening. To mention If you have a your GT attached to a WP7 phone you can&#8217;t change your password unless you want to lose all your games and data, I tried so thanks again MS</p>

<p> I received an e-mail Tuesday about the purchase of 6000 MS points, followed by an e-mail for 4000 MS points and an e-mail about an additional e-mail address being added to my account.  I clicked the link to deny the e-mail address and immediately changed my Xbox Live password online.  I called Microsoft, who asked a long series of questions and stated that an investigation would begin and that it could take up to 25 days.  I asked about a refund and they stated that was dependent on the investigation.  Not liking that answer, I called my bank who immediately refunded the amount and issued me a new card.  I think I&#8217;m going to leave my old, useless card on the account and just pay with gift cards from now on&#8230;</p>
<p>The part that sucks is the account is locked during the investigation and I&#8217;m unable to use my Netflix streaming.</p>

We are all connected via the family program and my dad is the &#8220;primary account.&#8221; I put my credit card on his account so I could purchase points when I needed them and transfer them over to my account. His account was stolen and my card ended up being charged 6000 MS points. Whoever stole also was playing Fifa 12 on both my dad&#8217;s and sister&#8217;s account although we have never owned a Fifa game. </p>

<p>FALSE. You can use prepaid subscription codes from pcgamesupply, Amazon, Gamestop, 7-11, and many, many other online and brick-and-mortar resellers, and never have a card on your account; heck, since you were involved in such a problem, why not call and ask to switch to prepaid cards, to convert time remaining into prepaid codes. </p>

This gigantic troll continues to club us down and offers little to no sating to constant questions. I understand they have a product, and anything worth value is worth protecting. Yet Microsoft is SO big they continuously fob their noses into the air and run over customers by their girth alone. </p>
<p>I am a student, I don&#8217;t have uber amounts of money laying around. These Fifa louses sucked the money from my bank account, so much so that I cannot afford the dentist appointment I had set up today and my back tooth is killing me. Maybe that&#8217;s why this post is so grumpy sounding.. yet I digress. 25 days just for the investigation THEN they MAY refund my money? I already called my credit company and they want to wait for the Microsoft reports. *sighs* I had to cancel my card and wait for a new one.. not that I have that much LEFT in my bank account at the moment. Not to mention the representative was nothing but haughty, rude, and demeaning to every small question I dared to asked. I know I might not sound like it at the moment but I was nothing but polite and patient during the course of our conversation.</p>
<p>Also to those of you saying I was asking for it by having payment information online, go suck the proverbial big one. That&#8217;s like saying I should never feel free to use any services that offer &#8216;protection&#8217; against fraud. No one is ever asking for identity theft or fraud to occur. I must admit though that I don&#8217;t plan on using credit card information for any Xbox live account I MIGHT continue to use, and that&#8217;s a big one considering they are being so close lipped about this situation. I&#8217;m a customer, I pay you to service me, when the customer goes, the money goes with.. sadly Microsoft will survive thanks to their bullying tactics and egotistical manner. Hail consumerism. </p>
<p>My only question to Microsoft when I recieve my email regarding the investigation will be, When is enough, enough? We pay for your services, you should cater to our questions, and answer our simple requests about WHO got WHAT from OUR accounts. Thank you and good luck to everyone that was ripped off by those simpering monkey gits. </p>

<p>The funny part is that the hacker couldn&#8217;t get any more out of the account, which is probably why we are standing at 75 dollars, not hundreds.  I have to find some humor here, or else I&#8217;d be murderous mad.  Seriously, nice job, jerks.</p>

It sounds like people at xbl need to put out an alert and start being proactive!! This is totally unacceptable.. Then reading you are locked out of your account for weeks while they investigate??? My son saved his money to buy this game&#8230; and now won&#8217;t be able to play online with his friends???

This isn&#8217;t just some 39 year old guy sitting in his moms basement..randomly hacking a couple people&#8230;It&#8217;s been going on for a few months now at least from what I can tell by whole 3 minute investigation..Same thng happening..over and over..people are getting hacked, points added, (I see alot at exactly 10,000)  then games are bought, or tried to before the owner becomes aware and changes his info&#8230;&#8230;.This is so frustrating especially since it is happening so often.. Where was my alert???  Sounds like there has been a breach somewhere up the chain&#8230;. and they are trying to keep it quiet&#8230;..

So pretty much the same story as everyone else.  This is such bullshit.  I don&#8217;t understand why one of the strongest gaming platforms doesn&#8217;t have better security or the sense to TREAT THEIR CUSTOMERS BETTER.. not treat us like criminals and lock us out.  I have to call back with my serial number and I&#8217;m going to be as pushy as I can and ask to speak with supervisors, etc, as well as address the concerns of this post- how did they hack my account, do they have my credit card information, et cetera.  Also I don&#8217;t understand why they have to kick us out of their accounts, rather than letting us play and maybe disabling purchases during the investigation process.  So angry.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-106" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Just happened to me New Year&#8217;s Eve Day &#8230; I received some MS Pre-Paid point cards for xmas &#8230; One 4000 MS Pts and two 1600 Pts &#8230;. I decided to add them to my account so that I could get some DLC and maybe rent a movie or two.  Went to bed with 7200 pts in my account &#8230;<br />
 <br />
Got up the next morning, turned on  my xbox and one of the login messages came up saying &#8220;This account was previously logged into another console&#8221; &#8230;. Not knowing the gravity of what this really meant, I just dismissed it.<br />
 <br />
Went online, played some multiplayer games &#8230; That night I was settling in and thought of renting a movie &#8230; Made my movie selection, went to purchase and saw that I only had 20 MS pts left in my account.  WTF!!!!<br />
 <br />
I looked at my download history on my console &#8230; But the only things that showed up are DLC and movies that I downloaded myself.  So I logged into XBL Website and looked at the account history &#8230; And there is was Microsoft Gold Jumbo Pack.  They have also associated another email address with my Live Account.  Luckily, the credit card that I associated with my XBL account only has a $200 credit limit &#8230; So they can&#8217;t get much from me.<br />
 <br />
Looked at my Achievements &#8230; FIFA 12 is showing up with 2 achievements unlocked.  I immediately called Microsoft and told them about the breach &#8230; I can&#8217;t stand sports games, I personally would never play one or pick one up .. So it&#8217;s pretty ironic that it&#8217;s a sports game that has created this security loop hole.<br />
 <br />
The MS Support agent went on to tell me that EA Games is running some type of in game promotion for the FIFA game that allows players to win MS Points and then redeem them for cash in the form of a check that is mailed to them.  Isn&#8217;t that just awesome.  Way to go EA!!  Thanks to your unsecure &#8220;promotion&#8221; hundreds if not thousands of us are getting hacked around the globe.<br />
 <br />
After reading everything below I don&#8217;t know why we someone hasn&#8217;t started a class action lawsuit against Microsoft or EA games at this point.  This is Theft and Identity Fraud.<br />
 <br />
So I&#8217;m in the same boat &#8230; Account is locked out for the next 3-6 weeks .. No Netflix or Hulu streaming &#8230; No playing online with my friends enjoying the many games that I got for Christmas.   I know it could be much much worse after reading that some people were hit up for 10k or more MS point purchases.  I think that I will be removing my credit card from my XBL account and associating my PayPal account going forward.  At least with PayPal, I have it set up that in order to log into PayPal a security code is sent to my cell phone and that code must be inputting within 3 minutes of receipt.  So I feel that this account is at least locked down and secure.</p>
<p>I truly feel for anyone that has had this happen to them .. It feels like a complete violation and if Microsoft or EA would only fess up or at the very least close down this security loop hole it might make us feel better about using their offered services.</p>

My 360 hadn&#8217;t left my closet for nearly a year, and one day I decided to hop on and try out some new games. The next day, well, same story as the rest of you, and now I&#8217;m locked out of my own account while they perform their overstated, month long &#8220;investigation&#8221; that anyone with the access could do in a matter of minutes. A month? Are these people serious?</p>
<p>Why the lock out at all? Why don&#8217;t they just temporarily remove our payment plans and remaining MS points so we can continue using our account without worrying about money being lost if it&#8217;s broken into again? But of course not, that would actually make sense and be customer friendly. Microsoft obviously wants us to have to decide between losing a sum of money ($90 in my case) or being locked from what we thought was our property for up to 2 months.</p>
<p>It makes me ill that these crooks, and sadly I&#8217;m referring to Microsoft and not the &#8220;hackers&#8221;, get away with this crap.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-113" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>It literally just happened to me.  I was playing with a buddy on some random indie game and I got kicked off live.   After cursing my Internet and logging back in I got the &#8220;previously logged into another xbox&#8221; message.  I immediately knew I was being hacked.  As I went to pick up my laptop to Chang passwords, my girlfriends account logged in and her account was on my console, she didn&#8217;t own one.  Called just to make sure.  So I logged her in and changed her password and as I was doing that , my gt logged out.  I quickly logged in and same &#8220;other console&#8221; message.   I quickly changed my password aswell.   Luckily I still had my 2000 mp and kept force logging this guy off before he could spend my point and mess up my account.  Now I have to wait for tomorrow and call in, and I&#8217;m totally looking forward to having my account locked.   It better be back by mass effect 3 and raccoon city.   I don&#8217;t see how my account which gets logged in here in Los Angeles, CA one minute and the get logged in the UK doesn&#8217;t raise a red flag over at Microsoft.<br />
My heart goes out to those of you who lost money and have lost accounts and spent time waiting for Microsoft to &#8220;figure out&#8221; what happened.  If for some odd reason I end up losing my account, xbox will lose a long and faithful customer for good. </p>

This blows!!! its been 20 days today and they said the max was 15 days for me!!!! the only reason I&#8217;m not switching over to playstation right now is because they are a month late for DLCs&#8230;..Fuck You Microsoft Customer Support.</p>

It tells a great story, and really makes you examine your actions as the player. The payoff at the end is crazy good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; is subjective. If you really despise first person shooters and sci fi stories you&amp;#039;re not going to like it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally this is one of the few games I point non-gamers at as a good representative of what the medium can do when it comes to storytelling and engaging the player. Infinite has a great plot, a very well realized world, and good characters. It&amp;#039;s just a great game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Video-Games/Is-BioShock-Infinite-really-that-good"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'>Is BioShock Infinite really that good?</a></li>

In fact, I&amp;#039;m with you - it&amp;#039;d probably be an interesting setting for an AC game. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ubisoft picks their settings for AC games in a very methodical way. They look at what sort of settings are going to fit well with current &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="/News-Entertainment-and-Pop-Culture"&gt;pop culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; trends, and they also do a lot of surveys and polls to see what settings people are interested in. If you&amp;#039;d like to see an AC set in India, keep talking about it - if other people agree, and Ubisoft sees the public interest in an Indian AC I&amp;#039;d imagine they would at least give it some thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Video-Games/Why-cant-we-have-an-Indian-themed-Assassins-Creed"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'>Why can't we have an Indian themed Assassin's Creed?</a></li>

That&amp;#039;s sort of a reductive summary of the game, but I&amp;#039;ve got a lot of ground to cover here. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Borderlands 2 improved on the original in just about every way, and it&amp;#039;s well worth your time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;X-Com Enemy Unknown is an excellent strategy game. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dishonored really cranked up the volume on player agency in stealth games&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assassin&amp;#039;s Creed III has some problems, but it tells a great story and hey, you can kill redcoats with a tomahawk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need for Speed Most Wanted is a great racing game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;If you prefer your racing games full of crashes and mayhem, it&amp;#039;s the racing game for you. If you prefer a little more precision, check out Forza Horizon - also a great game. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halo 4 is a very methodical shooter, and a very well crafted game. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you prefer your shooters fast and loose, Black Ops II is a solid installment in the series. Treyarch didn&amp;#039;t make any &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="/Earth"&gt;earth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; shattering changes to the CoD formula but the changes they made might make you rethink the way you approach CoD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Video-Games/What-are-the-best-video-games-of-2012"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'>What are the best video games of 2012?</a></li>
