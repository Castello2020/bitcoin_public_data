		<p>Despite the luxurious three figure income that freelance writing provides, I still find myself seeking side work from time to time. Fortunately, I&#8217;m not just a snarky writer, I also happen to be pretty good at fixing broken electronics as well. I often post my repair services on Craigslist, but recently I&#8217;ve noticed a lot of my ads for Xbox 360 repairs getting flagged down. Given the fact that I don&#8217;t offer any modding services that violate the Craigslist terms of service (and the law for that matter) I was surprised my listings were getting taken down. I was even more surprised when I saw listings going down within minutes of going live on Craigslist. <span id="more-35"></span></p>
<p>After this happened a few times, I decided to check out the policies governing flagging on Craigslist. From the Craigslist <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/help/flags_and_community_moderation" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.craigslist.org']);">page that explains flagging</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Free classified ads receiving a sufficient number of qualified negative flags are subject to automated removal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Based on that description my assumption was that multiple users had to flag a listing down in order to get it removed from the site. After Googling around for a bit, I discovered that several <a href="http://www.blackhatworld.com/blackhat-seo/craigslist-other-classified-ads-sites/210103-cl-auto-flagging-any-recomended-programs-techniques.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.blackhatworld.com']);">autoflagging</a> programs are available for purchase, and they make it really easy for one person to get a posting removed from Craigslist. Autoflagging software connects to a proxy server, flags the posting in question, switches proxies, flags the listing again, and repeats that process until the listing goes down.</p>
<p>With this new-found knowledge I was certain I had cracked the case. Obviously, another repairman was using an autoflagger to remove my listings. After contacting a few other local repairmen in an effort to find the culprit, I found that I wasn&#8217;t the only one having this problem. At least two other repairmen were going through the exact same thing, so we all contacted Craigslist about the issue. Craigslist never responded to me (or the other repairmen), so I decided to dig a little deeper.</p>
<p>I started adding tracking code from <a href="http://statcounter.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://statcounter.com']);">Stat Counter</a> to each of my posts in an effort to track down the flagger. There are a couple of ways to determine which users are the ones doing the flagging. The last person to visit a listing before it goes down flagged it down, and there&#8217;s a good chance that anyone visiting a listing multiple times in less than a minute flagged it down.</p>
<p>I was completely surprised at the results I got from Stat Counter. It turns out that one single person making no effort to disguise their IP address, or location was responsible for almost every flag. In fact, it appears that all they have to do to get a listing removed is flag it over and over again.</p>
<p><a href="http://whatthegeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/craigslist-flagging.jpg" ><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37" title="craigslist flagging" src="http://whatthegeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/craigslist-flagging.jpg" alt="" width="617" height="693" /></a></p>
<p>Just to be clear, that flagger wasn&#8217;t solely responsible for every listing that got flagged down, but almost every listing they attacked did get flagged down. One listing actually got removed after one single flag from this user.</p>
<p>I contacted Craigslist with this new found information, but I never received a response. No system is perfect, but it seems that it should take more than one flagger to get a listing removed from Craigslist. The current flagging system leaves the door open for a great deal of abuse. Anyone looking to bump competitors off of Craigslist can do so with minimal effort.</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s the solution? Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t have an answer to that question. Every time a listing goes down in this manner, I contact both Craigslist, and the flagger&#8217;s ISP with all of the relevant information, but it seems like neither is willing or able to do anything about it.</p>

<p>2. CL keeps making it harder for individuals to post bad ads(captchas and better, phone verification) while the SPAM floods in with bots and scamware anyway in spite of the best efforts who take the ToU seriously.</p>
<p>3. The CL &#8216;flagging forum&#8217; is a BLESSING resulting in many improved ads and more responsible CL users. We just need more volunteers to help educate the horrible abusers who are in denial about OBVIOUS abuses and entitlement issues.</p>

My postings were neither offensive, rude or violated rules of posting. Obviously there is no monitoring by CL in regards to flagging. Proven by them not responding to email. I too have emailed to no avail. I&#8217;m sure that when used appropriately flagging can be beneficial. But of  course there are those that use it as a tool other than intended. Thanks again for the insight!</p>

Craigs List need to remove the flagging function until they can make improvements on it so that they can preview the ad before it is deleted to prevent spiteful vindictive flagging.</p>

I&#8217;m a DJ and this person is trying to get a DJ for $120 on NYE. most likely he&#8217;s getting paid $800+ and were flagging this piece of shit. we flag any BS Cheap DJ post or DJ&#8217;s posting for cheap. they don&#8217;t understand our equipment is not cheap to repair. some speakers cost so much to repair in the range of $600 to $1000 each blown woofer. here is the add. DJ Needed For NYE Party (Equipment Provided)</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My friends and I are having a pretty small but still super sick New<br />
Year&#8217;s Eve Party at my buddy&#8217;s place in Woodland Hills and we need a DJ.<br />
 We&#8217;re all in the film industry and have our own equipment, tracks,<br />
turntables, speakers, etc. and we could ordinarily do it ourselves but<br />
but just need someone to spin the night away. All you have to do is show<br />
 up, be ready to bump it up, and enjoy yourself. We&#8217;ll provide gear and a<br />
 good time. </p>
<p>Being a small party, we can&#8217;t afford to pay that well, BUT we can give<br />
$120 for you to spin from 10 PM to 2 AM (4 Hours), give you free booze,<br />
and keep you on retainer as a DJ for any events we do (We&#8217;re a<br />
videography/live event company and are always asked DJ recommendations<br />
for big events). </p>
<p>Questions, concerns, or ideas? Let me know! Thanks!</p>
<p> Location: Woodland Hillsit&#8217;s NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests Compensation: 120 </p>

It takes a coward to flag posts. If you have a problem with an ad, message the poster and confront them like you still have your nads attached. </p>

Ghosting is actually automated, and has nothing to do with whether or not you annoy CL.. A post gets ghosted when it gets flagged too often over a certain period of time. I don&#8217;t know that CL has publicly admitted to the specific numbers of posts or time periods that they use to determine whether a post gets ghosted, but the process is automated and has nothing to do with them punishing you for reposting &#8211; they&#8217;re punishing you for reposting something that gets flagged down each time it goes up. Now, like I said in the article, flagging is broken, and as such, so is ghosting, but it&#8217;s important to understand how it all works. </p>

<p>I tested the stat counter by viewing the ad, and seeing if it caught my own IP &#8211; it did. From there, I let it run, and the results were what&#8217;s listed above &#8211; someone hitting the ad from the same IP over and over again was getting the ad flagged down. I&#8217;m not exactly sure how or why it worked for them, but it did work for them. </p>

Most flagging that I have encountered is due to selfish people who dont have a life and cannot compete with others so they flag their competition.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a war. So the flagging providers make money, which who know may give some kickbacks. I wont mention names.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a war and we are forced to retaliate in kind.<br />
Go use some else other that CL. No because despite the BS that we have to put up with it is still a free source of business leads.</p>
<p>So the flagging wars will continue until someone gets hurt.<br />
Trust me someone will and then there will be some sort of lawsuit to shake things down.</p>
<p>Hang in their fellow posters, alot of us feel the pain.</p>
<p>Remember!<br />
Never Give Up!<br />
Never Surrender!<br />
Flag your enemies into the ground if you can find them!<br />
If CL is reading this do the letters &#8220;FY&#8221; mean anything to you, because apparently you don&#8217;t give a darn.</p>

<p>All of you who think that you should be able to just abuse the site anyway you want need to use a different site.</p>
<p>It is part of the Terms of Use that y&#8217;all AGREED to. It is your responsibility as part of the CL community to moderate the site. That includes FLAGGING ads that are miscat (the worst abusers are those who &#8216;target market&#8217;&#8230; assuming they are ENTITLED to post where ever they feel they&#8217;ll get the most exposure, regardless of what category or local that is in).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take For Sale/Farm &amp; Garden as an example. Why would it be acceptable to post Boarding? Or Training? Or Lessons? Or Hay delivery? in a For sale section? What exactly are you selling?! NOTHING. But heaven forbid anyone point out there IS a VERY APPROPRIATE SERVICES OFFERED/Farm &amp; Garden section!<br />
@twitter-375507156:disqus <br />
Then you piss and groan when your ad is deleted when you intentionally posted in the obviously wrong category!</p>
<p>All of you here bitching about CL flagging are holier then thou jerks who think you should be able to abuse the FREE website without regard to the Terms of Use.</p>
<p>Do what you AGREED to do&#8230; post ONLY in the site most local to you. Post ONLY in the one category that is appropriate to what you&#8217;re offering. QUIT eBegging for free shit. No one want to police you.. you&#8217;re attitudes leave no choice if we want CL to remain marginally useful to the majority.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-163" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>What you&#8217;re describing is how the flagging system on CL is supposed to work. In your scenario, ads that broke the rules get flagged down while legit ads get to stay up. In theory, it&#8217;s a sound system. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not how flagging actually works. If you don&#8217;t believe my story for whatever reason, look around the comments here. People posting posting legit ads in the right category in their local CL  are having their ads flagged down immediately. They are using CL as it is intended to be used, but they&#8217;re still being flagged down by people who are abusing the flagging system. </p>
<p>You&#8217;re right when you say that someone misusing CL deserves to get flagged down. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people who didn&#8217;t do anything wrong that are getting flagged down too. </p>
<p>I would also argue that the TOS didn&#8217;t intend for people to police CL with bots designed to flag posts down automatically based on specific keywords or phrases. Further, these bots allow one person to do the flagging of hundreds of people &#8211; that would also seem to go against the TOS. These are the problems I&#8217;m addressing with this article, and these are the problems a lot of the commenters here are angry about. Just because you personally haven&#8217;t had a problem, that doesn&#8217;t mean that the flagging system is working as CL intended. </p>

So, a post that got flagged down by an automatic flagging bot would look the same to them as one flagged down for legit reasons. </p>
<p>In either case they would try to find something wrong with the ad. If they&#8217;re trying to find something wrong with an ad that was flagged down by a bot, nothing they say is going to be helpful &#8211; if you tweak your ad you&#8217;ll probably still get flagged down by the same bot. </p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-156" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>It has nothing to do whether we understand flagging or not. Most of us who have repeatedly gotten our ads flagged have looked there first to see if we are violating the rules. I&#8217;ve had numerous ads flagged.  How about &#8220;Free queen matress, boxframe, and springs&#8221;. In the free section. Down within one hour.<br />
Or free kitchen tearout. U demo, u haul, free. the listed items. Down within 1 hour. Posted in free section. with very good, not too big 4 pictures.<br />
I&#8217;ve put very benign ads on such as selling coffee table with pictures for reasonable price in the appropriate category. Down in one hour.<br />
I&#8217;m suspicious now that if you&#8217;ve had one ad flagged many more will be, and the more flagged the worse it gets.<br />
I&#8217;ve spent an hour or two reading the rules and trying to understand what it is I might be doing wrong.<br />
If you can track their IP they might be able to flag you based on my IP so it doesn&#8217;t matter what I put where.<br />
Free moving boxes in the free section shouldn&#8217;t be flagged!<br />
Personally I think CL has it ass backwards. The poster should have some protection but all the benefit goes to the flaggers.<br />
I&#8217;ve even thought of starting a new &#8216;CL&#8217;.<br />

I&#8217;ve recently had an ad taken down for a short term domestic gig, which I revised several times and put back up. I&#8217;m assuming it was probably taken down because it was assumed I was spamming and posting it to much</p>
<p>But, when I went to the community forums asking for help, I was told the reason it was probably flagged from two different people were because</p>
<p>1. It was too long &#8220;Write an ad, not a novel&#8221;<br />
2. You want THEM to supply the food?</p>
<p>WTF, where does it say that people can flag because they personally don&#8217;t like it? Here in the terms of use it says</p>
<p>A user shall not &#8220;flag&#8221; (or otherwise seek removal of) content on<br />
craigslist without a personal, good-faith belief that the content<br />
violates the TOU. A user may flag content only on his/her own behalf</p>
<p>and my post, violates none of the rules in the TOU below:</p>
<p>&#8220;Content prohibited from craigslist includes but is not limited to: (1)<br />
illegal content; (2) content in facilitation of the creation,<br />
advertising, distribution, provision or receipt of illegal goods or<br />
services; (3) offensive content (including, without limitation,<br />
defamatory, threatening, hateful or pornographic content); (4) content<br />
that discloses another&#8217;s personal, confidential or proprietary<br />
information; (5) false or fraudulent content (including but not limited<br />
to false, fraudulent or misleading responses to user ads transmitted via<br />
 craigslist); (6) malicious content (including, without limitation,<br />
malware or spyware); (7) content that offers, promotes, advertises, or<br />
provides links to posting or auto-posting products or services, account<br />
creation or auto-creation products or services, flagging or<br />
auto-flagging products or services, bulk telephone numbers, or any other<br />
 product or service that if utilized with respect to craigslist would<br />
violate these TOU or CL&#8217;s other legal rights; and (8) content that<br />
offers, promotes, advertises or provides links to unsolicited products<br />
or services. Other content prohibitions are set forth in guidelines for<br />
particular categories or services on craigslist and all such<br />
prohibitions are expressly incorporated into these TOU as stated in<br />
section 1 above.<br />
&#8221;</p>
<p>I said I thought it was idiotic how someone could flag because they personally didn&#8217;t like it and it could be removed, and they said how dumb it was for me to come here not knowing the rules.  How was I supposed to know people can flag for something that doesn&#8217;t violate the TOU? Where is that in it?</p>

Start a Jonny-come-letely competitive site<br />
Use another ad service (that won&#8217;t get many views)<br />
Hunt down the flagger and &#8230; then what?<br />
Repeatedly re-post so that the flagger needs to work as hard as you (You would need control of a few accounts, and maybe some special software.)</p>

<p>I have used Craigslistadtracker.com and you would be astounded as to who is looking at your ads and from the repeats you can see the flaggers are cowards and hide behind proxies.</p>
<p>Below are Ip addresses I picked up that are looking at my ad.  If you see the IP coming up more than once or from the IP 166 series you can be pretty sure that they are flagging you.</p>
<p>One way to prevent flagging is to post, wait for it to hit then delete.  You will be warned that if you repost within a certain time frame you would be overposting and subject to removal.  What you do is wait until just before the ad expires you repost.  It will repost to the spot that it originally had.  In addition you need to continually change the header on your ad.  Everytime you change the header, the title, the flagger has to reset and begin again.  Takes time but the ad stays up.  The easiest way to change the header is to place a symbol in front of the title.  example,  hot time in the city, change to ^hot time in the city., at the same time indent your ad, it will drive the flaggers crazy.</p>

Ebay has wanted to buy the remaining shares of Craiglist for years. No progress to date. They only own that 1/4 interest purchased many years ago. They need over 50%, or 1/2, to control the company and brand it Ebay with fess of course. Soooo. Ebay has no other options. They need to increase profits and grow the bottom line for it&#8217;s sharelholders. Reducing the amount of successful transaction on Craiglist, causing some to migrate to Ebay for the item, helps them achieve this growth.</p>
<p>Ebay sucks if I am correct about this. Wait a minute, Ebay sucks anyhow!</p>

<p>This is how you sound to me, so please stop talking that uneducated bull-shit and crawl back into the closet, as obviously your not ready to be out in public. </p>
<p>&#8220;shitted&#8221; is not a word and for the love of GOD, there is a shift, space, and comma key. Please learn to use them so you might pass yourself off as even -somewhat- intelligible.  You know they&#8217;re there. </p>
<p>I usually don&#8217;t care about retards on the internet, but you. . you were just so special, I had to make a comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your just an educated fool&#8221; ya know?</p>
<p>As for CL, I only use it to sell feeders and rats. I flag every-so-often, but only when the post actually deserves it.  I.E (that is, since I&#8217;m not sure Kiss_My_ASS would understand) when they are blatantly breaking the rules, or when individuals getting into posting fights. There is a forum for that crap, so nothing irritates me more than two people arguing over how these sorts of posts should be in the forum.</p>
<p>Hell, I&#8217;ve been flagged for selling cheaper feeders. It can be frustrating.</p>

I figure if I get flagged, I deserve it.   There is no way for anyone from CL to stop me creating more accounts.  I change my IP every time I log into my account and clear my cookies too.  </p>

Although, I think one of the potential buyers flagged me to avoid others from seeing it.  I posted it several times and got flagged several times. I had a good price on the object so it sold pretty quickly.  This is not the first time. I have had ads flagged for no apparent reason many times.</p>

First file a small claims suit against the offending IP address. Any amount is fine.<br />
The moment you&#8217;re filed, u have subpoena authority.<br />
Go to any cheap attorney and pay him (I&#8217;ve gotten it done for as little as $203) to file a subpoena against the ISP of that IP address, for any and all records associated with that IP address, including the owner&#8217;s name and address. They MUST comply. If your harasser is going through a proxie, then you must serve a subpoena for each proxie. You follow the bread crumbs back to the source. The last one I did traced back to a guy in Ohio or something who owned a fabric shop. Turned out he was friends with a tattoo artist in Seattle who wanted me flagged off. Nailed &#8216;em. More people need to do this and make it very public. Once you have your culprit, add his name to your suit, and hopefully collect damages. People stupidly say &#8220;stop using Craigslist&#8221;. Right. And the effective alternative is?</p>

However, there is an answer. Somehow come up with a better system. Code it. Start a new coppy-cat site. I realize it would be a late entry in the field, but it seems even late commers get a decent audience with the still high rate of expansion of the web. </p>

They willingly throw their users to the wolves without any desire to protect those who would be discriminated against, ganged up on and annihilated by abusive flaggers &#8211; regardless of how careful the poster is in following the TOU. It&#8217;s a lazy system of managing posts that gives power to lone wolf flaggers or small groups of rogue trolls to delete ANY ad they choose for WHATEVER horrible reason. They say its about the &#8220;community&#8221; when its really just vigilantism. Craig himself avoids any conversation about himself flagging system, which means that he KNOWS that they are culpable for major financial damages by allowing certain posters to rule over others. After all, who designed they system? Who employs it? Who sets the parameters? And why lie about it? Since there are no reasonable options to Craigslist at this point in time I would encourage any and all to challenge this brand of ILLEGAL discrimination and force CL to employ a better system of ad management. One that respects the rights of the user.</p>

This is a attack not only on Craigslist, but on inter-intra state commerce in the United States and a clear and present danger to the flow of information on Craigslist across the United States and the world. Since Craigslist is constantly recruiting these cybers to police their site, they have given them the ability to do so, and are directly complicate in this activity and just as guilty as the people they recruit. They have become the 21st Century Information Nazi&#8217;s, disguised as a classified ad site, which benefits mostly themselves.  Since they do not want to shut down their flagging system and remedy it,<br />
and place other protections to keep their advertisers and users safe, a federal investigation if warranted and will be called for shortly.</p>

It tells a great story, and really makes you examine your actions as the player. The payoff at the end is crazy good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; is subjective. If you really despise first person shooters and sci fi stories you&amp;#039;re not going to like it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally this is one of the few games I point non-gamers at as a good representative of what the medium can do when it comes to storytelling and engaging the player. Infinite has a great plot, a very well realized world, and good characters. It&amp;#039;s just a great game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Video-Games/Is-BioShock-Infinite-really-that-good"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'>Is BioShock Infinite really that good?</a></li>

In fact, I&amp;#039;m with you - it&amp;#039;d probably be an interesting setting for an AC game. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ubisoft picks their settings for AC games in a very methodical way. They look at what sort of settings are going to fit well with current &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="/News-Entertainment-and-Pop-Culture"&gt;pop culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; trends, and they also do a lot of surveys and polls to see what settings people are interested in. If you&amp;#039;d like to see an AC set in India, keep talking about it - if other people agree, and Ubisoft sees the public interest in an Indian AC I&amp;#039;d imagine they would at least give it some thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Video-Games/Why-cant-we-have-an-Indian-themed-Assassins-Creed"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'>Why can't we have an Indian themed Assassin's Creed?</a></li>

That&amp;#039;s sort of a reductive summary of the game, but I&amp;#039;ve got a lot of ground to cover here. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Borderlands 2 improved on the original in just about every way, and it&amp;#039;s well worth your time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;X-Com Enemy Unknown is an excellent strategy game. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dishonored really cranked up the volume on player agency in stealth games&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assassin&amp;#039;s Creed III has some problems, but it tells a great story and hey, you can kill redcoats with a tomahawk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need for Speed Most Wanted is a great racing game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;If you prefer your racing games full of crashes and mayhem, it&amp;#039;s the racing game for you. If you prefer a little more precision, check out Forza Horizon - also a great game. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halo 4 is a very methodical shooter, and a very well crafted game. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you prefer your shooters fast and loose, Black Ops II is a solid installment in the series. Treyarch didn&amp;#039;t make any &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="/Earth"&gt;earth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; shattering changes to the CoD formula but the changes they made might make you rethink the way you approach CoD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Video-Games/What-are-the-best-video-games-of-2012"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'>What are the best video games of 2012?</a></li>
