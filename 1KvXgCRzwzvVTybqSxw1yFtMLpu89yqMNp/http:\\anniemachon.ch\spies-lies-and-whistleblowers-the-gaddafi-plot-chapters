<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The <span class="caps">MI6</span>/Al Qaeda con­spir­acy, Part 1</strong></span></p>
<p>The MI6-funding of Islamic extrem­ists and Al Qaeda mem­bers to assas­sin­ate Col­onel Gad­dafi, is the main reason why David Shayler finally left <span class="caps">MI5</span>.  It is the real ‘case that made [him] quit’.  To quote David:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>Although I knew about the plot before mak­ing my decision to leave — I believed at the time that it was more <span class="caps">MI6</span> ‘Boys Own’ stuff — I was nev­er­the­less phys­ic­ally sickened by the fact that <span class="caps">MI6</span> wanted to spon­sor Islamic extrem­ists to carry out ter­ror­ism.  At around the time I was debat­ing whether to leave because of the Vic­toria Brit­tain invest­ig­a­tion, <span class="caps">MI6</span>’s David Wat­son told me he had in fact sup­plied his agent with $40,000 to buy weapons to execute the oper­a­tion to assas­sin­ate Gaddafi.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>I joined the ser­vices to stop ter­ror­ism and pre­vent the deaths of inno­cent people, not to get involved in these despic­able and cow­ardly acts.  I still can­not believe that the Prime Min­is­ter has refused to take my evid­ence or invest­ig­ate this mat­ter as this decision has sent out a clear mes­sage to the intel­li­gence ser­vices that they can fund ter­ror­ism; con­spire to murder people with impun­ity; and take enorm­ous risks with our security. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>After all, would you give an indi­vidual you hardly know — who has admit­ted to con­nec­tions with Al Qaeda — an enorm­ous sum to carry out a ter­ror­ist attack, when you know the group he is lead­ing is opposed to the val­ues of West­ern soci­ety?  It is dif­fi­cult to ima­gine a greater dis­reg­ard and con­tempt for the lives and secur­ity of the Brit­ish people.”</p>
<p>Key points</p>
<ul>
<li>The fol­low­ing issues arise from David’s whis­tleblow­ing about <span class="caps">MI6</span> sup­port for Al Qaeda:<br />Con­trary to mis­in­form­a­tion pub­lished in some news­pa­pers, the fol­low­ing account was not ‘bar-room gos­sip’.  David’s <span class="caps">MI6</span> coun­ter­part, <span class="caps">PT16</span>/B David Wat­son, briefed him offi­cially on the plot as it unfol­ded.  As <span class="caps">MI5</span> officers both David and I knew the ser­i­ous threat the fund­ing of Al Qaeda posed at the time. </li>
<li>Des­pite the then For­eign Sec­ret­ary Robin Cook’s deni­als in 1998, I have now found out that intel­li­gence officer,                           , was <span class="caps">MI6</span>’s man Tun­worth.  He is a mem­ber of the Islamic Fight­ing Group (<span class="caps">IFG</span>) aka the Mil­it­ant Islamic Group, an Al Qaeda affil­i­ate based in Libya.<br />French intel­li­gence has also estab­lished that lead­ing mem­bers of the <span class="caps">IFG</span> like Tun­worth are also mem­bers of Al Qaeda. </li>
<li>The <span class="caps">MI6</span> agent Tun­worth admit­ted his con­nec­tions with Islamic extrem­ists and Al Qaeda mem­bers dur­ing a debrief with his <span class="caps">MI6</span> hand­ler David Wat­son, in late 19952 so <span class="caps">MI6</span> can­not deny it did not know what it was enter­ing into.</li>
<li>At the very least, <span class="caps">MI6</span> failed to real­ise that it had prior intel­li­gence about an Al Qaeda coup in Libya.  If suc­cess­ful, <span class="caps">MI6</span> would have allowed Al Qaeda to take over an oil-rich state in North Africa, put­ting the lives of Brit­ish and <span class="caps">US</span> cit­izens, in par­tic­u­lar, at far greater risk.</li>
<li>By the time <span class="caps">MI6</span> paid the money, Osama Bin Laden’s organ­isa­tion was already known to be respons­ible for the 1993 World Trade Centre bomb­ing and <span class="caps">MI5</span> had set up <span class="caps">G9C</span>, a sec­tion ded­ic­ated to the task of defeat­ing Bin Laden and his affiliates.</li>
<li>Under the 1994 Intel­li­gence Ser­vices Act, the real James Bonds do have a licence to kill or immunity for crim­inal acts car­ried out abroad in the course of their work, provided they gain the per­mis­sion of the For­eign Sec­ret­ary.  But without that per­mis­sion they are break­ing the law, should they become involved in a con­spir­acy to murder and to cause ter­ror­ism.  In this case, they did not even seek that permission.</li>
<li><span class="caps">MI6</span> gave money to indi­vidu­als who posed a greater threat to our lives and secur­ity — Al Qaeda — to assas­sin­ate an indi­vidual who posed a lesser threat, Col­onel Gad­dafi.  It just doesn’t make any logical sense.  In fact, it demon­strates that <span class="caps">MI6</span> was motiv­ated by revenge on Gad­dafi, rather than any desire to pro­tect Brit­ish lives and national secur­ity, because he nation­al­ised the Libyan oil industry in 1976 at the expense of <span class="caps">BP3</span>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How David was briefed on the conspiracy</strong></p>
<p>In sum­mer 1995, at the height of the illegal invest­ig­a­tion into Vic­toria Brit­tain, David was first briefed on the plot.  David Wat­son, David’s coun­ter­part in <span class="caps">MI6</span>, asked to meet to dis­cuss an unusual case which he could not men­tion over the phone.  At the sub­sequent meet­ing, <span class="caps">PT16</span>/B told David that:</p>
<p>A senior mem­ber of the Libyan mil­it­ary intel­li­gence ser­vice had walked into the Brit­ish embassy in Tunis and asked to meet the res­id­ent <span class="caps">MI6</span> officer.</p>
<p>The Libyan ‘walk-in’ had asked for funds to lead a group of Islamic extrem­ists in an attemp­ted coup, which would involve the assas­sin­a­tion of Col­onel Gad­dafi, the head of the Libyan state.</p>
<p>Although the Libyan mil­it­ary intel­li­gence officer led the group, he had said he was not an Islamic extrem­ist himself.</p>
<p>The Libyan had a brief <span class="caps">MI6</span> record, which <span class="caps">PT16</span>/B thought was enough to con­firm that the Libyan did have the access to the régime that he claimed.</p>
<p>In exchange for <span class="caps">MI6</span>’s sup­port, the Libyan offered to hand over the two Lock­er­bie sus­pects after the coup.  Get­ting them to the <span class="caps">UK</span> for trial had at the time been one of <span class="caps">MI6</span>’s object­ives for about three years but there is no guar­an­tee that the coup plot­ters could have done this.  It is debat­able whether the coup plot­ters would have had either the resources or expert­ise required to track down the sus­pects after their planned coup.  At first, David was scep­tical to the point of ennui.  After all, <span class="caps">MI6</span> officers had often claimed that the Lock­er­bie two were about to be handed over or that Gad­dafi was about to die or be toppled but noth­ing had come of this sup­posedly keen and reli­able intelligence. </p>
<p>In the fol­low­ing weeks, <span class="caps">PT16</span>/B told David that the Libyan was code­named Tun­worth.  At some point in the fol­low­ing weeks David briefly saw the prin­tout of <span class="caps">MI6</span>’s record of him.  It con­tained around two or three sep­ar­ate men­tions.  They sup­por­ted his claim to be a senior mem­ber of Libyan mil­it­ary intel­li­gence but were not detailed.  David checked the Libyan’s name against Durbar and Star, <span class="caps">MI5</span>’s records, but the ser­vice had no trace of him.  David did not make any effort to remem­ber the name because he believed that the whole thing would come to noth­ing as other <span class="caps">MI6</span> plots had done.  Wat­son also issued at least two <span class="caps">CX</span> reports detail­ing intel­li­gence provided by Tun­worth at his meet­ing with the res­id­ent <span class="caps">MI6</span> officer in Tunis4.  David remem­bers it con­cerned changes in per­son­nel in the Libyan régime.  <span class="caps">MI5</span> had col­lat­eral for it so <span class="caps">G9</span> assessed that Tun­worth had some access to the régime.  David takes up the story:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>Through­out this pro­cess, I briefed my line man­ager, <span class="caps">G9A</span>/1 — Jerry Mahoney until Decem­ber 1995, Paul Slim, after that — about these devel­op­ments.  As the oper­a­tion was in its infancy when Mahoney left, I don’t believe that I told him any­thing other than the bare basics.  When brief­ing his suc­cessor, Paul Slim, I told him that this might be more ‘Boys’ Own stuff’ on the part of <span class="caps">MI6</span> and that we shouldn’t take it too ser­i­ously although we agreed to review this in the light of new information. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>It is incon­ceiv­able that <span class="caps">G9A</span>/1 did not think an MI6-funded plot to engin­eer a coup in Libya was worthy of men­tion­ing to his line man­ager, <span class="caps">G9</span>/0, Peter Mitchell.  In turn, it is unthink­able that <span class="caps">G9</span>/0 did not raise the mat­ter with his line man­age­ment who would have informed his boss until the <span class="caps">DG</span> her­self had been made aware.  I won­der if it was included in the first draft of Dame Stella’s book and removed on the orders of the authorities.”</p>
<p>In Decem­ber 1995, James Wor­th­ing, R/<span class="caps">ME</span>/C at <span class="caps">MI6</span>, cir­cu­lated <span class="caps">CX95</span>/ 534526 report to White­hall and other address­ees, warn­ing of a poten­tial coup in Libya.  It con­firmed that a mem­ber of the rebel group gave detailed intel­li­gence to his <span class="caps">MI6</span> hand­ler in anti­cip­a­tion of help from Bri­tain.  The report clearly demon­strated that Wat­son knew that Tun­worth was plan­ning ter­ror­ism and his group had already been involved in attempts on Gaddafi’s life:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>In late Novem­ber 1995 [Tunworth’s iden­tity removed]7 described plans, in which he was involved, to over­throw Col­onel Gad­dafi. […]  The coup is sched­uled to start at around the time of the next Gen­eral People’s Con­gress on Feb­ru­ary 14, 1996.  Coup will start with unrest in Tripoli, Mis­ra­tah and Benghazi.” […]<br />“The coup plot­ters were respons­ible for the death of [blank –Names removed to pro­tect security-————————blank] was about to take up the pos­i­tion as head of Mil­it­ary Intel­li­gence when he was forced off the Tripoli-Sirte road and was killed.  The 2 coup plot­ters involved escaped unhurt.  In August 1995, 3 army cap­tains who were part of the coup plot attemp­ted to kill Col­onel Gaddafi.”</p>
<p>The report then lis­ted Libyan install­a­tions that would be attacked and described sup­port­ers in Libya’s prin­cipal cit­ies and their occu­pa­tions.  The start of the coup was to be sig­nalled through coded mes­sages on tele­vi­sion and radio.  It also said that at least 250 British-made weapons were dis­trib­uted among the plotters.</p>
<p>Tun­worth also told his <span class="caps">MI6</span> hand­ler that:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>plot­ters would have cars sim­ilar to those in Gaddafi’s secur­ity entour­age with fake secur­ity num­ber plates. They would infilt­rate them­selves into the entour­age in order to kill or arrest Gaddafi…</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>One group of mil­it­ary per­son­nel were being trained in the desert area near Kufra for the role of attack­ing Gad­dafi and his entour­age.  The aim was to attack Gad­dafi after the <span class="caps">GPC</span> [Gen­eral People’s Con­gress], but before he had returned to Sirte.  One officer and 20 men were being trained for this attack.”</p>
<p>David also remem­bers another <span class="caps">MI6</span> <span class="caps">CX</span> report being issued about the plot in early 1996.  It was a shop­ping list of the group’s require­ments to carry out the coup, includ­ing the sup­ply of weapons and basics like jeeps and tents.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Christ­mas 1995, Wat­son told David that he had met Tun­worth, in Geneva and paid him $40,000.  Jackie Barker, who had replaced Sue Thomas as <span class="caps">G9A</span>/15, told him that Wat­son had told her the same inform­a­tion ‘in con­fid­ence’.  Dur­ing routine <span class="caps">G9</span>/<span class="caps">PT16</span> meet­ings around this time, officers occa­sion­ally men­tioned the plot.  Wat­son then met Tun­worth on two fur­ther occa­sions early in 1996 in Geneva.  David does not know of any fur­ther details except that Wat­son men­tioned that he had paid ‘sim­ilar sums’ to Tun­worth on each occa­sion.  Although <span class="caps">PT16</span>/B never spe­cific­ally men­tioned it, it was tacitly under­stood that Wat­son was work­ing with the approval of his dir­ect line man­ager, <span class="caps">PT16</span>, Richard Bartlett.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of gov­ern­ment sanction</strong></p>
<p>At some point — David can’t be sure when exactly — Wat­son men­tioned that the ‘sub­mis­sion’, <span class="caps">MI6</span> jar­gon for the let­ter request­ing per­mis­sion from the For­eign Office for oth­er­wise illegal oper­a­tions, was going to go “all the way to the top”.  In about Janu­ary 1996, Wat­son told him that the sub­mis­sion had been suc­cess­ful, indic­at­ing that the For­eign Sec­ret­ary him­self had signed the doc­u­ment per­mit­ting the operation.9  When David briefed Paul Slim on the details of the plot, he spe­cific­ally drew atten­tion to the fact that the ser­vice only had Watson’s word for this.  He urged his boss to task senior <span class="caps">MI5</span> man­age­ment to raise the mat­ter form­ally, to check that the oper­a­tion was legal.</p>
<p>Then, in either Feb­ru­ary or March 1996, David read two, pos­sibly three intel­li­gence reports quot­ing inde­pend­ent sources — the Egyp­tian and Moroc­can intel­li­gence ser­vices.  They all stated that an attack had been made on Col­onel Gad­dafi in Sirte, Libya.  Two of the reports indic­ated that the attack­ers had tried to assas­sin­ate Gad­dafi when he was part of a motor­cade but had failed as they had tar­geted the wrong car.  As a res­ult of the explo­sion and the ensu­ing chaos in which shots were fired, civil­ians and secur­ity police were maimed and killed.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>At a meet­ing shortly after, <span class="caps">PT16</span>/B ven­tured to me in a note of tri­umph that Tun­worth had been respons­ible for the attack.  “Yes that was our man.  We did it” was how he put it.  He regarded it, curi­ously, as a tri­umph even though the object­ive of the oper­a­tion had not been met and report­ing indic­ated there had been civil­ian cas­u­al­ties.  Des­pite that, I very much got the impres­sion that this was regarded as a coup for <span class="caps">MI6</span> because it was play­ing up to the repu­ta­tion that the real James Bonds wanted to have.  I then promptly passed the inform­a­tion on to my line man­ager, <span class="caps">G9A</span>/1.  Although ini­tially reluct­ant, he said he would deal with the mat­ter.  I’ve no idea whether he did.  In later months, I asked Wat­son sev­eral times what had happened to Tun­worth, but was not given answers.”</p>
<p>By this time, David had already decided to leave the ser­vice and was act­ively look­ing for jobs in the private sec­tor.  As a res­ult of <span class="caps">MI6</span> fund­ing Al Qaeda, on top of the gen­eral ineptitude and bungling I had wit­nessed, I also decided I no longer wanted to work for intel­li­gence ser­vices who had ceased to pro­tect demo­cracy and instead fun­ded our ter­ror­ist enemies.  The ser­vices are sup­posed to pro­tect us, not put our lives at greater risk from ter­ror­ist attack.  It was time to leave.  </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The <span class="caps">MI6</span>/Al Qaeda con­spir­acy, Part 2</strong></span></p>
<p>David had briefed the MoS with the bare bones of the plot in the sum­mer of 1996 and again when pre­par­ing the dis­clos­ures of 24 August 1997.  How­ever, given the con­tro­ver­sial and sens­it­ive nature of the mater­ial, he had always wanted to sub­mit it to the gov­ern­ment for invest­ig­a­tion.  Since then, min­is­ters and other respons­ible agen­cies like the <span class="caps">PM</span>’s <span class="caps">ISC</span> and the Cab­inet Office have con­sist­ently refused to take pos­ses­sion of David’s evid­ence con­cern­ing the plot. Des­pite his repeatedly writ­ing to them to inform them that ele­ments of the ser­vices were oper­at­ing out­side the law.</p>
<p>As the author­it­ies had shown no interest in tak­ing his evid­ence, in early Decem­ber 1997 David gave Mark Urban, at the time the <span class="caps">BBC</span>’s Defence and Dip­lo­matic Cor­res­pond­ent, a full, recor­ded inter­view about the <span class="caps">MI6</span>/Al Qaeda plot.  Then, after he had entered into nego­ti­ations, David again tried to give his evid­ence to the Brit­ish author­it­ies, but they repeatedly refused to take it.  By June 1998, Urban had stood up key aspects of the story.  Although David urged Urban to sub­mit the doc­u­ment­ary to the author­it­ies for imme­di­ate clear­ance under the injunc­tion, <span class="caps">BBC</span> man­age­ment appeared reluct­ant to face the gov­ern­ment and the intel­li­gence ser­vices head-on.  They sat on the pro­gramme, while they debated it internally.</p>
<p>By July 1998 the gov­ern­ment had shown no real will to come to a nego­ti­ated set­tle­ment with David.  In frus­tra­tion at the government’s fail­ure to dis­charge its demo­cratic duties by tak­ing his evid­ence and at the same time faced with <span class="caps">BBC</span> iner­tia, in July 1997 David told the MoS that he was look­ing into set­ting up an Inter­net site to ensure that the crimes of the intel­li­gence ser­vices could be prop­erly exposed. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>Noth­ing will threaten the secur­ity of <span class="caps">MI5</span> agents or staff,” he said, “or com­prom­ise its work­ing meth­ods.  But there are vital mat­ters that need a pub­lic air­ing and the Inter­net is the way to do it.” </p>
<p>David hoped the art­icle would prompt min­is­ters to take his evid­ence.  As there was no response after a week, David again told the MoS that he inten­ded to pub­lish his dis­clos­ures  with due care for national secur­ity  on the Inter­net in the <span class="caps">US</span>, where it would be pro­tec­ted under the first amendment. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>I don’t see how the Gov­ern­ment can com­plain,” said David, “when I’ve been try­ing to talk to them for months.”</p>
<p>Three days later, his www​.shayler​.com site was hacked, before it was even up and run­ning.  Verio aka Tab­net, the ser­vice pro­vider in the <span class="caps">US</span>, said that the hack­ing was done by a pro­fes­sional, after the pass­word to gain access to the site was inter­cep­ted en route to David’s com­puter.  There is no actual evid­ence to indic­ate that the intel­li­gence ser­vices were respons­ible but they are the like­li­est cul­prits.  Hack­ers do not nor­mally attack anti-establishment web­sites, par­tic­u­larly when they are not yet up and running.</p>
<p>On 31 July 1998, David and I met the MoS in Paris, in an effort get the <span class="caps">MI6</span>/Al Qaeda con­spir­acy out to a wider audi­ence.  On the strict under­stand­ing that the news­pa­per sub­mit­ted the story to gov­ern­ment, David gave the paper the details of the plot (without men­tion­ing the names of intel­li­gence officers).  Min­is­ters refused the paper per­mis­sion to pub­lish the inform­a­tion in any mean­ing­ful form, while also deny­ing the story.  David also met Nick Rufford and David Lep­pard of The Sunday Times and gave them a brief­ing on the plot, with the same caveat.  David comments:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>The denial and cen­sor­ship do not add up12.  Either the dis­clos­ure is untrue, in which case the gov­ern­ment can­not cite national secur­ity reas­ons for sup­press­ing the inform­a­tion.  Or the dis­clos­ure is true, in which case the gov­ern­ment has a duty to invest­ig­ate exactly how Brit­ish intel­li­gence officers came to use tax­pay­ers’ money to fund ter­ror­ism and murder inno­cent civil­ians.  The gov­ern­ment has used the injunc­tion and the 1989 <span class="caps">OSA</span> to restrain the free­dom of the press, in order to pro­tect itself from embar­rass­ment rather than pro­tect national security.”</p>
<p><strong>David’s arrest in con­nec­tion with the Plot</strong></p>
<p>Unbe­known to David and me, a couple of hours after he had legally13 sub­mit­ted his very ser­i­ous evid­ence to min­is­ters, those self-same min­is­ters sent an urgent request to extra­dite David for his ori­ginal dis­clos­ures which had appeared almost a year earlier in the MoS.  David says:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>In these cir­cum­stances, it is dif­fi­cult to see how any­one could believe that our over­sight arrange­ments work.  Indeed, the act of impris­on­ing an indi­vidual who uses a legal route to report ter­ror­ism on the part of <span class="caps">MI6</span>, is hardly likely to encour­age other indi­vidu­als to use the sys­tem.  It has all the hall­marks of des­pot­ism and tyranny.”</p>
<p>The next day, 1 August 1998, the French <span class="caps">DST</span>, the equi­val­ent of <span class="caps">MI5</span> and Spe­cial Branch, arres­ted David in the foyer of our hotel when he returned from watch­ing his foot­ball team, Middles­brough, lose 1–0 on Sky to Empoli in a pre-season friendly.  He was held for over 24 hours in the Pal­ais de Justice — most of the time in sol­it­ary — and denied access to a law­yer.  The day after, he was trans­ferred to La Santé prison in Paris’s 14<sup>th</sup> arron­disse­ment.  At the instig­a­tion of the Brit­ish author­it­ies, he was held under dra­conian secrecy legis­la­tion and first saw a law­yer over two days after he had been arres­ted.  He con­tin­ued to be denied access to all other vis­it­ors for most of his time in prison. </p>
<p>But for David’s quick think­ing, I would not have known what had happened to him.  He would have van­ished.  The <span class="caps">DST</span> asked him for his papers.  Know­ing I was wait­ing for his return in our hotel room, he told them his pass­port was in his bag upstairs (it was not).  I there­fore only knew he had been arres­ted when the <span class="caps">DST</span> came knock­ing on my door.  I was not to see him again for over two months.</p>
<p>Two days after David was arres­ted, The Daily Tele­graph splashed on dis­clos­ures he had given to its intel­li­gence cor­res­pond­ent Michael Smith, a few weeks before, about secur­ity blun­ders con­cern­ing the <span class="caps">IRA</span> main­land bomb­ing cam­paign.  The Tele­graph included some details of the fail­ures but was blocked by the injunc­tion from reveal­ing how a num­ber of attacks could have been pre­ven­ted.  Rather curi­ously, the paper — then edited by Charles Moore – called for David to be ‘horse­whipped’ in its leader column for provid­ing inform­a­tion about secur­ity fail­ures, which The Tele­graph pub­lished in its news section.</p>
<p>David’s soli­citor John Wadham said:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>It’s a strange coin­cid­ence that before this import­ant story about this assas­sin­a­tion attempt was going to break, the Gov­ern­ment ensured that David was arres­ted and incommunicado.”</p>
<p><strong>The New York Times breaks the story</strong></p>
<p>While David lan­guished in a prison cell, and while the dis­clos­ure had been injunc­ted in the Brit­ish press, a public-spirited indi­vidual passed the details of the <span class="caps">MI6</span>/Al Qaeda con­spir­acy to The New York Times.  On 5 August 1998, it repor­ted that the Brit­ish media had been banned from report­ing the plot.</p>
<p>Did the Brit­ish gov­ern­ment try to assas­sin­ate Col Mum­mar Gad­dafi, the Libyan leader, in Feb­ru­ary 1996 by plant­ing a bomb under his motor­cade?  And did the plan go awry because agents from <span class="caps">MI6</span>, the for­eign intel­li­gence ser­vice, put the bomb under the wrong car, killing sev­eral Libyan bystand­ers?” it asked. […]</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>A sweep­ing injunc­tion has barred news­pa­pers and tele­vi­sion news pro­grammes from pub­lish­ing the embar­rass­ing alleg­a­tions about the inner work­ings of Britain’s secur­ity ser­vices, brought up by a dis­gruntled former officer.  The media have been forced to dis­cuss the alleg­a­tions without actu­ally say­ing what the alleg­a­tions are.  ‘I’ve known these things for some­thing like 16 months, and I am not allowed to pub­lish any of it,’ said Jonathan Hol­borow, editor of The Mail on Sunday.”</p>
<p>The paper added that the gov­ern­ment had told the press it could report the alleg­a­tions as long as it did not men­tion details, like the pay­ment to Islamic extrem­ists of around £100,000.</p>
<p><strong>The Pan­or­ama programme</strong></p>
<p>The <span class="caps">BBC</span> began intense nego­ti­ations with the gov­ern­ment for per­mis­sion to show David’s inter­view with Mark Urban.  Only after threat­en­ing to chal­lenge the tem­por­ary injunc­tion through the courts, did the gov­ern­ment back down.  Two days after the pub­lic­a­tion of The New York Times art­icle, the <span class="caps">BBC</span> was per­mit­ted to broad­cast more details of the con­spir­acy in a Pan­or­ama spe­cial presen­ted by Mark Urban.  He con­firmed that the Islamic group involved was the Mil­it­ant (or Fight­ing) Islamic Group, led by Abdul­lah Al-Sadiq.  Cam­ille Tawil, an Arab journ­al­ist based in Lon­don, told the pro­gramme that shortly after the attack in Feb­ru­ary 1996, he received a fax from the group, claim­ing respons­ib­il­ity for the attack and nam­ing the mem­bers of its team who had died in the attack: </p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>I felt it was cred­ible inform­a­tion given to me but I wanted to verify the story.  I con­tac­ted other Libyan groups and they gave me a sim­ilar account of what had happened.  This is why I decided to pub­lish the story.”</p>
<p>Pan­or­ama also reported:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>Libya has pub­licly accused Bri­tain of giv­ing refuge to the leader of the Mil­it­ant Islamic Group.  In response to our enquiry, the For­eign Office said it does not know whether Abdul­lah Al Sadiq is in this country”.</p>
<p>The pro­gramme also con­firmed that <span class="caps">MI6</span> did not get the vital per­mis­sion from its min­is­ters to carry out the attack — which is a legal require­ment so the officers involved have immunity under Eng­lish law.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>Two well-placed people have told me that the Tory min­is­ters run­ning the depart­ment at the time gave no such author­isa­tion.  […]  In short, that means Britain’s intel­li­gence ser­vice was oper­at­ing com­pletely out of control.”</p>
<p>Urban con­cluded:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>It is true of course that Shayler’s know­ledge of this affair depends entirely on what the <span class="caps">SIS</span> man, <span class="caps">PT16</span>/B, told him at their meet­ings.  But cer­tain pieces of this Libyan jig­saw can­not eas­ily be argued away by <span class="caps">SIS</span>.  There was an assas­sin­a­tion attempt.  Numer­ous Libyan sources con­firm it.  Bri­tain did have a rela­tion­ship with Tun­worth.  Any inquiry into David Shayler’s alleg­a­tion will be able to find the key <span class="caps">CX</span> report which detailed the plot against Gad­dafi, so show­ing Tunworth’s inside knowledge. […] </p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>Only a thor­ough going inquiry would stand a chance of get­ting to the bot­tom of whether some intel­li­gence officers played fast and loose with the rules.  David Shayler has provided Pan­or­ama with other details about the Libyan oper­a­tion and the people con­nec­ted with it.  Com­bined with our own inform­a­tion, it sug­gests that <span class="caps">SIS</span> have a very ser­i­ous case to answer”.</p>
<p>The Pan­or­ama pro­gramme estab­lished that <span class="caps">MI6</span> had oper­ated out­side the con­trol of its polit­ical mas­ters.  In other words, unac­count­able intel­li­gence oper­at­ives were decid­ing Brit­ish for­eign policy, not a demo­crat­ic­ally elec­ted gov­ern­ment.  When you think about it, this means that middle rank­ing intel­li­gence officers have the power of life and death over an indi­vidual without being account­able for their actions16.  While that is all very well in a James Bond film, in the real world intel­li­gence officers are now required to oper­ate within the law.</p>
<p><strong>Sep­ar­ate sources con­firm the story</strong></p>
<p>On 9 August 1998, the MoS added still fur­ther con­firm­a­tion of the plot and the pay­ments.  It reported:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>David Shayler’s rev­el­a­tions that <span class="caps">MI6</span> tried to blow up Col­onel Gad­dafi were given strong cre­dence by <span class="caps">US</span> intel­li­gence sources yes­ter­day.  They insisted that, des­pite claims to the con­trary, the Brit­ish secret ser­vice was fin­an­cing the group behind the attempt on the Libyan leader’s life.  [Accord­ing to the <span class="caps">US</span>] the Brit­ish ser­vice [<span class="caps">MI6</span>] turned to the Fight­ing Islamic Group [<span class="caps">FIG</span>] and its leader, Abu Abdul­lah Sadiq, who was liv­ing in London.” </p>
<p>A sep­ar­ate source, a former senior ana­lyst with Amer­ican intel­li­gence, told the paper:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>I’m sure that Brit­ish intel­li­gence has all the plaus­ible deni­ab­il­ity that it needs.  Cer­tainly there were con­tacts between <span class="caps">MI6</span> and <span class="caps">FIG</span>.”</p>
<p>Yet another source in Wash­ing­ton told the paper that <span class="caps">MI6</span> had provided ‘vari­ous kinds of sup­port’ to <span class="caps">FIG</span>, includ­ing fin­an­cial help.</p>
<p>The same day, The Sunday Times repor­ted that it had iden­ti­fied one of the per­pet­rat­ors of the attack as Abd Al Muhay­meen.  Accord­ing to the paper, he was a Libyan ‘fun­da­ment­al­ist’ or Islamic extrem­ist, to use <span class="caps">MI5</span> phras­eo­logy, who had trained and fought in Afgh­anistan.  On the day, he also chose the tim­ing of the attack. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>He waited in ambush with a group of feday­deen from a force known as the Islamic Fight­ing Group. […]  The group appeared to be gain­ing in strength and dar­ing, mostly due to the expert­ise of Afghan vet­er­ans such as Al Muhay­meen. […]  As the con­voy approached, Al Muhay­meeen gave the word and the sounds of battle erup­ted.  When it was over, Gad­dafi had sur­vived yet again.  So had Al Muhay­meen.  But sev­eral of their men lay dead on each side.  So did bystanders.”</p>
<p><strong>For­eign Secretary’s comments</strong></p>
<p>On 9 August 1998, Robin Cook, the then For­eign Sec­ret­ary, told the <span class="caps">BBC</span>’s Break­fast with Frost programme:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>The tale about the <span class="caps">MI6</span> plot to assas­sin­ate Gad­dafi is pure fantasy.  First of all, let’s be clear about this claim that Shayler can bring down the gov­ern­ment, [the claim appeared in The Sunday Times, but David never made it] the alleg­a­tions are about some­thing that is alleged to have happened not under this gov­ern­ment but under our pre­de­cessor.  […] I have pur­sued these alleg­a­tions.  I am abso­lutely sat­is­fied that the pre­vi­ous For­eign Sec­ret­ary did not author­ise any such assas­sin­a­tion attempt.  I am per­fectly sat­is­fied that <span class="caps">SIS</span> never put for­ward any such pro­posal for an assas­sin­a­tion attempt, nor have I seen any­thing in the 15 months I have been in the job which would sug­gest that <span class="caps">SIS</span> has any interest, any role or any exper­i­ence over the recent dec­ade of any such escapade.  It is pure fantasy.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>I have already made my own enquir­ies.  I have sat­is­fied my mind.  I see no basis for the reports in today’s papers about any forth­com­ing enquiry.  There was no <span class="caps">SIS</span> pro­posal to do it and I am fairly clear that there has never been any <span class="caps">SIS</span> involve­ment.  I do wish people would recog­nise that what is being said here is that there is some­body who has left another ser­vice, not <span class="caps">SIS</span>, was never in <span class="caps">SIS</span>, is mak­ing alleg­a­tions no doubt for his own reas­ons.  We would like to see him back in Bri­tain in order that we can pur­sue those charges that have been made against him.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>I am clear these alleg­a­tions have no basis in fact and secondly I am quite clear that the <span class="caps">SIS</span> oper­a­tions that I have author­ised have noth­ing remotely to do with the kind of fantasy that has been pro­duced over the last two days.”</p>
<p>Without ever both­er­ing to take David’s evid­ence, Cook repeated from The Sunday Times an alleg­a­tion that David had never made: that he could ‘bring down the government’17, a tac­tic that Straw had used in the first use of the sub­mis­sion pro­cess in Octo­ber 1997. </p>
<p>Cook also unequi­voc­ally denied the exist­ence of any <span class="caps">MI6</span> oper­a­tion at all; “The tale about the <span class="caps">MI6</span> plot to assas­sin­ate Col­onel Gad­dafi is pure fantasy.”  There is no men­tion here that Cook is claim­ing that aspects of the story may be fantasy – such as the pay­ments, which the For­eign and Com­mon­wealth Office (<span class="caps">FCO</span>) later and wrongly claimed were the sub­ject of the ‘pure fantasy’ jibe.</p>
<p>Without both­er­ing to hold a proper enquiry, he was uncrit­ic­ally put­ting out the <span class="caps">MI6</span> line, adding: “I am clear these alleg­a­tions have no basis in fact.”  Min­is­ters can­not leg­ally ban inform­a­tion that is fantasy.  After all, min­is­ters had already indic­ated in off-the-record brief­ings at the time of the Israeli Embassy dis­clos­ure that dis­clos­ures on the part of former officers, which they accept to be untrue, could not harm national security.</p>
<p>Indeed, when Cook said: “I am abso­lutely sat­is­fied that the pre­vi­ous For­eign Sec­ret­ary did not author­ise any such assas­sin­a­tion attempt”, he merely con­firmed a key aspect of the Pan­or­ama invest­ig­a­tion; that <span class="caps">MI6</span> did not have the per­mis­sion of min­is­ters to carry out the attack, mak­ing any actions by <span class="caps">MI6</span> a crim­inal offence.  Although Cook then claimed he was ‘fairly clear’ that there had never been any <span class="caps">MI6</span> involve­ment and ‘per­fectly clear’ there was no basis in fact, he did not relate how exactly he had estab­lished this or why he was ‘per­fectly clear’ of one pos­i­tion but only ‘fairly clear’ about another. </p>
<p>Des­pite his claims, he obvi­ously hadn’t had time to organ­ise and carry out a full inquiry, even though there were officers in <span class="caps">MI5</span> who had been briefed about the plot, and who could have been inter­viewed.  In fact, it appears that Cook – in the same way that Straw had done before him — went to the head of the agency con­cerned (in this case, <span class="caps">MI6</span>) and asked if it had been involved in ter­ror­ist fund­ing and murder.  Not sur­pris­ingly, the lat­ter appears to have denied it.</p>
<p>After the Pan­or­ama pro­gramme was shown, Mark Urban offered his evid­ence to Robin Cook, who refused to take pos­ses­sion of it, inform­ing him that the mat­ter was closed.  As this was an alleg­a­tion of murder and ter­ror­ist fund­ing, Cook should have dis­charged his legal duty and imme­di­ately referred the mat­ter to the police to investigate. </p>
<p><strong>Libya con­firms plot</strong></p>
<p>On Wed­nes­day 25 Novem­ber 1998, Libyan <span class="caps">TV</span> broad­cast foot­age of the assas­sin­a­tion attempt.  It showed Gad­dafi lean­ing out of his open-topped car to greet the crowds, then ming­ling with the crowd, then it showed an object fly­ing through the air, Gad­dafi look­ing down, then sud­denly being sur­roun­ded by body­guards, who hustled him away.  The <span class="caps">TV</span> zoomed in on the face of a man in the crowd, and his face was circled in red.  Libyan <span class="caps">TV</span> named the assail­ant as Abdul­lah Rad­wan, a part­ner of Abu Abdul­lah Sadiq, the leader of the Islamic Fight­ing Group.  Accord­ing to the report:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>Abdul­lah Rad­wan suc­ceeded in reach­ing the front ranks and threw a gren­ade when the brother leader left the car.”</p>
<p>Libyan <span class="caps">TV</span> then showed an inter­view with Hasan Al Sadiq Al Shahh, an alleged accom­plice of Radwan:</p>
<p>Ques­tioner: Who entrus­ted you with the mis­sion of enter­ing the Jamahir­iya [the People’s Repub­lic of Libya]?<br />Al Shahh: Abu Abdul­lah Al Sadiq.<br />Q: Did he give money?<br />A: Yes<br />Q: How much money?<br />A: $20,000<br />Q: $20,000?<br />A: Yes<br />Q: What is the total amount of money you obtained from Abu Abdul­lah Al Sadiq?<br />A: Per­haps, $40,000 or $41,000<br />Q: $41,000?<br />A: Approx­im­ately, yes<br />Q: Where did the money you got come from?<br />A: I do not know.  But there is a group in those coun­tries<br />Q: What coun­tries are these?<br />A: Bri­tain<br />                                                                                                                                                            <br /><em>Redac­ted text on orders of <span class="caps">MI5</span></em>                                                                                                                                                              <br />                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <br />Our recent enquir­ies with Swal­low Tail, a former intel­li­gence officer who can­not be named for fear of reprisals20, have con­firmed that the man caught by the Liby­ans in the attack, was the agent Tun­worth.  This is fur­ther con­firm­a­tion that an <span class="caps">MI6</span> agent, whom we know was work­ing to Wat­son in Lon­don, was involved in the plot.  The officer also con­firmed that                was either killed dur­ing the attack that Feb­ru­ary or shortly after.  This rather under­mines the claims of min­is­ters that they banned the story in order to pro­tect national secur­ity, since the agent was clearly no longer at risk of reprisal and was not then provid­ing intel­li­gence to the Brit­ish services.</p>
<p>Other than using the sub­mis­sion pro­cess to inform the <span class="caps">PM</span> about ser­vice abuses of power, David also wrote to min­is­ters Tony Blair, Jack Straw, Robin Cook, John Prescott and the Attor­ney Gen­eral on sev­eral occa­sions, ask­ing them to invest­ig­ate his dis­clos­ures of <span class="caps">MI6</span>’s fund­ing of Al Qaeda.  At no point did any min­is­ter hear his evid­ence.  In June 1999, David sent min­is­ters Secrets and Lies, a doc­u­ment he had pre­pared on his case to counter the mis­in­form­a­tion put out by gov­ern­ment.  It provided details of the con­spir­acy but min­is­ters still refused to call in the police or hold any kind of enquiry.  And that would have been that, if it hadn’t been for the public-spirited former intel­li­gence officer who obtained the <span class="caps">CX</span> doc­u­ment issued by <span class="caps">MI6</span> in Decem­ber 1995, and put it on the Inter­net.  That officer said:<br />“I’ve just about had it up to here with the lies of min­is­ters.  It is dif­fi­cult to ima­gine a more ser­i­ous abuse of power than <span class="caps">MI6</span> fund­ing our ter­ror­ist enemies with the res­ult that inno­cent people are murdered in cold-blood.  If there had been a legal way of present­ing that doc­u­ment to inde­pend­ent invest­ig­at­ors, I would have used it.  As there was not, I had to resort to the Inter­net.  Thank God for mod­ern technology.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The <span class="caps">MI6</span>/Al Qaeda con­spir­acy, Part 3</strong></span></p>
<p>In Feb­ru­ary 2000, The Sunday Times provided cor­rob­or­a­tion that <span class="caps">MI6</span> had con­spired with an agent in a plan to assas­sin­ate Col­onel Gad­dafi, when it repor­ted that a leaked <span class="caps">MI6</span> doc­u­ment, <span class="caps">CX95</span>/ 53452 had appeared on the web­site www​.geo​cit​ies​.com/​b​y​a​n​y​m​e​a​n​s​n​e​c​e​s​s​a​r​y​2​000.  When inter­viewed about the doc­u­ment, the then For­eign Sec­ret­ary Robin Cook refused to con­firm that it was genu­ine.  David can though con­firm that it is the doc­u­ment sent by <span class="caps">MI6</span>’s R/<span class="caps">ME</span>/C to White­hall depart­ments and the intel­li­gence ser­vices in Decem­ber 1995.  It refuted Cook’s claims, which had caused many to believe that David had simply made the whole thing up:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>The tale about the <span class="caps">MI6</span> plot to assas­sin­ate Gad­dafi is pure fantasy. <br />“It is pure fantasy”<br />“I am clear these alleg­a­tions have no basis in fact” <br />The <span class="caps">MI6</span> report clearly demon­strated that an <span class="caps">MI6</span> agent among the coup plot­ters was meet­ing his <span class="caps">MI6</span> hand­ler to dis­cuss the assas­sin­a­tion of Col Gad­dafi ‘in which he was involved’: <br />“The coup plot­ters would launch a dir­ect attack on Gad­dafi and would either arrest him or kill him.”<br />“The mil­it­ary officer said that the plot­ters would have cars sim­ilar to those in Gaddafi’s secur­ity entour­age with fake secur­ity num­ber plates.  They would infilt­rate them­selves into the entour­age in order to kill or arrest Gaddafi.”</p>
<p>Remem­ber, Tun­worth had already out­lined his plans and his request for fin­ance to the res­id­ent <span class="caps">MI6</span> officer in Tunis in sum­mer 1995.  David Wat­son, <span class="caps">PT16</span>/B, had then met Tun­worth — in the full know­ledge that the lat­ter wanted to assas­sin­ate Gad­dafi — to obtain details of the oper­a­tion, which were pub­lished in the <span class="caps">CX</span> report.  If this report had been a record of a meet­ing between a Libyan ter­ror­ist and an <span class="caps">IRA</span> mem­ber plan­ning to assas­sin­ate Tony Blair, which had fallen into <span class="caps">MI5</span> or police hands, it would have been accep­ted in a court of law as clear evid­ence of a con­spir­acy between the two to cause terrorism.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">MI6</span> intel­li­gence report also con­firmed that Sirte was the site of the attack in Feb­ru­ary or March 1996, inform­a­tion David had told Urban who had stood it up for the Pan­or­ama invest­ig­a­tion into the plot.  It also estab­lished that the group of coup plot­ters were at least look­ing for sup­port from the Brit­ish state.  (As a <span class="caps">CX</span> report going out to min­is­ters, it could not detail the illegal payments):</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>The officer was dis­clos­ing this inform­a­tion in the hope that if the coup was suc­cess­ful, the new gov­ern­ment could enlist <span class="caps">HMG</span> support.”</p>
<p>Accord­ing to the report, Tun­worth also admit­ted con­tacts between the plot­ters and Islamic extrem­ists, described as ‘Libyan stu­dents’ and ‘Libyan vet­er­ans who served in Afgh­anistan’.  As already dis­cussed, vet­eran Libyan Islamic extrem­ists who served in Afgh­anistan are con­sidered by <span class="caps">MI5</span> to be de facto mem­bers of Al Qaeda.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">CX</span> report oth­er­wise played down the agent’s con­tacts with Islamic extrem­ists, pre­sum­ably because the report went to min­is­ters who would have been appalled at the pro­spect of Islamic ter­ror­ists top­pling Gad­dafi, given that the former posed a greater threat to Brit­ish lives.  As we now know from the sexed-up dossier, it is not unusual for incon­veni­ent pieces of inform­a­tion to be left out of offi­cial reports. </p>
<p>David is adam­ant that, when Wat­son was brief­ing him, he told David that Tun­worth was lead­ing a ‘rag tag’ group of Islamic extrem­ists.  David also briefed Paul Slim, his boss at the time, with this inform­a­tion and provided it in his sworn state­ment to the police.  He has not been charged with per­jury.  Other media reports already quoted have estab­lished that the Islamic Fight­ing Group were respons­ible.  The Libyan <span class="caps">TV</span> broad­cast also indic­ated that a lead­ing mem­ber of the <span class="caps">IFG</span> might be Tun­worth, as he led the attack in much the way that Tun­worth out­lined in the <span class="caps">CX</span> report.</p>
<p>The report also made it abso­lutely clear that the Per­man­ent Under Secretary’s Depart­ment – Sir Humphrey Appleby’s equi­val­ent in the For­eign Office — <span class="caps">GCHQ</span>, <span class="caps">MI5</span>; the Min­istry of Defence; and <span class="caps">MI6</span> sta­tions in Tunis, Cairo and Wash­ing­ton knew of the assas­sin­a­tion attempt at least two months in advance.  They would there­fore have had cop­ies on file.  Did none of them bother to brief Cook with this rather per­tin­ent inform­a­tion before he went on the Break­fast with Frost pro­gramme on 9 August 1998?  Were our Sir Humphreys and our George Smi­leys delib­er­ately keep­ing min­is­ters in the dark?  Or did Cook know about Tun­worth but think he could get away with brand­ing the plot ‘pure fantasy’ in the belief that doc­u­ments detail­ing the rela­tion­ship between Tun­worth and <span class="caps">MI6</span> would never see the light of day?  <br />We also have to ask ourselves what role the <span class="caps">PM</span> played in all this, as the fig­ure ulti­mately respons­ible for our ser­vices.  What did he know and when did he know it?</p>
<p><strong>Julie Ann and the bul­lies in government</strong></p>
<p>The gov­ern­ment had always claimed it was not in the busi­ness of pre­vent­ing legit­im­ate dis­cus­sion of the intel­li­gence ser­vices.  But on 6 March 2000, that all changed when Spe­cial Branch officers arres­ted Julie Ann Dav­ies, a stu­dent at King­ston Uni­ver­sity, under the 1911 and 1989 OSAs, dur­ing a lec­ture at the col­lege.  She was held for sev­eral hours at King­ston Police sta­tion but was not charged.  She was later released on police bail.  The uni­ver­sity con­firmed that it had com­plied with a search war­rant, giv­ing police the right to access Davies’s com­puter at the uni­ver­sity.  Dav­ies had recently vis­ited David in France and had begun to rally sup­port for him. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>Dur­ing that meet­ing I became con­vinced that the man was genu­ine and so I felt the need to do some­thing about his situ­ation,” she said at the time. </p>
<p>The day after the <span class="caps">CX</span> doc­u­ment appeared on the Inter­net, Dav­ies cir­cu­lated an e-mail to fel­low cam­paign­ers and journ­al­ists.  In it, she stated:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>You have prob­ably heard about the doc­u­ment on the web that appears to back up David Shayler’s alleg­a­tions of an <span class="caps">MI6</span> plot to assas­sin­ate Col­onel Gaddafi.”</p>
<p>It is also clear from the con­text of the ques­tions that police asked her that Spe­cial Branch sus­pec­ted her of put­ting the <span class="caps">CX</span> doc­u­ment on the Inter­net.  Under ques­tion­ing, Dav­ies denied hav­ing any­thing to do with this.  After keep­ing her on police bail for a num­ber of months without char­ging her, Spe­cial Branch even­tu­ally dropped the invest­ig­a­tion.  As a res­ult of the police action, she was forced to drop out of her uni­ver­sity course.  She is cur­rently suing police for wrong­ful arrest.  As a res­ult of dis­clos­ure in this case, police have provided her with the ‘evid­ence’ which led to her arrest.  It con­sists only of three anonym­ous let­ters claim­ing that she put the doc­u­ment on the Inter­net.  As they are anonym­ous, they would not be con­sidered admiss­ible evid­ence in a court of law. </p>
<p>Mr Peter Scott, King­ston Uni­ver­sity vice chan­cel­lor, said:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>The uni­ver­sity, as an insti­tu­tion com­mit­ted to free­dom of expres­sion, would be par­tic­u­larly con­cerned if it turned out that a dis­cred­ited piece of legis­la­tion like the <span class="caps">OSA</span> was being used to sup­press legit­im­ate journ­al­istic invest­ig­a­tion and the public’s right to know about alleged abuses by the secur­ity services.”</p>
<p>The arrest of Julie Ann Dav­ies proved once again that min­is­ters were rather more con­cerned with intim­id­at­ing David’s sup­port­ers and pro­tect­ing the intel­li­gence ser­vices from proper scru­tiny, includ­ing crim­inal invest­ig­a­tion, than free speech, one of the corner­stones of demo­cracy.  It was also a clear example of bul­ly­ing.  The Sunday Times, which had pub­lished the ori­ginal art­icle about the report and quoted from the doc­u­ment, had not been invest­ig­ated, nor had any of its journ­al­ists been arres­ted in con­nec­tion with the mat­ter.  <br />This is also clear evid­ence that mater­ial from <span class="caps">CX</span> reports can be pub­lished without caus­ing dam­age to national secur­ity, as the gov­ern­ment did not pro­sec­ute the paper or its journ­al­ists under s5 of the 1989 <span class="caps">OSA</span>, where the Crown has to prove dam­age, for pub­lish­ing and quot­ing from the report.  But the bul­ly­ing was set to continue. </p>
<p><strong>The Observer taken to court</strong></p>
<p>Hav­ing used the <span class="caps">OSA</span> to intim­id­ate one of David’s sup­port­ers for try­ing to expose ter­ror­ism fun­ded out by <span class="caps">MI6</span>, Blair’s gov­ern­ment then turned its sights on the ele­ments of the press who were bravely try­ing to expose the con­spir­acy.  Comedian and journ­al­ist Mark Thomas had agreed to deliver his evid­ence about the conspiracy23 to the Brit­ish Embassy by hand in Novem­ber 1999.  As Straw did not even bother to reply, David briefed Mar­tin Bright of The Observer.  In Feb­ru­ary 2000, he repor­ted that Straw had done noth­ing to ensure that there was a crim­inal invest­ig­a­tion into <span class="caps">PT16</span>/B’s activities. </p>
<p>The art­icle also revealed for the first time in pub­lic that Tun­worth was a senior mem­ber of Libyan intel­li­gence, who had walked into the Brit­ish Embassy in Tunis, and that reports quot­ing Moroc­can and Egyp­tian intel­li­gence sources had con­firmed the assas­sin­a­tion attempt, shortly after it took place in Feb­ru­ary 1996. </p>
<p>A For­eign Office spokes­man changed the offi­cial pos­i­tion on the con­spir­acy, try­ing to play down Robin Cook’s claim that the tale about the <span class="caps">MI6</span> plot to assas­sin­ate Gad­dafi was ‘pure fantasy’:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>We have never denied know­ledge of coup attempts against Col Gad­dafi,” he told the paper.  “We always described alleg­a­tions of involve­ment as fantasy25.  We have noth­ing to add or subtract”.</p>
<p>If the For­eign Office and Cook had been hon­est when the dis­clos­ure was first made, they would have said at the time:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>We are aware of a con­spir­acy to assas­sin­ate Col­onel Gad­dafi in early 1996.  We are still mak­ing enquir­ies about any <span class="caps">MI6</span> involvement.”</p>
<p>Tun­worth was after all an <span class="caps">MI6</span> agent who had by the time of the attack met David Wat­son, an <span class="caps">MI6</span> officer, at least twice to dis­cuss his plans.  On that evid­ence alone, we can con­clude that <span class="caps">MI6</span> was involved.  How­ever, Tun­worth could not have gone ahead with the plot without the back­ing of <span class="caps">MI6</span>, fin­an­cial or oth­er­wise.  As we have seen, sep­ar­ate sources have con­firmed pay­ments were made to the <span class="caps">IFG</span>, the group Tun­worth belonged to. </p>
<p>On 14 March 2000, both The Observer and The Guard­ian were taken to court by the author­it­ies.  Spe­cial Branch sought a court order to seize any note­books and browse through The Observer’s com­puter for fur­ther evid­ence of breaches of the <span class="caps">OSA</span> on David’s part.  It sought from The Guard­ian the ori­ginal of a let­ter David had writ­ten, which was pub­lished in news­pa­per on the 17 Feb­ru­ary 2000.  As Nick Cohen, The Observer’s colum­nist put it:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>No one would dream of telling a news­pa­per about offi­cial cor­rup­tion, incom­pet­ence or crime, if they thought the police – or in this case, the secret police – might read every jot­ting and e-mail.” </p>
<p>A couple of days later, Detect­ive Ser­geant John Flynn, from the fin­an­cial invest­ig­a­tions unit of Spe­cial Branch, told The Guard­ian that there were ‘reas­on­able grounds’ for pro­sec­ut­ing Mar­tin Bright and Roger Alton, the editor of The Observer, under s5 of the <span class="caps">OSA</span>. </p>
<p>A month later, judge Mar­tin Steph­ens ruled that the papers had to hand over any mater­ial, even though he admit­ted that the let­ter to The Guard­ian con­tained noth­ing that had not already been prin­ted.  David said at the time:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>The gov­ern­ment is adopt­ing the tac­tics of a total­it­arian state by attack­ing the press in this way.  If they really believe I have doc­u­ments that could dam­age national secur­ity, why don’t they come and talk to me about them, rather than intim­id­ate journalists.”</p>
<p>Even the then For­eign Sec­ret­ary Robin Cook and the For­eign Office min­is­ter Peter Hain were repor­ted to be hor­ri­fied at such an attack on press free­dom.  But we have to won­der why they chose to speak out at this point.  Did Cook know that if the doc­u­ments were handed over then David might be pro­sec­uted for dis­clos­ing details of the <span class="caps">MI6</span>/Al Qaeda con­spir­acy, allow­ing Cook’s ‘pure fantasy’ lies to be examined before a court?</p>
<p>On 19 July 2000, Mr Justice Igor Judge heard the case for Spe­cial Branch to access The Observer’s com­puter.  He over­turned the decision of the lower courts in his ringing defence of press freedom:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>The Gad­dafi Plot is either true or it is false, and unless there are reas­ons of com­pel­ling national secur­ity, the pub­lic is entitled to know the facts, and as the eyes and ears of the pub­lic, journ­al­ists are entitled to invest­ig­ate and report the facts, dis­pas­sion­ately and fairly, without pre­judge­ment or selectivity […]</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>If true, it is dif­fi­cult to over­es­tim­ate its enorm­ity: a con­spir­acy to murder the head of another state, res­ult­ing not in his death, but in the deaths of inno­cent people who were not its inten­ded tar­gets.[…]  Again, if true, the cir­cum­stances in which such a plan was con­ceived and developed, and the iden­tity of those who were informed about and approved it, or turned a blind eye to it, and equally those who were delib­er­ately kept in ignor­ance, raise crit­ical pub­lic issues about the activ­it­ies of the secur­ity ser­vices and those respons­ible for them”  <br />In the middle of all this, a new devel­op­ment neatly poin­ted to the impot­ence of the ser­vices and the inef­fect­ive­ness of cur­rent legis­la­tion in pro­tect­ing state secrets in the age of the Inter­net.  Por­tuguese intel­li­gence expert Fre­derico Duarte pub­lished the names of David Wat­son and Richard Bart­lett, <span class="caps">PT16</span>/B and <span class="caps">PT16</span> respect­ively in Tal <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Qual, the Por­tuguese equi­val­ent of Private Eye.  As the names were also avail­able on the Inter­net, they could be accessed from Bri­tain.  As they were now in the pub­lic domain, they could be repeated in the Brit­ish media, although only the Cam­paign for Press and Broad­cast­ing Free­dom dared to actu­ally pub­lish the names of the two <span class="caps">MI6</span> ter­ror­ists involved.</p>
<p><strong>The delayed police investigation</strong></p>
<p>In March 2000, John Wadham and I had hand-delivered a state­ment — which David had pre­pared and indic­ated he was pre­pared to swear to under oath — to the Met­ro­pol­itan Police Spe­cial Branch at New Scot­land Yard.  The police then refused to invest­ig­ate the plot claim­ing that con­spir­acy to murder did not amount to a crime in Bri­tain.  Again, this demon­strates what would have happened if David had viol­ated the 1989 <span class="caps">OSA</span> s1 and approached the Met dir­ectly with his dis­clos­ures in 1997. </p>
<p>Finally in Decem­ber 2000, two and a half years after David had made the ori­ginal dis­clos­ure, he was finally given per­mis­sion by the author­it­ies to give evid­ence to the police.  <span class="caps">DS</span> Gerry Mackin­non and Detect­ive Supt Lewis Ben­jamin work­ing for <span class="caps">SO1</span> of the Met, inter­viewed him and pre­pared a sworn state­ment, which he signed in early 2001.  <span class="caps">SO1</span> then under­took the first ever police invest­ig­a­tion into the activ­it­ies of <span class="caps">MI6</span>.  You don’t have to be a cynic to point out that by this time, <span class="caps">MI6</span> had had plenty of time to des­troy or tamper with the evid­ence.  David and I have every con­fid­ence that the police in this case did their job thor­oughly and pro­fes­sion­ally but by then, we believe, it was too late.</p>
<p>In Feb­ru­ary 2001, <span class="caps">SO1</span> sent a report to the Crown Pro­sec­u­tion Ser­vice.  Pro­sec­u­tion sources said the author­it­ies had decided there was a prima facie case, mer­it­ing fur­ther investigation29.  In all, the enquir­ies took nine months.  In Novem­ber 2001, the Met­ro­pol­itan Police con­firmed that the <span class="caps">MI6</span>/Al Qaeda con­spir­acy was not ‘pure fantasy’:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>As you know, the Met­ro­pol­itan Police Ser­vice under­took an assess­ment of the avail­able mater­ial and sub­mit­ted two reports to the Crown Pro­sec­u­tion Ser­vice, an interim report in Feb­ru­ary 2001 and a final report in Septem­ber 2001.  The police enquiry has been extremely thor­ough, examin­ing all rel­ev­ant material.”</p>
<p>This clearly con­firms that the police have gathered evid­ence – ‘rel­ev­ant mater­ial’ — about the <span class="caps">MI6</span> con­spir­acy, which con­firm there is ‘a basis in fact’ for David’s dis­clos­ures refut­ing Robin Cook asser­tion that: “The tale about the <span class="caps">MI6</span> plot to assas­sin­ate Gad­dafi is pure fantasy. [with] no basis in fact”.  At the same time, neither the police nor the <span class="caps">CPS</span> sought to arrest David or bring charges for per­jury or wast­ing police time, indic­at­ing that detailed sworn state­ment was hon­est, reli­able and true.  On these avail­able facts, any reas­on­able observer can only con­clude that Cook is lying and David telling the truth.  In fact, we have chal­lenged Cook to sign a sworn state­ment say­ing that the <span class="caps">MI6</span>/Al Qaeda plot was ‘pure fantasy [with] no basis in fact’.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">CPS</span> did con­clude that there is not enough evid­ence to secure a con­vic­tion.  But it took them two months to come to this decision after the nine-month invest­ig­a­tion.  Even then, the <span class="caps">CPS</span> sought to mis­rep­res­ent the find­ings of the enquiry:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>Final advice from the Crown Pro­sec­u­tion Ser­vice has now been received, say­ing that the mater­ial does not sub­stan­ti­ate the alleg­a­tion made by David Shayler.”</p>
<p>The work of the police and the Crown Pro­sec­u­tion Ser­vice is not to ‘sub­stan­ti­ate […] alleg­a­tions’ or oth­er­wise.  (Any­way, David made a num­ber of alleg­a­tions, not just one).  Its job is to judge whether there is enough evid­ence to secure a con­vic­tion in front of a jury bey­ond any reas­on­able doubt.  That is a very high stand­ard of proof.  The usual test of proof for Par­lia­ment­ary or judi­cial enquir­ies is ‘the bal­ance of probabilities’.</p>
<p>At the time, David commented:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>This is the first time that the police have invest­ig­ated an alleg­a­tion against <span class="caps">MI6</span>, partly because <span class="caps">MI6</span> had a de facto immunity from invest­ig­a­tion into alleg­a­tions of crime on the part of the ser­vice under the Royal Prerog­at­ive.  It demon­strates why <span class="caps">MI6</span> was put on a legal foot­ing in the 1994 Intel­li­gence Ser­vices Act.  The invest­ig­a­tion was not of course ideal.  The police were only look­ing to gather admiss­ible evid­ence, which could be used to secure a con­vic­tion of the two <span class="caps">MI6</span> officers who planned and car­ried out the plot, rather than try­ing to assess all rel­ev­ant mater­ial, includ­ing intelligence.” </p>
<p>This whole pro­cess once again calls into ques­tion the over­sight arrange­ments for the ser­vices and the abil­ity of min­is­ters and offi­cials to dis­charge their legal duties.  In the future, we will be seek­ing per­mis­sion to have the record­ing — on which David’s sworn testi­mony was based — pub­lished so that the Brit­ish people and, it is hoped, Par­lia­ment can see for them­selves the truth of his words. </p>
<p><strong>Fur­ther con­firm­a­tion of the plot</strong></p>
<p>That, again, might have been that but for a book pub­lished by two French journ­al­ists, shortly before David went to trial in Octo­ber 2002.  Guil­laume Dasquié, pub­lisher of Intel­li­gence On-line, and Jean-Charles Bris­ard, a former adviser to French Pres­id­ent Jacques Chirac who worked for the French intel­li­gence ser­vices, pub­lished For­bid­den Truth.  The book con­firms that the Islamic Fight­ing group was the Libyan Al Qaeda cell respons­ible for the attempt on Gaddafi’s life.  The book added that the Islamic Fight­ing Group also included Anas al-Liby, a lead­ing Al Qaeda mem­ber who is wanted for his involve­ment in the African embassy bomb­ings and remains on the <span class="caps">US</span> government’s most wanted list with a reward of $25 mil­lion for his cap­ture.  Al-Liby was with Osama bin Laden in Sudan before the Al Qaeda leader returned to Afgh­anistan in 199632.  Dasquie said:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>Bin Laden wanted to settle in Libya in the early 1990s but was hindered by the gov­ern­ment of Muam­mar Gad­dafi.  Enraged by Libya’s refusal, bin Laden organ­ised attacks inside Libya, includ­ing assas­sin­a­tion attempts against Gaddafi.”.</p>
<p>This provides yet more con­vin­cing evid­ence that Tun­worth was involved with Al Qaeda.  At the very least, <span class="caps">MI6</span> and <span class="caps">MI5</span>’s under­stand­ing of Al Qaeda was so lim­ited that neither ser­vice real­ised the implic­a­tions of Tunworth’s pro­posed coup in Libya: by assas­sin­at­ing Gad­dafi the West would have lost a valu­able ally in the battle with Al Qaeda and instead would have had to face the threat of an Al Qaeda in con­trol of Libyan oil.</p>
<p>Given the tim­ing of the <span class="caps">MI6</span> pay­ments– along with the close rela­tion­ship between the <span class="caps">IFG</span> and bin Laden – it appears that Brit­ish tax­pay­ers’ money was used to fund Al Qaeda attacks in Libya.  Ashur Sha­mis, a Libyan expert on Islamic extrem­ism, also added sup­port to David’s allegation:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>There was a rise in the activ­it­ies of the Islamic Fight­ing Group from 1995 [around the time of the first pay­ment],” he said, “but many in Libya would be shocked if <span class="caps">MI6</span> was involved.”.</p>
<p><strong>Issues raised by the <span class="caps">MI6</span>/Al Qaeda conspiracy</strong></p>
<p>Nearly all experts who work in counter-terrorism — as opposed to people on the “out­side” — believe that assas­sin­a­tions, par­tic­u­larly in the case of heads of state only serve to destabil­ise a region.  This was a view held by the <span class="caps">US</span> National Secur­ity Coun­cil until George W Bush became pres­id­ent.  Although cer­tain Third World lead­ers do not share our stand­ards of demo­cracy, they do provide a cer­tain amount of sta­bil­ity to their coun­try and region.  Remove such a leader from power by assas­sin­a­tion and you will only cre­ate a vacuum, which will lead to unrest and viol­ence as fac­tions com­pete for power. </p>
<p>Under inter­na­tional law, assas­sin­a­tion oper­a­tions are illegal.  The only moral argu­ment for assas­sin­at­ing any dic­tator or ter­ror­ist is that such action would lead to con­sid­er­ably fewer deaths, than leav­ing him in power to con­tinue to sup­port viol­ence against the West.  By 1996, Gad­dafi had ceased to sup­port the <span class="caps">IRA</span> or indeed any ter­ror­ism.  There were, though, a few uncon­firmed reports that he had provided funds to Palestinian res­ist­ance move­ments in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, ter­rit­or­ies illeg­ally occu­pied by Israel and sub­ject to <span class="caps">UN</span> res­ol­u­tions.  In this con­text, Gad­dafi was fund­ing organ­isa­tions fight­ing for their own free­dom, not terrorists.</p>
<p>In addi­tion, <span class="caps">MI6</span> had given its bless­ing to an indi­vidual who was lead­ing a group of Islamic extrem­ists with links to the Al Qaeda net­work.  If Tun­worth, the indi­vidual the Liby­ans caught in the act, had suc­ceeded in assas­sin­at­ing Col­onel Gad­dafi, his sup­port­ers would in all prob­ab­il­ity have set up an Islamic Extrem­ist state in North Africa, fur­ther destabil­ising a region already sub­ject to viol­ence from Islamic fundamentalists. </p>
<p>Once Al Qaeda had Libya, it would have been all too easy for the group to take con­trol of neigh­bour­ing states like Sudan, Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt, which already have their own internal prob­lems with Al Qaeda.  In con­trol of a state like Libya or a region like North Africa, Al Qaeda would have had:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ready access to Libyan funds, run­ning into £billions. </li>
<li>Con­trol of the Libyan oil industry, destabil­ising world oil prices.</li>
<li>The abil­ity to launch many more attacks like Septem­ber 11<sup>th</sup>, killing and maim­ing thou­sands of <span class="caps">UK</span> and <span class="caps">US</span> citizens. </li>
<li>A land bor­der with Israel and there­fore a greatly increased capa­city to attack the state of Israel. </li>
<li>The means to destabil­ise world secur­ity on an enorm­ous scale. </li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, we only have to look at the cur­rent prob­lems in Iraq to see what could have happened, had the <span class="caps">MI6</span>/Al Qaeda con­spir­acy suc­cess­fully led to Gaddafi’s assas­sin­a­tion.  In the absence of West­ern mil­it­ary and secur­ity forces in a post-coup Libya, Al Qaeda would have had an even freer rein than it now has in post-war Iraq.  At the very least, <span class="caps">MI6</span> failed to real­ise the implic­a­tions of Tunworth’s admit­ted asso­ci­ation with Islamic Extrem­ists or his inten­tions, a coup lead­ing to an Al Qaeda state in Libya.  That in itself would be of enorm­ous con­cern, for which <span class="caps">MI6</span> deserves to roundly be cen­sured.  But, the truth is, the agent duped <span class="caps">MI6</span> officers into fund­ing that poten­tial Al Qaeda takeover.  David explains:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>This was an act of ter­ror­ism, in which Bri­tain became a state spon­sor of Islamic extrem­ism.  To put this in con­text, the Pro­vi­sional <span class="caps">IRA</span> tries to avoid harm­ing civil­ians on the basis that it pro­duces bad pub­li­city (although inev­it­ably civil­ians are maimed and murdered when bombs go off on our streets).  Islamic extrem­ists and Al Qaeda have no such restraint.  <span class="caps">MI6</span> con­sciously sup­por­ted ter­ror­ists who pose a greater threat to the national secur­ity of the <span class="caps">UK</span> than the Pro­vi­sional <span class="caps">IRA</span> ever did.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>Although my boss, Paul Slim did not seem to want to know, I made it clear to him that it was his respons­ib­il­ity to take it up the man­age­ment chain.  This whole oper­a­tion was clearly a viol­a­tion of the rule of law that my recruiter had told me the ser­vices must observe.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>I could also clearly see that the rela­tion­ship between Tun­worth and <span class="caps">MI6</span> was flawed.  <span class="caps">MI5</span> had no secur­ity record of Tun­worth and <span class="caps">MI6</span> had only a couple of traces or brief men­tions.  Yet less than six months later, after a hand­ful of meet­ings, <span class="caps">MI6</span> had given him £100,000 of tax­pay­ers’ money to assas­sin­ate a for­eign head of state.  There was no way that <span class="caps">MI6</span> could in that time have estab­lished a close enough rela­tion­ship with him to make any real­istic assess­ment of his char­ac­ter and reli­ab­il­ity – he really could have been anybody.”</p>
<p>If this sort of <span class="caps">MI6</span> activ­ity only went on abroad and did not affect Brit­ish cit­izens, it might be less fright­en­ing for us.  How­ever, <span class="caps">MI6</span> routinely oper­ates in the <span class="caps">UK</span>.  In addi­tion to IOPs35, <span class="caps">UKG</span> (now <span class="caps">PT16B</span>/<span class="caps">OPS</span>) ran agents in the <span class="caps">UK</span> and <span class="caps">UKZ</span> car­ries out surveillance.</p>
<p>If our elec­ted rep­res­ent­at­ives are not allowed to access <span class="caps">MI6</span> doc­u­ments about the con­spir­acy then per­haps they should try using the <span class="caps">US</span> Free­dom of Inform­a­tion Act to obtain final con­firm­a­tion of <span class="caps">MI6</span> fund­ing Tun­worth and the <span class="caps">IFG</span> and Al Qaeda.</p>
<p><strong>Con­clu­sions</strong></p>
<p>As David went on the record pre­cisely because of the <span class="caps">MI6</span> fund­ing of Al Qaeda, it is worth look­ing at what he would have said in his defence in court, had he been allowed one:</p>
<p>Cover-up: There is over­whelm­ing evid­ence to indic­ate that the then For­eign Sec­ret­ary Robin Cook was ‘eco­nom­ical with the truth’.  His state­ment pro­tec­ted mur­der­ers in the intel­li­gence ser­vices and ensured that David was thrown in prison with a view to extra­di­tion.  The media has been slow to put this to Cook and the head of Britain’s intel­li­gence ser­vices, Prime Min­is­ter Tony Blair.  Once the <span class="caps">MI6</span> doc­u­ment appeared on the Inter­net and the police recovered rel­ev­ant mater­ial, it must have been clear to the Prime Min­is­ter that his For­eign Sec­ret­ary had not told the whole truth to the Brit­ish people.  In that situ­ation, he had a simple choice under the min­is­terial code: either cor­rect the state­ment of his min­is­ter or enter into the.  This is a cover up of monu­mental pro­por­tions.  Its implic­a­tions for our demo­cracy and the rule of law are enormous.</p>
<p><strong>Justice:</strong> Although the deaths of a few Liby­ans may not carry as much weight with news­pa­per edit­ors as the deaths of Brit­ish cit­izens, they are still somebody’s sons and daugh­ters.  They are human beings and not ‘col­lat­eral dam­age’ as some com­ment­at­ors have sug­ges­ted.  Brit­ish min­is­ters have a duty to pro­tect life.</p>
<p><strong>Law and order:</strong> Any attempt to assas­sin­ate a for­eign head of state is an act of ter­ror­ism, banned by inter­na­tional law under the Pro­tec­tion of Priv­ileged Per­sons Act 1869.  How can we con­demn Libya for bomb­ing flight <span class="caps">PA</span> 103 over Lock­er­bie or assas­sin­at­ing <span class="caps">WPC</span> Yvonne Fletcher, if we resort to the same ter­rible tactics?</p>
<p><strong>Ter­ror­ism:</strong> Remov­ing Col­onel Gad­dafi would have led to a more extreme des­pot tak­ing over in Libya, which would in all prob­ab­il­ity have led to attacks on Brit­ish, <span class="caps">US</span>, European and Israeli cit­izens.  Al Qaeda mem­bers, enemies of the West then and now, car­ried out the attemp­ted coup.  By this time, <span class="caps">MI6</span> knew that Al Qaeda was respons­ible for the attack on the World Trade Centre in 1993.  At the same time, <span class="caps">MI5</span> had set up a sec­tion, <span class="caps">G9C</span>, in 1995, spe­cific­ally to invest­ig­ate Islamic extrem­ist groups, par­tic­u­larly Al Qaeda.  It was there­fore the height of neg­li­gence (some might say stu­pid­ity) for <span class="caps">MI6</span> to give up to £100,000 of tax­pay­ers’ money to the leader of such a group.</p>
<p><strong>Fail­ure of account­ab­il­ity and over­sight:</strong> Under the 1994 Intel­li­gence Ser­vices Act, <span class="caps">MI6</span> could have sub­mit­ted the plot to the For­eign Sec­ret­ary for per­mis­sion.  With that per­mis­sion, they would have been immune from pro­sec­u­tion.  By not sub­mit­ting, <span class="caps">MI6</span> officers were decid­ing Brit­ish for­eign policy towards Libya, not the demo­crat­ic­ally account­able For­eign Sec­ret­ary.  After David’s return to the <span class="caps">UK</span>, we approached the police to invest­ig­ate the plot.  They ini­tially refused to take pos­ses­sion of David’s evid­ence, allow­ing those involved in the mean­time to per­haps doc­tor the evidence. </p>
<p><strong>Lack of trans­par­ency:</strong> If we can only main­tain our repu­ta­tion for demo­cracy through lying, cheat­ing and obsess­ive secrecy then I sug­gest we are not really a lib­eral demo­cracy at all.  If you want to live in the sort of coun­try in which the intel­li­gence ser­vices are allowed to work in abso­lute secrecy and lit­er­ally get away with murder, I sug­gest you go and live in Iran.  <br />Cor­rup­tion: If you want to live in a func­tion­ing demo­cracy, you have a moral and demo­cratic duty to ensure that the laws of the land are upheld and that they apply equally to every cit­izen of that coun­try.  When the Prime Min­is­ter and the For­eign Sec­ret­ary give <span class="caps">MI6</span> officers a de facto immunity by refus­ing to take evid­ence of their con­spir­ing to murder, they send a very clear mes­sage to <span class="caps">MI6</span>.  And that mes­sage is: “You are above the law.  You can get away with it now and can get away with it in the future.  In fact, you enjoy the same rights as <span class="caps">KGB</span> officers in the former Soviet Union”.</p>
<p><strong>Waste of money:</strong> In the attack, <span class="caps">MI6</span> wasted £100,000 of tax­pay­ers’ money.  These funds could have been bet­ter spent on school­books and medicines. </p>
