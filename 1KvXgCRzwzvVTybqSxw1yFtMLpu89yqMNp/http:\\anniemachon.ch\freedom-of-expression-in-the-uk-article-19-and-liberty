Con­sequently the Brit­ish media’s abil­ity to func­tion<br />as a “watch­dog” of cer­tain areas of offi­cial activ­ity is severely and delib­er­ately<br />impeded by legis­la­tion and offi­cial prac­tice.<br />It is widely recog­nised in inter­na­tional law that free­dom of expres­sion is not an<br />abso­lute right and can legit­im­ately be restric­ted if it harms national secur­ity.<br />How­ever, all such exemp­tions must be accom­pan­ied by adequate safe­guards to<br />pro­tect against their mis­use by gov­ern­ments and to ensure that the bal­ance between<br />national secur­ity and free­dom of expres­sion is prop­erly struck. Such safe­guards are<br />absent from the <span class="caps">UK</span>’s legis­lat­ive frame­work. The pat­tern seen in the courts has been<br />less a care­ful bal­an­cing of free­dom of expres­sion and national secur­ity than judg­ments<br />that dam­age free expres­sion and sup­press rev­el­a­tions of incom­pet­ence, illeg­al­ity and<br />other wrong­do­ing by mem­bers of the secur­ity and intel­li­gence ser­vices and the armed<br />forces.<br />The <span class="caps">UK</span> Gov­ern­ment has a bat­tery of means at its dis­posal to ensure that a veil of<br />offi­cial secrecy is main­tained and the activ­it­ies of the Secur­ity and Intel­li­gence<br />Ser­vices (<span class="caps">SIS</span>) remain unex­amined. Chief among these is the dra­conian Offi­cial<br />Secrets Act (<span class="caps">OSA</span>), which pro­hib­its the dis­clos­ure of a huge range of inform­a­tion by<br />gov­ern­ment employ­ees and the media. Those breach­ing the <span class="caps">OSA</span> face impris­on­ment<br />and fines.<br />The <span class="caps">OSA</span> makes it a crime for cur­rent and ex-members of the Secur­ity and<br />Intel­li­gence Ser­vices to reveal any security-related inform­a­tion, even if such<br />inform­a­tion is not dam­aging to national secur­ity, put­ting the <span class="caps">UK</span> out of step with<br />many other demo­cra­cies. Fur­ther, in many other demo­cratic states such as Ger­many<br />and the Neth­er­lands, pub­lic­a­tion of offi­cial secrets and inform­a­tion harm­ful to<br />national secur­ity can be excused if it serves the pub­lic interest. No such defences for<br />whis­tleblowers or the recip­i­ents and pub­lish­ers of their inform­a­tion exist under <span class="caps">UK</span><br />law.<br />A raft of other mech­an­isms is also used in the <span class="caps">UK</span> to sup­press inform­a­tion, obtain<br />doc­u­ments, com­pel dis­clos­ure of sources and trace and pun­ish those respons­ible for<br />dis­clos­ures of national secur­ity related inform­a­tion. Injunc­tions, pro­duc­tion orders,<br />con­fid­en­ti­al­ity clauses and con­tempt of court laws are just some of the civil and<br />crim­inal mech­an­isms at the Government’s dis­posal. All have been invoked in recent<br />years in the executive’s read­i­ness to seek gag­ging orders, fines and prison sen­tences<br />for pub­lic ser­vants and journ­al­ists who use pro­tec­ted inform­a­tion to pub­li­cise<br />doc­u­ments and alleg­a­tions relat­ing to offi­cial incom­pet­ence, illeg­al­ity or wrong­do­ing.<br />Other powers, such as search and seizure by police, are also used to obtain<br />inform­a­tion. In the use of injunc­tions as a pre­ferred means of sup­press­ing<br />inform­a­tion, the Brit­ish author­it­ies are unfettered by the con­sti­tu­tional, stat­utory or<br />judi­cial safe­guards gov­ern­ing prior restraint in coun­tries such as Aus­tria, France,<br />Sweden and the <span class="caps">US</span>. Nor do <span class="caps">UK</span> journ­al­ists enjoy the same right as their coun­ter­parts<br />in many other European coun­tries to pro­tect the con­fid­en­ti­al­ity of their sources.<br />The report iden­ti­fies the alarm­ing tend­ency of the <span class="caps">UK</span> judi­ciary to defer to the<br />Gov­ern­ment in these mat­ters and its fail­ure to observe the neces­sity to bal­ance<br />national secur­ity con­sid­er­a­tions against the pub­lic interest and the right to free­dom of<br />expres­sion.<br />Among the recom­mend­a­tions we make are:<br />• that the Gov­ern­ment con­ducts a review of all law and prac­tice relat­ing to<br />   national secur­ity, includ­ing ongo­ing pro­sec­u­tions;<br />• intro­duc­tion of mech­an­isms for proper demo­cratic scru­tiny of the activ­it­ies of<br />   the secur­ity and intel­li­gence ser­vices;<br />• estab­lish­ment of a nar­row defin­i­tion of national secur­ity;<br />• spe­cific inclu­sion of a sub­stan­tial harm test for dis­clos­ures relat­ing to national<br />   secur­ity offences and a pub­lic interest defence for those accused of breach­ing<br />  offi­cial secrecy; and<br />• legal pro­tec­tion for Secur­ity and Intel­li­gence Ser­vices “whis­tleblowers”.<br />This report fur­ther provides an ana­lysis of how the <span class="caps">UK</span> Gov­ern­ment uses the law to<br />pre­vent dis­clos­ures of security-related inform­a­tion by gov­ern­ment employ­ees, the<br />media and mem­bers of the pub­lic. The legis­lat­ive frame­work is meas­ured against<br />inter­na­tional legal stand­ards and found want­ing. The report also ana­lyses the role of<br />the judi­ciary and its fail­ure to sub­ject gov­ern­ment claims about national secur­ity to<br />close scru­tiny. It sets out the laws and mech­an­isms which restrict dis­clos­ure of<br />national security-related inform­a­tion, and details the ways in which this mat­rix of<br />civil and crim­inal legis­la­tion has been used by the Gov­ern­ment in the last three years<br />against former secur­ity ser­vice employ­ees, mem­bers of the pub­lic, and the media.<br />The report also con­siders the Human Rights Act 1998, which incor­por­ates the<br />European Con­ven­tion of Human Rights into domestic law, and its implic­a­tions for<br />reform­ing the <span class="caps">UK</span> régime of free­dom of expres­sion in the con­text of national secur­ity.<br />The report dis­cusses the options open for reform, and con­cludes with a list of four­teen<br />recom­mend­a­tions that would ensure that the <span class="caps">UK</span> régime gov­ern­ing free­dom of<br />expres­sion and national secur­ity con­forms to the stand­ards and prac­tices befit­ting a<br />mod­ern, open and healthy demo­cratic soci­ety.<br />Sum­mary of Recom­mend­a­tions<br />Recom­mend­a­tion 1: The gov­ern­ment should imme­di­ately review all national<br />secur­ity laws for com­pli­ance with these recom­mend­a­tions.<br />Recom­mend­a­tion 2: All ongo­ing pro­sec­u­tions and other legal meas­ures, as well as<br />any sanc­tions already imposed, should be reviewed for com­pli­ance with these<br />recom­mend­a­tions and remedial meas­ures taken where neces­sary.<br />Recom­mend­a­tion 3: All national secur­ity restric­tions should be sub­ject to a full<br />appeal on the mer­its by the courts.<br />Recom­mend­a­tion 4: All national secur­ity legis­la­tion should include a clear and<br />nar­row stat­utory defin­i­tion of national secur­ity.<br />Recom­mend­a­tion 5: Those seek­ing to restrict expres­sion should bear the bur­den of<br />prov­ing that the restric­tion com­plies with these recom­mend­a­tions.<br />Recom­mend­a­tion 6: No restric­tion on expres­sion or inform­a­tion should be<br />con­sidered legit­im­ate unless it meets the three-part test under the European<br />Con­ven­tion.<br />Recom­mend­a­tion 7: No one should be sub­ject to crim­inal pen­alty for dis­clos­ure of<br />inform­a­tion unless that dis­clos­ure poses a real risk of sub­stan­tial harm to a legit­im­ate<br />national secur­ity interest and there was a spe­cific inten­tion to cause harm of that sort.<br />Recom­mend­a­tion 8: All restric­tions on expres­sion and inform­a­tion should be sub­ject<br />to a pub­lic interest defence.<br />Recom­mend­a­tion 9: Any sanc­tions for breach of laws

<span class="caps">UN</span> United Nations Pre­face<br />Pre­face<br />In the last few years, the issues sur­round­ing whis­tleblow­ing, free­dom of expres­sion<br />and national secur­ity in the <span class="caps">UK</span> have been attract­ing high levels of atten­tion. The<br />Brit­ish government’s sin­gle­minded pur­suit of vari­ous ex-intelligence offi­cials,<br />journ­al­ists and media out­lets has gen­er­ated much con­tro­versy. Not since Clive<br />Pont­ing was acquit­ted by a jury act­ing against the instruc­tions of the judge,1 and<br />Sarah Tis­dall was con­victed and imprisoned in order to deter other civil ser­vants from<br />leak­ing inform­a­tion to the media,2 have offences under the Offi­cial Secrets Acts been<br />the sub­ject of such debate. Not since Peter Wright was pur­sued through the civil<br />courts of sev­eral coun­tries for years on end – at a cost to the tax­payer of some £3<br />mil­lion – in a failed attempt to pre­vent pub­lic­a­tion of his mem­oirs, have injunc­tions<br />enjoyed such a high media profile.3<br />The Brit­ish Gov­ern­ment “has an appalling record of attempt­ing to clas­sify as ‘top<br />secret’ mere polit­ical embarrassment.“4 Only recently, the Government’s record in<br />this area attrac­ted cri­ti­cism from the <span class="caps">UN</span> Spe­cial Rap­por­teur on Free­dom of Opin­ion<br />and Expression.5 But if the recent dis­clos­ures have sub­stance, it is not mere<br />embar­rass­ment that the gov­ern­ment has shown itself keen to avoid through its actions,<br />but also the expos­ure of, and need to take action on, illegal and dan­ger­ous activ­it­ies<br />1<br />R v Pont­ing [1985] Crim.

The <span class="caps">UK</span> legal régime<br />cur­rently per­mits no way of pro­tect­ing whis­tleblowers who work within the Secur­ity<br />and Intel­li­gence Ser­vices, and instead provides a bat­tery of legal mech­an­isms to<br />pun­ish and deter them. Rather than invest­ig­at­ing whis­tleblowers’ claims and mak­ing<br />pub­lic any evid­ence it may have that the alleg­a­tions are false, the Gov­ern­ment has<br />made use of these mech­an­isms to try and limit their dis­sem­in­a­tion.

Whereas many other<br />coun­tries have long had declas­si­fic­a­tion and dis­clos­ure pro­ced­ures which give<br />sub­stance to the public’s right to know about their gov­ern­ments’ activ­it­ies, <span class="caps">UK</span><br />gov­ern­ments have to date res­isted attempts to intro­duce effect­ive free­dom of<br />inform­a­tion legis­la­tion. The draft law on free­dom of inform­a­tion cur­rently going<br />through Par­lia­ment is a great deal less pro­gress­ive than those pub­lished by trans­itional<br />demo­cra­cies such as Bul­garia and Mol­dova, and includes broader exemp­tions than<br />those felt to be neces­sary in the laws of Aus­tralia, Canada, Ire­land and New Zealand.8<br />One place from which to begin to under­stand the defi­cien­cies of the <span class="caps">UK</span> régime is the<br />lack of judi­cial scru­tiny. In the <span class="caps">US</span>, the Neth­er­lands and Ger­many, the courts exer­cise<br />the power to exam­ine gov­ern­ment claims that national secur­ity is harmed.9 In France<br />an inde­pend­ent com­mis­sion which has access to clas­si­fied inform­a­tion decides<br />whether the courts can have sim­ilar access. By con­trast, the judi­cial stand­ard in<br />Brit­ish courts appears to be a vir­tu­ally unques­tion­ing accept­ance of the Government’s<br />claims of national secur­ity, with no body inde­pend­ent of the exec­ut­ive to hold the<br />Government’s claims to account.<br />Now is an appos­ite time to recon­sider the <span class="caps">UK</span> régime gov­ern­ing free­dom of<br />expres­sion and offi­cial secrecy. The European Con­ven­tion on Human Rights has been<br />incor­por­ated into domestic law via the Human Rights Act 1998, which came into<br />force in Octo­ber 2000. It will fun­da­ment­ally change the legal land­scape. The right to<br />free­dom of expres­sion will cease to be defined purely by com­mon law rules, as a<br />resid­ual free­dom occupy­ing the space left by stat­utory restric­tions. It will itself be<br />estab­lished by stat­ute – a stat­ute, moreover, against which all oth­ers must be assessed<br />for com­pat­ib­il­ity.

It is a right that lies at<br />the heart of demo­cratic soci­ety, because it makes pos­sible the mean­ing­ful exer­cise of<br />cit­izens’ demo­cratic rights. For this reason, it has been described as “the touch­stone of<br />all the freedoms to which the United Nations is consecrated”.10 The guar­an­tee of free<br />expres­sion is a key means of hold­ing gov­ern­ment to account and of pro­tect­ing cit­izens<br />against abuses of their rights. The press, as the con­duit through which indi­vidu­als can<br />dis­sem­in­ate and obtain inform­a­tion, has a “pre-eminent role … in a State gov­erned by<br />the rule of law”.11<br />The right to free­dom of expres­sion is enshrined in a range of inter­na­tional and<br />regional treat­ies and instru­ments which bind the United King­dom. These include<br />Art­icle 19 of the Inter­na­tional Cov­en­ant on Civil and Polit­ical Rights (<span class="caps">ICCPR</span>), which<br />codi­fies the Uni­ver­sal Declar­a­tion of Human Rights, and Art­icle 10 of the European<br />Con­ven­tion on Human Rights (<span class="caps">ECHR</span>). Free­dom of expres­sion also enjoys<br />recog­ni­tion in the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights and the Amer­ican<br />Con­ven­tion on Human Rights.<br />Art­icle 19 of the <span class="caps">ICCPR</span> and Art­icle 10 of the <span class="caps">ECHR</span> encom­pass the right both to<br />receive and to impart inform­a­tion.

This is recog­nised in both the <span class="caps">ICCPR</span> and the <span class="caps">ECHR</span>, which allow for lim­ited<br />restric­tions on free­dom of expres­sion. For example, it is acknow­ledged that<br />expres­sion may be restric­ted in cer­tain cases where it harms the repu­ta­tion of<br />indi­vidu­als. Sim­il­arly, national secur­ity con­sid­er­a­tions jus­tify cer­tain restric­tions on<br />free­dom of expres­sion.<br />How­ever, any restric­tion must sat­isfy cer­tain strin­gent cri­teria in order that they do<br />not encroach upon the legit­im­ate scope of free expres­sion. There is a well-founded<br />danger that gov­ern­ments will mis­use exemp­tions to pre­vent speech for reas­ons other<br />than that stated, par­tic­u­larly where it involves national secur­ity. It is not suf­fi­cient for<br />a gov­ern­ment simply to assert that national secur­ity is in issue. Rather, inter­na­tional<br />and national jur­is­pru­dence, as well as the clear lan­guage of the treat­ies, requires that<br />any restric­tions meet the fol­low­ing three-part test, as set out by the <span class="caps">ECHR</span> and other<br />courts:<br />The first require­ment is that the restric­tion be pre­scribed by law. The idea of<br />law­ful­ness which flows from this encom­passes sev­eral dis­tinct com­pon­ents. It means,<br />first, that the restric­tion must be set clearly in law, for example, in the stat­utes enacted<br />by Par­lia­ment, through the com­mon law artic­u­lated by judges, in sec­ond­ary<br />legis­la­tion, or in pro­fes­sional rules. Second, the restric­tion must be artic­u­lated with<br />suf­fi­cient pre­ci­sion to meet the tests of legal cer­tainty and fore­see­ab­il­ity; it is<br />import­ant for cit­izens and the press to be able to under­stand their oblig­a­tions and<br />pre­dict when a cer­tain dis­clos­ure is likely to be unlaw­ful. Laws which are excess­ively<br />vague or which allow for excess­ive dis­cre­tion in their applic­a­tion fail to pro­tect<br />indi­vidu­als against arbit­rary inter­fer­ence and do not con­sti­tute adequate safe­guards<br />against abuse. They “exert an unac­cept­able chilling effect on free­dom of expres­sion as<br />cit­izens steer well clear of the poten­tial zone of applic­a­tion to avoid censure.“12<br />The second cri­terion that a restric­tion on free­dom of expres­sion must meet is that it be<br />genu­inely dir­ec­ted towards achiev­ing one of the legit­im­ate aims spe­cified in the<br />treat­ies. If an individual’s free­dom of expres­sion is to be cur­tailed in the interests of<br />national secur­ity, the restric­tions imposed must actu­ally pro­tect national secur­ity.<br />Restric­tions that pre­vent the pub­lic from learn­ing of illeg­al­ity and wrong­do­ing from<br />whis­tleblowers in our state insti­tu­tions fail this part of the test.<br />Even where a restric­tion can sat­isfy the first and second cri­teria, it will be a legit­im­ate<br />lim­it­a­tion on the right to free expres­sion only if it is neces­sary in a demo­cratic soci­ety.<br />This cri­terion will be met only where the restric­tion ful­fils a press­ing social need.13<br />The notion of neces­sity requires, in addi­tion, the key ele­ment of proportionality.14<br />12<br />Writ­ten com­ments sub­mit­ted by <span class="caps">ARTICLE</span> 19 in the case of Leader Pub­lic­a­tions (Pvt) Lim­ited v<br />Rubas­inghe and Ors, 30 June 2000, p.9<br />13<br />Sunday Times v United King­dom, 26 April 1979, No 30, 2 <span class="caps">EHRR</span> 245<br />14<br />Handyside v United King­dom, 7 Decem­ber 1976, No 24, 1 <span class="caps">EHRR</span> 737<br />Where national secur­ity does require that free­dom of expres­sion be cur­tailed, the<br />restric­tions imposed must impair that right as little as pos­sible, or at least not to an<br />extent dis­pro­por­tion­ate with the import­ance of the legit­im­ate aim being pur­sued.<br />These cri­teria estab­lish a gen­eral pre­sump­tion in favour of free expres­sion. Free<br />expres­sion is the basic default pos­i­tion from which any depar­ture must be jus­ti­fied.<br />The excep­tions in Art­icle 10(2) must be con­strued narrowly.15 Only where these<br />cri­teria are ful­filled will it be legit­im­ate to cur­tail the right to free expres­sion in the<br />name of national secur­ity. The bur­den of demon­strat­ing the valid­ity of the restric­tion<br />should rest with the author­it­ies. Moreover, claims to have sat­is­fied the cri­teria for a<br />legit­im­ate restric­tion must be sub­ject to proper inde­pend­ent scrutiny.16 The judi­ciary<br />has a cru­cial role to play in ensur­ing that free­dom of expres­sion is impeded no more<br />than is strictly required in the pub­lic interest.<br />1.2 The Johan­nes­burg Prin­ciples<br />The aim of the Johan­nes­burg Principles17 (see Appendix 1) is to spell out more clearly<br />what these stand­ards require of gov­ern­ments in rela­tion to national secur­ity. Draw­ing<br />on inter­na­tional and regional case law, the Johan­nes­burg Prin­ciples were defined by a<br />group of experts con­vened by <span class="caps">ARTICLE</span> 19 in Octo­ber 1995. Their aim is to cla­rify<br />the mean­ing of – and the scope of jus­ti­fi­able lim­it­a­tions upon – the right to free<br />expres­sion as con­tained in vari­ous inter­na­tional con­ven­tions and cov­en­ants, includ­ing<br />the <span class="caps">ECHR</span>. This “flesh­ing out” has received pos­it­ive com­ment from the <span class="caps">UN</span> Spe­cial<br />Rap­por­teur for Free­dom of Expres­sion and the <span class="caps">UN</span> Spe­cial Rap­por­teur on the<br />Inde­pend­ence of Judges and Lawyers.18<br />The Prin­ciples recog­nise that national secur­ity is a valid reason for impos­ing<br />restric­tions on the free flow of information.19 How­ever, if the pre­sump­tion in favour<br />of free­dom of expres­sion and of access to inform­a­tion is to be respec­ted, the scope of<br />the excep­tion needs to be defined as strictly and as nar­rowly as pos­sible. To this end<br />the Prin­ciples include a clear defin­i­tion of what con­sti­tutes legit­im­ate national<br />secur­ity interest. A restric­tion on the right to free expres­sion is jus­ti­fied in the<br />interests of national secur­ity only if its effect is to “pro­tect a country’s exist­ence or its<br />ter­rit­orial integ­rity against the use or threat of force, or its capa­city to respond to the<br />use or threat of force.“20 Moreover, the pre­sump­tion in favour of free­dom of<br />expres­sion requires gov­ern­ments to demon­strate that the expres­sion will actu­ally harm<br />national secur­ity; the mere asser­tion of this by the exec­ut­ive will be insuf­fi­cient.<br />The prin­ciples also state expli­citly that the public’s right to inform­a­tion must be given<br />due weight. A state may not cat­egor­ic­ally deny access to all inform­a­tion related to<br />national secur­ity, but des­ig­nate in law only those spe­cific and nar­row cat­egor­ies of<br />inform­a­tion neces­sary to pro­tect legit­im­ate national secur­ity interests (Prin­ciples 11,<br />15<br />Sunday Times v United King­dom, 1979, 2 <span class="caps">EHRR</span> 245<br />Sil­ver and Oth­ers v United King­dom, 25 March 1983, No 61, 5 <span class="caps">EHRR</span> 347; Handyside v United<br />King­dom 7 Decem­ber 1976, No 24, 1 <span class="caps">EHRR</span> 737<br />17<br />The Johan­nes­burg Principles:National Secur­ity, Free­dom of Expres­sion and Access toIn­form­a­tion,<br /><span class="caps">ARTICLE</span> 19, Media Law and Prac­tice Series, 1996<br />18<br />Sandra Coliver, ?Com­ment­ary on the Johan­nes­burg Prin­ciples,’ in Sandra Coliver et al, Secrecy and<br />Liberty: National Secur­ity, Free­dom of Expres­sion and Access to Inform­a­tion, Kluwer Law, 1999,<br />pp.80–81<br />19<br />Prin­ciple 1©<br />20<br />Prin­ciple 2(a)<br />16<br />12). As a res­ult, once a piece of inform­a­tion is in the pub­lic domain no threat to<br />national secur­ity is posed by fur­ther dis­clos­ure, and these can­not legit­im­ately be<br />pre­ven­ted. Such actions do not meet the legit­im­ate aim of restrict­ing free expres­sion<br />to pro­tect national secur­ity, as the Spycatcher case established.21<br />In addi­tion, the Prin­ciples state the widely accep­ted view that there is a fun­da­mental<br />pub­lic interest in know­ing about wrong­do­ing and illeg­al­it­ies. National secur­ity can­not<br />be used to pre­vent dis­clos­ures expos­ing illeg­al­it­ies or wrong­do­ing, no mat­ter how<br />embar­rass­ing to the government.22 There is no jus­ti­fic­a­tion for pun­ish­ing<br />whis­tleblowers when they reveal inform­a­tion that is embar­rass­ing or that exposes<br />wrong­do­ing. This aspect of the pub­lic interest remains fun­da­mental even when such<br />dis­clos­ures harm national secur­ity. No per­son may be pun­ished for mak­ing<br />dis­clos­ures that dam­age national secur­ity if the pub­lic interest in know­ing the<br />inform­a­tion out­weighs the harm from disclosure.23 Whis­tleblowers’ free­dom of<br />expres­sion should there­fore be recog­nised to be worthy of pro­tec­tion, even when<br />legit­im­ate national secur­ity con­sid­er­a­tions are in play.<br />1.3 Con­clu­sion<br />Pre­serving free expres­sion and the interests of national secur­ity is not just a ques­tion<br />of find­ing the appro­pri­ate bal­ance in situ­ations where the two appear to con­flict. It is<br />also neces­sary that ulti­mately this bal­ance should be struck by bod­ies, par­tic­u­larly the<br />courts, that are not open to abuse by gov­ern­ment. Those who wield exec­ut­ive power<br />may act in their own polit­ical interest, rather than the broader pub­lic interest, and<br />abuse restric­tions to avoid embar­rass­ing rev­el­a­tions, and the expos­ure of<br />incom­pet­ence, illeg­al­ity and other forms of wrong­ful action. As we shall see, ensur­ing<br />that the pro­ced­ures and mech­an­isms work to safe­guard free­dom of expres­sion<br />requires, among other things, a clear defin­i­tion of national secur­ity that is sub­ject to<br />crit­ical judi­cial over­sight.<br />21<br />The Observer and Guard­ian v.

The lack of<br />effect­ive judi­cial scru­tiny<br />2.1 National secur­ity exemp­tions<br />It is essen­tial that restric­tions on free­dom of expres­sion, includ­ing for reas­ons of<br />national secur­ity, be sub­ject to effect­ive over­sight by the courts. To ful­fil this<br />func­tion, it is neces­sary for the judi­ciary to be able decide whether, in fact, national<br />secur­ity is threatened. In Bri­tain, the right to effect­ive review is under­mined by the<br />lim­ited scope of judi­cial over­sight and the lack of any clear stat­utory guidelines for<br />examin­ing what national secur­ity cov­ers.<br />The extent of super­vi­sion by the courts of national secur­ity restric­tions is presently<br />lim­ited to the stand­ard of judi­cial review. This is sat­is­fied if the gov­ern­ment can<br />per­suade the court that national secur­ity was con­sidered as a rel­ev­ant factor when the<br />con­tested decision was made. Under this approach, judges do not eval­u­ate whether the<br />decision-maker came to a cor­rect decision, in other words, whether national secur­ity<br />actu­ally does jus­tify the restriction.24<br />The poten­tial for mis­use of national secur­ity exemp­tions is exacer­bated by a tend­ency<br />towards judi­cial defer­ence in issues involving national secur­ity. For example, Richard<br />Tom­lin­son, an ex-MI5 officer, was denied recourse to an employ­ment tribunal simply<br />on the grounds that the gov­ern­ment would have to divulge inform­a­tion relat­ing to<br />national security.25 Sim­ilar defer­ence tends to pre­vail when the gov­ern­ment seeks<br />injunc­tions to pre­vent dis­clos­ures of pur­portedly sens­it­ive information.26 It has been<br />observed that “courts in coun­tries around the world tend to demon­strate the least<br />inde­pend­ence and greatest defer­ence to the claims of gov­ern­ment when national<br />secur­ity is invoked.“27 The European Court of Human Rights has ten­ded in the past to<br />regard a state’s “mar­gin of appre­ci­ation” – its dis­cre­tion to determ­ine for itself the<br />com­pat­ib­il­ity of restric­tions on rights with the <span class="caps">ECHR28</span> – as being widest where<br />national secur­ity con­sid­er­a­tions are involved.29 At the very point where domestic<br />courts become most defer­en­tial and least inquis­it­ive, the European Court appeared to<br />be more will­ing to take gov­ern­ments’ claims at face value.<br />Mis­use of the legit­im­ate national secur­ity exemp­tion in the <span class="caps">UK</span> to avoid<br />embar­rass­ment and gag whis­tleblowers has been facil­it­ated by the fact that the<br />concept of national secur­ity is often left undefined. It is defined neither in the <span class="caps">ECHR</span><br />nor any­where in <span class="caps">UK</span> legis­la­tion. National secur­ity has been described as a pro­tean<br />24<br />Coun­cil of Civil Ser­vice Uni­ons v Min­is­ter for the Civil Ser­vice [1985] <span class="caps">AC</span> 374.

The mar­gin of appre­ci­ation is a<br />highly con­tested doc­trine but in any case, the Court has estab­lished that this mar­gin of<br />appre­ci­ation is far from infin­ite. In cer­tain rul­ings, it has shown itself to have teeth,<br />able to tear at the veil of national secur­ity that gov­ern­ments draw around their actions.<br />In so doing, it has indic­ated that the <span class="caps">ECHR</span> requires our domestic judi­ciary to sub­ject<br />gov­ern­mental claims regard­ing national secur­ity to a deeper and more crit­ical scru­tiny<br />than is gen­er­ally the case.<br />As described in sec­tion 1.1, judges too often leave the defin­i­tion of national secur­ity<br />largely in the hands of the exec­ut­ive, which effect­ively gives those with an interest in<br />sup­press­ing embar­rass­ing or incon­veni­ent inform­a­tion carte blanche to define national<br />secur­ity for their own con­veni­ence. This has been recog­nised to be unac­cept­able by<br />the European Court of Human Rights, which has held that judi­cial review in the <span class="caps">UK</span><br />fails to provide an effect­ive rem­edy to the applic­ant, as required by Art­icle 13 of the<br /><span class="caps">ECHR</span>.32 In the case of an Egyp­tian cleric’s appeal against deport­a­tion, the Court<br />found that the <span class="caps">UK</span> Government’s invoc­a­tion of national secur­ity con­cerns was<br />unsat­is­fact­ory grounds for refus­ing to divulge inform­a­tion jus­ti­fy­ing the deport­a­tion<br />decision. Excess­ive judi­cial defer­ence to the exec­ut­ive on the defin­i­tion of national<br />secur­ity could, there­fore, sim­il­arly be regarded as con­trary to the <span class="caps">ECHR</span>.<br />In response to the judg­ment in the Chahal case above, the gov­ern­ment estab­lished the<br />Spe­cial Immig­ra­tion Appeals Com­mis­sion (<span class="caps">SIAC</span>) to which immig­ra­tion appeals<br />could be referred. In a recent hear­ing, <span class="caps">SIAC</span> rejec­ted sug­ges­tions that what con­sti­tutes<br />a danger to national secur­ity is a mat­ter for the gov­ern­ment to determ­ine and not<br />within the com­pet­ence of the courts to assess, save inso­far as was neces­sary for<br />judi­cial review pur­poses. Rather, <span class="caps">SIAC</span> took the view that the Spe­cial Immig­ra­tion<br />Appeals Com­mis­sion Act 1997 had con­ferred on it the jur­is­dic­tion to determ­ine for<br />itself both the mean­ing of a “danger to national secur­ity” and whether that defin­i­tion<br />was sat­is­fied on the facts in issue. Whilst the views of the exec­ut­ive – based on<br />priv­ileged access to inform­a­tion and expert­ise – were to be accor­ded con­sid­er­able<br />weight, the ulti­mate assess­ment of whether national secur­ity was under threat was felt<br />to be squarely within <span class="caps">SIAC</span>’s own remit. The Home Sec­ret­ary was required to prove<br />to a high civil bal­ance of prob­ab­il­it­ies that, on the facts of the case, the indi­vidual was<br />a danger to national secur­ity, as defined by <span class="caps">SIAC</span>.<br />30<br />Sec­ret­ary of State for the Home Depart­ment v Shafiq Ur Reh­man, 23 May 2000, No. 1999/1268/C,<br />para.35.

Lord Woolf <span class="caps">MR</span> sup­plied a wider defin­i­tion for use by <span class="caps">SIAC</span> in<br />recon­sid­er­ing the case. The core of this defin­i­tion is that a danger to national secur­ity<br />exists where there is at least a “real pos­sib­il­ity” of dir­ect or indir­ect “adverse<br />reper­cus­sions” on the secur­ity of the <span class="caps">UK</span>.34<br />This is the closest we have yet come to a defin­i­tion of national secur­ity for the<br />pur­poses of <span class="caps">UK</span> law. It is still a wider defin­i­tion than desir­able, and its applic­a­tion is<br />con­fined to the issues of ter­ror­ism and immig­ra­tion. The import­ant point for present<br />pur­poses, how­ever, is not so much the con­tent of the defin­i­tions offered by <span class="caps">SIAC</span> and<br />the Court of Appeal, but rather the fact that <span class="caps">SIAC</span> has unam­bigu­ously been con­firmed<br />as the arbiter of national secur­ity for cases within its jur­is­dic­tion. The judi­cial<br />defer­ence found in judi­cial review pro­ceed­ings was rejec­ted in favour of a full crit­ical<br />scru­tiny of exec­ut­ive claims regard­ing national secur­ity.<br /><span class="caps">SIAC</span> is not a typ­ical court: its three mem­bers are drawn not only from the judi­ciary,<br />but also from the Immig­ra­tion Appeal Tribunal and from amongst those with<br />“exper­i­ence of national secur­ity meas­ures”. 35 In con­firm­ing that <span class="caps">SIAC</span> did have<br />author­ity to “pierce the veil” of national secur­ity, Lord Woolf <span class="caps">MR</span> appears to have<br />been impressed by this unusual com­pos­i­tion. He noted that “[w]ithout stat­utory<br />inter­ven­tion, this is not a role which a court read­ily adopts. But <span class="caps">SIAC</span>’s mem­ber­ship<br />meant that it was more appro­pri­ate for <span class="caps">SIAC</span> to per­form this role.“36<br />2.3 Con­clu­sion<br />It is unclear to what extent this approach will be regarded as ?trans­fer­able? from the<br />con­text of <span class="caps">SIAC</span>. The fact that <span class="caps">SIAC</span>’s stat­utory author­ity to scru­tin­ise the exec­ut­ive<br />was con­ferred because the European Court found excess­ive judi­cial defer­ence to be in<br />breach of the <span class="caps">ECHR</span> lends sub­stance to beliefs that such will­ing­ness to sub­ject claims<br />regard­ing national secur­ity to proper scru­tiny may travel across the court sys­tem more<br />gen­er­ally. In addi­tion, the Human Rights Act 1998 requires pub­lic author­it­ies,<br />includ­ing the courts, to com­ply with the <span class="caps">ECHR</span>. As such, it is able to provide courts<br />with the requis­ite author­ity to exam­ine the sub­stance of exec­ut­ive claims to national<br />secur­ity along the lines of the <span class="caps">SIAC</span>.37<br />The lack of effect­ive and inde­pend­ent judi­cial scru­tiny on national secur­ity issues<br />under­mines the right to inde­pend­ent review, and makes it impossible to inde­pend­ently<br />ascer­tain what con­sti­tutes harm in the government’s applic­a­tion of cer­tain laws<br />gov­ern­ing offi­cial secrecy. Effect­ive scru­tiny is also cru­cial when the Gov­ern­ment is<br />gran­ted injunc­tions based on a claim that the dis­clos­ure of inform­a­tion would be<br />pre­ju­di­cial to national secur­ity.<br />33<br />Sec­ret­ary of State for the Home Depart­ment v Shafiq Ur Reh­man, 23 May 2000, No. 1999/1268/C,<br />Court of Appeal, Civil Divi­sion<br />34<br />Ibid., para.39<br />35<br />Ibid., para.11; and s. 1 Spe­cial Immig­ra­tion Appeals Com­mis­sion Act 1997<br />36<br />Ibid., para.42<br />37<br />How­ever, it is worth not­ing that Art­icle 13 ? on which the Chahal decision was based ? is not<br />incor­por­ated by the Human Rights Act 1998. Con­sequently, there must be some danger that the courts<br />might not recog­nise the Act as sup­ply­ing them with the requis­ite author­ity<br />3 Legal restric­tions on pub­lic employ­ees? free­dom of<br />expres­sion: restrict­ing Primary Dis­clos­ure<br />There are vari­ous legal mech­an­isms in place for poli­cing the bound­ar­ies between free<br />expres­sion and national secur­ity. The Offi­cial Secrets Act 1989 (<span class="caps">OSA</span>) is the most<br />import­ant of these. It imposes vari­ous crim­inal pen­al­ties for unau­thor­ised dis­clos­ures<br />by cur­rent and former pub­lic employ­ees as well as for non-employees (see Chapter 4).<br />Of at least equal import­ance in sup­press­ing cer­tain kinds of dis­clos­ure is the nexus of<br />civil injunc­tions to restrain dis­clos­ures on the basis of oblig­a­tions of con­fid­ence,<br />com­bined with the use of con­tempt of court pen­al­ties for any sub­sequent breach of<br />those injunc­tions. Whichever route is taken, the ulti­mate sanc­tion for mak­ing<br />dis­clos­ures is the threat of being fined and/or incar­cer­ated by the state.<br />Moreover, the pen­al­ties imposed on those pub­lic employ­ees or ex-employees who<br />make unau­thor­ised dis­clos­ures are often expli­citly inten­ded to have deterrent effects<br />on oth­ers. Sarah Tis­dall, a civil ser­vant, was sen­tenced to six months impris­on­ment<br />for leak­ing doc­u­ments to the press, a sen­tence which the Court of Appeal held to be<br />appro­pri­ate in reflect­ing an ele­ment of deterrence.38 The pun­ish­ment meted out to<br />whis­tleblowers will not neces­sar­ily be pro­por­tion­ate to the crime they com­mit. This<br />con­flicts with Prin­ciple 24 of the Johan­nes­burg Principles,39 and con­tra­venes the<br />pro­por­tion­al­ity test inher­ent in the <span class="caps">ECHR</span> require­ment that any restric­tion on free<br />expres­sion be “neces­sary in a demo­cratic soci­ety”, which applies to pen­al­ties as well<br />as to the nature of the restrictions.40 When breaches are pun­ished in this way, the civil<br />and crim­inal law relat­ing to national secur­ity can be used inten­tion­ally to seek a<br />chilling effect that can­not be con­strued merely as the unin­ten­ded unfor­tu­nate by–<br />product of dili­gently pro­tect­ing the pub­lic interest in national secur­ity.<br />3.1 The Offi­cial Secrets Act<br />There has been an Offi­cial Secrets Act (<span class="caps">OSA</span>) in force since the first Act was passed<br />in 1911. Offences of espi­on­age from the ori­ginal Act sur­vive in the 1911 Act but it is<br />the Offi­cial Secrets Act 1989 which is rel­ev­ant for present pur­poses. The <span class="caps">OSA</span><br />con­tains a range of offences relat­ing to primary dis­clos­ure – that is, dis­clos­ure by<br />cur­rent and former mem­bers of the civil ser­vice, secur­ity ser­vices or armed forces – of<br />vari­ous types of inform­a­tion. It also cre­ates an offence relat­ing to sec­ond­ary<br />dis­clos­ure – that is, the fur­ther dis­sem­in­a­tion, by journ­al­ists and oth­ers, of inform­a­tion<br />obtained as a res­ult of a primary dis­clos­ure. All the major offences under the <span class="caps">OSA</span><br />are pun­ish­able with a max­imum term of two years impris­on­ment and/or an unlim­ited<br />fine.41<br />38<br />R v Tis­dall (Sarah) (1984) 6 Cr.App.R.(S.).

These pub­lic employ­ees are<br />sub­ject to a much more strin­gent oblig­a­tion of secrecy than are other civil ser­vants or<br />mem­bers of the armed forces. The lat­ter are liable only where the dis­clos­ures they<br />make are “dam­aging”, but dis­clos­ures made by the former may be pen­al­ised without<br />proof of dam­age. Any­one who works or has worked for <span class="caps">MI5</span> or <span class="caps">MI6</span> is guilty of a<br />crim­inal offence if they dis­close any inform­a­tion relat­ing to secur­ity or intel­li­gence<br />gleaned as a res­ult of their employment.42 Present and ex-Security and Intel­li­gence<br />per­son­nel are sub­ject to a blanket ban on reveal­ing any security-related inform­a­tion.<br />As such, cur­rent and former mem­bers of <span class="caps">MI5</span>, <span class="caps">MI6</span> and <span class="caps">GCHQ</span> may be imprisoned for<br />mak­ing harm­less rev­el­a­tions that have no impact on genu­ine national secur­ity<br />interests.<br />Moreover, in these cases the <span class="caps">OSA</span> does not provide for a pub­lic interest defence.43<br />That is, the <span class="caps">OSA</span> does not allow for the idea that it may be in the pub­lic interest for a<br />dis­clos­ure to be made. Under the Act, genu­ine whis­tleblowers are not dis­tin­guished<br />from those who make mali­cious or mis­chiev­ous dis­clos­ures. In Ger­many and the<br />Neth­er­lands, pub­lic­a­tion of offi­cial secrets and inform­a­tion harm­ful to national<br />secur­ity can be excused if it serves the pub­lic interest. There is no such defence for<br />whis­tleblowers under <span class="caps">UK</span> law.<br />No harm test what­so­ever is applied in determ­in­ing whether that person’s actions are<br />deserving of crim­inal pun­ish­ment. The ban on dis­clos­ures cov­ers not only legit­im­ately<br />secret mater­ial, but also mater­ial that has entirely ceased to be con­fid­en­tial because it<br />has already been brought, by whatever means, into the pub­lic domain. It also cov­ers<br />mater­ial that causes no dam­age and that which is in the pub­lic interest.44<br />The same offence is com­mit­ted regard­less of the truth or fals­ity of the dis­clos­ure, as<br />the s. 1(1) offence does not dis­tin­guish between them.45 This is unique to secur­ity–<br />related inform­a­tion and does not, for example, apply in respect of defence-related<br />mater­ial. In the White Paper on the <span class="caps">OSA</span> of 1989,46 the Con­ser­vat­ive Gov­ern­ment<br />then in power stated that this “spe­cial treat­ment” – pro­scrib­ing dis­clos­ure by those in<br />42<br />S. 1(1) <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989<br />A point noted and deplored by the Labour Party when oppos­ing the intro­duc­tion of the <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989.<br />Roy Hat­ters­ley, as Shadow Home Sec­ret­ary, argued that “those who expose wrong­do­ing [should] be<br />given the right to argue the defence that they did what they did in the pub­lic interest.” Hansard, 21<br />Decem­ber 1988, 477<br />44<br />See the com­ments of Lord Nich­olls of Birken­head, Attorney-General v Blake and Another, 27 July<br />2000<br />45<br />S. 1(2) <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989<br />46<br />Reform of Sec­tion 2 of the Offi­cial Secrets Act 1911, Cm 408<br />43<br />Secur­ity and Intel­li­gence Ser­vices of all security-related inform­a­tion whether it is true<br />or false – was jus­ti­fied on the basis that:<br />(1) as a mat­ter of policy, gov­ern­ments do not com­ment on the vera­city of asser­tions<br />about secur­ity or intel­li­gence; and<br />(2) state­ments by cur­rent or former mem­bers of the secur­ity and intel­li­gence ser­vices<br />have a “par­tic­u­lar cred­ib­il­ity” that allows false dis­clos­ures to cause as much dam­age<br />as genu­ine revelations.47<br />These pro­vi­sions can also be applied to civil ser­vants in cer­tain pos­i­tions by<br />noti­fic­a­tion pro­ced­ure.<br />3.1.2 Dis­clos­ures by other civil ser­vants<br />It is also an offence under the <span class="caps">OSA</span> for civil servants48 other than those employed in<br />the Secur­ity and Intel­li­gence Ser­vices to dis­close inform­a­tion relat­ing to secur­ity or<br />intel­li­gence obtained as a res­ult of their employment.49 How­ever, such dis­clos­ure is<br />sub­ject to a harm test, so that a civil ser­vant will com­mit an offence only when<br />mak­ing a “dam­aging dis­clos­ure”. Con­sequently, dis­clos­ure of doc­u­ment X by a<br />former mem­ber of one of the Secur­ity Ser­vices might be an offence, whilst dis­clos­ure<br />of the same doc­u­ment by a former civil ser­vant in the Home Office might not.<br />Nev­er­the­less, the test of “dam­age” is not strict and a dis­clos­ure is con­sidered<br />dam­aging if it falls within a class or descrip­tion of inform­a­tion the dis­clos­ure of<br />which is likely to dam­age the work of <span class="caps">MI5</span> or <span class="caps">MI6</span>.50 Thus, it is not neces­sary that the<br />par­tic­u­lar inform­a­tion dis­closed is itself dam­aging.<br />It is also an offence to dis­close inform­a­tion which is likely to dam­age defence,51 but<br />in this instance the notion of dam­age is more clearly defined to include, inter alia,<br />mater­ial likely to dam­age the cap­ab­il­ity of the armed forces to carry out their tasks,<br />lead to loss of life or injury, or endanger the interests of the United King­dom<br />abroad.52 In this case, the actual inform­a­tion dis­closed must sat­isfy this test. There is<br />no repe­ti­tion of the “class or descrip­tion” pro­vi­sion that applies in rela­tion to secur­ity<br />and intel­li­gence inform­a­tion.<br />An equi­val­ent offence cov­ers unau­thor­ised dam­aging dis­clos­ures by civil ser­vants of<br />inform­a­tion relat­ing to inter­na­tional rela­tions. 53 This cat­egory is clearly defined, but<br />excess­ively broad: a “dam­aging” dis­clos­ure for these pur­poses is one that is likely to<br />endanger <span class="caps">UK</span> interests (or their pro­mo­tion) abroad.54 A dis­clos­ure will be deemed<br />dam­aging in this way if it con­sists of inform­a­tion received in con­fid­ence from a<br />for­eign power or inter­na­tional non-governmental organisation.55 It is also an offence<br />47<br />Ibid., para.43<br />Through­out this dis­cus­sion, “civil ser­vants” is used to refer to both Crown ser­vants and gov­ern­ment<br />con­tract­ors<br />49<br />S. 1(3) <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989<br />50<br />S. 1(4)(b) <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989<br />51<br />S. 2(1) <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989<br />52<br />S. 2(2)(a)-(b) <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989<br />53<br />S. 3(1) <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989<br />54<br />S. 3(2) <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989<br />55<br />S. 3(3) <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989<br />48<br />for a civil ser­vant to make dis­clos­ures that are likely56 to res­ult in the com­mis­sion of<br />an offence, facil­it­ate an escape from legal cus­tody or impede crim­inal<br />investigations.57 This offence also applies where the unau­thor­ised dis­clos­ure is of<br />inform­a­tion obtained by legal inter­cep­tions and actions per­formed by the Secur­ity<br />Ser­vice under warrant.58 There is no pub­lic interest defence or con­sid­er­a­tion for any<br />of these offences.<br />3.1.3 Com­ments and con­clu­sions<br />Cur­rent and ex-government employ­ees in the Secur­ity and Intel­li­gence Ser­vices are<br />pro­hib­ited from reveal­ing any security-related inform­a­tion, regard­less of whether it is<br />harm­ful and whether it serves the pub­lic interest. The only defence avail­able to<br />Secur­ity and Intel­li­gence per­son­nel is to prove that they did not know and had no<br />reason to believe that the inform­a­tion they dis­closed related to secur­ity and<br />intel­li­gence. It is dif­fi­cult to ima­gine a defend­ant suc­cess­fully invok­ing this defence.<br />For other pub­lic employ­ees, the <span class="caps">OSA</span> does incor­por­ate a harm test but this is often<br />weak and easy to sat­isfy, requir­ing simply that the dis­clos­ure be likely to fall within<br />cer­tain cir­cum­stances. As Roy Hat­ters­ley, speak­ing for the Labour Party when the<br />Offi­cial Secrets Bill was debated in 1989, noted, the “defin­i­tion of harm is so wide<br />and so weak that it is dif­fi­cult to ima­gine any rev­el­a­tion, which is fol­lowed by a<br />pro­sec­u­tion, not res­ult­ing in a conviction.“59<br />The lack of a harm test and the fail­ure to con­sider the pub­lic interest ele­ment in the<br />dis­clos­ure makes the <span class="caps">OSA</span> incom­pat­ible with inter­na­tional stand­ards of pro­tec­tion for<br />free­dom of expres­sion. Prin­ciple 15 of the Johan­nes­burg Prin­ciples states:<br />No per­son may be pun­ished on national secur­ity grounds for dis­clos­ure of inform­a­tion<br />if (1) the dis­clos­ure does not actu­ally harm and is not likely to harm a legit­im­ate<br />national secur­ity interest, or (2) the pub­lic interest in know­ing the inform­a­tion<br />out­weighs the harm from disclosure.60<br /><span class="caps">ARTICLE</span> 19 and Liberty recog­nise that gov­ern­ment employ­ees in a pos­i­tion to gain<br />access to sens­it­ive inform­a­tion can rightly be placed under a duty not to divulge<br />cer­tain types of inform­a­tion harm­ful to national secur­ity and it is pos­sible that even<br />false rev­el­a­tions may harm national secur­ity. How­ever, we believe those <span class="caps">OSA</span><br />pro­vi­sions which fail to incor­por­ate a harm test or pub­lic interest defence for any kind<br />of inform­a­tion, and regard­less of whether it is true or false, have dele­ter­i­ous<br />con­sequences for free­dom of expres­sion and the pub­lic interest. Moreover, the act­ive<br />crim­in­al­isa­tion of whis­tleblowers and the cur­tail­ment of expres­sion which has a claim<br />to some pro­tec­tion in its ser­vice to the pub­lic interest detracts from the cred­ib­il­ity of<br />the offi­cial bod­ies offered pro­tec­tion by such meas­ures.<br />When the Offi­cial Secrets Act was first pro­posed in 1988, Roy Hat­ters­ley, on behalf<br />of the Labour Party, then in oppos­i­tion, took the view that it was “a bad Bill. Its<br />applic­a­tion is likely to be worse because ? the Gov­ern­ment will man­age and<br />56<br />S. 4(2)(b) <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989<br />S. 4(2)(a) <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989<br />58<br />S. 4(3) <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989<br />59<br />Hansard, 21 Decem­ber 1988<br />60<br />See Appendix 1<br />57<br />manip­u­late it.“61 Frank Dob­son hoped that “[s]urely we as a Par­lia­ment have not sunk<br />so low that we want to intro­duce new laws to pro­tect offi­cial wrongdoing.“62 The<br />cur­rent Labour gov­ern­ment has appar­ently found the <span class="caps">OSA</span> rather more accept­able<br />than its pos­i­tion in 1988?89 would have suggested.63<br />3.2 Civil rem­ed­ies backed by crim­inal pen­al­ties<br />Pro­sec­u­tions under the <span class="caps">OSA</span> have been rel­at­ively rare, not least because they tend to<br />be embar­rass­ing and incon­veni­ent for the secur­ity and intel­li­gence ser­vices. A rather<br />more pop­u­lar means of pre­vent­ing both primary and sec­ond­ary dis­clos­ures is the use<br />of the civil rem­edy of an injunc­tion. Rather than call­ing in the police to invest­ig­ate<br />what they regard as a crim­inal offence, the gov­ern­ment depart­ment con­cerned lit­ig­ates<br />the mat­ter dir­ectly using civil law backed by the threat of crim­inal pen­al­ties.<br />Injunc­tions<br />The injunc­tion is one of the most power­ful means open to gov­ern­ment for con­trolling<br />the flow of inform­a­tion. A form of prior restraint, it is also one of the most intrus­ive<br />instru­ments avail­able to gov­ern­ment for deny­ing free­dom of expres­sion. For this<br />reason, Liberty and <span class="caps">ARTICLE</span> 19 believe there should be a pre­sump­tion against the<br />use of prior restraint. In their will­ing­ness to use injunc­tions, the <span class="caps">UK</span> author­it­ies are<br />unfettered by con­sti­tu­tional, stat­utory or judi­cial safe­guards gov­ern­ing the issu­ing of<br />prior restraint orders which exist in coun­tries such as Aus­tria, France, Sweden and the<br /><span class="caps">US</span>.64 For example, in the <span class="caps">US</span>, the courts have yet to uphold a single injunc­tion<br />against free speech on national secur­ity grounds, whereas injunc­tions have been<br />sought and obtained with alarm­ing ease and fre­quency in the <span class="caps">UK</span>. They may be<br />sought on the basis of breach of con­trac­tual duties, of duties of con­fid­ence, fidu­ciary<br />duties of con­fid­ence or copy­right, or the need to pre­vent the com­mis­sion of <span class="caps">OSA</span><br />offences.<br />Injunc­tions can be interim, per­man­ent or for a spe­cified period of time, and they can<br />be obtained at a hear­ing where the tar­get of the injunc­tion is rep­res­en­ted, or, through<br />an ex parte applic­a­tion, where the tar­get is absent.65 Applic­a­tions for injunc­tions to<br />pre­vent dis­clos­ures of security-related inform­a­tion have sev­eral clear advant­ages for<br />the Gov­ern­ment over crim­inal pro­sec­u­tion. These include:<br />Speed. An interim injunc­tion can be obtained via an ex parte applic­a­tion. The tar­get of<br />an injunc­tion need not be put on notice of the applic­a­tion, and may not even be aware<br />of the injunc­tion until it is gran­ted and served. Indeed, the gov­ern­ment need not even<br />61<br />Hansard, 21 Decem­ber 1988, 478<br />Hansard, 13 Feb­ru­ary 1989, 79<br />63<br />See §§5–6 below<br />64<br />Free­dom of Inform­a­tion: An Unre­cog­nised Right—The Right to know and the <span class="caps">EU</span>, An <span class="caps">EFJ</span> Brief­ing<br />Doc­u­ment &lt;www​.ifj​.org/​r​e​g​i​o​n​s​/​e​u​r​o​p​e​/​e​f​j​/​e​n​/​e​u​s​u​r​v​e​y​.​h​tml&gt;<br />65<br />An ex parte applic­a­tion is one that pro­ceeds in the absence of the respond­ent. The respond­ent, e.g., a<br />news­pa­per plan­ning to pub­lish a story about the Secur­ity Ser­vice, is given no notice of the applic­a­tion<br />for an injunc­tion and is not rep­res­en­ted at the hear­ing<br />62<br />attend a court to obtain the interim order, but can obtain “pyjama justice” at any time<br />of the day or night by ask­ing a judge to grant an injunc­tion over the telephone.66<br />Onus of proof. In order to obtain an interim injunc­tion, the gov­ern­ment needs to<br />estab­lish simply that it has an argu­able case in law; that dam­ages would be an<br />inad­equate rem­edy; and that the bal­ance of con­veni­ence tells in favour of grant­ing the<br />injunction.67 With the tra­di­tional judi­cial defer­ence to exec­ut­ive assess­ments of<br />national secur­ity, it is not as dif­fi­cult as it should be to per­suade a judge that the<br />bal­ance of con­veni­ence favours grant­ing the order.<br />Bur­den of proof. In mak­ing its applic­a­tion, the gov­ern­ment need simply estab­lish<br />those mat­ters referred to at (ii) to the civil stand­ard of proof; namely, on the bal­ance<br />of prob­ab­il­it­ies, rather than bey­ond all reas­on­able doubt.<br />Min­imal con­tro­versy. Invok­ing the Offi­cial Secrets Act against a per­son who has<br />caught the pub­lic ima­gin­a­tion with rev­el­a­tions of illeg­al­it­ies or incom­pet­ence in the<br />secur­ity and intel­li­gence com­munity will always gen­er­ate polit­ical con­tro­versy.<br />Injunc­tions will typ­ic­ally, although not always, be polit­ic­ally less sens­it­ive. Such<br />orders carry no imme­di­ate threat of impris­on­ment and are obtained via a tech­nical<br />pro­ced­ure with which few cit­izens are familiar.68 In addi­tion, since injunc­tions are<br />typ­ic­ally obtained prior to pub­lic­a­tion and, in the absence of full inform­a­tion, the<br />pub­lic would tend to assume that the injunc­tion serves a legit­im­ate need. Indeed, it is<br />pos­sible to obtain injunc­tions that pre­vent those to whom they apply from reveal­ing<br />even the fact that the injunc­tion exists, let alone the pre­cise terms of the order.69<br />Applic­a­tions for per­man­ent injunc­tions do not share all of these advant­ages. Indeed, it<br />is not uncom­mon for the gov­ern­ment to fail at the final applic­a­tion hav­ing suc­ceeded<br />at the interim stage. This was the res­ult in the Spycatcher saga.70 How­ever, the<br />interim injunc­tion is a crit­ical instru­ment. It can last for months or even years and is<br />suf­fi­cient to sup­press the inten­ded dis­clos­ure. Even­tual fail­ure at trial to trans­form<br />interim injunc­tions into per­man­ent injunc­tions need cause no great con­cern to the<br />gov­ern­ment if the dis­clos­ures in ques­tion are by that time old news, or if a suc­cess­ful<br />pro­sec­u­tion under the <span class="caps">OSA</span> has already occurred. Cur­rent pro­ced­ures for injunc­tion<br />applic­a­tions how­ever, will be tightened up con­sid­er­ably under the Human Rights Act<br />1989 (see Chapter 10).<br />66<br />Laurence Lust­garten, “Free­dom of Expres­sion, Dis­sent, and National Secur­ity in the United<br />King­dom,” in Sandra Coliver et al, Secrecy and Liberty: National Secur­ity, Free­dom of Expres­sion and<br />Access to Inform­a­tion, Kluwer Law, 1999, p.467<br />67<br />Amer­ican Cyan­amid Co. v Ethicon Ltd [1975] <span class="caps">AC</span> 396.

How­ever, they are backed up by the threat of crim­inal<br />pro­ceed­ings for con­tempt of court in the event that the terms of the injunc­tion are<br />breached. Pro­sec­u­tions under the <span class="caps">OSA</span> are also crim­inal, so the effect­ive out­come is<br />the same – to crim­in­al­ise the dis­sem­in­a­tion of inform­a­tion, regard­less of whether or<br />not this is in the over­all pub­lic interest. Indeed, it could be argued that injunc­tions<br />pose the greater threat to free­dom of expres­sion since tri­als for crim­inal con­tempt are<br />not con­duc­ted in the pres­ence of a jury. The fact that a judge alone presides at such<br />hear­ings is of par­tic­u­lar con­cern given the tend­ency of the judi­ciary to defer to the<br />exec­ut­ive in mat­ters of national secur­ity, as out­lined pre­vi­ously in this report.<br />The law of con­fid­ence<br />The usual grounds for injunc­tion applic­a­tions against cur­rent or ex-public employ­ees<br />is breach of laws, con­ven­tions and reg­u­la­tions regard­ing con­fid­ence. Mem­bers of the<br />secur­ity and intel­li­gence ser­vices are deemed to owe the state a lifelong duty of<br />con­fid­ence. 71 Former spies remain under an oblig­a­tion not to dis­close any secur­ity–<br />related inform­a­tion until the day they die. There are sev­eral sources of this oblig­a­tion<br />of con­fid­ence. In David Shayler?s case, the Attorney-General based his claim for an<br />injunc­tion on:<br />(i) an express con­trac­tual term requir­ing lifelong non-disclosure;<br />(ii) an implied con­trac­tual term of good faith which would be breached by any<br />    dis­clos­ure;<br />(iii) a fidu­ciary duty requir­ing lifelong non-disclosure;<br />(iv) a fidu­ciary duty of good faith which would be breached by any dis­clos­ure; and<br />(v) infringe­ment of Crown copy­right in doc­u­ments con­tain­ing con­fid­en­tial<br />   inform­a­tion.<br />These alleged terms and duties pur­port to cre­ate an endur­ing oblig­a­tion not to dis­close<br />any security-related mater­ial what­so­ever and are rein­forced by the blanket terms of s.<br />1(1) <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989, relat­ing to primary dis­clos­ure by present and former mem­bers of the<br />secur­ity and intel­li­gence ser­vices (see sec­tion 3.1).<br />The law of con­fid­ence does require that the gov­ern­ment, in seek­ing to impose an<br />injunc­tion, estab­lish inter alia that there is a legit­im­ate interest to be pro­tec­ted.<br />Moreover, where an injunc­tion is sought on these grounds, the pub­lic interest in<br />know­ing the inform­a­tion must be con­sidered. How­ever, plead­ing “national secur­ity”<br />as that legit­im­ate interest in this sphere attracts sim­ilar defer­ence by the courts to that<br />observed dur­ing judi­cial review pro­cesses. Once that legit­im­ate interest has been<br />iden­ti­fied, it is rel­at­ively easy to show that the bal­ance of con­veni­ence favours an<br />injunc­tion, since at present the law will find defend­ants in breach of their oblig­a­tions<br />of con­fid­ence unless those defend­ants can show that dis­clos­ure served a greater pub­lic<br />interest. Where the applic­a­tion is made ex parte, the defend­ant can have no<br />oppor­tun­ity even to attempt to make such an argu­ment before the rem­edy is gran­ted.<br />71<br />Attorney-General v Guard­ian News­pa­pers Ltd (No.2) [1988] 3 <span class="caps">WLR</span> 776. House of Lords<br />In addi­tion to injunc­tions, a num­ber of rem­ed­ies may be applied for breach of<br />con­fid­ence and other civil oblig­a­tions relat­ing to the dis­clos­ure of inform­a­tion. These<br />include:<br />• Delivery-up. An order may be sought for the delivery-up of doc­u­ments on the<br />   basis that the Crown holds copy­right in those doc­u­ments.<br />• Dam­ages. The gov­ern­ment can argue for an award of dam­ages to com­pensate<br />   it for loss incurred as a res­ult of breach of con­tract, infringe­ment of copy­right<br />  and/or breach of fidu­ciary duties of con­fid­ence.<br />• Account of profits. An order requir­ing the defend­ant to account to the Crown<br />   for all profits made as a res­ult of dis­clos­ures may be avail­able on the basis of<br />  breach of fidu­ciary duty and breach of copy­right. Moreover, the House of<br /> Lords has recently decided that account of profits may be avail­able for breach<br />of con­tract where that breach con­sists in a dis­clos­ure by a former mem­ber of<br />the secur­ity and intel­li­gence ser­vices that con­tra­venes s. 1(1) <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989.72<br />3.3 Recent pro­sec­u­tions of former Secur­ity and Intel­li­gence<br />officers<br />The <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989 has been deployed fre­quently in the last few years to coun­ter­act<br />dis­clos­ures of security-related material.73<br />David Shayler<br />Per­haps the most well-known recent case under the Offi­cial Secrets Act is that of<br />David Shayler. An ex-MI5 officer who left the Intel­li­gence Ser­vice in 1997, he is<br />cur­rently facing three charges of breach of the <span class="caps">OSA</span>. In August 1997, the Mail on<br />Sunday was sup­plied with security-related inform­a­tion, includ­ing the alleg­a­tion that<br />the gov­ern­ment kept secret files on cer­tain Labour politi­cians. In July 1998, after he<br />had left the <span class="caps">UK</span> for France, David Shayler allegedly accused <span class="caps">MI5</span> of fail­ing to react on<br />prior know­ledge of a ter­ror­ist attack on the Israeli Embassy, and alleged that <span class="caps">MI6</span><br />officers had plot­ted to assas­sin­ate the Libyan leader, Col­onel Gad­dafi. A month later<br />he was arres­ted in France and held without charge for four months while the <span class="caps">UK</span><br />Gov­ern­ment attemp­ted without suc­cess to extra­dite him. In July 2000, in an art­icle in<br />Punch magazine, he claimed that <span class="caps">MI5</span>, <span class="caps">GCHQ</span> and the Met­ro­pol­itan Police could have<br />pre­ven­ted <span class="caps">IRA</span>’s bomb­ing of Bish­opsgate, in Lon­don, but that they failed to do so. In<br />addi­tion to pla­cing an injunc­tion on Shayler in August 1997, which for­bade him from<br />reveal­ing any fur­ther inform­a­tion unless form­ally author­ised, the Gov­ern­ment issued<br />a state­ment of claim against him on 22 Decem­ber 1999 for breach­ing copy­right laws<br />on files held by <span class="caps">MI5</span> and <span class="caps">MI6</span>, and breaches of con­fid­ence and con­tract.<br />The per­cep­tion of the need for a com­pre­hens­ive gag on serving and former spies is<br />not uni­ver­sally shared among mem­bers of the judi­ciary. Judge <span class="caps">LJ</span> stated that David<br />Shayler’s alleg­a­tion of <span class="caps">MI6</span> par­ti­cip­a­tion in a plot to assas­sin­ate Col­onel Gad­dafi “is<br />either true or it is false, and unless there are com­pel­ling reas­ons of national secur­ity,<br />72<br />Attorney-General v Blake and Another, House of Lords 27 July 2000<br />The last <span class="caps">OSA</span> pro­sec­u­tion for a security-related dis­clos­ure occurred in Octo­ber 1998.

Given the extraordin­ary scope of the <span class="caps">OSA</span> offences – and the s. 1(1)<br />offence in par­tic­u­lar – it is per­haps unsur­pris­ing that the French courts refused the<br /><span class="caps">UK</span>’s request for extra­di­tion of Shayler in 1998 on the basis that the charges were<br />“polit­ical” in nature.75 David Shayler returned to the <span class="caps">UK</span> vol­un­tar­ily in August 2000<br />to face charges of breach of the <span class="caps">OSA</span>, and intends to invoke the Human Rights Act in<br />his defence.<br />Richard Tom­lin­son<br />Richard Tom­lin­son is an ex-MI6 employee. In 1995 he was denied an indus­trial<br />tribunal at which to con­test his dis­missal on grounds that it would require dis­clos­ure<br />of inform­a­tion harm­ful to national secur­ity. He was sen­tenced to one year’s<br />impris­on­ment in 1997 for offences under the <span class="caps">OSA</span> for hav­ing sent an Aus­tralian<br />pub­lisher a syn­op­sis of a planned memoir-cum-exposé of his work. Released on<br />parole in April 1998 after nine months in prison, he was barred from talk­ing to<br />journ­al­ists and his pass­port was con­fis­cated. How­ever, Tom­lin­son left Bri­tain and<br />went to France where he made pub­lic alleg­a­tions that <span class="caps">MI6</span> had been involved in<br />wrong­do­ing, one such claim being that there had been an <span class="caps">MI6</span> plot to assas­sin­ate<br />Slobodan Milo­sevic, then Pres­id­ent of Yugoslavia.76<br />Tom­lin­son was re-arrested under an inter­na­tional war­rant on 31 July 1998 in France,<br />by officers from Scot­land Yard and mem­bers of the Dir­ec­tion de la Sur­veil­lance du<br />Ter­ritoire (<span class="caps">DST</span>), the French equi­val­ent of <span class="caps">MI5</span>. The war­rant was issued on the basis<br />of sus­pi­cions that Tom­lin­son was intend­ing to make dam­aging dis­clos­ures regard­ing<br />the secur­ity and intel­li­gence ser­vices. How­ever, the <span class="caps">DST</span> per­son­nel quickly<br />determ­ined that there was insuf­fi­cient evid­ence to jus­tify an extra­di­tion and, as in the<br />case of David Shayler, the <span class="caps">UK</span> Government’s attempt to extra­dite him failed and<br />Tom­lin­son was released after some 30 hours’ questioning.77 He then trav­elled to New<br />Zea­l­and in August 1998, where he was greeted with an injunc­tion obtained by the <span class="caps">UK</span><br />Gov­ern­ment which pre­ven­ted him from mak­ing any security-related dis­clos­ures and<br />com­ple­men­ted the injunc­tion already in place in the <span class="caps">UK</span>.78 After the names of spies<br />were placed on the Inter­net on 12 May 1999 gov­ern­ment sus­pi­cion fell on Tom­lin­son<br />des­pite his denial, and he was expelled from Switzer­land where he was then liv­ing.<br />The Gov­ern­ment con­tin­ues to believe that he intends to pub­lish dam­aging rev­el­a­tions<br />and in May 2000, Italian police accom­pan­ied by Brit­ish Spe­cial Branch officers<br />raided his apart­ment in Italy and took away per­sonal papers and com­puter<br />equipment.79<br />74<br />R v Cent­ral Crim­inal Court, ex parte The Guard­ian, The Observer <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Mar­tin Bright, Divi­sional Court<br />of Queen’s Bench Divi­sion 21 July 2000, draft judg­ment, p.2<br />75<br />“Offi­cials study Shayler rul­ing,” <span class="caps">BBC</span> News, 19 Novem­ber 1998,<br />«news​.bbc​.co​.uk/​h​i​/​e​n​g​l​i​s​h​/​u​k​/​n​e​w​s​i​d​_​2​1​6​0​0​0​/​2​1​6​7​9​5​.​stm»<br />76<br />“The spy who was snubbed” <span class="caps">BBC</span> News 13 May 1999<br />«news6​.thdo​.bbc​.co​.uk/​h​i​/​e​n​g​l​i​s​h​/​u​k​/​n​e​w​s​i​d​_​3​4​2​0​0​0​/​3​4​2​8​5​3​.​stm»<br />77<br />David Lep­pard and Nich­olas Ruther­ford, “The spies dragged in from the cold,” The Sunday Times, 9<br />August 1998<br />78<br />Michael Evans, “Cook gags former <span class="caps">MI6</span> spy in New Zea­l­and,” The Times, 6 August 1998<br />79<br />Philip Wilan “Reneg­ade spy to give him­self up in return for tribunal hear­ing”, The Guard­ian, 3 June<br />2000<br />Nigel Wylde<br />Shayler and Tom­lin­son may be the most widely-known indi­vidu­als pur­sued via the<br /><span class="caps">OSA</span> in recent years, but they are not the only ones. Nigel Wylde, a former army<br />col­onel, has been arres­ted and charged with mak­ing dam­aging defence-related<br />dis­clos­ures under s. 2 of the <span class="caps">OSA</span>. This pro­sec­u­tion has been brought against Wylde<br />as the alleged source of inform­a­tion pub­lished in The Irish War by Tony Ger­aghty, a<br />book which includes details of the extent to which the pop­u­la­tion in North­ern Ire­land<br />is kept under com­pu­ter­ised sur­veil­lance by the state.80 Wylde was iden­ti­fied through<br />a search of Geraghty’s house under the <span class="caps">OSA</span>. No attempt was made to pre­vent<br />pub­lic­a­tion of Geraghty’s book. Indeed, the Min­istry of Defence has con­ceded that<br />the book was “embar­rass­ing rather than damaging.“81 In Octo­ber 2000, how­ever, the<br />MoD law­yers were repor­ted to be seek­ing to try Wylde in secret, since the MoD is<br />now claim­ing that the inform­a­tion in the book was dam­aging. 82 One obvi­ous reason<br />for these charges is the hope of exer­cising a deterrent effect on any fur­ther dis­clos­ures<br />of this kind.<br />“Mar­tin Ingrams”<br />Also facing pro­sec­u­tion under s.1 of the <span class="caps">OSA</span> is the pseud­onym­ous “Mar­tin Ingrams”,<br />former mem­ber of the Force Research Unit (<span class="caps">FRU</span>), a now dis­ban­ded “clandes­tine<br />cell” within army intel­li­gence which handled inform­ants within the <span class="caps">IRA</span> and loy­al­ist<br />para­mil­it­ary groups.83 “Ingrams” has made vari­ous dis­clos­ures to Liam Clarke of The<br />Sunday Times regard­ing the activ­it­ies of the <span class="caps">FRU</span> and other secur­ity forces oper­at­ing<br />in North­ern Ire­land. He has alleged that the secur­ity forces elec­ted not to con­fis­cate or<br />dis­able ter­ror­ist weapons which were sub­sequently used in sec­tarian killings in the<br />interests of pro­tect­ing their inform­ers within the para­mil­it­ary groups.84 Addi­tion­ally,<br />“Ingrams” has claimed that listen­ing devices used by the secur­ity forces to gather<br />inform­a­tion facil­it­ated two <span class="caps">SAS</span> ambushes that res­ul­ted in the deaths of eleven <span class="caps">IRA</span><br />members.85<br />The most notori­ous of “Ingrams’s” dis­clos­ures con­cerns attempts by the <span class="caps">FRU</span> to<br />dis­rupt an inquiry con­duc­ted by John Stevens (now Com­mis­sioner of the<br />Met­ro­pol­itan Police) into alleged links between the police and secur­ity forces and<br />loy­al­ist murders. Accord­ing to “Ingrams”, these efforts reached their peak with an<br />“illegal burgle-and-burn assault“86 on the offices used by the Stevens Inquiry team.<br />The fire was inten­ded to sab­ot­age the inquiry in order to pre­vent or at least delay the<br />arrest for murder of a <span class="caps">FRU</span> informer named Brian Nel­son. The attempt failed because<br />Stevens had for­tu­it­ously kept back-up cop­ies of all files else­where.

Provided that no cur­rent genu­ine<br />national secur­ity interests are threatened and no lives put at risk, it is import­ant that<br />such mat­ters be brought into the pub­lic domain.<br />The <span class="caps">OSA</span> does not allow “Ingrams” to argue that the pub­lic interest jus­ti­fied his<br />dis­clos­ures. The offi­cial response to those dis­clos­ures has not been to invest­ig­ate his<br />alleg­a­tions of illegal and dan­ger­ous acts by the <span class="caps">FRU</span>, but rather to make efforts to<br />identify and pro­sec­ute him for breach of the <span class="caps">OSA</span>. The hunt for him led to at least one<br />other arrest under the <span class="caps">OSA</span>, that of a former sol­dier accused of being “Ingrams”. On 1<br />Feb­ru­ary 2000, prior to his arrest, the individual’s house was burgled. Amongst the<br />items stolen was the draft of a memoir.89 Extraordin­ar­ily, this manu­script “turned up<br />a few days later in the hands of the pro­sec­u­tion at a court hear­ing” for an injunc­tion<br />pre­vent­ing pub­lic­a­tion of the work90 and was used to con­front the alleged “Ingrams”<br />in questioning.91 The <span class="caps">MOD</span> claimed that these papers had been received in a<br />mys­ter­i­ous let­ter drop. If one has doubts about the jus­ti­fi­ab­il­ity of the <span class="caps">OSA</span> offences<br />them­selves, this series of events gives inde­pend­ent cause for con­cern regard­ing how<br />alleged breaches of the <span class="caps">OSA</span> are invest­ig­ated.<br />3.4 Con­clud­ing obser­va­tions<br />The Government’s pur­suit of the above cases high­lights three tend­en­cies, act­ive<br />crim­in­al­isa­tion of whis­tleblowers; the use of far-reaching injunc­tions; and increas­ing<br />invent­ive­ness in the grounds on which injunc­tions are sought.<br />There can be no doubt that there is a power­ful pub­lic interest in at least some of the<br />dis­clos­ures made by Shayler, Tom­lin­son, Wylde and “Ingrams”. Yet the <span class="caps">OSA</span> makes<br />crim­in­als of those “insiders?” who would expose illegal and/or dan­ger­ous beha­viour<br />by the Secur­ity and Intel­li­gence Ser­vices. There are at present few, if any, means by<br />which wrong­do­ing within these ser­vices can be exposed, and the over­all pub­lic<br />interest prop­erly assessed. In par­tic­u­lar, there is no inde­pend­ent means for bal­an­cing<br />the pub­lic interest in dis­clos­ure against any genu­ine national secur­ity con­sid­er­a­tions.<br />The exper­i­ences of Shayler, Tom­lin­son, Wylde and “Ingrams” high­light the extens­ive<br />use of the gen­er­ally pre­ferred means of gag­ging state ser­vants, namely the civil<br />injunc­tion. Exper­i­ence sug­gests that when the Gov­ern­ment claims “national secur­ity”<br />as the legit­im­ate interest to be pro­tec­ted in applic­a­tions for far-reaching injunc­tions,<br />the desired interim order will be obtained from the courts without great dif­fi­culty. The<br />Gov­ern­ment has no hes­it­a­tion in try­ing to extend the scope of injunc­tions as far as<br />pos­sible. For example, in respect of “Mar­tin Ingrams” and The Sunday Times, the<br />gov­ern­ment reques­ted and ini­tially received an order that pre­ven­ted repe­ti­tion of<br />87<br />Henry McDon­ald, “Police in hunt for Brit­ish agent,” The Observer (Irish edi­tion), 21 May 2000<br />Liam Clarke, “Met chief blames arson on army,” The Sunday Times, 19 March 2000<br />89<br />Liam Clarke, “Agents ‘stole papers’ to nail whis­tleblower,” The Sunday Times, 2 April 2000<br />90<br />Richard Norton-Taylor, “Secrets and Spies,” The Guard­ian, 18 May 2000<br />91<br />Liam Clarke, “Agents ‘stole papers’ to nail whis­tleblower,” The Sunday Times, 2 April 2000<br />88<br />pre­vi­ously pub­lished alleg­a­tions and even men­tion of the fact that the injunc­tion<br />existed.92 These con­di­tions were removed on appeal.<br />In an appar­ent attempt to counter adverse pub­li­city, the <span class="caps">UK</span> Gov­ern­ment has denied<br />that a wide interim injunc­tion relat­ing to David Shayler, in place since Septem­ber<br />1997, is a “blanket” injunc­tion, since it allows for the repe­ti­tion of inform­a­tion<br />already in the pub­lic domain and for new dis­clos­ures “if formal author­ity is obtained<br />beforehand.“93 In seek­ing this injunc­tion, the gov­ern­ment relied upon a wide range of<br />claims, includ­ing the tri­um­vir­ate of claims described above, as well as a claim for<br />breach of Crown copyright.94<br />92<br />Richard Norton-Taylor, “Softly, softly,” The Guard­ian, 10 April 2000<br />Lord Wil­li­ams of Mostyn, let­ter to The Guard­ian, 6 August 1998<br />94<br />This can also con­sti­tute a crim­inal offence. See s. 107 Copy­right Designs and Pat­ents Act 1988<br />93<br />4 Restrict­ing Sec­ond­ary Dis­clos­ure — Gag­ging the<br />Media and oth­ers<br />Demo­cracy requires cit­izens to be informed so that they can mean­ing­fully exer­cise<br />their right to par­ti­cip­ate in the demo­cratic pro­cess. The media play an essen­tial role in<br />facil­it­at­ing the pro­cess of provid­ing inform­a­tion to cit­izens. This is par­tic­u­larly<br />import­ant in regard to inform­a­tion about offi­cial wrong­do­ing. Exper­i­ence shows that<br />when wrong­do­ing does take place, invest­ig­at­ive journ­al­ists are among those best<br />placed to expose it. Indeed, because of the great pub­lic interest in the con­duct of<br />gov­ern­ment, includ­ing cor­rup­tion and other kinds of mis­use of pub­lic office, the<br />European Court of Human Rights has fre­quently noted the import­ant ‘watch­dog’ role<br />of the media.<br />How­ever, as Chapters 4 and 5 show, for­mid­able bar­ri­ers are placed in the way of<br />invest­ig­at­ive journ­al­ists in the form of laws pre­vent­ing sec­ond­ary dis­clos­ure of<br />inform­a­tion relat­ing to national secur­ity, and the rel­at­ive ease with which the<br />Gov­ern­ment is able to pry con­fid­en­tial sources and inform­a­tion from journ­al­ists. With<br />regard to secur­ity inform­a­tion, the law in rela­tion to the media, allows the gov­ern­ment<br />to employ a wide range of crim­inal and civil law to pre­vent dis­clos­ures. In so far as<br />pub­lic­a­tion is fre­quently the primary means by which the pub­lic are aler­ted to such<br />dis­clos­ures, mech­an­isms invoked against the press are the most effect­ive way for the<br />gov­ern­ment to pre­vent inform­a­tion from reach­ing the pub­lic.<br />4.1 Sec­ond­ary dis­clos­ure under s. 5 <span class="caps">OSA</span><br />The main legal mech­an­ism for pre­vent­ing sec­ond­ary dis­clos­ure is con­tained in s. 5 of<br />the <span class="caps">OSA</span>, which makes it a crim­inal offence for any­one to dis­sem­in­ate inform­a­tion<br />deemed to be dam­aging to national secur­ity. The prin­cipal tar­get of this pro­vi­sion has<br />always been the media. Although there is a harm test, there is no pub­lic interest<br />defence.<br />Under s. 5, any­one will com­mit an offence if:<br />(i) they receive inform­a­tion from an “insider” by way of a primary disclosure;95<br />(ii) they make a sec­ond­ary dis­clos­ure without obtain­ing law­ful author­ity know­ing<br />    (or hav­ing reason to believe) that the primary dis­clos­ure was unlaw­ful under<br />   the <span class="caps">OSA</span>;96<br />(iii) they know or have reason to believe that their sec­ond­ary dis­clos­ure would be<br />     damaging;97 and<br />(iv) their sec­ond­ary dis­clos­ure is damaging.98<br />It does not mat­ter whether the tar­get of this pro­vi­sion – nor­mally a journ­al­ist or media<br />out­let – received the inform­a­tion dir­ectly or indir­ectly from the ori­ginal (insider)<br />95<br />S. 5(1)(a)(i) <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989<br />S. 5(2) <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989<br />97<br />S. 5(3)(b) <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989<br />98<br />S. 5(3)(a) <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989<br />96<br />source. On the other hand, the journ­al­ist must have at least reas­on­able cause to believe<br />both that the dis­clos­ure was unlaw­ful and that it would be dam­aging to national<br />secur­ity. This may be harder for the pro­sec­u­tion to estab­lish in the case of “out­siders”<br />than for civil ser­vants and spies, since the lat­ter may be gen­er­ally assumed to be more<br />famil­iar with these mat­ters. Moreover, in respect of this offence, it is for the<br />pro­sec­u­tion to prove bey­ond reas­on­able doubt the pres­ence of all ele­ments of the<br />offence. Indeed, hav­ing the requis­ite know­ledge is a key ele­ment of the s. 5 offence.<br />While it is more dif­fi­cult to pro­sec­ute a journ­al­ist under the <span class="caps">OSA</span> than a civil ser­vant<br />or mem­ber of the secur­ity and intel­li­gence ser­vices, the lack of any pub­lic interest<br />defence remains a not­able and dis­turb­ing fea­ture of the legis­la­tion.<br />4.2 The Defence Advis­ory notice sys­tem (DA-Notice sys­tem)<br />In addi­tion to the media’s import­ant role as a watch­dog of gov­ern­ment on behalf of<br />soci­ety, they also have a respons­ib­il­ity, as do gov­ern­ment employ­ees and the gen­eral<br />pub­lic, to exer­cise their right to free­dom of expres­sion so that genu­ine national<br />secur­ity interests are pro­tec­ted. The DA-Notice sys­tem, formerly the D-Notice<br />sys­tem, was set up to pre­vent dis­clos­ures by journ­al­ists unsure or unaware of whether<br />a par­tic­u­lar dis­clos­ure would be regarded as dam­aging to national secur­ity. How­ever,<br />Liberty and <span class="caps">ARTICLE</span> 19 are of the view that this sys­tem rep­res­ents a ser­i­ously<br />flawed attempt to nego­ti­ate the bound­ar­ies between press pub­lic­a­tion of secur­ity<br />inform­a­tion and free­dom of expres­sion through an “informal?” sys­tem.<br />The Defence, Press and Broad­cast­ing Advis­ory Com­mit­tee was con­ceived as a<br />vol­un­tary arrange­ment between gov­ern­ment and the press with the aim of pre­vent­ing<br />inad­vert­ent breaches of s. 5 <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989.99 Chaired by the Per­man­ent Under-Secretary<br />of State for Defence, it has sev­en­teen mem­bers, thir­teen of which are nom­in­ated by<br />media organ­isa­tions. The Com­mit­tee, estab­lished in 1912, issues gen­eral guid­ance<br />notices and spe­cific “Private and Con­fid­en­tial” notices, on cat­egor­ies of inform­a­tion<br />where secrecy id deemed to be essen­tial to pro­tect national secur­ity. Edit­ors or<br />journ­al­ists can, if they wish, con­sult the Sec­ret­ary of the Com­mit­tee, cur­rently Rear–<br />Admiral Nick Wilkin­son, to find out in advance whether any details con­tained in a<br />planned story fall within the scope of the five stand­ing DA-Notices which cover<br />dif­fer­ent areas of pos­sible threat to national secur­ity. The Secretary’s role is offi­cially<br />described as that of a con­fid­en­tial medi­ator between the journ­al­ist wish­ing to pub­lish<br />and the gov­ern­ment depart­ment or secur­ity ser­vice con­cerned to pro­tect national<br />security.100 Under the Committee’s rules, any offi­cials whom the Sec­ret­ary con­sults<br />about a par­tic­u­lar story must be able to con­vince the Sec­ret­ary of the need for secrecy<br />and can­not ini­ti­ate police action or legal pro­ceed­ings unless they have the requis­ite<br />inform­a­tion from another source.101<br />The DA-Notice sys­tem is unique – no other coun­try in the world main­tains such an<br />arrangement.102 Some edit­ors are con­vinced that the sys­tem is out­dated, a relic of the<br />Cold War,103 although oth­ers con­cede the value of an “advis­ory pipeline” of this<br />99<br />See §4.2 and §6 below<br />«www​.dnotice​.org​.uk/​f​a​q​s​.​htm»<br />101<br />Ibid<br />102<br />Ibid<br />103<br />“What is remark­able about [DA-Notices] is that edit­ors still obey them.” Roy Greenslade, quoted in<br />The Inde­pend­ent, 18 May 1999<br />100<br />nature.104 Regard­less of ones’ pos­i­tion on the value of the Committee’s advice, the<br />DA-Notice sys­tem suf­fers from at least two key flaws. First, exist­ing as it does under<br />the shadow of the dra­conian pro­vi­sions of s. 5 of the <span class="caps">OSA</span>, it is hardly vol­un­tary in<br />any true sense of that word. Absent the threat of <span class="caps">OSA</span> pro­sec­u­tions and other forms of<br />legal har­ass­ment, it may be assumed that few journ­al­ists would bother with the <span class="caps">DA</span>–<br />Notice sys­tem.<br />Second, “com­pli­ance [with the DA-Notice sys­tem] does not relieve the editor of<br />respons­ib­il­it­ies under the Offi­cial Secrets Act.“105 Thus, the fact that the Sec­ret­ary<br />has raised no objec­tion to a planned story does not neces­sar­ily mean that the applic­ant<br />editor or journ­al­ist is immune from pro­sec­u­tion in respect of any dis­clos­ures they then<br />go on to pub­lish. Given this, the claim by the Sec­ret­ary that the DA-Notice sys­tem<br />oper­ates on a more strin­gent and nar­rower under­stand­ing of “national secur­ity” than<br />the <span class="caps">OSA</span> and other statutes106 is of scant com­fort. The cur­rent Sec­ret­ary main­tains that<br />“nego­ti­ation by me between the media and the offi­cials must be prefer­able to<br />lit­ig­a­tion, espe­cially as lit­ig­a­tion tends to be slow and expens­ive and to end in blanket<br />sup­pres­sion of a story or source, rather than removal of just a few details.“107 Many<br />in the media world, on the other hand, feel that one does not neces­sar­ily pre­clude the<br />other.<br />Of at least equal con­cern is the grow­ing per­cep­tion amongst journ­al­ists that the <span class="caps">DA</span>–<br />Notice sys­tem is in fact being used to facil­it­ate cen­sor­ship of the press by the<br />gov­ern­ment, des­pite the Secretary’s insist­ence that it is “inde­pend­ent and media–<br />dominated.“108 Journ­al­ists have expressed the fear that seek­ing “con­fid­en­tial”<br />medi­ation will merely invite early receipt of an injunc­tion and/or invest­ig­a­tion for<br />breach of s. 5 <span class="caps">OSA</span>, and this is not helped by the tra­di­tion of appoint­ing an ex-Armed<br />Ser­vices per­son to the post of Sec­ret­ary. The Sec­ret­ary offers guid­ance in con­sulta­tion<br />with mem­bers of the affected ser­vices, and this neces­sar­ily gives them advance<br />warn­ing that a story is about to emerge. Even if the Sec­ret­ary does not dis­close the<br />iden­tity of the party, it is not dif­fi­cult for pro­fes­sional intel­li­gence officers to dis­cover<br />the rel­ev­ant inform­a­tion in short order. The exper­i­ence of Tony Ger­aghty has greatly<br />rein­forced this sus­pi­cion (see box below) although the Sec­ret­ary of the DA-Notice<br />Com­mit­tee “denied any col­lu­sion between him­self and the MoD police”.109<br />Tony Ger­aghty<br />Tony Ger­aghty was accused of dis­clos­ing inform­a­tion regard­ing the extens­ive use of<br />com­pu­ter­ised sur­veil­lance by intel­li­gence agen­cies in North­ern Ire­land in his book,<br />The Irish War. Prior to pub­lic­a­tion of his book, Rear Admiral David Pul­ver­taft<br />con­tac­ted Geraghty’s pub­lish­ers, invit­ing the author to sub­mit the manu­script for<br />eval­u­ation. Ger­aghty declined, believ­ing that the only reason for the request was to<br />facil­it­ate the iden­ti­fic­a­tion of his sources within the <span class="caps">SAS</span>.110 Ger­aghty has repor­ted<br />that the Sec­ret­ary respon­ded to his refusal by express­ing his hope that Ger­aghty<br />104<br />Cal McCrys­tal, “Secret stor­ies,” The Guard­ian, 5 July 1999<br />“Gen­eral Intro­duc­tion to DA-Notices”, «www​.dnotice​.org​.uk/​n​o​t​i​c​e​s​.​htm».<br />106<br />This claim was made by Rear Admiral Nick Wilkin­son in the course of a speech to the Soci­ety of<br />Edit­ors on 3 May 2000, See “Media Art­icles and Speeches,” «www​.dnotice​.org​.uk/​a​r​t​i​c​l​e​s​.​htm»<br />107<br />“Media Art­icles and Speeches,” «www​.dnotice​.org​.uk/​a​r​t​i​c​l​e​s​.​htm»<br />108<br />Rear Admiral Nick Wilkin­son, “Open Secrets,” let­ter to The Observer, 30 July 2000<br />109<br />John Dav­ison, The Inde­pend­ent, 18 May 1999<br />110<br />Stephen Glover, “Where’s free­dom of inform­a­tion if this journ­al­ist is charged next Thursday?” The<br />Spec­tator, 6 March 1999<br />105<br />“would not come to regret” his non-co-operation.111 No attempt was made to pre­vent<br />pub­lic­a­tion of the book; but Geraghty’s house was raided by Min­istry of Defence<br />police on 3 Decem­ber 1998 and the author was sub­sequently charged with the<br />sec­ond­ary dis­clos­ure offence under s. 5 <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989.112<br />4.3 Recent pro­sec­u­tions brought under s. 5 <span class="caps">OSA</span><br />Tony Ger­aghty<br />As out­lined above, former Sunday Times defence cor­res­pond­ent Tony Ger­aghty was<br />arres­ted some three months after pub­lic­a­tion of his book, The Irish War. No<br />injunc­tion was sought at the time of pub­lic­a­tion, per­haps because, as the Min­istry of<br />Defence has sub­sequently con­ceded, its rev­el­a­tions regard­ing the extens­ive<br />sur­veil­lance con­duc­ted on the pop­u­la­tion of North­ern Ire­land were “embar­rass­ing<br />rather than damaging.“113 Nev­er­the­less, the pub­lish­ers came under pres­sure from<br />Min­istry of Defence police to refrain from issu­ing a paper­back ver­sion of the work.114<br />Ger­aghty was arres­ted after a dawn raid of his home on 3 Decem­ber 1998 for breach<br />of s. 5 <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989.115 The charge was dropped in Decem­ber 1999 on the advice of the<br />Attor­ney Gen­eral. Sig­ni­fic­antly, this change of heart occurred shortly before the case<br />would have reached com­mit­tal pro­ceed­ings, that is, the first point at which the<br />pro­sec­u­tion case would have been sub­jec­ted to judi­cial exam­in­a­tion. Ger­aghty is not<br />alone in being “sur­prised that they [the mil­it­ary police] believe that they have law­ful<br />jur­is­dic­tion over a civil­ian author owing no legal duty to the MoD.“116 The charges<br />against Nigel Wylde, Geraghty’s alleged source, are still being pur­sued.<br />Liam Clarke<br />In 1999, the North­ern Ire­land Editor of The Sunday Times was threatened with<br />pro­sec­u­tion for breach of s. 5 of the <span class="caps">OSA</span>.117 Clarke pub­lished a series of art­icles<br />detail­ing dis­clos­ures made by agents, includ­ing “Mar­tin Ingrams” (see 3.3), of the<br />activ­it­ies of the under­cover Force Research Unit (<span class="caps">FRU</span>) in North­ern Ire­land. The<br />art­icles con­tained ser­i­ous alleg­a­tions of wrong­do­ing by the <span class="caps">FRU</span>, includ­ing claims<br />that they com­mit­ted arson to des­troy evid­ence in an offi­cial invest­ig­a­tion and spied on<br />and tapped the phones of oppos­i­tion Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment. Fol­low­ing a com­plaint<br />by the <span class="caps">UK</span> Min­istry of Defence, Clarke was detained by the Met­ro­pol­itan Police for<br />ques­tion­ing regard­ing breach of s 5 of the <span class="caps">OSA</span>. It remains unclear whether he will be<br />charged.<br />111<br />Cal Mac­Crys­tal, “Spy­ing secrets spark ‘abuse’ of the D-notice”, Even­ing Stand­ard, 12 March 1999<br />Stephen Glover, “Where’s free­dom of inform­a­tion if this journ­al­ist is charged next Thursday?” The<br />Spec­tator, 6 March 1999<br />113<br />Richard Norton-Taylor, “Secrets charges against Ulster spy author dropped,” The Guard­ian, 23<br />Decem­ber 1999<br />114<br />Richard Palmer, “Anger at book ban on Ulster spy secrets,” The Express, 26 July 1999<br />115<br />Richard Norton-Taylor, “Secrets charges against Ulster spy author dropped,” The Guard­ian, 23<br />Decem­ber 1999<br />116<br />Tony Ger­aghty, “I am cen­sored too,” let­ter to The Sunday Tele­graph, 7 March 1999<br />117<br />Let­ter from Detect­ive Inspector Alan Learner to Liam Clarke, 5 May 2000<br />112<br />Julie-Ann Dav­ies<br />Per­haps the most aston­ish­ing case of the use of s. 5 <span class="caps">OSA</span> is that of Julie-Ann Dav­ies,<br />a mature stu­dent and volun­teer researcher for the satir­ical pro­gramme, the Mark<br />Thomas Com­edy Product. She was arres­ted and ques­tioned for pos­sible breach of s. 5<br /><span class="caps">OSA</span> on the basis that she had been in com­mu­nic­a­tion with David Shayler. Yet the<br /><span class="caps">OSA</span> only pro­hib­its dis­clos­ures and it is unclear which dis­clos­ures she her­self was<br />alleged to have made. Her uni­ver­sity – “an insti­tu­tion com­mit­ted to free­dom of<br />expres­sion” – was equally per­turbed by the devel­op­ment. The Vice Chan­cel­lor stated<br />that King­ston Uni­ver­sity “would be par­tic­u­larly con­cerned if it turned out that a<br />dis­cred­ited piece of legis­la­tion … was being used to sup­press journ­al­istic<br />invest­ig­a­tion and the public’s right to know about alleged abuse by the secur­ity<br />services.“118 Although it has since been decided that Julie-Ann Dav­ies should not be<br />pro­sec­uted, her arrest gives cause for con­cern, since it shows a determ­in­a­tion to<br />extend the impact of chilling effects bey­ond pro­spect­ive whis­tleblowers and the<br />media, to encom­pass any­one inclined to assist – or even to cor­res­pond with – a<br />whis­tleblower.<br />4.4 Use of injunc­tions to pre­vent pub­lic­a­tion<br />As well as being used to gag whis­tleblowers, injunc­tions are also brought heav­ily to<br />bear on press attempts to pub­lish “dam­aging inform­a­tion.” Indeed, the government’s<br />pre­ferred means of gag­ging the press still seems to be prior restraint via an injunc­tion,<br />not­with­stand­ing the recent increase in crim­inal pro­ceed­ings under s. 5 <span class="caps">OSA</span>. Once an<br />injunc­tion is gran­ted, it can be served not only on the defend­ant, but also on any<br />media out­let likely to dis­close the inform­a­tion in ques­tion. Injunc­tions can also be<br />served dir­ectly on journ­al­ists and their employ­ers.<br />Sig­ni­fic­antly for the media, injunc­tions may be imposed for breach of con­fid­ence<br />even in the absence of any con­trac­tual rela­tion­ship. A news­pa­per or journ­al­ist that<br />receives security-related inform­a­tion as the res­ult of a primary dis­clos­ure may be held<br />to owe a duty of con­fid­ence to the state in equity where they know that the primary<br />dis­clos­ure by the whis­tleblower occurred in breach of confidence.119 As such, the<br />gov­ern­ment can seek an injunc­tion against the media dir­ectly, even if not (yet) able to<br />identify the primary source of the inform­a­tion con­cerned and inde­pend­ently of any<br />legal action against the source.<br />Injunc­tions abound at present in rela­tion to the pub­lic­a­tion of security-related<br />inform­a­tion by “Mar­tin Ingrams”, Shayler and Tom­lin­son.<br />The Sunday Times received an injunc­tion in respect of rev­el­a­tions by “Mar­tin<br />Ingrams” relat­ing to the Force Research Unit. News­pa­pers have also been banned<br />from pub­lish­ing any dis­clos­ure he makes about the 1973 “Bloody Sunday” killings of<br />civil­ians by <span class="caps">UK</span> secur­ity forces in North­ern Ire­land. Ini­tially, the injunc­tion on<br />inform­a­tion about the <span class="caps">FRU</span> not only covered facts already pub­lished, but also<br />pre­ven­ted any dis­clos­ure of the exist­ence of the injunc­tion. These con­di­tions were<br />118<br />Vice Chan­cel­lor Peter Scott, quoted in “Stu­dent arres­ted over Shayler link,” The Guard­ian, 7 March<br />2000<br />119<br />Attorney-General v Guard­ian News­pa­pers Ltd (No.2) [1988] 3 <span class="caps">WLR</span> 776, House of Lords<br />relaxed on appeal, but the pre­cise terms of the injunc­tion still may not be disclosed.120<br />The press has thus been pre­ven­ted from dis­clos­ing any fur­ther inform­a­tion relat­ing to<br />alleg­a­tions of illegal and dan­ger­ous activ­it­ies, includ­ing inter­fer­ence with an<br />inde­pend­ent police inquiry. 121 It appears that the interests of national secur­ity demand<br />that a will­ing­ness to endanger life and impede the course of justice by those in the<br />employ of the army’s intel­li­gence units be kept secret. The Min­istry of Defence<br />appar­ently “can­not identify any ‘pub­lic interest which demands pub­lic­a­tion of such<br />material’”.122<br />Injunc­tions also exist to pre­vent any pub­lic­a­tion of fur­ther alleg­a­tions from Shayler.<br />On 6 Octo­ber 2000 James Steen, editor of Punch magazine, was found guilty of<br />con­tempt of court in rela­tion to pub­lic­a­tion of an art­icle writ­ten by David Shayler,<br />even though the judge found no evid­ence to believe that it had harmed national<br />security.123 The art­icle was found to be in breach of the 1997 injunc­tion “which bans<br />pub­lic­a­tion of any inform­a­tion David Shayler acquired by vir­tue of employ­ment for<br />the secur­ity service”,124 although gov­ern­ment law­yers admit­ted that it had been<br />broken many times before. In accord­ance with the magazine’s prac­tice, Punch<br />sub­mit­ted Shayler’s art­icle to the Gov­ern­ment Law Officers before pub­lic­a­tion for<br />con­firm­a­tion that it would not infringe the injunc­tion. When the Treas­ury Soli­citor<br />was unable to deliver a final ver­dict on the art­icle in good time, Steen decided to<br />pub­lish an abridged ver­sion of the ori­ginal. He is cur­rently appeal­ing the guilty<br />ver­dict.<br />4.5 Con­clu­sion<br />Des­pite the unac­cept­ab­il­ity of attempt­ing to chill free expres­sion by crim­in­al­ising<br />journ­al­ists car­ry­ing out their job of invest­ig­at­ing alleged gov­ern­ment wrong­do­ings,<br />the Labour Gov­ern­ment cur­rently in power has dis­played an increased will­ing­ness to<br />deploy s. 5 <span class="caps">OSA</span>, and has sought to exploit addi­tional rem­ed­ies against those who<br />have made sec­ond­ary dis­clos­ures in mat­ters touch­ing on national secur­ity. <span class="caps">ARTICLE</span><br />19 and Liberty believe that the <span class="caps">UK</span> Gov­ern­ment makes excess­ive use of both civil and<br />crim­inal pro­ced­ures to pre­vent embar­rass­ing inform­a­tion from reach­ing the pub­lic at<br />large and that the pen­al­ties it seeks to impose have gen­er­ally been dis­pro­por­tion­ate to<br />actual dam­age caused when bal­anced against the pub­lic interest in know­ing the<br />inform­a­tion.<br />120<br />Liam Clarke, “Gag­ging order pro­tects army’s dirty tricks unit,” The Sunday Times, 28 Novem­ber<br />1999<br />121<br />See 4.4 below for fur­ther detail on “Ingrams’s” dis­clos­ures<br />122<br />Liam Clarke, “Under­cover arson­ists pro­moted by army,” The Sunday Times, 16 April 2000<br />123<br />Richard Norton Tayler, “Punch ruled guilty of con­tempt of court” The Guard­ian, 7 Octo­ber 2000<br />124<br />Spokes­man for the Attorney-General’s office, quoted in Paul Lash­mar, “Editor of Punch to face<br />court for Shayler con­tempt,” The Inde­pend­ent, 28 July 2000<br />5 Pro­tec­tion of sources<br />Journ­al­ists’ abil­ity to expose wrong­do­ing, and hence to exer­cise their proper func­tion<br />in a demo­cracy, is often heav­ily depend­ent on their abil­ity to receive and hold<br />inform­a­tion in con­fid­ence, and their capa­city to make cred­ible prom­ises of con­fid­ence<br />to their sources of inform­a­tion. Fur­ther, in many cases, pro­tec­tion of con­fid­en­tial<br />sources is essen­tial not only to main­tain the free flow of inform­a­tion to journ­al­ists,<br />and from them to the pub­lic, but also for the per­sonal secur­ity of journ­al­ists.<br />Under the cur­rent legal régime in the <span class="caps">UK</span>, a pub­lic interest defence holds no weight<br />and insiders risk crim­inal pro­sec­u­tion if they decide to blow the whistle on illeg­al­ity<br />and incom­pet­ence in mat­ters touch­ing on national secur­ity, regard­less of how<br />peri­pheral or import­ant they may be. Their will­ing­ness to do so thus often depends<br />dir­ectly on assur­ances that their iden­tit­ies will be con­cealed. If journ­al­ists can be<br />com­pelled to divulge their sources – or to grant access to doc­u­ments that could enable<br />the source to be traced and iden­ti­fied – their prom­ises of con­fid­ence will ring hol­low.<br />Across the world, journ­al­ists have too fre­quently and too read­ily been required to<br />divulge their sources, and there is a widely felt con­sensus that the <span class="caps">UK</span> courts have<br />sys­tem­at­ic­ally failed to accord due weight to the import­ance of per­mit­ting journ­al­ists<br />to keep their sources con­fid­en­tial. It may be true that “[a]ny rule of pro­fes­sional<br />con­duct enjoin­ing a journ­al­ist to pro­tect his con­fid­en­tial sources is sub­ject to whatever<br />excep­tion is neces­sary to enable the journ­al­ist to obey the orders of a court of<br />com­pet­ent jurisdiction.“125 How­ever, this can be regarded as an accept­able state­ment<br />of prin­ciple only if the court of com­pet­ent jur­is­dic­tion is required to recog­nise and<br />give spe­cial weight to the pub­lic interest in journ­al­ists’ abil­ity and interest in keep­ing<br />their sources con­fid­en­tial.<br />5.1 Inter­na­tional stand­ards on pro­tec­tion of journ­al­ists’<br />sources<br />The <span class="caps">UN</span>, <span class="caps">OSCE</span> and <span class="caps">OAS</span> rap­por­teurs on free­dom of expres­sion asser­ted in Feb­ru­ary<br />2000 that: “Journ­al­ists should never be required to reveal their sources unless this is<br />neces­sary for a crim­inal invest­ig­a­tion or the defence of a per­son accused of a crim­inal<br />offence and they are ordered to do so by a court, after a full oppor­tun­ity to present<br />their case.“126<br />The European Court of Human Rights has emphas­ised the fact that orders for source<br />dis­clos­ure have the poten­tial to pro­duce a sub­stan­tial chilling effect, sig­ni­fic­antly<br />impair­ing the capa­city of the press to act as pub­lic watch­dog. One import­ant rul­ing in<br />the land­mark judg­ment of Good­win v <span class="caps">UK</span>,127 was that, “[l]imitations on the<br />con­fid­en­ti­al­ity of journ­al­istic sources called for the most care­ful scru­tiny by the<br />125<br />X Ltd v Mor­gan Grampian (Pub­lish­ers) Ltd and oth­ers [1991] 1 <span class="caps">AC</span> 1, House of Lords per Lord<br />Bridge<br />126<br />State­ment regard­ing key issues and chal­lenges to free­dom of expres­sion, agreed by: San­ti­ago<br />Can­ton, <span class="caps">OAS</span> Spe­cial Rap­por­teur on Free­dom of Expres­sion.

As the<br />European Court put it:<br />“Pro­tec­tion of journ­al­istic sources is one of the basic con­di­tions for press free­dom …<br />Without such pro­tec­tion, sources may be deterred from assist­ing the press in<br />inform­ing the pub­lic on mat­ters of pub­lic interest. As a res­ult, the vital pub­lic<br />watch­dog role of the press may be under­mined and the abil­ity of the press to provide<br />accur­ate and reli­able inform­a­tion may be adversely affected. Hav­ing regard to the<br />import­ance of the pro­tec­tion of journ­al­istic sources for press free­dom in a demo­cratic<br />soci­ety and the poten­tially chilling effect an order of source dis­clos­ure has on the<br />exer­cise of that free­dom, such a meas­ure can­not be com­pat­ible with Art­icle 10 of the<br />Con­ven­tion unless it is jus­ti­fied by an over­rid­ing require­ment in the pub­lic<br />interest.”129<br />Most estab­lished demo­cra­cies – includ­ing, for example, Aus­tria, Den­mark, Fin­land,<br />France, Ger­many, Italy and Sweden – provide expli­cit pro­tec­tion for journ­al­ists’<br />con­fid­en­ti­al­ity of sources. It is the view of Liberty and <span class="caps">ARTICLE</span> 19 that journ­al­ists<br />should not be com­pelled to dis­close their sources, except under “excep­tional<br />cir­cum­stances”, where “vital interests” are at stake.130<br />5.2 Legal mech­an­isms for com­pel­ling source dis­clos­ure in<br />the <span class="caps">UK</span><br />There are both crim­inal and civil mech­an­isms avail­able to the gov­ern­ment to use in<br />pur­suit of journ­al­ists either for dir­ect dis­clos­ure of their sources, or else for access to<br />notes and papers which may enable the inform­ant to be iden­ti­fied and traced.<br />It has been argued that s.10 Con­tempt of Court Act 1981 provides some degree of<br />pro­tec­tion to journ­al­ists by hold­ing that:<br />No court may require a per­son to dis­close … the source of inform­a­tion con­tained in a<br />pub­lic­a­tion for which he is respons­ible, unless it be estab­lished to the sat­is­fac­tion of<br />the court that dis­clos­ure is neces­sary in the interests of justice or national secur­ity or<br />for the pre­ven­tion of dis­order or crime<br />This sec­tion has been described as requir­ing the judge to engage in a bal­an­cing<br />exer­cise, weigh­ing the import­ance of non-disclosure and the need for dis­clos­ure in the<br />interests of, for example, national security.131 How­ever it fails to give due weight to<br />the pre­sump­tion in favour of non-disclosure. S. 10 states that the court must be<br />per­suaded that an order for source dis­clos­ure is neces­sary in the interests of, for<br />example, national secur­ity.<br />It would appear that the applic­a­tion of s. 10 by judi­cial author­it­ies within the <span class="caps">UK</span> falls<br />short of the stand­ard set out in Art­icle 10 of the European Con­ven­tion.

The orders are designed to allow the police to pierce the<br />veil of journ­al­ists’ pro­fes­sional con­fid­ence in the event that this will assist with a<br />crim­inal invest­ig­a­tion.

The sur­veil­lance can be car­ried out cov­ertly on the orders of<br />the exec­ut­ive without prior judi­cial author­isa­tion.<br />Civil orders<br />Where no crim­inal offence is being invest­ig­ated, the gov­ern­ment can still rely on<br />courts to order journ­al­ists (and oth­ers) to dis­close their sources – or grant access to<br />their papers – in order to identify “wrongdoers”.137 Civil orders can com­pel<br />dis­clos­ure of the iden­tit­ies of those who have acted in breach of con­fid­ence, and who<br />thus con­sti­tute “wrong­do­ers”. As such, where the Gov­ern­ment is able, as it fre­quently<br />is, to argue that a dis­clos­ure has occurred in breach of con­fid­ence, it has grounds upon<br />which to apply for an order requir­ing journ­al­ists to dis­close their sources. These<br />mech­an­isms allow the Gov­ern­ment to com­pel journ­al­ists to dis­close their sources<br />irre­spect­ive of whether the primary and sec­ond­ary dis­clos­ures them­selves are being<br />pur­sued via the crim­inal or civil law.<br />5.3 Recent his­tory of pro­duc­tion orders<br />The recent his­tory of pro­duc­tion orders in cases of whis­tleblowers sug­gests that the<br />police find it rel­at­ively easy to con­vince the judge at first instance to make the order,<br />but that applic­a­tions for judi­cial review of that decision are often suc­cess­ful,<br />fre­quently on the basis that pro­ced­ural errors have been com­mit­ted.

In<br />par­tic­u­lar Spe­cial Branch sought the ori­ginal of a let­ter Mr Shayler wrote to The<br />Guard­ian con­tain­ing his email address. They also wanted the notes of Mar­tin Bright, a<br />journ­al­ist on The Observer who repor­ted that Mr Shayler had named two <span class="caps">MI6</span> officers<br />involved in the alleged plot to kill Gad­dafi.<br />137<br />Nor­wich Phar­macal v Cus­toms <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Excise Com­mis­sion­ers [1974] <span class="caps">AC</span> 133, House of Lords<br />R v Cent­ral Crim­inal Court, ex parte The Guard­ian, The Observer <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Mar­tin Bright, 21 July 2000<br />139<br />R v Bel­fast County Court, ex parte Molo­ney, 27 Octo­ber 1999<br />138<br />The orders were sought on the basis that they would advance police invest­ig­a­tions<br />into alleged breaches of the Offi­cial Secrets Act.140 An appeal for judi­cial review of<br />the decision against the Observer, ex parte Bright, was decided in July 2000. By a<br />major­ity of two to one, the court quashed all the orders bar one. In each case, the basis<br />for the decision was that the grounds for grant­ing a pro­duc­tion order (or access<br />con­di­tions) had not been met. Judge <span class="caps">LJ</span> emphas­ised the need for the presid­ing judge to<br />be per­son­ally per­suaded that each ele­ment of those con­di­tions had been prop­erly<br />made out by the applic­ant police force.<br />In par­tic­u­lar, the Court held that the evid­ence did not dis­close a “ser­i­ous arrestable<br />offence” under the <span class="caps">OSA</span>. While s. 1(1) and s. 1(2) offences are always “arrestable”,<br />they become “ser­i­ous arrestable” offences only if the dis­clos­ure in ques­tion has<br />caused, was inten­ded to cause, or was likely to cause ser­i­ous harm to state secur­ity, or<br />death or ser­i­ous injury to any person.141 In respect of the order sought against The<br />Guard­ian, there was no cred­ible claim that “ser­i­ous” harm had been done (or was<br />threatened) to national secur­ity. A more cogent case argu­ment was presen­ted in<br />rela­tion to The Observer, but again the access con­di­tions were found not to have been<br />prop­erly made out.<br />Pro­ced­ural errors in ex parte Bright<br />The appeal court found that the ori­ginal grant of pro­duc­tion orders against The<br />Guard­ian and The Observer,142 was marred by ser­i­ous pro­ced­ural errors. Amongst the<br />most sig­ni­fic­ant flaws were the fol­low­ing:<br />(i) All parties to the pro­ceed­ings, includ­ing the judge, had assumed that any<br />   breach of the <span class="caps">OSA</span> amoun­ted to a “ser­i­ous arrestable” offence as defined by<br />      the Police and Crim­inal Evid­ence Act. In fact, <span class="caps">OSA</span> offences, whilst<br />     “arrestable”, are not “ser­i­ous arrestable” offences unless the dis­clos­ures have<br />            cer­tain con­sequences (see above). The police were not put to proof on this<br />           cru­cial ele­ment of the applic­a­tion.<br />(ii) The task of giv­ing evid­ence in sup­port of the applic­a­tion was assigned to <span class="caps">DS</span><br />    Flynn, a “qual­i­fied fin­an­cial invest­ig­ator”, as required by police policy.<br />       How­ever, <span class="caps">DS</span> Flynn had not been involved in the rel­ev­ant invest­ig­a­tion prior<br />      to this point. “In real­ity he knew noth­ing, or vir­tu­ally noth­ing, about the<br />     case“143 and was in no pos­i­tion to give an informed assess­ment of the value to<br />    the invest­ig­a­tion of the mater­i­als in respect of which the orders were sought.<br />(iii) As a res­ult of <span class="caps">DS</span> Flynn’s lack of involve­ment with the invest­ig­a­tion, all the<br />       evid­ence he pro­duced for the court was hearsay. As such, it should have been<br />140<br />Whether the Attorney-General would have con­sen­ted to such a pro­sec­u­tion may never be known.<br />Judge <span class="caps">LJ</span> expressed “con­sid­er­able reser­va­tions whether there is any evid­ence at all that Mr. Bright can<br />be said to have “dis­closed” any­thing to any­one for the pur­poses of s. 5.

Coun­sel stated that he would, given the oppor­tun­ity, wish to ques­tion<br />Inspector Lerner. As the appeal court noted, “It is unfor­tu­nate that these<br />obser­va­tions did not lead to the obvi­ous response that Mr. Lerner was indeed<br />present and avail­able at court.“144<br />Com­ments on ex parte Bright<br />The judg­ment on appeal in the case was wel­comed as “a ringing defence of press<br />free­dom and the news­pa­pers’ right to pub­lish alleg­a­tions by whistleblowers.“145<br />Closer exam­in­a­tion of the judg­ment sug­gests that such enthu­si­asm is not war­ran­ted.<br />In fact, the basis of the decision was primar­ily pro­ced­ural errors, not the bal­an­cing of<br />free­dom of expres­sion in the con­text of a national secur­ity interest. Indeed, “the police<br />did not claim that either news­pa­per had in any way threatened national security.“146<br />How­ever, the judg­ment is prom­ising in that it con­tains a recog­ni­tion that gov­ern­ment<br />claims of national secur­ity need to be open to scru­tiny. Judge <span class="caps">LJ</span> stated that judges<br />“gen­er­ally … can­not pro­ceed on the basis of bare asser­tion by a police officer.“147<br />How­ever, he also sug­ges­ted that a “care­ful sum­mary of the rel­ev­ant factors” delivered<br />in open court would suf­fice, unless even this level of dis­clos­ure would itself threaten<br />national secur­ity, in which case “a pro­ced­ure sim­ilar to that used in [Pub­lic Interest<br />Immunity] applic­a­tions” would be more appropriate.148 It is argu­able whether either<br />of these two approaches can guar­an­tee that the judge will be able to make a truly<br />inde­pend­ent assess­ment of the claim that national secur­ity was under threat. How­ever,<br />Judge <span class="caps">LJ</span> emphas­ised that the presid­ing judge must be per­son­ally con­vinced that the<br />rel­ev­ant sch.1 factors are all sat­is­fied and that he/she found uncon­vin­cing the Crown’s<br />asser­tion that it was “abso­lutely vital” for the police to get their hands on the mater­ial<br />to facil­it­ate pro­sec­u­tion of the case against David Shayler.<br />5.3.2 Ex parte Molo­ney — use of the <span class="caps">PTA</span><br />In Octo­ber 1999, a pro­duc­tion order against Ed Molo­ney, a North­ern Ire­land<br />journ­al­ist was quashed by the High Court in Bel­fast. A County Court order had been<br />served on him dir­ect­ing him to sur­render notes of inter­views he car­ried out nearly ten<br />years pre­vi­ously with Wil­liam Sto­bie. The lat­ter was a self-confessed police informer<br />and alleged quarter­mas­ter of the Ulster Defence Asso­ci­ation, a para­mil­it­ary<br />organ­isa­tion, who was being invest­ig­ated for the 1989 murder of Pat Finu­cane, a<br />Cath­olic soli­citor. As in ex parte Bright, the judge found the access orders, in this case<br />based on sch.7, para. 3(5) of the Pre­ven­tion of Ter­ror­ism (Tem­por­ary Pro­vi­sions) Act<br />144<br />Ibid., p.13<br />Richard Norton-Taylor, “Papers win Shayler <span class="caps">MI5</span> case,” The Guard­ian, 22 July 2000<br />146<br />“A court comes to the res­cue of free speech,” The Guard­ian, 22 July 2000<br />147<br />Draft judg­ment, p.13<br />148<br />Ibid<br />145<br />1989 (which sur­vive in sch. 5, para. 5 of the Ter­ror­ism Act 2000) were not made out,<br />in par­tic­u­lar as the police had not proved that there was a pos­sib­il­ity that the notes<br />would be of help in the investigation.149<br />Com­ment on ex parte Molo­ney<br />Des­pite this judg­ment, there is little reason to think that the agenda pro­tect­ing<br />free­dom of expres­sion has been sig­ni­fic­antly furthered as regards use of the <span class="caps">PTA</span>. As<br />with s. 9 and sch. 1 <span class="caps">PACE</span>, there is no stat­utory require­ment to weigh press free­dom<br />against the interests of facil­it­at­ing a ter­ror­ist invest­ig­a­tion, although the judge at first<br />instance stated that he took the import­ance of a free press into account in mak­ing the<br />order and this was accep­ted in judi­cial review by the High Court. Carswell <span class="caps">LCJ</span> took<br />the view that – des­pite not being included as a stat­utory cri­terion – press free­dom was<br />a mater­ial factor to be con­sidered, but the weight to be accor­ded to that factor was for<br />the indi­vidual judge to determine.150<br />5.4 Con­clu­sion<br />Even if the <span class="caps">UK</span> courts do con­sider there to be a pre­sump­tion against mak­ing an order<br />for dis­clos­ure, their his­tor­ical reluct­ance to sub­ject claims of national secur­ity to<br />sub­stant­ive scru­tiny weak­ens its strength. Indeed, it con­tin­ues to be dis­pro­por­tion­ately<br />easy for an applic­ant able to plead national secur­ity to obtain an order for dis­clos­ure<br />of sources. This con­cern is enhanced by recent legis­lat­ive devel­op­ments which fur­ther<br />under­mine pro­tec­tion for con­fid­en­tial sources. For example, the Ter­ror­ism Act 2000 ?<br />which pre­serves the pro­duc­tion order pro­vi­sions from the Pre­ven­tion of Ter­ror­ism<br />(Tem­por­ary Pro­vi­sions) Act 1989 – greatly extends the defin­i­tions of “ter­ror­ist” and<br />“terrorism”151 and the Reg­u­la­tion of Invest­ig­at­ory Powers Act 2000 provides a basis<br />for email inter­cep­tion, a grow­ing form of com­mu­nic­a­tion between journ­al­ists and<br />their sources. In Liberty and <span class="caps">ARTICLE</span> 19’s view, there is a clear need for stronger<br />judi­cial scru­tiny in the <span class="caps">UK</span>.<br />The tra­di­tional reluct­ance of the judi­ciary to pierce the veil of national secur­ity is<br />unlikely to evap­or­ate overnight, but these judg­ments may sig­nal a change in atti­tude<br />as the courts alloc­ate more import­ance to pro­tect­ing press free­dom. It is not­able for its<br />insist­ence that even once access con­di­tions have been made out, the decision to grant<br />a pro­duc­tion order is within the judge’s dis­cre­tion. In ex parte Bright, the Court held<br />149<br />For detail on the back­ground to this judg­ment, see Justice Delayed … Alleged State Col­lu­sion in the<br />Murder of Patrick Finu­cane and Oth­ers, §6, Brit­ish Irish Rights Watch, Feb­ru­ary 2000.<br />«http://​www​.fhit​.org/​b​i​r​w​/​j​u​s​t​i​c​e​.​h​tml»<br />150<br />ex parte Molo­ney, draft judg­ment, p.15. The pro­duc­tion order against Molo­ney was again quashed<br />on the nar­row ground that the stat­utory access con­di­tions had not been prop­erly sat­is­fied by the<br />applic­ant police force.<br />151<br />S. 1 of the new Act defines ter­ror­ism in such a broad man­ner that it might encom­pass cam­paign­ing<br />bod­ies, pro­test­ers and even work­ers involved in indus­trial dis­putes. The Act cov­ers those who use or<br />threaten action involving ser­i­ous viol­ence, ser­i­ous prop­erty dam­age, endan­ger­ment of life, ser­i­ous risks<br />to pub­lic health and safety or ser­i­ous inter­fer­ence with an elec­tronic sys­tem. (s. 1(2) Ter­ror­ism Act<br />2000) The use or threat of such action becomes “ter­ror­ism” if designed to influ­ence the gov­ern­ment or<br />intim­id­ate (a sec­tion of) the pub­lic in the interests of a polit­ical, reli­gious or ideo­lo­gical cause. (s. 1(1)<br />Ter­ror­ism Act 2000) The Act also imposes a duty of dis­clos­ure on those – includ­ing journ­al­ists – who,<br />in the course of their pro­fes­sion, obtain inform­a­tion relat­ing to ter­ror­ist offences. (s. 19 Ter­ror­ism Act<br />2000) Those who, without reas­on­able excuse, fail to pass on such inform­a­tion to the police com­mit an<br />offence<br />that in decid­ing how to exer­cise this dis­cre­tion, the presid­ing judge should bear in<br />mind that:<br />“[i]nconvenient or embar­rass­ing rev­el­a­tions, whether for the Secur­ity Ser­vices or for<br />pub­lic author­it­ies, should not be sup­pressed. Legal pro­ceed­ings [for pro­duc­tion<br />orders], or the threat of such pro­ceed­ings, tends to inhibit dis­cus­sion. … [C]ompelling<br />evid­ence would nor­mally be needed to demon­strate that the pub­lic interest would be<br />served by such proceedings.”152<br />In addi­tion, the incor­por­a­tion of the <span class="caps">ECHR</span> under the Human Rights Act 1998 will<br />mean that courts are com­pelled to expli­citly bal­ance free­dom of expres­sion as a<br />human right against claims in favour of dis­clos­ure. A pre­sump­tion in favour of<br />free­dom of expres­sion should mean that even where a source falls at the least<br />pro­tec­ted end of the spec­trum, the applic­ant seek­ing dis­clos­ure should be required to<br />make a com­pel­ling case on the facts, to rebut a pre­sump­tion that his applic­a­tion ought<br />to fail.<br />Given that in the <span class="caps">UK</span> both crim­inal and civil forms of orders com­pel­ling source<br />dis­clos­ure are dis­cre­tion­ary, in all cases, the pub­lic interest in press free­dom should be<br />given con­sid­er­able weight and a pre­sump­tion against mak­ing the order should be<br />observed. Judges should exer­cise their dis­cre­tion to refuse such orders, save in<br />excep­tional cases, and only when they can be per­suaded that the prin­ciple of<br />journ­al­istic con­fid­ence has genu­inely to be aban­doned in the pub­lic interest.<br />Applic­ants claim­ing national secur­ity to be at stake should be put to proof on that<br />mat­ter. It is incum­bent upon judges to ques­tion invoc­a­tions of national secur­ity in<br />sup­port of those applic­a­tions; to ensure that the applic­a­tions are dealt with in a<br />pro­ced­ur­ally proper man­ner; to insist upon being fur­nished with care­fully pre­pared<br />and adequate evid­ence; and, ulti­mately, to accord free expres­sion and the prin­ciple of<br />journ­al­istic con­fid­ence the weight they deserve.<br />152<br />Draft judg­ment, p.27<br />6 Chilling the watch­dogs and silen­cing the<br />whis­tleblowers<br />The laws pre­vent­ing primary and sec­ond­ary dis­clos­ures of security-related<br />inform­a­tion – whether through pro­sec­u­tion under the Offi­cial Secrets Act or through<br />ex parte applic­a­tions for interim injunc­tions – clearly affect those against whom they<br />are deployed. They may ulti­mately lose their liberty and/or face sub­stan­tial fin­an­cial<br />pen­al­ties. Sim­ilar con­sequences may be vis­ited upon those who refuse to com­ply with<br />stat­utory pro­duc­tion orders or equit­able dis­clos­ure orders under con­tempt of court<br />pro­vi­sions.<br />How­ever, in addi­tion to such “local” effects on those who dis­close inform­a­tion and<br />those who pub­lish it, these mech­an­isms also pro­duce wider or global chilling effects.<br />Given the flawed DA-Notice sys­tem, the lack of adequate pro­tec­tion of sources, lack<br />of clar­ity as to what national secur­ity cov­ers and the lack of effect­ive judi­cial<br />over­sight, the cur­rent régime is well poised to pro­duce chilling effects on free<br />expres­sion.<br />There are two ways in which chilling effects dampen the free flow of inform­a­tion:<br />(i) con­fid­en­tial sources cease to make that inform­a­tion avail­able for fear of the<br />   per­sonal con­sequences of doing so; and<br />(ii) journ­al­ists and news­pa­pers are reluct­ant to make sec­ond­ary dis­clos­ures for<br />    fear of the per­sonal and/or cor­por­ate con­sequences that may fol­low<br />   pub­lic­a­tion.<br />The greater the chilling effects at either level, the less the media are able to per­form<br />their vital role as watch­dog of the demo­cratic pro­cess, and the less informed the<br />pub­lic are about mat­ters they have an interest in know­ing, and about which they have<br />a right to know.<br />The European Court has stated that such chilling effects must be taken into account in<br />determ­in­ing whether a pro­duc­tion order is com­pat­ible with Art­icle 10 of the European<br />Con­ven­tion on Human Rights.153 Indi­vidual cases can have indir­ect and wider<br />con­sequences; and these should impact upon whether grant­ing a given order can be<br />regarded as “pro­por­tion­ate” in the sense deman­ded by the Art­icle 10(2) require­ment<br />that any restric­tion on free expres­sion be neces­sary in a demo­cratic soci­ety. Given that<br />demo­cracy needs its watch­dogs to be effect­ive, the danger of pro­du­cing such chilling<br />effects must be given due weight in determ­in­ing what the out­come of a given<br />applic­a­tion ought to be.<br />6.1 Whis­tleblowers deterred<br />There can be little doubt that <span class="caps">UK</span> Gov­ern­ments have pur­sued a delib­er­ate policy of<br />seek­ing to chill at the first level, to make whis­tleblowers reluct­ant to come for­ward.<br />This is sup­por­ted by the judiciary’s will­ing­ness to impose sen­tences under the <span class="caps">OSA</span><br />which sig­nal a clear inten­tion to exert a deterrent effect.154 Given the extens­ive scope<br />153<br />154<br />Good­win v United King­dom, 27 March 1996, 22 <span class="caps">EHRR</span> 123<br />R v Tis­dall (Sarah) (1984) 6 Cr.App.R.(S.) 155, Court of Appeal, Crim­inal Divi­sion<br />of the <span class="caps">OSA</span> offences and the lack of any pub­lic interest defence thereto, such deterrent<br />effects must work to dis­cour­age the major­ity of dis­clos­ures which would oth­er­wise be<br />made in the pub­lic interest, as much as those who might seek to reveal inform­a­tion<br />with mali­cious intent. For example, Jestyn Thirkell-White, a former col­league of<br />David Shayler’s who has recently come for­ward to endorse some of the latter’s<br />dis­clos­ures, “had always agreed with Shayler’s ana­lysis of <span class="caps">MI5</span>’s fail­ings … but was<br />ori­gin­ally deterred, as well as appalled, by the har­ass­ment and the impris­on­ment of<br />his former colleague.“155<br />In the civil arena, the courts have recently expressed a will­ing­ness to treat breaches of<br />con­trac­tual oblig­a­tions of con­fid­ence by former mem­bers of the secur­ity and<br />intel­li­gence ser­vices as deserving of spe­cial treat­ment, in the form of par­tic­u­larly<br />harsh and dis­pro­por­tion­ate pen­al­ties. In such cases, the courts have, for example,<br />aban­doned the gen­eral rule that the proper rem­edy for breach of con­tract is<br />com­pens­at­ory dam­ages. Instead, they will at least con­sider award­ing an account of<br />profits, even where the dis­clos­ures in ques­tion can­not be regarded as hav­ing<br />con­tra­vened any fidu­ciary duty of confidence.156 At least part of the jus­ti­fic­a­tion for<br />this move is that the breach of con­tract in ques­tion in such cases will neces­sar­ily also<br />con­sti­tute an offence under s. 1 <span class="caps">OSA</span>.157 As such, this may be read as a fur­ther means<br />of deter­ring acts in con­tra­ven­tion of the <span class="caps">OSA</span>.<br />6.2 Media self-censorship<br />The recent trend of threat­en­ing journ­al­ists with pro­sec­u­tion under s. 5 <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989 is<br />being sup­ple­men­ted by a grow­ing will­ing­ness to put fin­an­cial pres­sure on news­pa­pers<br />via civil claims for damages.158 If indi­vidual journ­al­ists can­not be made to fear for<br />their liberty, then per­haps their employ­ers can be made to fear for their wal­lets. Civil<br />actions such as applic­a­tions for interim injunc­tions and pro­duc­tion orders often have<br />indir­ect chilling effects as con­test­ing such orders can be extremely expens­ive and<br />time-consuming. In addi­tion, fail­ure to com­ply with their terms can res­ult in fines<br />and/or impris­on­ment. The author­it­ies have some incent­ive in ini­ti­at­ing pro­ceed­ings –<br />whether in the crim­inal or civil courts – because even a pro­sec­u­tion or suit that<br />even­tu­ally fails can help rein­force the chill.<br />6.2.1 Slate — a case of Inter­net self-censorship<br />When David Shayler’s alleg­a­tions regard­ing <span class="caps">MI6</span> involve­ment in a plot to assas­sin­ate<br />Col­onel Gad­dafi were first cir­cu­lated in 1998, the Brit­ish news­pa­pers hes­it­ated in<br />pub­lish­ing the story for fear of being in breach of the stand­ing injunc­tion against<br />dis­clos­ing any security-related inform­a­tion obtained from Shayler.159<br />Given the ini­tial reluct­ance of Brit­ish news­pa­pers to pub­lish Shayler’s alleg­a­tions<br />about <span class="caps">MI6</span> involve­ment in the Gad­dafi plot, one UK-based journ­al­ist e-mailed an<br />art­icle about the alleg­a­tion to Slate, an Inter­net news site. His sug­ges­tion was that<br />Slate – being an Amer­ican site – could pub­lish the story which, given the global<br />155<br />Mark Hollings­worth, “Open­ing the floodgates,” The Guard­ian, 25 July 2000<br />Attorney-General v Blake and Another, House of Lords, 27 July 2000<br />157<br />Ibid., per Lord Nich­olls of Birken­head<br />158<br />See §§4§6 for details regard­ing the range of claims brought against David Shayler and Asso­ci­ated<br />News­pa­pers<br />159<br />This was issued on 4 Septem­ber 1997<br />156<br />nature of the Inter­net, would then be avail­able in the <span class="caps">UK</span>.160 Legal advice con­vinced<br />Slate and its par­ent com­pany, Microsoft, that the site would not neces­sar­ily escape<br />sanc­tion under the <span class="caps">OSA</span> and Slate there­fore declined the invit­a­tion to pub­lish. Shortly<br />there­after, The Sunday Times took the risk of men­tion­ing Shayler’s alleg­a­tions and<br />then other news­pa­pers took up the story, report­ing the fact that the alleg­a­tions had<br />been reported.161 Had The Sunday Times not taken this step, the ini­tial chill might<br />have per­sisted. This illus­trates how the threat of pro­sec­u­tion under the <span class="caps">OSA</span> can cre­ate<br />chilling effects that reach bey­ond the bor­ders of the <span class="caps">UK</span>.<br />On the other hand, if Slate had not been a sub­si­di­ary of a global cor­por­a­tion with a<br /><span class="caps">UK</span> pres­ence, it is unlikely that its editor would have felt the inten­ded chill. “Our<br />Brit­ish friend instantly and effort­lessly e-mailed us the rogue spy’s art­icle, and if we<br />hadn’t been wor­ried about Brit­ish law we would have made it as instantly and<br />effort­lessly avail­able in Bri­tain as if he’d pub­lished it himself.“162 This per­haps<br />under­lines the view expressed by Rear Admiral David Pul­ver­taft, former DA-Notice<br />Sec­ret­ary, that the Inter­net is “unpre­dict­able and uncontrollable.“163 The gov­ern­ment<br />has sought to limit the impact of Inter­net pub­lic­a­tion by refus­ing to recog­nise<br />dis­sem­in­a­tion over the Inter­net as put­ting the mater­ial in the pub­lic domain. 164 This<br />view would mean that it was still pro­hib­ited to pub­lish mater­ial from the Inter­net in<br />news­pa­pers, con­trary to the gen­eral rule that once mater­ial is in the pub­lic domain,<br />fur­ther pub­lic­a­tion does not threaten national secur­ity.<br />In the end it was the New York Times, which was not covered by the injunc­tion,<br />which pub­lished the details of the alleg­a­tions in August 1998. The Guard­ian and then<br />other Brit­ish papers fol­lowed suit. The alleg­a­tions were also the sub­ject of an epis­ode<br />of the cur­rent affairs pro­gramme Pan­or­ama.<br />6.3 Con­clu­sion<br />The chilling effect of <span class="caps">UK</span> legis­la­tion and prac­tice extends far bey­ond those dir­ectly<br />affected. Whether chilling effects are delib­er­ately sought or whether instead they are<br />the unin­ten­ded by-products of actions taken for other reas­ons is to some extent<br />irrel­ev­ant. As long as genu­ine whis­tleblowers are pro­sec­uted along­side those who<br />make genu­inely dam­aging dis­clos­ures, and the media are act­ively pre­ven­ted from<br />pub­lish­ing rev­el­a­tions of wrong­do­ing in the pub­lic interest, this chilling effect will be<br />widely felt. The pub­lic interest demands a sub­stan­tial thaw.<br />160<br />Michael Kins­ley, “How we lost that story,” 8 August 1998 «slate.msn.com/Readme/98–08–<br />08/Readme.asp»<br />161<br />Ibid<br />162<br />Ibid<br />163<br />Quoted in “Inter­net expos­ure sparks fears for safety of spies,” Fin­an­cial Times, 13 May 1999<br />164<br />David Pal­lister, “World web war wor­ries cen­sors,” The Guard­ian, 13 May 1999<br />7 A cul­ture of greater open­ness?<br />The Brit­ish State has long been cri­ti­cised for its cul­ture of secrecy and lack of<br />open­ness. The oper­a­tion of the par­lia­ment­ary sys­tem has been described as an elect­ive<br />dic­tat­or­ship, and the strangle­hold that the exec­ut­ive exer­cises on inform­a­tion and on<br />decision-making was only tempered in the 1980s by the estab­lish­ment of a select<br />com­mit­tee sys­tem.<br />The Labour Party, before its elec­tion in 1997, pledged that it would intro­duce a new<br />cul­ture of open­ness and trans­par­ency and broaden the pro­cesses of polit­ical<br />account­ab­il­ity. Since it took office it has enacted one piece of legis­la­tion and has<br />another in the pipeline, both of which – if they met inter­na­tional stand­ards – would<br />encour­age and facil­it­ate the dis­sem­in­a­tion of inform­a­tion to the media and the pub­lic.<br />The Pub­lic Interest Dis­clos­ure Act 1998 provides pro­tec­tion for leaks con­cern­ing<br />unlaw­ful or oth­er­wise dam­aging activ­it­ies, and its effects are already begin­ning to be<br />felt. The Gov­ern­ment is still attempt­ing to steer its Free­dom of Inform­a­tion Bill,<br />provid­ing for a right to access inform­a­tion held by pub­lic author­it­ies, through the<br />legis­lat­ive pro­cess. How­ever, it has come up against stiff res­ist­ance from many<br />quar­ters, and it still falls far short of inter­na­tional standards165 – in par­tic­u­lar in<br />rela­tion to the excess­ive régime of exemp­tions included in the Bill.<br />While such legis­la­tion is wel­come, neither piece of legis­la­tion applies to the Secur­ity<br />and Intel­li­gence ser­vices, illus­trat­ing the utter lack of will­ing­ness on the part of<br />Gov­ern­ment to tackle the veil of secrecy on mat­ters of national secur­ity. It is pre­cisely<br />where other mech­an­isms of hold­ing gov­ern­ment and state to account are weak­est that<br />this new legis­la­tion is most feeble. The lack of account­ab­il­ity on mat­ters con­cern­ing<br />national secur­ity is fur­ther rein­forced by inad­equate par­lia­ment­ary over­sight on these<br />mat­ters.<br />7.1 Pub­lic Interest Dis­clos­ure Act 1998<br />The Pub­lic Interest Dis­clos­ure Act 1998 (<span class="caps">PIDA</span>) amends the Employ­ment Rights Act<br />1996 to provide stat­utory pro­tec­tion for those who, in the pub­lic interest, breach<br />duties of con­fid­ence and make dis­clos­ures regard­ing inter alia illeg­al­it­ies and<br />wrongdoing.166 Under cer­tain con­di­tions, <span class="caps">PIDA</span> will pro­tect dis­clos­ures made to the<br />press, although the pre­ferred recip­i­ents of such dis­clos­ures are employ­ers or those<br />appoin­ted to hear grievances.167 Where indi­vidu­als have made dis­clos­ures that fall<br />within the scope of <span class="caps">PIDA</span>, they are entitled not to be sub­ject to any adverse<br />con­sequences as a result.168 If they are dis­missed as a res­ult of mak­ing such<br />dis­clos­ures, this will con­sti­tute unfair dismissal.169<br />The restric­ted scope of <span class="caps">PIDA</span>, how­ever, high­lights the lim­ited way in which the<br />Gov­ern­ment is pre­pared to be open. None of these pro­tec­tions extends to those<br />165<br />See Appendix 2<br />S. 1 <span class="caps">PIDA</span> 1998, adding s. <span class="caps">43B</span> <span class="caps">ERA</span> 1996<br />167<br />S. 1 <span class="caps">PIDA</span> 1998, adding ss. <span class="caps">43C-43H</span> <span class="caps">ERA</span> 1996<br />168<br />S. 2 <span class="caps">PIDA</span> 1998, adding s. <span class="caps">47B</span> <span class="caps">ERA</span> 1996<br />169<br />S. 5 <span class="caps">PIDA</span> 1998, adding s. <span class="caps">103A</span> <span class="caps">ERA</span> 1996<br />166<br />employed by the secur­ity and intel­li­gence services,170 even where they expose<br />illeg­al­it­ies and incom­pet­ence. In light of the fact that the pub­lic interest may favour<br />the dis­clos­ure of some secret inform­a­tion, this fail­ure to offer pro­tec­tion would not<br />appear to serve the pub­lic interest. Par­lia­ment ought to con­sider afresh the ques­tion of<br />whether whis­tleblowers from within <span class="caps">MI5</span> and <span class="caps">MI6</span> should be given some pro­tec­tion<br />against adverse con­sequences arising as a res­ult of their dis­clos­ures. This is<br />par­tic­u­larly import­ant where, due to the lack of effect­ive internal and external<br />account­ab­il­ity struc­tures, whistle-blowing may be the only way in which atten­tion can<br />be brought to bear on wrong­do­ing.<br />It might be said that the abil­ity of those ser­vices to dis­charge their func­tions is<br />pecu­li­arly sens­it­ive to the per­ceived loy­alty and integ­rity of its officers. The courts<br />have held that: “It is of para­mount import­ance that mem­bers of the [Secret<br />Intel­li­gence Ser­vice] should have com­plete con­fid­ence in all their deal­ings with each<br />other, and that those recruited as inform­ers should have the like confidence.“171<br />How­ever, it is surely going too far to sug­gest that this factor is of para­mount<br />import­ance. It may be that mem­bers of the Secur­ity and Intel­li­gence Ser­vices should<br />not bene­fit from exactly the same rem­ed­ies as oth­ers, for example in rela­tion to a right<br />to rein­state­ment, but there can be little jus­ti­fic­a­tion for deny­ing such whis­tleblowers<br />any pro­tec­tion from sanc­tion.<br />7.2 The Free­dom of Inform­a­tion Bill<br />The Gov­ern­ment claims to hon­our a mani­festo com­mit­ment by intro­du­cing a draft law<br />on free­dom of inform­a­tion. How­ever, the Free­dom of Inform­a­tion Bill cur­rently going<br />through Par­lia­ment fails to provide any altern­at­ive sys­tem­atic means of dis­sem­in­at­ing<br />security-related inform­a­tion which is in the pub­lic interest and so leaves the press-as–<br />watch­dog reli­ant on unau­thor­ised dis­clos­ures.<br />The pro­vi­sions in the Bill relat­ing to secur­ity bod­ies effect­ively impose a blanket ban<br />on any inform­a­tion about their operation.172 <span class="caps">MI5</span>, <span class="caps">MI6</span>, <span class="caps">GCHQ</span> and the spe­cial forces,<br />are com­pletely excluded from the oblig­a­tions of dis­clos­ure set out in the Bill.<br />In addi­tion, all inform­a­tion “dir­ectly or indir­ectly sup­plied to the pub­lic author­ity by,<br />or [which] relates to the work of” secur­ity bod­ies is also exempt (s. 21(1)). Moreover,<br />a cer­ti­fic­ate signed by a Min­is­ter of the Crown will stand as con­clus­ive evid­ence that<br />any inform­a­tion reques­ted falls within this blanket exemption.173 A sim­ilar exemp­tion<br />applies in respect of other inform­a­tion to be with­held from the pub­lic in the interests<br />of safe­guard­ing national secur­ity. Again, a min­is­terial cer­ti­fic­ate will suf­fice as<br />con­clus­ive evid­ence that inform­a­tion falls within this category.174 The pro­vi­sion for<br />min­is­terial cer­ti­fic­ates to con­sti­tute con­clus­ive evid­ence of a legit­im­ate exemp­tion<br />offers scant com­fort to those who regard the executive’s abil­ity to deflect proper<br />scru­tiny through claims of national secur­ity as a vital tool for main­tain­ing the cur­rent<br />imbal­ance between free expres­sion and other ele­ments of the pub­lic interest.

Thus, s. 21<br />pre­cludes dis­clos­ure of inform­a­tion even where this is clearly in the pub­lic interest. In<br />effect, s. 21 com­pletely neg­ates any pub­lic access to the very broad range of<br />inform­a­tion it cov­ers. The Free­dom of Inform­a­tion Bill there­fore provides little more<br />by access to inform­a­tion about national secur­ity than exis­ted before.<br />7.3 Lack of demo­cratic account­ab­il­ity of the Secur­ity and<br />Intel­li­gence Ser­vices<br />The need for greater account­ab­il­ity has led to some change in the way that the<br />Secur­ity and Intel­li­gence Ser­vices func­tion. How­ever, the extent to which they can be<br />said to be sub­ject to adequate par­lia­ment­ary over­sight is ques­tion­able. Yet<br />par­lia­ment­ary over­sight is of key import­ance to ensur­ing that the secur­ity and<br />intel­li­gence ser­vices are account­able for their activ­it­ies to the same degree as other<br />pub­lic bod­ies. Judging by the num­ber of whis­tleblowers that have come forth over<br />time, and the sup­port that they have attrac­ted from some of their ex-colleagues, there<br />appears to be a need for Par­lia­ment to scru­tin­ise more closely the work of the secur­ity<br />and intel­li­gence ser­vices, par­tic­u­larly as internal mech­an­isms deal­ing with<br />wrong­do­ing do not appear to be work­ing.<br />Given the view of some ex-security and intel­li­gence ser­vices officers that there is “no<br />mech­an­ism for internal dis­sent” and that mem­bers of <span class="caps">MI5</span> have “no con­fid­ence in the<br />so-called staff coun­sel­lor,” a former per­man­ent secretary,176 whistle-blowing appears<br />to some employ­ees within the secur­ity and intel­li­gence ser­vices as the only way to<br />draw atten­tion to wrong­do­ing. But rely­ing on whis­tleblow­ing to expose wrong­do­ing is<br />unsat­is­fact­ory and a poor sub­sti­tute for prop­erly effect­ive struc­tures of account­ab­il­ity,<br />both internal and external.<br />In 1989 and again in 1994 there was some move­ment towards mak­ing the Secur­ity<br />and Intel­li­gence Ser­vices more account­able to elec­ted rep­res­ent­at­ives. In the wake of<br />vari­ous leaks and con­tro­ver­sies, and a case res­ult­ing from <span class="caps">MI5</span>?s sur­veil­lance of<br />Liberty, the Gov­ern­ment passed the 1989 Secur­ity Ser­vices Act which provides for<br />stat­utory reg­u­la­tion of the activ­it­ies of <span class="caps">MI5</span>.177 <span class="caps">GCHQ</span> and <span class="caps">MI6</span> were also form­ally<br />estab­lished by the Intel­li­gence Ser­vices Act 1994. How­ever, the sys­tem of<br />com­mis­sion­ers and tribunals empowered to “check the leg­al­ity of war­rants issued by<br />ministers“178 has yet to uphold a single com­plaint.<br />In 1994, the Intel­li­gence Ser­vices Act was passed provid­ing for lim­ited Par­lia­ment­ary<br />over­sight through the estab­lish­ment of the Intel­li­gence and Secur­ity Com­mit­tee.<br />How­ever, lim­it­a­tions in its man­date have led many to con­clude that the secur­ity and<br />intel­li­gence ser­vices are still not sub­ject to a sat­is­fact­ory level of Par­lia­ment­ary<br />175<br />cll.24, 25 <span class="amp">&amp;</span> 27 <span class="caps">FOIB</span> 2000<br />David Shayler and Jestyn Thirkell-White make these claims.

Mem­bers are appoin­ted by<br />the Prime Min­is­ter, to whom it reports. Its remit is to exam­ine expendit­ure,<br />admin­is­tra­tion and policy of the secur­ity agen­cies, but it is restrained from examin­ing<br />oper­a­tions. It can com­pel evid­ence from heads of agen­cies but has no power to<br />sum­mon wit­nesses or demand inform­a­tion from the pub­lic at large. Per­haps the most<br />lim­it­ing fea­ture of the Com­mit­tee is the fact that it has to oper­ate within the “ring of<br />secrecy” – “the Com­mit­tee can­not itself con­trol the extent to which its con­clu­sions are<br />made pub­lic … the Prime Min­is­ter may – after con­sulta­tion with the Com­mit­tee –<br />exclude mater­ial which he con­siders to be pre­ju­di­cial to the con­tin­ued dis­charge of<br />the func­tions of the Agen­cies …“180 This once again rein­forces the executive’s<br />mono­poly over defin­ing what con­sti­tutes national secur­ity.<br />The view that the Intel­li­gence and Secur­ity Com­mit­tee should be given full Select<br />Com­mit­tee status was endorsed by the Home Affairs Select Com­mit­tee last year and<br />many other senior politi­cians before that.181 This status would give the Com­mit­tee a<br />status inde­pend­ent of the exec­ut­ive in national secur­ity mat­ters and would extend its<br />abil­ity to invest­ig­ate wrong­do­ings and to main­tain effect­ive over­sight over the<br />Secur­ity and Intel­li­gence Ser­vices. In pro­pos­ing such a scheme in 1989, Roy<br />Hat­ters­ley said:<br />“One of the advant­ages of a Select Com­mit­tee in com­par­ison with other insti­tu­tions is<br />that under our scheme it would write its reports after listen­ing to the Government’s<br />advice about the need for secur­ity. That dif­fer­ence is cru­cial. It demon­strates the<br />weak­ness of one and the strength of the other. It is the dif­fer­ence between keep­ing the<br />super­vi­sion of the secur­ity ser­vices within the fam­ily of the estab­lish­ment or<br />extend­ing it to a respons­ible but essen­tially inde­pend­ent oversight.”182<br />Mak­ing the Secur­ity and Intel­li­gence Ser­vices answer­able to Par­lia­ment, in part by<br />con­fer­ring full Select Com­mit­tee status upon the Intel­li­gence and Secur­ity<br />Com­mit­tee, would go some way to address­ing the Secur­ity and Intel­li­gence Ser­vices’<br />cur­rent lack of account­ab­il­ity.<br />7.4 Con­clu­sion<br />The lack of account­ab­il­ity and open­ness about the secur­ity forces makes<br />whis­tleblowers from within the secur­ity and intel­li­gence ser­vices par­tic­u­larly<br />valu­able. In the absence of any sub­stan­tial altern­at­ive means by which Par­lia­ment can<br />scru­tin­ise the con­duct of those ser­vices, unau­thor­ised dis­clos­ures by those within the<br />intel­li­gence com­munity con­sti­tutes a vital source of inform­a­tion on illeg­al­it­ies and<br />wrong­do­ing. Yet the gov­ern­ment has shown that it is not only unwill­ing to pro­tect<br />whis­tleblowers, but actu­ally pur­sues them instead. Its com­mit­ment to open­ness is<br />there­fore open to ques­tion.<br />179<br />“Our spies must answer to Par­lia­ment for their actions” Don­ald MacIntyre, The Inde­pend­ent, 22<br />August 2000<br />180<br />Third Report: Account­ab­il­ity of the Secur­ity Ser­vices, Select Com­mit­tee on Home Affairs, House of<br />Com­mons, 21 June 1999<br />181<br />Ibid<br />182<br />Offi­cial Report 16 Janu­ary 1989 col 37<br /><span class="caps">ARTICLE</span> 19 and Liberty believe that the Gov­ern­ment can do much more to ful­fil its<br />com­mit­ment to open­ness.

Lastly, it should<br />sub­ject the Secur­ity and Intel­li­gence Ser­vices to greater Par­lia­ment­ary scru­tiny than<br />cur­rently exists.<br />8 The Future of Secrecy under the Human Rights Act<br />1998<br />The most sig­ni­fic­ant recent piece of legis­la­tion in rela­tion to the laws on secur­ity and<br />free­dom of expres­sion is the Human Rights Act 1998 (<span class="caps">HRA</span>) which came into force<br />on 2 Octo­ber 2000. The <span class="caps">HRA</span> finally incor­por­ates the <span class="caps">ECHR</span> into <span class="caps">UK</span> law.183 <span class="caps">UK</span><br />cit­izens are now able to rely on their <span class="caps">ECHR</span> rights before domestic courts, both as a<br />defence to civil action and crim­inal pro­sec­u­tion and as a cause of action against pub­lic<br />author­it­ies in civil actions and judi­cial review.184 The gov­ern­ment regards the <span class="caps">HRA</span><br />as “a con­sid­er­able achieve­ment” and has “urged people to make the most of their new<br />rights.“185<br />For those facing pro­sec­u­tion and civil suits for mak­ing security-related dis­clos­ures<br />such as David Shayler, Nigel Wylde, “Mar­tin Ingrams”, the <span class="caps">HRA</span> will be a wel­come<br />means of defend­ing their right to free expres­sion.<br />Under the <span class="caps">HRA</span> all legis­la­tion is to be con­strued, where pos­sible, so as to render it<br />com­pat­ible with the <span class="caps">ECHR</span> rights incor­por­ated by this Act.186 The <span class="caps">HRA</span> for the first<br />time gives the courts in Scot­land, North­ern Ire­land and Eng­land and Wales the power<br />to strike out sec­ond­ary legis­la­tion, such as stat­utory instru­ments and Orders in<br />Coun­cil, where it does not admit of a com­pat­ible interpretation.187 Sim­il­arly, the<br />courts may inval­id­ate admin­is­trat­ive actions, includ­ing those con­duc­ted under the<br />Royal Prerogative.188 The courts can­not, how­ever, strike out primary legis­la­tion –<br />that is, Acts of Parliament.189 Rather, in the name of par­lia­ment­ary sov­er­eignty, the<br />courts will only be able to declare them incom­pat­ible with the <span class="caps">ECHR190</span> and it will<br />then be for Par­lia­ment to amend the offend­ing stat­ute (the Act provides for a spe­cial<br />“fast-track” pro­ced­ure for this).191 In the mean­time, the incom­pat­ible stat­ute will<br />con­tinue to apply, so a declar­a­tion of incom­pat­ib­il­ity has no impact on the<br />pro­ceed­ings within which it is issued.192<br />8.1 Free­dom bred in the bone of com­mon law?<br />It is some­times claimed by the courts that the pro­vi­sions of Art­icle 10 of the <span class="caps">ECHR</span><br />are reflec­ted in the com­mon law of Eng­land and Wales,193 and that free­dom of<br />183<br />The <span class="caps">HRA</span> does not incor­por­ate Art­icle 13, which con­fers the right to an effect­ive rem­edy to cor­rect<br />infringe­ments of the “sub­stant­ive” <span class="caps">ECHR</span> rights<br />184<br />Provided the indi­vidu­als in ques­tion are “vic­tims” of a breach of <span class="caps">ECHR</span> rights.

As a respec­ted com­ment­ator has observed, “[the] Brit­ish<br />sys­tem pre­cisely does not put the onus on gov­ern­ment to jus­tify inter­fer­ence with<br />fun­da­mental polit­ical rights. Par­lia­ment­ary sov­er­eignty in prac­tice raises the exec­ut­ive<br />above any sys­tem­atic legal or polit­ical restraint. … Moreover, the judi­ciary imposes<br />fur­ther restraints on itself, most not­ably in cases involving national security.“195 The<br /><span class="caps">HRA</span> should, there­fore, provide an oppor­tun­ity for a sig­ni­fic­ant review of Brit­ish law<br />and prac­tice in the area of secrecy and national secur­ity.<br />One sig­ni­fic­ant dif­fer­ence under the <span class="caps">HRA</span> is that courts will no longer be restric­ted to<br />the stand­ard of judi­cial review when assess­ing legis­la­tion and admin­is­trat­ive actions.<br />We believe that the courts should apply the three-part test set out above to any<br />restric­tions on free­dom of expres­sion, in par­tic­u­lar to require any restric­tion to be<br />“neces­sary in a demo­cratic soci­ety”. This means that the tra­di­tional defer­ence courts<br />have shown in the face of exec­ut­ive claims regard­ing national secur­ity is no longer<br />accept­able; instead, courts should now see them­selves as under a duty to sub­ject<br />attempts to limit free expres­sion to proper scru­tiny.<br />Another dif­fer­ence is that courts must now take account of the jur­is­pru­dence of the<br />European Court and Com­mis­sion of Human Rights.196 Com­pli­ance with this<br />require­ment will demand that the <span class="caps">UK</span> courts inter­pret the “rights and freedoms<br />guar­an­teed … con­sist­ent with the gen­eral spirit of the Convention.“197 This means that<br />the courts should give a broad con­struc­tion to the basic freedoms – as the right to free<br />expres­sion in Art­icle 10(1) – con­strue the legit­im­ate excep­tions to those freedoms,<br />such as the national secur­ity exemp­tion in Art­icle 10(2), in a nar­row man­ner.<br />In this respect, it is worth cit­ing state­ments made by the Lord Chan­cel­lor in a lec­ture<br />delivered on 16 Decem­ber 1997.198 Dis­cuss­ing the likely impact of incor­por­at­ing the<br /><span class="caps">ECHR</span>, Lord Irvine of Lairg stated that from incor­por­a­tion, judi­cial scru­tiny:<br />will not be lim­ited to see­ing if the words of an excep­tion can be sat­is­fied.<br />The Court will need to be sat­is­fied that the spirit of this excep­tion is made<br />out. It will need to be sat­is­fied that the inter­fer­ence with the pro­tec­ted right<br />is jus­ti­fied in the pub­lic interests in a free demo­cratic soci­ety [and will] have<br />to apply the Con­ven­tion prin­ciple of pro­por­tion­al­ity.<br />8.2 An end to judi­cial defer­ence<br />As noted above, the <span class="caps">HRA</span> should bring about a sig­ni­fic­ant change in the way <span class="caps">UK</span><br />courts assess restric­tions on free­dom of expres­sion on grounds of national secur­ity. It<br />could be argued that the <span class="caps">HRA</span> requires courts to adopt an approach closer to that of<br />194<br />R v Cent­ral Crim­inal Court, ex parte The Guard­ian, The Observer <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Mar­tin Bright, 21 July 2000,<br />draft judg­ment, p.24<br />195<br />F.

The <span class="caps">HRA</span><br />allows the courts to sub­stan­tially rein­ter­pret legis­la­tion, includ­ing the Offi­cial Secrets<br />Act, and to issue declar­a­tions of incom­pat­ib­il­ity where this fails to render laws <span class="caps">ECHR</span><br />com­plaint. It also allows courts to re-evaluate the tra­di­tional approach towards the<br />exer­cise of their dis­cre­tion, for example in award­ing pro­duc­tion orders, interim<br />injunc­tions and other civil rem­ed­ies. Sim­il­arly, the deterrent effect of pen­al­ties can be<br />taken into account by assess­ing whether a par­tic­u­lar claim viol­ates the require­ment of<br />pro­por­tion­al­ity.<br />8.3 The <span class="caps">HRA</span> and injunc­tions<br />The <span class="caps">HRA</span> con­tains spe­cific pro­vi­sions relat­ing to interim injunc­tions which will<br />sig­ni­fic­antly impede the Government’s abil­ity to secure gag­ging orders of this nature.<br />Such injunc­tions are often obtained through an ex parte applic­a­tion, that is, in the<br />absence of the respond­ent. Under the <span class="caps">HRA</span>, no ex parte relief can be gran­ted unless<br />either the gov­ern­ment has taken all prac­tic­able steps to put the respond­ent on notice or<br />there are com­pel­ling reas­ons for the pro­ceed­ings to be con­duc­ted on this basis.202<br />Moreover, an interim injunc­tion will be jus­ti­fi­able only if the gov­ern­ment can show<br />that a per­man­ent injunc­tion is likely to be obtained at trial.203 This is quite dif­fer­ent<br />from present require­ments, under which the applic­ant only needs to show that there is<br />an “argu­able” case where the bal­ance of con­veni­ence favours an injunc­tion. Courts<br />are now expli­citly required to take into account the extent to which the mater­ial in<br />ques­tion has entered or is about to enter the pub­lic domain and, sig­ni­fic­antly, the<br />extent to which it would be in the pub­lic interest for the mater­ial to be published.204<br />These changes – inspired by media con­cern that the judi­ciary might give too little<br />weight to free­dom of expres­sion as against indi­vidu­als’ right to pri­vacy under Art­icle<br />8 of the <span class="caps">ECHR205</span> – mean that ex parte interim injunc­tions to pre­vent security-related<br />dis­clos­ures should now be far more dif­fi­cult to obtain. They are much-needed<br />safe­guards against a rem­edy fre­quently abused by the Gov­ern­ment to pre­vent the<br />dis­sem­in­a­tion of a wide range of inform­a­tion.<br />199<br />Chahal v United King­dom (1997) 23 <span class="caps">EHRR</span> 413<br />Sec­ret­ary of State for the Home Depart­ment v Shafiq Ur Reh­man, 23 May 2000<br />201<br />Lord Irvine of Lairg, “The Devel­op­ment of Human Rights in Bri­tain under and Incor­por­ated<br />Con­ven­tion on Human Rights,” par­tially reprin­ted in Michael Allen and Brian Thompson, Cases <span class="amp">&amp;</span><br />Mater­i­als on Con­sti­tu­tional <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Admin­is­trat­ive Law, 5<sup>th</sup> edi­tion, Black­stone Press, 1998, p.557<br />202<br />S. 12(2) <span class="caps">HRA</span> 1998<br />203<br />S. 12(3) <span class="caps">HRA</span> 1998<br />204<br />S. 12(4)(a) <span class="caps">HRA</span> 1998<br />205<br />Brian MacAr­thur, “Farewell kiss-and-tell,” The Times, 18 August 2000<br />200<br />Sec­tion 12 Human Rights Act 1998 and Free­dom of Expres­sion<br />Sec­tion 12 (2) If the per­son against whom the applic­a­tion for relief is made (“the<br />respond­ent”) is neither present nor rep­res­en­ted, no such relief is to be gran­ted unless<br />the court is sat­is­fied–<br />(a) that the applic­ant has taken all prac­tic­able steps to notify the respond­ent; or<br />(b) that there are com­pel­ling reas­ons why the respond­ent should not be noti­fied.<br />(3) No such relief is to be gran­ted so as to restrain pub­lic­a­tion before trial unless the<br />court is sat­is­fied that the applic­ant is likely to estab­lish that pub­lic­a­tion should not be<br />allowed.<br />(4) The court must have par­tic­u­lar regard to the import­ance of the Con­ven­tion right to<br />free­dom of expres­sion and, where the pro­ceed­ings relate to mater­ial which the<br />respond­ent claims, or which appears to the court, to be journ­al­istic, lit­er­ary or artistic<br />mater­ial (or to con­duct con­nec­ted with such mater­ial), to–<br />(a) the extent to which–<br />(i) the mater­ial has, or is about to, become avail­able to the pub­lic; or<br />(ii) it is, or would be, in the pub­lic interest for the mater­ial to be pub­lished;<br />(b) any rel­ev­ant pri­vacy code.<br />8.4 An ECHR-compliant <span class="caps">OSA</span><br />The <span class="caps">HRA</span> should also sig­ni­fic­antly affect applic­a­tion of the Offi­cial Secrets Act. On<br />the face of it, the <span class="caps">OSA</span> is clearly incom­pat­ible with the <span class="caps">ECHR</span> and is widely<br />recog­nised to be so, although it remains to be seen as to whether the judi­ciary will<br />neces­sar­ily agree with this view. The key issues here are whether it is pos­sible to read<br />the <span class="caps">OSA</span> in such a way that the vari­ous offences estab­lished by that Act are<br />com­pat­ible with the <span class="caps">ECHR</span>; whether, if not, the courts will be will­ing to issue<br />declar­a­tions of incom­pat­ib­il­ity; and finally, whether, in this case, the Gov­ern­ment will<br />be pre­pared to amend or repeal the offend­ing pro­vi­sions.<br />A dis­clos­ure under ss. 2–5 <span class="caps">OSA</span> 1989 is crim­inal only if it is “dam­aging”. In the view<br />of Liberty and <span class="caps">ARTICLE</span> 19 this require­ment can eas­ily be read as includ­ing a broad<br />pub­lic interest test. Under such an inter­pret­a­tion, dam­age would be con­strued broadly,<br />so that it would refer not only to dir­ect harm to national secur­ity but also to any<br />bene­fits from a par­tic­u­lar dis­clos­ure, for example in expos­ing wrong­do­ing. This<br />inter­pret­a­tion is sup­por­ted by s. 12(4)(a) <span class="caps">HRA</span>, deal­ing with injunc­tions, which<br />expli­citly requires that the broader pub­lic interest be taken into account, and by cases<br />in which the <span class="caps">ECHR</span> has held that fur­ther dis­sem­in­a­tion of inform­a­tion already in the<br />pub­lic zone may not be sanc­tioned.<br />A more dif­fi­cult ques­tion is whether s. 1 <span class="caps">OSA</span> – the pro­vi­sion under which former<br />mem­bers of the secur­ity and intel­li­gence ser­vices may be pro­sec­uted – can also be<br />read in such a way as to be com­pat­ible with the <span class="caps">ECHR</span>. This offence does not con­tain<br />any require­ment of dam­age. How­ever, it could be argued that by incor­por­at­ing<br />Art­icle 10 into <span class="caps">UK</span> law, the <span class="caps">HRA</span> has impli­citly amended the <span class="caps">OSA</span> so as to include<br />harm and pub­lic interest tests. Des­pite this, it may be worth not­ing that under the<br />doc­trine of the mar­gin of appre­ci­ation, the European Court has always allowed States<br />some lat­it­ude in pro­tect­ing national secur­ity, and it remains unclear how the Brit­ish<br />courts will apply this doc­trine.<br />Even if the courts do not read harm and pub­lic interest tests into s. 1 <span class="caps">OSA</span>, they still<br />could, and indeed should, issue a declar­a­tion of incom­pat­ib­il­ity under the <span class="caps">HRA</span>,<br />pla­cing the onus on gov­ern­ment to cor­rect that incom­pat­ib­il­ity. How­ever, since such a<br />declar­a­tion does not affect the pro­ceed­ings in which it is issued,206 in the­ory the courts<br />could jail a whis­tleblower under the <span class="caps">OSA</span> while at the same time recog­nising its<br />incom­pat­ib­il­ity with the <span class="caps">ECHR</span>.<br />8.5 The <span class="caps">HRA</span> and civil claims<br />The <span class="caps">HRA</span> could also provide assist­ance to a genu­ine whis­tleblower facing the full<br />range of civil claims that the gov­ern­ment habitu­ally deploys against those who make<br />dis­clos­ures of security-related inform­a­tion. A pub­lic author­ity will only to be able<br />bene­fit from civil rem­ed­ies – includ­ing dam­ages, account of profits and per­man­ent<br />injunc­tions – where they are ECHR-compliant, in the sense that they are neces­sary in<br />a demo­cratic soci­ety. Where the applic­ant is a true pub­lic actor, as opposed to a<br />private one where the rules might be dif­fer­ent, the same require­ments of harm and<br />pub­lic interest should apply. This should apply, for example, to claims by the Secur­ity<br />and Intel­li­gence Ser­vices for breach of con­fid­ence or con­tract. Unless these con­di­tions<br />are sat­is­fied, grant­ing the gov­ern­ment a civil law rem­edy would not be a pro­por­tion­ate<br />response to the dis­clos­ure.<br />8.6 Con­clu­sion<br />The <span class="caps">HRA</span> requires <span class="caps">UK</span> courts to be more act­ive in their scru­tiny of restric­tions on<br />free­dom of expres­sion, includ­ing those jus­ti­fied in the name of national secur­ity. They<br />should now assess whether such restric­tions are neces­sary in a demo­cratic soci­ety,<br />rather than simply apply the weak stand­ard of judi­cial review. This should mean that<br />injunc­tions and other civil law rem­ed­ies will be harder to obtain; pro­duc­tion orders<br />more dif­fi­cult to jus­tify; and con­vic­tions under the <span class="caps">OSA</span> restric­ted to a nar­row range<br />of genu­inely dam­aging dis­clos­ures. <span class="caps">ARTICLE</span> 19 and Liberty see the incor­por­a­tion of<br />the <span class="caps">ECHR</span> into <span class="caps">UK</span> law through the <span class="caps">HRA</span> as an extremely pos­it­ive devel­op­ment which<br />provides an oppor­tun­ity to redress the cur­rent strik­ing imbal­ance between the right to<br />free­dom of expres­sion and national secur­ity. We sin­cerely hope that the courts<br />embrace this oppor­tun­ity to bring about sig­ni­fic­ant changes in the law.<br />206<br />Laurence Lust­garten, “Free­dom of Expres­sion, Dis­sent, and National Secur­ity in the United<br />King­dom,” in Sandra Coliver et al, Secrecy and Liberty: National Secur­ity, Free­dom of Expres­sion and<br />Access to Inform­a­tion, Kluwer Law, 1999, p. 470<br />9 Recom­mend­a­tions<br />The pro­tec­tion of national secur­ity is a genu­ine and legit­im­ate interest, not simply of<br />the state or the gov­ern­ment of the day, but of the pub­lic at large. How­ever, as this<br />report has shown, cur­rent law and prac­tice in the <span class="caps">UK</span> sig­nally fails to provide a proper<br />bal­ance between the public’s right to free­dom of expres­sion and free­dom of<br />inform­a­tion and these national secur­ity interests. The law is overly restrict­ive,<br />effect­ively pre­cludes proper judi­cial over­sight and encour­ages abuse.<br />Cor­rect­ing the flaws of cur­rent law and prac­tice – design­ing a struc­ture able to deliver<br />an appro­pri­ate bal­ance between free expres­sion and national secur­ity – demands a<br />recog­ni­tion of the fact that this is not a mat­ter of weigh­ing the interests of the state<br />against the interests of its cit­izens. Ulti­mately, proper pro­tec­tion of the right to free<br />expres­sion will lead to more open, account­able and bet­ter gov­ern­ment, as well as<br />more appropriately-run, effect­ive secur­ity ser­vices. This is in the over­all interest of<br />the State, as well as indi­vidu­als, since both free­dom of expres­sion and national<br />secur­ity are, ulti­mately, interests of the pub­lic. Bal­an­cing the two is a mat­ter of<br />determ­in­ing how best to serve the over­all pub­lic interest.<br />To the extent that judges in Bri­tain have ten­ded to adopt a “stat­ist view of the pub­lic<br />interest,“207 they have failed to strike an appro­pri­ate bal­ance between these two<br />interests.

The fol­low­ing<br />factors should be taken into account in assess­ing whether a par­tic­u­lar dis­clos­ure meets<br />this stand­ard:<br />• whether the inform­a­tion has already entered, or is likely soon to enter, the<br />   pub­lic domain, includ­ing via the Inter­net; and<br />• whether there is an dir­ect and imme­di­ate con­nec­tion – a causal link – between<br />       the dis­clos­ure and the risk of harm.<br />Recom­mend­a­tion 8: A Pub­lic Interest Defence to Apply<br />All restric­tions on expres­sion and inform­a­tion on grounds of national secur­ity,<br />whether crim­inal or civil, should be sub­ject to a pub­lic interest defence so that<br />sanc­tion or liab­il­ity should ensue only where any dam­age to national secur­ity is not<br />out­weighed by a cor­res­pond­ing pub­lic interest in dis­clos­ure.<br />Recom­mend­a­tion 9: Sanc­tions should not be Dis­pro­por­tion­ate<br />Any legal sanc­tions, crim­inal or civil, for breach of laws restrict­ing expres­sion or<br />inform­a­tion on grounds of national secur­ity should not be so severe as to have a<br />dis­pro­por­tion­ate effect on free­dom of expres­sion and inform­a­tion.

In par­tic­u­lar, journ­al­ists should be able to with­hold con­fid­en­tial sources<br />or inform­a­tion unless the party seek­ing dis­clos­ure can show that it is neces­sary for the<br />con­duct of the defence of an accused per­son in a crim­inal trial or to the interest of<br />soci­ety in crim­inal invest­ig­a­tions. Neces­sity, in this con­text, implies the fol­low­ing:<br />• the mater­ial in ques­tion will mater­i­ally assist the defence or crim­inal<br />   invest­ig­a­tion;<br />• there is no altern­at­ive means by which the inform­a­tion might be obtained; and<br />• the pub­lic interest in dis­clos­ure sig­ni­fic­antly out­weighs the harm to free­dom of<br />   expres­sion from dis­clos­ure.<br />Recom­mend­a­tion 12: The DA-Notice Sys­tem should be Dis­mantled<br />The sys­tem as presently con­sti­tuted should be dis­mantled.

If people do not know what is hap­pen­ing in<br />their soci­ety, if the actions of those who rule them are hid­den, then they can­not take a<br />mean­ing­ful part in the affairs of that soci­ety. But inform­a­tion is not just a neces­sity<br />for people, it is an essen­tial part of good gov­ern­ment. Bad gov­ern­ment needs secrecy<br />to sur­vive. It allows inef­fi­ciency, waste­ful­ness and cor­rup­tion to thrive. As Amartya<br />Sen, the Nobel Prize-winning eco­nom­ist has observed, there has never been a<br />sub­stan­tial fam­ine in a coun­try with a demo­cratic form of gov­ern­ment and a rel­at­ively<br />free press. Inform­a­tion allows people to scru­tin­ise the actions of a gov­ern­ment and is<br />the basis for proper, informed debate of those actions.<br />Most gov­ern­ments, how­ever, prefer to con­duct their busi­ness in secret. In Swahili,<br />one of the words for gov­ern­ment means “fierce secret”. Even demo­cratic gov­ern­ments<br />would rather con­duct the bulk of their busi­ness away from the eyes of the pub­lic. And<br />gov­ern­ments can always find reas­ons for main­tain­ing secrecy – the interests of<br />national secur­ity, pub­lic order and the wider pub­lic interest are a few examples. Too<br />often gov­ern­ments treat offi­cial inform­a­tion as their prop­erty, rather than some­thing<br />which they hold and main­tain on behalf of the people.<br />That is why <span class="caps">ARTICLE</span> 19 has pro­duced this set of inter­na­tional prin­ciples – to set a<br />stand­ard against which any­one can meas­ure whether domestic laws genu­inely per­mit<br />access to offi­cial inform­a­tion. They set out clearly and pre­cisely the ways in which<br />gov­ern­ments can achieve max­imum open­ness, in line with the best inter­na­tional<br />stand­ards and prac­tice.<br />Prin­ciples are import­ant as stand­ards but on their own they are not enough. They need<br />to be used – by cam­paign­ers, by law­yers, by elec­ted rep­res­ent­at­ives and by pub­lic<br />offi­cials.
