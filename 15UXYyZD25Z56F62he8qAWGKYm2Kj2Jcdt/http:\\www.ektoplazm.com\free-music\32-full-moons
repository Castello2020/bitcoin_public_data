Ash says:	February 16, 2010 at 11:27 pm	i like this album, you have all definitely stepped up a gear, well done to you and the artists. 01) Felix – Shivaya
Very powerful …. yes i can see myself dancing to this in the sun in an outdoor this summer, can’t wait x
02) Snag – The Sun shepherd, Return To Mind
I love the SweePz mmmm .. it seems to transmogrify into a Celtic offering .. which i can handle… haha woar there it goes again .. swirlll sweep .. mmm got me dancing in my front room hehe a big hint of Goa …with 21st century engineering… what more could you ask for on a sunny day in a party x
03) Mervit – Element.
Catchy tune.. straight to the point builds, solid monotonous bass, cool
04) Nemesis – Full In Operation
The sound is reverberating here from the track, i thought someone was at the door then haha i didn’t look though! … love the retro sqiggley sound.. got my foot tappin… kinda minimal n bouncy & gradually goes mental haha i like. 05) TighT – Here Again
Minimal mash up, deffo very influenced by your tech brothers, like the octave jump 3:40 in, brain booster .. making me feel like I’m in freak city … probably where i belong haha
06) Atomgrinder – Warm Damp Carpet
Excellent name for a song? haha certainly off the wall, just like our Atom Grinding friends x and yes grinding atoms here with a solid bass as the neighbours say haha 07) Boom Nasha – Boom Buxtha
I never get it with these tunes, until they near finish, keeps you in suspenders, picks up about 4:30, dig the jangly synth in the background..a trancer…happy & uplifting with grunt. 08) Tartaro – Evolution
Yep like it.. got me jigglin to a steady pace sat here, evolve it does, to a bouncy bouncy bit [i'm over emphasizing now!]… im moving my hand like im wearing a white glove..quite difficult when typing! .. must be good x again another lovely round n fat bass..
09) Bionick – Solar Move
Hands in the air.. no im typing but then again..turns groovy, repetitively.. can get lost in that.. on drugz… obviously hits a spot for me then! back to hands in the air, im at Samothraki festival now… in the sun mmm reminds me of Depeche Mode too ? mm connection mmm strange noises i think.
10) Cozmographika – Expanding Universe
Nice intro.. expanding universe of a kick! bass tickin over nice … heavy duty… nails nearly in!.. like the sample verbs, bass has got my body vibrating..you could have let the wailing women have a cuppa in the middle, but they sound great anyway.. x
Phew… i’m not sure i could do that for a living [i heard that!] it does seem easier, to listen and type at the same time.. i guess thats how you do it haha… Does eating a dictionary actually work? Flicking through the tracks now and i guess my fav must be track 02 Snag – The Sun shepherd, Return To Mind due to the fact im an old Goa head and love losing it to this as my bro knows, Steve J too.. In short an album worth grasping hold of, i will be dancing to it when it is played out, hopefully somewhere on a hill soooon.

Andy says:	April 15, 2010 at 1:24 pm	I really love the 2nd track, kind of alien death ray noise on it.
Chankin says:	July 14, 2010 at 12:36 am	Este conjugacion de sonidos electronicos con la letra tan sensual esta genial, puede ser hasta un proceso de mentalizacion hacia elementos y encuentro con el interior. mi e-mail es : arquitecturaespiritual@hotmail.com (me gustaria tener contacto con seres que les guste la alquimia del espiritu)
Chankin says:	July 14, 2010 at 12:46 am	La piedra lunar que se expone en el logo tiene gran significado astral muestra una serie de eventos segun su traduccion maya, en sus glifos existe una relacion alterna con la realidad que conocemos , y una de las puertas espirituales que se abrio fue el domingo 11 de Julio del 2010, con el eclipse del bajo universo se pudo ver al sur del planeta, y el proximo eclipse lunar y el mas fuerte de la era de sombra (la que esta por terminar ) es en noviembre del 2012, eclipse que abre a otro mundo en el que los seres que entren podran ver la coneccion que existe de todos lo seres en los diferentes planos y niveles astrales.
pero esto ya lo sabian los mayas, los seres de la isla de pascua, los incas, etc. culturas que hoy estan en otra realidad alterna a esto que le decimos espacio en el tiempo transcurrido en nuestra era.
si tienes mas informacion al respecto porfavor contactame, necesitamos estar preparados.
