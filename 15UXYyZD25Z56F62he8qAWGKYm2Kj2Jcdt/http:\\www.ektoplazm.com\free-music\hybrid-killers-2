Much better are the climaxes from SubConsciousMind’s Intermezzo Extended, which can be found here. Also, Fungus Funk’s F. People is a mind-killer. Anyone else have some songs with finishes of such intensity?

Zhihan says:	January 26, 2010 at 12:30 pm	I think this is one of the best releases after Faradize-Darknight Caster EP. Felix-First Contact and Y East-Ray of Light are really awesome.
mashiara says:	January 27, 2010 at 2:23 am	I like these compilations but the flac zip file appears to be password protected. halp
psyentifica says:	February 2, 2010 at 3:07 pm	Agree with Zhihan on Ray of light – nice track as you can usually expect from Y East, I also liked Noisixx – Insufficient Energy : cosmogenisis delivers again :)
Alex Evans says:	February 2, 2010 at 5:35 pm	If anyone has the chance to get a hold of Full Service by Sunstation Records, DO IT. It’s some of the best full-on I’ve heard yet. Especially good is the Dharma Kaya edit of Justice.
psyentifica says:	February 6, 2010 at 1:10 am	^ can’t find that title anywhere…
Alex Evans says:	February 8, 2010 at 2:18 pm	just type in ‘Full Service Rapidshare’ in Google.
Psylalyy says:	February 11, 2010 at 4:25 am	hey my mongolian song huumii track 3 nice
rf says:	February 18, 2010 at 11:50 pm	The Twins Paradox track is wonderful. The whole compilation is amazing and in capable hands lifts the spirit.
HotDogJog says:	February 19, 2010 at 12:20 am	Was that a distorted beat drop? Yes! Going the right way.
TRANCE says:	February 24, 2010 at 7:37 pm	YEA NICE IN MEXICO
Sam Perkins says:	August 24, 2010 at 4:51 am	~ALEX EVANS~ FULL SERVICE IS A GREAT FULL ON COMPILATION, YOU ARE RIGHT. AND DHARMA KAYA’S EDIT OF JUSTICE IS WICKED!!! BUT THE LABEL IS NOT SUN STATION, IT’S BLITZ STUDIOS. YOU MUST HAVE GOTTEN CONFUSED COZ THE 2 LABELS WORK TOGETHER SOMETIMES, SUCH AS IN THE CASE OF SUN BLITZ VA. BUT FULL SERVICE IS DHARMA KAYA’S SOLO RELEASE @ BLITZ STUDIOS. AS IS HIS LATEST COMPILATION SUN BLITZ 2 – THE RUSSIAN TWILIGHT SOUND. WHICH ALSO HAS SOME GREAT MORNING TRACKS FEATURED ON IT ;)
