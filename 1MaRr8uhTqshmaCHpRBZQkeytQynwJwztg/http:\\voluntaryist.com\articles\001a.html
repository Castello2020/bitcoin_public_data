<h2>The Ethics of Voting - Part I</h2>
<h4>by George H. Smith</h4>
</center>

<h3><p>1.Introduction</p></h3>

<p>
A detailed libertarian critique of electoral voting is long overdue.
Political libertarians (i.e., those who support the effort to elect
libertarians to political office) are usually silent on the moral
implications of electoral voting. When challenged, they typically
dismiss moral objections out of hand, as if the voluntaryist (i.e.,
anti-voting) case deserved nothing more than a cursory reply.
</p>

<p>This situation will probably change in the near future. The
issues raised in voluntaryist arguments are far too important to be
discarded without careful consideration, even if one ultimately rejects
voluntaryist conclusions. This is especially true for those political
anarchists (if I may use that curious phrase) who support the
Libertarian Party. If it is at least comprehensible why minarchists
(advocates of minimal government) support a political party, the
spectacle of political anarchists is far more perplexing. Hence this
essay (to be continued in subsequent issues of The Voluntaryist ) is
directed primarily at political anarchists, though some of the material
is relevant to minarchists as well.

</p>

<p>The purpose of this essay is to explore the moral implications
of libertarians (especially anarchists) holding political office,
running for political office, or assisting those who do � primarily
through the vote. The ethics of voting cannot be divorced from the key
question of what one is voting for. And this, as I shall argue, cannot
be divorced from the institutional framework in which the voting
occurs.
</p>

<p>This essay is directed to fellow libertarians who are familiar
with the standard debates in contemporary libertarianism, such as that
between minarchism and anarchism. I must also assume that the reader is
generally familiar with the basic approach of <a href='/fundamentals/introduction.html'>voluntaryism</a>. (if not, my
essay Party Dialogue should be consulted, along with the other essays
in "The Voluntaryist Series.") Moreover, standard terms in the
libertarian lexicon � e.g., "invasion" and "aggression" (which I use
synonymously) � are not defined in this essay. Here again standard
libertarian works should be consulted, such as various books and essays
by Murray Rothbard. A term that may generate some confusion is
"electoral voting." This means voting for the purpose of placing
someone in a political office. It does not refer to other kinds of
political voting, such as voting on particular issues in a referendum.
(This requires a somewhat different analysis.) Hereafter, unless
otherwise noted, the simple term "voting" shall be used to mean
"electoral voting."
</p>

<p>Since this essay is to appear in installments, I must beg
reader's pardon if some problems remain unsolved atthe conclusion of
each part. The theory of voting has been so neglected that it is
difficult to explore its moral implications without first laying a good
deal of preliminary groundwork. Some pro-voting arguments are based on
different premises and actually clash with each other when employed by
the same person. Other pro-voting arguments appear decisive, but they
retain this appearance at the expense not only of <a href='/fundamentals/introduction.html'>voluntaryism</a>, but of
principles common to all libertarian theories (especially anarchism).
These "kamikaze arguments" attack <a href='/fundamentals/introduction.html'>voluntaryism</a> by undercutting the
foundations of libertarian political analysis, thus exploding political
arguments later.) For one libertarian to use a kamikaze argument
against another libertarian is somewhat indelicate, to say the least.
</p>

<p>The theory of voting should be investigated within a broad
framework of political and legal theory. This plunges us into complex
and troublesome areas, like principal-agent relationships, accessories
before the fact, aiders and abettors of crime, and so forth. I do not
presume to have solved the problems these concepts create for
libertarian theory, but libertarianism undeniably depends on some
notion of accountability for persons other than those directly involved
in criminal (i.e., aggressive) acts.
</p>

<p>Libertarians generally agree that the driver of a getaway car
is liable for a bank robbery, even if he did not personally wield a gun
or threaten force. Similarly, we hold legislators accountable for their
unjust laws, political executives accountable for their unjust
directives, and judges accountable for their unjust decisions. We do
not exonerate these individuals just because they legitimize their
actions under the "mask of law." Yet political and bureaucratic
personnel rarely participate in law enforcement; they do not strap on
guns and apprehend violators. This is left to the police.
</p>

<p>Clearly, therefore, the libertarian (anarchist) condemnation of
the State as a criminal gang rests on the view that criminal liability
can extend beyond the person who uses, or threatens to use, invasive
force. Most of the individuals in government, though not directly
involved in aggression, nevertheless "aid and abet" this process.
Libertarian theory would be irreparably crippled without this
presumption. If criminal accountability is restricted only to direct
aggressors, then the vast majority of individuals in the State
apparatus, including those at the highest levels of decision-making,
must be considered nonaggressors by libertarian standards and hence
totally innocent. We could not even regard Hitler or Stalin as
aggressors, so long as they did not personally enforce their monstrous
orders. The only condemnable persons would be in the police, military,
and in other groups assigned to the enforcement of state decrees. All
others would be legally innocent (though we might regard them as
morally culpable).
</p>

<p>Few libertarians are willing to accept this bizarre conclusion,
but it automatically follows if we refuse to incorporate within
libertarian theory some idea of "vicarious liability" defined by
Black's Law Dictionary as "indirect legal responsibility; for example,
the liability of ... a principal for torts and contracts of agents").
</p>

<p>Libertarian theorists have virtually ignored vicarious
liability in three respects: first, they have rarely acknowledged it as
an implicit underpinning in the libertarian (especially anarchist)
analysis of the State; second, they have neglected to provide a
thorough study and justification of it; third (and most relevant to
this discussion), they have not examined its implications for the
theory of voting.
</p>

<p>I shall not attempt to defend a theory of vicarious liability
here, despite the crucial need for such a defense. Because I am
addressing fellow libertarians � most of whom accept some version of
this principle � I shall accept vicarious liability as a given within
libertarian theory and proceed from this foundation. ibertarian theory
in general, and anarchist theory in particular, would tread perilously
close to incoherence without this presumption. Given this fact, it
follows that voters, in some cases at least, are deemed accountable by
libertarians for the results of their votes (e.g., legislators who vote
for victimless crime laws). And this liability attaches despite the
fact that the voters do not directly engage in aggression or explicit
threats of aggression. It is incongruous, therefore, for a political
libertarian to profess bewilderment that even a prima facie case
against voting may exist, on the ground that voting is obviously a
nonaggressive act. If voting per se is deemed nonaggressive, if the
voter is never accountable for what occurs afterwards, then this attack
on vicarious liability succeeds in smashing <a href='/fundamentals/introduction.html'>voluntaryism</a> at the
considerable expense of rendering incoherent the libertarian analysis
of the State. Thus do kamikaze arguments "succeed".
</p>

<p>The libertarian who seriously believes that voting is always
nonaggressive � "How," he asks, "can pulling a lever in a voting booth
constitute aggression?" � is led by his own logic to conclude that
voting for any candidate is permissible by libertarian standards,
regardless of what the aspiring politician promises to do while in
office. A candidate might promise to imprison all redheads in slave
labor camps, or to order the execution of all Catholics on sight. But
on a strict nonaccountability theory of voting, the voters who placed
these politicians in office are in no way liable for their criminal
acts. And since � as political libertarians like to remind us �
libertarian theory forbids only aggressive acts, there would be nothing
inconsistent in a libertarian voting for these power-seekers, because
all voting, by definition, is nonaggressive.
</p>

<p>Moreover, the successful libertarian politician would find it
impossible, qua office holder, to violate libertarian principles while
in office. If voting is never aggressive, then the libertarian
legislator can never be aggressive (and hence unlibertarian) regardless
of what he votes for. Would a libertarian legislator who voted for a
draft be regarded by members of the Libertarian Party as having acted
contrary to libertarian principle? Most certainly. But if
libertarianism forbids aggressive acts only, and if voting can never be
an aggressive act, then in no sense can the pro-draft legislator be
accused of behaving in an anti-libertarian fashion.
</p>

<p>Political libertarians who endorse a non-accountability theory
of voting will have to grapple with its many paradoxes. After its
implications are understood, it is unlikely to find many defenders.
Some political libertarians already concede that a voter may be
accountable. For example, Jeff Hummel, a prominent anarchist and
supporter of the LP, maintains that "any legislator who votes for an
unjust law is ... in fact one of the actual aggressors!" (Free Texas,
Fall, 1981). Does this argument extend a step further back? Do voters
who place these politicians in power share liability for the resulting
injustice? Unfortunately, this is one crucial question among many on
which political libertarians remain silent.
</p>

<p>I have argued briefly that the voluntaryist case against
political voting cannot be dismissed as prima facie absurd by political
libertarians. This is because political libertarians share with
voluntaryists a theory of vicarious liability on which the case against
voting is built. (see p. 7 of manuscript) Deny vicarious liability ...
and political libertarians will be hard-pressed to retrieve their own
theory from the wreckage strewn about by their kamikaze attack.
</p>

<p>Of course, to establish the prima facie possibility of the
voluntaryist case does not cinch the argument. Many more arguments and
principles need to be considered. But we have at least cleared a path
along which the rest of this article may travel.
</p>

<h3>2. The Burden of Proof</h3>

<p>Before proceeding to an analysis of electoral voting and the
arguments pro and con, it may prove helpful to establish some
procedural guidelines. Foremost in any argument is the burden of proof.
Who assumes the burden of proof in a given dispute? Which side must
produce the preponderance of evidence and/or arguments in order to
resolve the case? Most important, if the responsible party fails to
meet the burden of proof, then what is the status of the dispute?
</p>

<p>In the voting debate, it is usually assumed that the burden of
proof rests with the voluntaryist, i.e., the opponent of voting. If the
voluntaryist claims that voting is inconsistent with libertarianism or
anarchism, then he must substantiate his claim. He must show that
electoral voting actually falls within the category of actions known as
"Invasive" or "aggressive." Failure to accomplish this acquits the
political libertarian, or the political anarchist, of all charges.
</p>

<p>This procedure seems reasonable. To condemn voting as improper
is a serious charge, after all, and it appears that the voluntaryist
should assume the burden of proof if he expects to be taken seriously.
We see a parallel in legal theory, where a man is presumed innocent
until this presumption is "defeated," i.e., until the defendant is
proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The legal presumption of
innocence determines where the burden of proof rests. Failure to
provide sufficient proof means that the presumption remains where it
began: the defendant is innocent.
</p>

<p>The legal analogy is accurate in one respect. It points out
that the burden of proof is fixed according to the basic presumption of
an argument. If, as we have seen, an accused man is presumed innocent,
then the onus falls upon his accuser to defeat this presumption. A
presumption functions as the starting point in a dispute.
</p>

<p>From the legal analogy, however, it does not follow
automatically that the political libertarian is analogous to the
defendant, and thus it does not follow that the burden of proof lies
entirely upon the voluntaryist. Indeed, in dealing with anarchism - the
principled rejection of the State � I maintain that there is a
presumption against political office-holding and therefore a
presumption against voting for political office. Thus the political
anarchist is the one who must defeat the basic presumption. When two
anarchists debate the ethics of voting, it is the political anarchist
who assumes the major burden of proof. It is the political anarchist
who must demonstrate to the voluntaryist why voting � an overt
participation in the political process � is not a violation of their
common anarchist principles. Let us examine this claim in more detail.
</p>

<p>Voluntaryists are more than libertarians; they are libertarian
anarchists. They reject the institution of the state totally, and it is
this element that is not contained (explicitly, at least) within
libertarianism. Libertarian theory condemns invasive (rights-violating)
acts and says that all human interaction should be voluntary. All
libertarians, whether minarchists or anarchists, accept this. It is the
defining characteristic of a libertarian.
</p>

<p>Libertarian anarchism professes not only the nonaggression
principle, but the additional view that the State is necessarily
invasive and should thus stand condemned. Libertarian anarchism
combines the libertarian principle of nonaggression with a particular
analysis of the State � an analysis not shared by libertarian
minarchists. It is the premise of nonaggression, coupled with an
institutional analysis of the State, that leads to the rejection of the
State by the anarchist as inconsistent with libertarian principles.
</p>

<p>The above reference to "institutional analysis" is critical.
One cannot progress from libertarianism to anarchism without an
intervening argument. A principled rejection of the State does not
necessarily follow from the nonaggression principle, unless one can
also show that the State is necessarily aggressive. This latter point �
the anarchist insight into the nature of the State � is the minor
premise required to justify anarchism:
</p>

<p>Major premise: Libertarian theory condemns all invasive acts.
Minor premise: All States commit invasive acts. Conclusion: Libertarian
theory condemns all States (or governments � I use the terms
interchangeably).
</p>

<p>This syllogism illustrates the difference between simple
libertarianism (articulated in the major premise) and libertarian
anarchism (articulated in the conclusion). The transition to anarchism
is realized through the anarchist insight (articulated in the minor
premise). This insight is what all libertarian anarchists share with
fellow anarchists. It is also what distinguishes libertarian anarchists
from their minarchist cousins.
</p>

<p>Minarchists qualify as authentic libertarians so long as they
believe it possible for their minimal State to remain nonaggressive.
The minarchist, like the anarchist, accepts the nonaggression
principle; but the minarchist does not accept the anarchist view of the
State. This controversy over the minor premise leads to different
applications of the nonaggression principle to the State. (Whether this
stems from a definitional dispute or from something more substantial
need not concern us here.)
</p>

<p>The minarchist issues a challenge to all libertarian
anarchists, political and voluntaryist alike: "Prove that all
governments are invasive. Demonstrate that the State, by its very
nature, must violate individual rights." The anarchist responds, as
indicated earlier, with an institutional analysis of the State. He
avers that institutional features of the State, such as the claim of
sovereign jurisdiction over a given geographical area, render the State
invasive per se. This invasive trait persists regardless of who
occupies positions of power in the State or what their individual
purposes may be. The anarchist insight, in order words, is not arrived
at inductively. The anarchist does not investigate every employee of
every State, determine each individual to be an aggressor, and then
generalize from the individual to the institution. On the contrary, the
State is assessed first, qua institution, according to constant
structural features inhering in all governments. This institutional
analysis leads to the anarchist insight, after which particular
individuals within the State are considered to be part of a "criminal
gang" owing to their participation in the exercise of State power.
</p>

<p>To put it another way: for anarchism, the individual does not
taint the institution; rather, the institution taints the individuals
who work within it. It is because the nature of the State as an
institution renders it irredeemably invasive that we condemn particular
offices within the State apparatus, and hence particular individuals
who occupy those offices. Such individuals "aid and abet" State
injustice, even though they may not personally commit aggressive acts.
</p>

<p>It is necessary to understand that the institutional analysis
sketched here is vital to all theories of anarchism, including
political anarchism. This kind of institutional analysis must be valid
if anarchism is to have a solid footing. It is simply impossible for
anarchists to derive anarchism from the inductive method described
above. It is patently impossible to examine the personal motives and
goals of all individuals who comprise "the State" before we can pass
judgment on the State itself. In addition, if this research were
undertaken, we would find that the vast majority of State employees
never intend to aggress against others, nor do they participate
directly in aggressive acts. The inductive method never permits us to
bridge the gap between individuals and institutions. Indeed, from a
purely inductive perspective, there is no "State." Only individuals
exist and act; there are no institutions. The State, then, is a
fiction, and it is nonsense to refer to the "State" as "invasive" or
"aggressive." Only individuals can invade or aggress; and although some
individuals within that organization we call the "State" may personally
aggress, the vast majority do not. To condemn the State per se,
therefore, as the anarchist wishes to do � and by implication to
condemn all individuals within the State � is flagrantly unjust. It is
to besmirch the good names of innumerable State employees who never
personally engage in aggression.
</p>

<p>This methodological objection to anarchism is important, and
anarchists, as I have indicated, will be unable to respond adequately
unless they defend the approach I have described as institutional
analysis. The coherence of anarchism as a theory hangs on this kind of
analysis.
</p>

<p>Why is this relevant to the debate over voting? Because it
illustrates that the presumption, and therefore the burden of proof,
varies according to whether the voluntaryist addresses a minarchist or
a political anarchist. Since the minarchist need not adopt an
institutional analysis, he will not view the fact that an individual is
an agent of the State as even prima facie evidence of improper conduct.
There is, for the minarchist, no moral "curse" on the State as such,
which then filters down to individuals within the State. Working for
the State, in other words, does not constitute a presumption of guilt.
The individual is presumed "innocent" until proven otherwise, despite
his institutional affiliations.
</p>

<p>This is why the minarchist is a difficult convert to
<a href='/fundamentals/introduction.html'>voluntaryism</a>. Usually the minarchist must be brought first to
anarchism, which requires that he accept an institutional analysis of
the State, and only then to voluntaryism. The procedural chasm dividing
voluntaryists from minarchists is so wide that this intermediate step
is ordinarily required. The burden of proof falls upon the anarchist to
establish the soundness of this intermediate step.

</p>

<p>But the situation changes when the voluntaryist addresses a
political anarchist. Here the anarchist insight � the recognition of
the State per se as an invasive institution � is agreed upon by all
parties before the argument over voting even commences. Both disputants
utilized institutional analysis in order to arrive at their current
positions. It is plainly inconsistent, therefore, for the political
anarchist to reject voluntaryism because it employs institutional
analysis. It <a href='/howibecame/mysteriousways.html'>borders</a> on hypocrisy for the political anarchist to fall
back upon the personal intentions of his favorite politicians in order
to save them from the anarchist curse, when he has traveled merrily
down the anarchist road without ever having regarded personal
intentions as significant before this point. If an institutional
analysis of the State is good enough to get us to anarchism, then it is
good enough to get us to voluntaryism. Institutional analysis is not a
bridge that can be conveniently burned by the political anarchist after
he has used it to cross over to anarchism.
</p>

<p>It is because of their common acceptance of the anarchist
insight that the initial presumption shifts in favor of the
voluntaryist. The voluntaryist and the political anarchist agree that
the State is inherently aggressive. From this it follows that anyone
who voluntarily joins the State � who campaigns for office, receives a
salary, swears allegiance to the State, and so forth � is at least
highly suspect from an anarchist point of view. There is a presumption,
a prima facie case, against the political office-holder in anarchist
theory (and thus against voting for a political office). The burden
then falls not upon the voluntaryist to show how this office-holder
participates in aggression � for both disputants already agree that the
State is inherently aggressive and both accept vicarious liability �
but upon the political anarchist to show how his favorite office-holder
constitutes a valid exception to the general condemnation (the
anarchist curse) of the State and its agents.
</p>

<p>Anarchists agree that the State is necessarily aggressive,
which is why they commonly use terms like "criminal gang" and "ruling
class" to describe the State. But anarchists also realize that the
State is not a disembodied entity. Institutions are not individuals;
they cannot act in any fashion, much less act aggressively. Thus, if
the anarchist analysis of the State is to have meaning, it must refer
to individuals who work within the structure of the State apparatus.
Individuals and their actions, considered within a broader
institutional framework (prescribed goals, rules, and procedures),
combine to form what anarchists mean by the State. Particular offices
within the State, and the individuals who occupy those offices, are
assessed according to their importance in directing, supporting, and
furthering the institutionalized goals of State power.
</p>

<p>It is because anarchists regard the State as inherently
aggressive that there exists a presumption among anarchists that anyone
who joins the State participates in this aggression. The anarchist
curse � the presumption of evil � descends from the condemned
institution to the individuals who are necessary to maintain the life
of that institution. The institution is the skeleton, in effect, which
requires the flesh and blood of real people to operate. These people
are highly suspect in anarchist eyes, even if they do not personally
aggress, because they are the components required to translate the
institutional aggression of the State into concrete reality.
</p>

<p>The anarchist presumption against agents of the State, like all
presumptions, is defeasible. It may be that the political anarchist can
argue for a valid exception to the general rule. He may be able to
explain why we should regard all politicians as members of a criminal
gang, except those politicians with "good" (i.e., libertarian)
intentions. Personal intentions were not previously considered relevant
to the anarchist analysis of the State, but the political anarchist may
have uncovered new information that will convince his voluntaryist
colleague. The political anarchist may thus be able to overcome the
presumption, the anarchist curse, that makes his case seem initially
implausible. (The idea of an "anarchist politician" does seem
counter-intuitive at best.)
</p>

<p>In our dispute between the voluntaryist and the political
anarchist, therefore, the presumption is on the side of voluntaryism,
and the political anarchist assumes the burden of proof. Anarchists of
all persuasions have traditionally rejected <a href='/nonvoting/index.html'>electoral politics</a>, and
with good reason. This seems, after all, to be an essential part of
what anarchism means. This is why I wrote in Party Dialogue ("The
Voluntaryist Series," no. 1) that "libertarianism must stand firm
against all Senators, all Presidents, and so forth, because these
offices and the legal power they embody are indispensable features of
the State apparatus. After all, what can it possibly mean to oppose the
State unless one opposes particular offices and institutions in which
State power manifests itself? "
</p>

<p>With the preceding introduction material, we are now able to
undertake a systematic analysis of voting. Some of the issues discussed
thus far raise problems far too complex to be resolved without further
discussion. These will be addressed in more detail in subsequent parts
of this essay.
