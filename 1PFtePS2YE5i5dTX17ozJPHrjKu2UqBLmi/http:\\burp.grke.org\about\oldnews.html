There is still a bug in the Windows strip_vss/split_vss options in burp-1.3.22.
Files that change on Windows are truncated in the backup. If you are using
either of those options, it is recommended that you turn them off until the
next release of burp.

  * When syslogging, do not prepend a date to the log message.
  * Don't count phase 2 counters twice when resuming.
  * Ignore files in clientconfdir starting with '.' or ending with '~', as
    these are hidden or temporary files.
  * Fix bug where the client_can_* options were not being overridden in the
    client specific conf files.
  * Fix bug that stopped client_can_restore=0 working.
  * Scan the manifest before restore/verify so that counters and status
    monitor can show estimates.
  * Add verify/restore notifications.
  * Fix Windows batch file IF/ELSE syntax in Windows autoupgrade script.
  * Have the server send the client the counters when resuming.
  * Have the server send the client the counters when verifying/restoring, so
    that it knows what to expect.

  * Do not skip restores of sockets.
  * Add server_can_restore=[0|1] client side option, so that clients can refuse
    server initiated restores.

    installer.
  * Indicate to the server post script whether there was an error.
  * Indicate to the server post script whether a timed backup was attempted.

  * Have separate CA directories for the client and server. Make 'make install'
    create the directory /etc/burp/CA-client.
  * Make compile succeed when there is no libncurses library.
  * Add 'client_can_force_backup' option, defaulted to on. Turning it off means

<FONT COLOR="#99CCFF">2012-03-31: burp-1.3.2 is released.
<pre>
Changes in burp-1.3.2:
  * Add options for the client to automatically generate a certificate signing
    request, have the server sign and return it, and have the client use the
    new certificate. Remove old default SSL certificates because they should
    no longer be needed.
    See docs/burp_ca.txt for more information.
  * Add ability for conf files to point to more conf files to read.
  * Fix status server segfault when deleting files from clientconfdir.
  * Allow directories in clientconfdir.
  * Add the ability for the server to set the client include/excludes.
  * Simulate browsing backups with the use of "-a l/L -d path".
  * Add ability to set up a restore on the server side.
  * Add ability to specify child processes separately to status child process
    with new max_status_children option.
  * Status monitor - make keypresses more responsive.
  * Fix bug where old clients that didn't leave an incexc file on the server
    meant that resume would not start.
  * Add 'include_ext' option, which excludes all files unless their names end
    in the given extension.
  * Fall back to using the client or server name if ssl_peer_cn is unset on the
    server or client.
  * Don't try to chuser/chgrp in the child if the user/group settings are the
    same as the parent (fixes bug where setting user/group in the server
    wouldn't work, because it would try to chuser/chgrp twice).
  * Windows installer: add comment about poll interval '0' means that the
    scheduled job isn't installed.
  * Windows installer: don't install the scheduled task when doing an upgrade.
  * Unlock the client directory after server_script_post has run instead of
    before.
  * Fix bug where the wrong arg count was being given to the server post
    script.
  * Make sure status snapshot exits when there are no backup clients.
  * Ability to dump logs and paths in backups using '-a S' (useful for making
    a gui that browses backup contents).
  * Bug fixes to ssl_extra_checks_script.
  * Bug fix: initialise network_timeout properly.
  * Fix typos in docs/burp_ca.txt.
  * Add 'export LANG=C' to the timer script, so that timer_arg days are always
    expected in English.
  * Add config file option to turn syslog logging on/off.
  * Bug fix for 'compression = gzip[0-9]'.
  * Pass the server version to the client.

<FONT COLOR="#99CCFF">2012-01-27: burp-1.3.1 is released.
<pre>
Changes in burp-1.3.1:
  * EFS support on Windows.
  * Move to using mingw-w64 for both 32bit and 64bit Windows builds.
  * Add 'exclude_fs =' option for Linux so that you can skip partitions
    types (for example, tmpfs) without generating warnings.
  * If recovery method 'resume' is set, but the includes/excludes change,
    switch to 'use', then start a new backup.
  * In the tests, check to see whether it looks like the server has finished
    the backup before moving on, rather than just waiting a set amount of time.
  * Add man pages for bedup and burp_ca.
  * Remove embedded uthash code. It will need to be installed as a dependency.
    For example, in Debian, you might run 'apt-get install uthash-dev'.
  * Add Bas van den Dikkenberg's tweaks for getting burp into official Debian
    and Ubuntu repositories. Burp is now in debian sid and ubuntu precise.
  * Make the server tell the client what extra_comms features it supports, so
    that, in future, old servers are more likely to work with new clients.
  * Improve 'make clean'.
  * Add option to strip off leading path components on restore.
  * Fix segfault that was happening on the server when SSL_accept() failed.
  * Move burp and bedup to /usr/sbin (you need to check that any cron jobs
    are pointing there too).
  * Moved list of things to do to https://github.com/grke/burp/issues

Changes in burp-1.3.0:
  * Add a mechanism for automatically upgrading clients.

    properly.
  * Fix rounding problem in remaining time estimation in the status monitor.
  * Don't backup the whole file if only ctime changed.
  * Include the client name in arguments to server scripts.
  * Do not log a message in the server SIGCHLD handler, as this appeared to
    be causing an occasional lock up on a Ubuntu server.
  * Upgrade Windows depkgs to latest versions of openssl.
  * Make Windows uninstall work.
  * Add 'allow autoupgrade' option to a second screen on the Windows installer.
  * Add 'max_storage_subdirs' option, and default it to 30000.

  * Set environment variables from SSL cert details so that the server-side
    scripts can see them.
  * Add Jason Haar's server script for doing extra SSL certificate checks.
  * Add 'max_hardlinks' option, which limits the number of times a single file
    is hardlinked in storage. Default is 10000.
  * Add '-i' option: print an index table of symbols that humans may see burp
    produce, and exit.
  * Let backups carry on when files cannot be opened.
  * Spot Windows EFS directories and files and warn about them.
  * Add an 'estimate' option (-a e), which does a scan of the file system to
    be backed up, and prints counters, without contacting the server.
  * Strip out 744 lines of unused Windows code.
  * Fix possible segfault when backup directory forward paths don't match.
  * Removed working_dir_recovery_method=merge. Use 'resume' instead.
  * Add a flexible way of passing new fields from the client to the server so
    that clients are less likely to have to upgrade.

    didn't previously exist.
  * Fix possible segfault when resume mode triggers with nothing to resume.

Changes in burp-1.2.0:
  * Improvements to the counters and status monitor - remember the phase1
    scan counters for later phases to use for things like estimated times.

    client needs to be is now this release.

    you need to upgrade your clients).

    anticipation of a 'verify' command.

    IMPORTANT IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM AN OLDER VERSION OF BURP:
    a) Your previous backups will no longer work, due to changes in the
    manifest files. You will also need to move old backups aside in order to
    continue to make new backups.
    b) Your old config files will need some fields to do with SSL added to them.
    See the man page and the examples in the 'configs' directory for help.

    IMPORTANT FOR MY ENCOURAGEMENT AND THE FUTURE OF BURP:
    If you have tried burp, I really want to hear from you to find out what 
    you like about it, what you don't like, what new features you would like,
    how you have been using it, whether it has helped you, or anything that
    you would like to tell me. I am currently working in the dark!
