Traffic in Frenetic HCMC, Vietnam
from Rob Whitworth Plus 2 years ago All Audiences
Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) is an amazing up and coming city. This time lapse is a culmination of 10,000 RAW images and multiple shoots capturing some of the cities relentless energy and pace of change.
Everyone who has visited Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam knows part of the magic (love it or hate it) is in the traffic. Ever since I first set foot in HCMC I have been captivated by the cities energy. Saigon is a city on the move unlike anything I have experienced before which I wanted to capture and share.
Thanks to everyone who helped with the film and thanks also to the numerous kind people who allowed me access to some amazing locations.
The soundtrack is the energetic Mondo'77 by Looper - itunes.apple.com/ca/artist/looper/id3266548
