I really don't think it takes much to torpedo the value with the intention of buying low.  You just have to be confidant that the value will go back up, which may also be a product of market manipulation.  I'm staying the hell away.<br /><br />For a product which professes to be a revolution in payments, it's only really proven useful as a vehicle for speculation.

The open source implementation maintained by volunteers fixed it in the reference implementation was fixed a year ago. Yet Mt Gox, a profit making entity with paid developers, couldn't find the time to fix their implementation.

              Something is very strange with this exchange. If someone is holding your money and they tell you that they can only release a fraction of it at a time (or none at all, as is the case right now)... you should be very cautious. It would not surprise me one bit if they actually no longer had access to the assets that they claim they control.  Good luck to everyone who still needs to get their bitcoins out of Mt. Gox.

              &quot;Something is very strange with this exchange. If someone is holding your money and they tell you that they can only release a fraction of it at a time (or none at all, as is the case right now)... you should be very cautious. It would not surprise me one bit if they actually no longer had access to the assets that they claim they control.&quot; <br /><br />All very good reasons not to leave your Bitcoins in an exchange. The entire system is still in beta, and really, crises like this one is more the expected result than a genuine surprise and cause for dismay.  Basically, I think the management at Mt. Gox is responsible and honest, albeit a tad incompetent, but there are so many factors that are beyond their complete control. It's sad that when the going gets rough like this people don't know and/or don't remember all the ways Mt. Gox has done a superlatively good job of being the first Bitcoin exchange.  If you meander around some of the bitcoin forums, you often see snarky remarks from people who wish everybody else could just keep a lid on it until the problems get sorted out.  I'm quite sure that when all the dust settles, every single Bitcoin deposited to Mt. Gox will still be there and available for its rightful owner to withdraw.<br /><br />Still, depending on how possessive you are of your money, keeping it in a Bitcoin exchange at this stage of the game is more than a tad risky.  Me, I keep mine in several identical flash drives that are disconnected from any computer 99.9% of the time (a modern day equivalent of stashed under a mattress), with only very small amounts of my BTC in a hot wallet at any one time, or larger amounts for vanishing small amounts of time.  Exchanges have their uses, but not for holding deposits, in my opinion.  Maybe someday, but we aren't there yet.

              &quot;The 'problem on their end' was using a non-unique ID as a unique ID. Nothing more, nothing less. &quot;<br /><br />And they knew what sort of problems this would cause when the developers changed the algorithms to only recognize transaction IDs with no padding zeros - in 2011 - and everyone else updated their code to reflect this change.  Yes, Mt. Gox is a little lax and guilty of not keeping their eye on the birdie, but nothing worse than that.

              While the price on Mt Gox continues to fall as their users scramble for the door, what I find interesting is that other exchanges such as Bitstamp appear to have been only moderately affected by the ongoing implosion of Mt Gox. This could be a sign that if Mt Gox actually goes bankrupt, other exchanges will have no problem carrying on without them. <br /><br />It will be very interesting to see what happens when a real U.S. based exchange comes online once the regulations get sorted out.

When the price drops like that no one wants to sell their Bitcoins to you at the market price and as the market is small the exchanges cannot just magic a customer out of no where. Recently people were wanting £100 over the market price (25%) which meant there would be no quick profits on the way back up as you effectivley starting at a 25% loss.

Do exchanges even have a best practices checklist to develop against? <br /><br />This type of problem is exactly the type that slips past back end developers without real world guidance to mitigate the risks.

As full disclosure, I don't own any bitcoins, but it really kills me to see anyone disparage something they don't understand, or spreading around misinformation. <br /><br />Info on how the protocol actually works:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://qz.com/154877/by-reading-this-page-you-are-mining-bitcoins/">http://qz.com/154877/by-reading-this-pa ... -bitcoins/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Info on transaction malleability:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_Malleability">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_Malleability</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Transaction malleability is the reality that at any time someone can try to defraud the Bitcoin network by manipulating transactions. The end goal as well as the methods of attack may vary, such as getting more bitcoins for yourself, making the value of BTC tank, or double spending, but in the end the outcome is the same: someone creates false transactions or modifies existing ones and sends them out to the network. <br /><br />Let's say that Alice is a right old fraud and tries to double spend. Alice sends one bitcoin to Bob. She then maliciously tries to send the very same bitcoin to Charlie by sending that transaction to a different part of the Bitcoin network (this is technically not correct as there's no such thing as a bitcoin, just records of transaction, but the simplification is for illustrative purposes only). The nodes to which she sends her transaction with Bob start processing that transaction, while the nodes to which she sends her transaction with Charlie start processing that transaction. As you may have read in my first link, since each block in the blockchain is linked to the previous block, this causes a fork in the blockchain. The protocol dictates that the fork that miners choose to continue gets processed and is considered the actual chain of events, while the other fork becomes orphaned and is ignored (side note: this is why someone having 50% of the mining power, like Ghash.IO, is a big deal.. they could overpower the network and continue the fraudulent fork of the blockchain). In the end, it is of little consequence whether the network chooses Alice's transaction with Bob or Charlie as the &quot;valid&quot; transaction. The end result ends up being the same: the 1 BTC that Alice tried to send to Bob and Charlie only gets sent to one or the other, not both. The other transaction gets orphaned, and either Bob or Charlie goes and asks Alice why she hasn't paid them yet. This is just an example of how the network deals with double spending, but the protocol uses this same process for weeding out and eliminating any type of fraud, including transaction malleability.<br /><br />This becomes important when you consider the software systems that Mt. Gox and other exchanges use. You must remember Mt. Gox doesn't have a human sitting behind a computer and clicking a &quot;send&quot; button when someone wants to withdraw BTC. There is a complex software system responsible for the payouts. The idea of transaction malleability becomes a big deal because using the right sequence of events, you can trick the system into thinking it hasn't given you your BTC yet, when in reality it has. In the end, the malicious transactions one sends to the Bitcoin network are discarded, but since Mt. Gox operates somewhat like a bank, having a huge reserve of bitcoins that it gives to people when they want to withdraw, it is possible to exploit software vulnerabilities to the point where you drain Mt. Gox's coffers to nil.<br /><br />If you're not a fan of the Bitcoin protocol, fine. I don't own any and certainly won't until the currency is actually used like a currency and not a speculative medium. Regardless, the protocol is robust and is an impressive piece of software engineering and it's a bit of a slight to keep implying that there is a flaw in the protocol. The proof of work system does a very good job at weeding out fraud and double spending. It was Mt. Gox that dropped the ball with their software design, not the Bitcoin protocol.

You're welcome to avoid using them, but if you're going to criticize them you at least need to pick some problems that are Bitcoin-specific.

              This is all complete bullshit. When are they going to address the delays in withdrawing money via wire transfer? I've been waiting 4 fucking months now, with no real explanation for the delay. There's something fishy going on with Mt. Gox. They used to be adequate.

              &quot;A fractional reserve foreign currency exchange... what could go wrong?&quot;<br /><br />What makes you so sure Mt. Gox is a fractional reserve?  I don't see them doing any lending, or otherwise relinquishing control of the BTC in their custody in any way. So far as I can tell, every customer expecting to withdraw the BTC they have deposited at Mt. Gox will get all of them, as soon as the software issues are resolved.  Even if every single customer asks to withdraw every single Bitcoin. Perhaps I'm wrong about some or all of this, but if so I would truly like to know what and how.

Gox is a fractional reserve?  I don't see them doing any lending, or otherwise relinquishing control of the BTC in their custody in any way. So far as I can tell, every customer expecting to withdraw the BTC they have deposited at Mt. Gox will get all of them, as soon as the software issues are resolved.  Even if every single customer asks to withdraw every single Bitcoin. Perhaps I'm wrong about some or all of this, but if so I would truly like to know what and how.</div><br /><br />Sorry for the confusion, that was an attempt at sarcasm. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />They aren't fractional reserve, but if they've lost a ton of bitcoin it could amount to the same thing. That's just speculation though, we don't know right now how much they've actually lost. If there are losses, I hope they're small for the sake of their users.

Have you read <span style="font-style: italic">anything </span>about bitcoin besides this article?  If you had, then you'd already know that the system is NOT &quot;opaque,&quot; but completely transparent.  Anyone can audit the blockchain; all transactions are public and completely visible. There isn't anything at all &quot;opaque&quot; about the bitcoin protocol. You sound like you need some help.
