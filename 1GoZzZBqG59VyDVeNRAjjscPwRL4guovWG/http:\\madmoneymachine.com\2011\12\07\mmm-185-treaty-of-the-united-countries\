<li>Something different for this episode!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>Imagine that a group of respected people from various <strong>Countries</strong> got together recently at some <strong>National</strong> <strong>Summit</strong> meeting (let&#8217;s say, in Philadelphia) for the explicit purpose of modifying their previous UN treaties and agreements with each other. At the outset of the <strong>Summit</strong>, it was declared that no one was allowed to talk about the <strong>Summit</strong> outside the meeting. They met for four months, in a closed <strong>Summit</strong> hall, in complete secrecy. But instead of doing what they said they were going to do and modify previous agreements, they cleverly decided to create a completely new <strong>Treaty</strong> of the United <strong>Countries</strong>, seeking to establish a single world government comprised of legislatures, judges, and even a president of the world.</p>
<p>The people who met at the <strong>Summit</strong> decided that in order for this new United <strong>Countries</strong> <strong>Treaty</strong> to come into being, that 9/13ths of the <strong>Countries</strong> would need to sign it. But instead of requiring signatures from the various legislatures, it just asked for signatures from special <strong>Country</strong> <strong>Summits</strong>.  At the end of the Philadelphia <strong>Summit</strong>, even though not everyone at the <strong>Summit</strong> agreed on the wording or ideas in the <strong>Treaty</strong>, they stated that the attendees &#8220;having written the <strong>Treaty</strong> decided unanimously to send it to the <strong>Countries</strong> for approval.&#8221; Heh heh, get it? They decided unanimously <em>to send it</em>. Clever. Thinking this would confuse ratifiers into believing the <strong>Treaty</strong> was unanimously agreed to. The wording of their new <strong>Treaty</strong> began with the phrase, &#8220;We the people of the Unified <strong>Countries</strong>…&#8221; But shouldn&#8217;t it have read, &#8220;We the <strong>countries</strong> of the Unified <strong>Countries</strong>?&#8221;</p>
<p>The people in favor of the new <strong>Treaty</strong> decided to take the name &#8220;<strong>Nationalists</strong>&#8221; for themselves and for everyone who agreed with this new world government, even though &#8220;<strong>Globalists</strong>&#8221; might have been a more accurate name. They called anyone that disagreed with them &#8220;Anti-<strong>Nationalists</strong>.&#8221; (Clever!) After their <strong>Summit</strong>, three of the key authors of the <strong>Treaty</strong> wrote Op-Eds in the New York Times under pseudonyms so that no one knew they were the <strong>Treaty&#8217;s</strong> authors. Clever! Their goal was to convince the <strong>Countries</strong> to agree to the <strong>Treaty</strong>. The 85 articles they wrote came to be called, &#8220;The <strong>Nationalist</strong>&#8221; or &#8220;The <strong>Nationalist</strong> Papers.&#8221;</p>
<p>In them they said that this new &#8220;<strong>National</strong> Government&#8221; was needed to combat a common threat. They didn&#8217;t specify the threat exactly, but perhaps it was a global environmental threat or astroid collision or lone-wolf terrorists or threat of alien invasion.  Whatever it was, this threat was a CRISIS! The <strong>Countries</strong> must act immediately to ratify the <strong>Treaty</strong>. Some even begged that time need not be taken to debate the <strong>Treaty</strong> in detail, just agree to it and trust the respected people of the <strong>Summit</strong> that it is the right thing to do for the <strong>Countries</strong>.</p>
<p>Some of the articles in the <strong>Treaty</strong> stated that they would need to impose taxes to fund a defense against the threat. A militant force would be assembled to fight the threat. Land for a headquarters of 10 square miles would have to be established. There was a clause that said that the new <strong>National</strong> Government could enact laws that were &#8220;necessary and proper&#8221; for executing their powers. Another one said that the new Congress would have the power to &#8220;promote the general welfare&#8221; of the United <strong>Countries</strong>.</p>
<p>Some things not explicitly stated in the <strong>Treaty</strong> would happen anyway: People would be employed to collect the taxes.  A <strong>World</strong> police would come about to enforce the collection of taxes. After some time, agencies would eventually rise such as the <strong>National</strong> Bureau of Investigation (NBI), <strong>World</strong> Security Agency (<strong>W</strong>SA),  The <strong>World</strong> Guard, External Revenue Service (ERS), <strong>World</strong> Reconnaissance Office (<strong>W</strong>RO), <strong>National</strong> Emergency Management Association (<strong>N</strong>EMA), Department of <strong>World</strong> Education, Department of <strong>World</strong> Energy, et cetera…</p>
<p>Eventually, this new <strong>National</strong> Government would grow so large as to make the governments of the individual <strong>Countries</strong> somewhat meaningless. If a <strong>Country&#8217;s</strong> police did not enforce by the new &#8220;<strong>National</strong>&#8221; laws, the <strong>N</strong>BI would be brought in to sweep down and arrest the offenders.</p>
<p>As time went on, the people would eventually forget that the <strong>Treaty</strong> was supposed to restrict the size of the <strong>National</strong> Government.</p>
<p>The Anti-<strong>Nationalists</strong> lost their argument, and the people of the <strong>World</strong> lost their liberty.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>GURU Roulette:</p>
<p>The following is a letter, written by one of the Summit attendees, an anti-nationalist, to his country&#8217;s ratifying convention:</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Gentlemen,</p>
<p>I am honored to enclose, pursuant to my commission, the <strong>Treaty</strong> proposed by the <strong>National</strong> <strong>Summit</strong>.</p>
<p>I did not agree with the system and I will submit my objections to the honorable legislature.</p>
<p>It was painful for me, on a subject of such <strong>global</strong> importance, to disagree with the respected members who signed the <strong>Treaty</strong>. But I believed that the <strong>World&#8217;s</strong> liberties were not secured by the new system and that it was my duty to oppose it.</p>
<p>Here are my main objections to the plan:</p>
<ol>
<li>The people are not adequately represented.</li>
<li>They have no security for the right of an election.</li>
<li>Some powers of the legislative branch are ambiguous, and others are indefinite and dangerous.</li>
<li>The executive branch is blended with, and will have an undue influence over, the legislature.</li>
<li>The judicial branch will be oppressive</li>
<li>Regulations of the highest importance can be formed by the President, with the advice of two-thirds of a quorum of the Senate</li>
<li>The system does not have the security of a Bill of Rights.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are objections do not apply to just a specific locality, they apply equally to all of the countries.</p>
<p>Since the <strong>Summit&#8217;s</strong> purpose was for “the sole and express purpose of revising existing agreements, and reporting to Congress and the several legislatures, the alterations and provisions that will render the <strong>National</strong> <strong>Treaty</strong> adequate to the needs of government and the preservation of the Union of <strong>countries</strong>,” I did not imagine that these powers extended to the formation of the proposed plan. But the <strong>Summit</strong> had a different opinion, so I reluctantly accepted it, being fully convinced that in order to preserve the Union, an efficient government was absolutely necessary, and that it would be difficult to make proper amendments to the existing agreements.</p>
<p>The proposed system has few, if any, <strong>national</strong> features. Instead, it is a system of <strong>global</strong> government. Nevertheless, in many respects, I think it has great merit, and, by proper amendments, could be adapted to the “needs of government and preservation of liberty.”</p>
<p>The question on this plan involves others of the highest importance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Will the <strong>UN</strong> be closed down?</li>
<li>Will the <strong>national</strong> governments be changed so much that they will effectively be dissolved?</li>
<li>In lieu of the <strong>UN</strong> and <strong>national</strong> governments, will the proposed <strong>global</strong> <strong>Treaty</strong> be substituted in their place without any amendment?</li>
</ol>
<p>Never, perhaps, were a people called upon to decide a question of greater magnitude. If the citizens of the <strong>world</strong> adopt the plan as it now stands, their liberties may be lost. But if they reject it altogether, anarchy might result. It is clear, therefore, that their decision should not be made hurriedly. The subject should be well understood. Otherwise, they might have to refuse to support the government after having hastily accepted it.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether they are for or against the <strong>Treaty</strong>, if discussions about it remain moderate, they will provide a great deal of information and the result will be a happy one.</p>
<p>Some may urge that we have total confidence in the <strong>Summit</strong>. But no matter how respectable the members may be who signed the <strong>Treaty</strong>, only a free people are the proper guardians of their rights and liberties. The greatest men can make mistakes, and their mistakes are sometimes the largest.</p>
<p>Other people might assume that the <strong>Treaty</strong> can be safely adopted because of the provisions it contains to amend it. But can’t this better be done before it is ratified than after it? Should free people really adopt a form of government knowing that it needs amendment?</p>
<p>Some others might think that if the people do not adopt the plan, that they will not unite in another plan. But surely, while they still have the power to amend it, they do not need to completely reject it.</p>
<p>I have been delayed here longer than I expected, but will leave here in a day or two for <strong>America</strong>. When I arrive, I will submit the basis for my objections (if required by the legislature).</p>
<p>I will only add that, since the welfare of the Union requires a better <strong>Treaty</strong> than the <strong>UN Treaty</strong>, I believe it is my duty as a citizen of <strong>America</strong> to support whatever is finally adopted, sincerely hoping that it will secure the liberty and happiness of the <strong>world</strong>.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>E. Gerry.</p>
