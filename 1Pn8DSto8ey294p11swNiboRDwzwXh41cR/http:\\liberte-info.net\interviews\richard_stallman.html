        <p> <strong>Can you tell us about yourself?</strong><br />
          I am Richard Stallman, founder of the free (libre) software movement.
          In 1984 I launched the development of a complete operating system,
          called GNU, whose goal is to be entirely free software (see <a href="http://www.gnu.org" target="_blank">gnu.org</a>).<br />
          GNU is widely used, but its users mostly don't know they are using GNU
          because they think it is Linux. (See          <span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT27"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html</a></span> and          <span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT28"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html</a></span>.)<br />
          <br />
          <strong>In 1980, your struggle against abusive power (that of some
          companies) started with the poorly designed proprietary software driver of a printer... can you explain to us how software companies
          have used proprietary software to expand at the expense of computer
          users' freedom?<br />
          </strong>
          A proprietary program (<em>privateur, parce qu'il prive de liberté</em>) is in
          itself an attack on users' freedom.<br />
          With software, either the users control the program or the program
          controls the users. The first case is free software; the second case
          is proprietary software.<br />
          With proprietary software, the developer controls the program and the
          program controls the users. As a result, the program is an instrument
          of unjust power: power of the developer over the users of the program.<br />
          This is an injustice in itself, but it is also the basis for further
          injustice. In many widely used nonfree programs, the developers have
          made intentional malfeatures for surveillance or restriction of the
          users. There are even back doors, which can do nasty things to the
          user based on commands received from others (the user has no say).<br />
          Specific malfeatures are known in Windows, MacOS, the iThings, Flash
          Player, the Playstation 3 (see <a href="http://www.boycottsony.org" target="_blank">boycottsony.org</a>), the Amazon Kindle
          Swindle (see <a href="http://www.DefectiveByDesign.org" target="_blank">DefectiveByDesign.org</a>), and most portable phones. Other
          proprietary programs might have them too -- we are blocked from
          checking them.<br />
          The only known defense against malicious features installed in a
          program by the developer is for the users to have control over the
          program. In other words, free software.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>The accumulation of power by some of those companies has made them
          much bigger (in terms of revenues) than many countries (Apple's 2012 revenues reached $108 billion, the equivalent of Morocco's GDP of the  <br />
          same year). This provides them with a significant lobbying power. In
          the same time the Free Software movement has won several fights, like
          (although only partially) the one against DRM technology. How would
          you describe the balance of power between those companies and the Free
          Software movement today, and what are the areas where the fight is the
          most critical?<br />
          </strong>
          I am unable to answer the first question, because I have no way to
          measure those companies' power or the free software community's
          strength.  However, I can tell you the areas where we face the most
          difficult obstacles:<br />
          - Device drivers and firmware.  Many manufacturers often sell you a
          device but refuse to tell you how to use it.  Writing free
          replacements for these is difficult when the hardware interfaces are
          secret.<br />
          - Secret interfaces ought to be a scandal, but most computer users
          are so accustomed to being spit on by computer companies that they
          can't imagine complaining.<br />
          - Secret data formats used by nonfree software.<br />
          -  Some areas where progress is slow because they are very hard; for
          instance, speech recognition software.<br />
          - Schools that require or encourage use of proprietary software,
          effectively directing their students into dependence.<br />

          <br />
          <strong> The constitutions of today's democracies date back to several
            decades, if not a couple of centuries, a time when the importance of
            information technology was far from trivial. Can we attribute some
            people's indecisiveness and skepticism surrounding digital freedoms in
            relation to democracy to the fact that nothing is explicitly mentioned
            about it in these old constitutions?<br />
            </strong>
          I don't know how much influence constitutions have on the strength of
          public demand for freedom, but they do have an effect on laws that can
          affirm freedom or deny freedom.<br />
          Most of the issues of freedom raised by digital technology are not
          inherently tied to a specific kind of technology. They may concern
          threats to human rights that technology made possible. It is best for
          the constitution to avoid mention of specific kinds of technology
          as much as possible.<br />
          <br />
          <strong> Should we think of constitutions as programs that need patching and
            upgrading every few decades, or can we hope that a certain
            constitution will protect a country's citizens forever (as it may be 
            sometimes believed)?<br />
            </strong>
          I don't think we should expect any constitution to be perfect. The
          enemies of democracy from time to time find a new way to grab power
          they should not have, or undermine previously respected human rights.<br />
          Then we have to fight to rescue human rights and democracy from their
          grip. Sometimes (though not always) this requires amending the
          constitution. It is normal to do that; that is why they have
          amendment procedures.<br />
          For instance, the US Supreme Court ruled a couple of years ago that
          corporations are entitled to the human rights guaranteed by the US
          constitution. There is now a campaign, which I support, for a
          constitutional amendment to reverse that decision.<br />
          However, we should not look for ways to change the text of a
          constitution merely because time has passed since it was written.<br />
          <br />
          <strong> Do you think that aspiring democracies like Tunisia and Egypt have
            a unique chance to implement information technology's specifics and
            importance in their new constitutions?<br />
            </strong>
          My proposals for constitutions are in          <span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT31"><a target="_blank" href="http://stallman.org/articles/constitution-suggestions.html">http://stallman.org/articles/constitution-suggestions.html</a></span>. As
          you can see, I have tried to focus on issues rather than a specific
          technology. One of the suggestions explicitly refers to &quot;information
          technology&quot;; in the others, I was able to avoid mentioning technology.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>One of the reasons cited behind the Arab Spring revolution, which
            started in Tunisia, is the fact that Tunisian activists knew - thanks,
            amongst other things, to Wikileaks' revelations - that the US  <br />
            government would not stand with former dictator Ben Ali in case of a
            row with the (politically neutral) Tunisian military. When compared
            with the Pentagon Papers, these revelations by Wikileaks, part of a  <br />
            massive publication of secret information of public interest, shows
            just how much power can information technology give back to the people. Was it imaginable in the '70s and '80s that information
            technology could have such an enormous impact on global politics and
            democracy?<br />
            </strong>
          How many people must imagine something before it qualifies as &quot;imaginable&quot;?<br />
          In the 70s, Ted Nelson published Dream Machines, which envisaged a
          computer network which everyone would use to publish documents,
          including edited versions of other people's documents, and it would
          show the history of editing the document. This was in the 70s. Those
          who read the book (including me) imagined the idea too.  Other ideas<br />
          along the same lines were imagined as early as the 1930s.<br />
          What I could not imagine at the time was how the hobbyist computers
          of the day might lead to real computers available to most people.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Today, governments and companies still significantly rely on humans
            to perform their tasks. One of the consequences of this is the
            whistleblowing phenomenon, in which individuals witness to illegal,  <br />
            criminal, or simply immoral behavior by their organizations make the
            case public (often after unsuccessfully raising the issue within the
            organization). This phenomenon, which stems from the basic human  <br />
            ability to distinguish right from wrong, insures a certain level of
            morality in government and business practices. What do you think could
            happen if humans in government and business offices keep on gradually <br />
            being replaced by programs, and for that matter proprietary ones? Would we be running toward Dystopia?<br />
            </strong>
          Someone defined bureaucracy as a computing machine made out of human
          parts. Using computers instead of humans does not necessarily make a
          system less ethical; conversely, we can't count on human functionaries
          in governments or businesses to make them ethical. This is why
          whistleblowers are so important and must have public protection.<br />
          Thus, I don't think that the presence of computers in the system
          necessarily makes it worse.  It does, however, facilitate total
          surveillance of everyone's activities, which enables corrupt and
          tyrannical states to crush opposition.  It may turn out that is the
          most important effect of the use of digital technology.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>You run a personal website, <a href="http://stallman.org/" target="_blank">stallman.org</a>, on which you publish
            activist news and invite people to join campaigns. When did you start
            this website, and what was your motivation?<br />
            </strong>
          Around 2000, I recognized that I was somewhat known to the public, and
          felt I ought to make use of that to support campaigns for human rights
          on other issues beyond free software. So I started <a href="http://stallman.org/" target="_blank">stallman.org</a> to
          publish articles and links about those other issues.<br />
          <br />
          <strong> Many in the US, and also outside of the US, have placed enormous
            faith in Obama when he was elected to office in 2008. What is your
            opinion on his presidency so far?<br />
            </strong>
          I did not support Obama; compared with candidates such as Kucinich and
          Nader, Obama was clearly too right-wing. His slogans, &quot;hope&quot; and          &quot;change&quot;, were so vague that they inspired me to feel distrust, which
          his subsequent conduct has justified.
          <br />
          Obama has done more to attack whistleblowers than any previous
          president. He protects torturers and people such as Bush who ordered
          torture; he protects those guilty crimes against the peace, again
          including Bush; the Guantanamo &quot;military tribunals&quot;, obviously unjust,
          are meant to suppress consideration of that torture.<br />
          Obama also protects the banksters from prosecution for massive
          fraudulent foreclosures. He panders to big business at almost every
          opportunity, and only rarely and grudgingly does anything for the
          public interest.<br />
          <br />
          <strong> It seems that, in the last few decades, whoever is elected to the
            White House, the true power lies in the hands of two or three lobbying
            groups, which define (dictate?) foreign policy and more and more the  <br />
            domestic one: the military-complex lobby (which is now expanding in domestic markets and turning them into heavily armed surveillance
            states), the financial lobby, and the colonialist pro-Israeli lobby.  <br />
            Can one still speak of a democratic (as in <em>demos kratos</em>) state when
            talking about the US?<br />
            </strong>
          The US is democratic in form, but its democracy is so sick that it hardly functions.<br />
          The purpose of democracy is for the many non-rich to join together and
          be more powerful than the rich. If it fails to do that, it isn't
          effective democracy. These days, business interests have converted
          the US government into a government of occupation on behalf of the
          empire of the megacorporations.<br />
          The colonialist lobby you refer to is that of the Israeli right wing.
          However, it is not correct to call it the &quot;pro-Israel&quot; lobby; supporting
          Israel (which I do) is not the same as supporting the occupation of
          the West Bank and the siege of Gaza (which I don't).<br />
          <br />
          <strong> Is the widespread belief in 'bipartocracy' - the perceived idea
            that only the alternation between the two main parties can create some
            kind of democracy - also a part of the problem?<br />
            </strong>
          I never heard anyone say that having only two parties is a requisite
          for democracy, or even that it is desirable.  In the US, people
          generally think that having two major parties, which deny other
          parties the chance to get elected, is an unfortunate flaw which nobody
          anticipated.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Are voters trapped in 
            some kind of dogma that reinforces the establishment and prevents new blood from gaining political momentum?<br />
            </strong>
          It isn't a dogma, it is a flaw that results from details of the
          electoral system in the US.  It is almost impossible for a third party
          to get started in the US.  If it is on the left, it would split the
          vote of the Democratic candidate and help a Republican win. Most
          voters who want someone on the left would vote for the Democrat
          instead. A third party on the right would face a similar problem of
          splitting the Republican vote.<br />
          I support the Green Party despite that logic because I consider the
          Democratic Party so right-wing I can't stomach it. Obama is not much
          better than Bush, and I doubt McCain would have been much worse than
          Obama. In other words, the Democratic Party is so bad that it can no
          longer win my support by warning that Republicans might win.<br />
          <br />
          <strong> April 20 2012 has marked the 500th day of detention of Julian
            Assange, despite the fact that he hasn't been charged with anything
            anywhere, not in Sweden, not in the US, not in the UK, not in his home Australia... there is undoubtedly an international conspiracy lead by
            the US that has as an agenda to get him on US soil to face an
            inquisition-like trial (called a Grand Jury) where he wouldn't even
            have the right to defend himself, and where a long prison sentence in
            isolation awaits him, if not worse...<br />
            </strong>
          A grand jury is not a trial at all; it cannot find anyone guilty.
          What it can do is lay charges which can subsequently be judged in a
          trial.<br />
          I think the US wants to imprison Assange by hook or by crook. I don't
          think it will hesitate to lay false charges or use false, coerced
          testimony to prove them. There are unconfirmed reports that the US
          has already used a grand jury to establish such charges against people
          involved in Wikileaks.<br />
          <strong><br />
            ...All this because Wikileaks (of
            which he is the main public figure) revealed the true nature of US
            foreign policy and its relationship with other pseudo-democracies like
            Sweden (for instance regarding CIA rendition flights)... Is it fair to
            say that Assange is the first international prisoner of conscience?<br />
            </strong>
          He's not a prisoner at present, but he may become one. If so, he
          won't be the first international prisoner of conscience. Consider the
          Saudi blogger who published a rather mild statement of disagreement
          with Islam. He was arrested in transit through Malaysia, which sent
          him to Saudi Arabia without an extradition hearing. He now faces<br />
          execution merely for stating his beliefs. It is hard to find a
          nastier example of tyranny than that.<br />
          Freedom of speech means the freedom to criticize, denounce, mock or
          insult any person, any institution, and any belief. It is easy to
          support people's freedom to say things we agree with. The test of our
          support for free speech is what we do when people say things we
          despise.<br />
          <br />
          <strong> Does the free software community work on developing cryptography
            and anonymity tools? Is it seen as a strategic area for the protection of users' privacy, communications, and right to free speech?<br />
            </strong>
          Anonymity and privacy are a major priority for us, because we value
          freedom so highly. Thus, it is no surprise that important privacy
          tools such as <a href="https://www.torproject.org/" target="_blank">TOR</a> have come from the free software community.<br />

          <strong> The hacker group Anonymous (which defines itself more as an idea)
            has become a major player on the international geopolitical scene
            since its operations in protest against the attacks on Wikileaks, and its support of Arab Spring activists in their fight against oppressive 
            regimes. Mainstream media calls Anonymous operations 'attacks'; is it
            the right word, or should we use 'protests' instead?<br />
            </strong>
          Most Anonymous actions involve a lot of people sending many ordinary
          messages to a web server, which therefore becomes overloaded. This is
          the virtual equivalent of a protest on the street at the door of a
          building. That is a normal aspect of democracy, and must be legal.<br />
          Another kind of Anonymous action involves drawing mocking graffiti on
          a web site. That is the virtual equivalent of writing on a poster on
          the wall. It is a normal aspect of democracy and must not be
          prosecuted.<br />
          Most of the organizations that Anonymous takes action against are
          guilty of major crimes against society. We must take account of this
          when we judge the Anonymous actions directed at them.<br />

          <strong> Current copyright laws not only make it harder for people to share
            creative works with each other, but they have created an illegitimate
            accumulation of wealth within publishing and collecting companies at the expense of the artists, who earn a ridiculous share of the revenues. You have made a proposal for an Internet sharing license,
            can you tell us which interests it serves, and how is works?<br />
            </strong>
          Sharing is good, and digital technology makes sharing of published
          works easy. Therefore sharing must be legalized.<br />
          The existing copyright system is supposed to support artists, but it
          does a lousy job of this (except in the case of a few stars).<br />
          This means there are two reasons to reform copyright: so we are free
          to share, and to support non-star artists better. My proposal does
          both. It legalizes sharing (noncommercial redistribution of exact copies),
          whether using the Internet or not.
          <br />
          In addition, it suggests that the state collect taxes each year from
          Internet subscribers, and distribute it among the artists based on
          published rules. The rules would call for measuring the popularity of
          each artist, then giving each artist a share of the annual sum in
          proportion to the cube root of that artist's popularity.<br />
          The cube root is crucial--distribution in linear proportion would give
          too much of the money to stars, wasting that money. With the cube
          root, if A is 1000 times as popular as B, A gets 10 times as much
          money as B. The effect of this is to shift most of the money from the
          stars to the artists of middling popularity--the ones that really need<br />
          better support.
          <br />
          This would be in addition to other income streams for artists, such as
          selling copies, royalties for commercial use of artistic works, and so
          on. My proposal makes no change in those activities.<br />
          <br />
          <strong> Are some countries discussing its adoption?<br />
            </strong>
          Not that I know of, but I am about to propose it again to the
          government of Brazil, which is considering reforming its<br />
          copyright collecting system.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>What are your projects in the near future?<br />
            </strong>
          My work nowadays isn't programming, and usually doesn't take the form
          of projects. The closest thing to a project that I have nowadays is
          an article or an interview such as this one. Mostly my work concerns
          activities that continue for a long time.<br />
          <br />
          <strong> Which laptop computer do you use, and with which operating system?<br />
            </strong>
          I use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemote" target="_blank">Lemote Yeeloong</a>, running the GNU/Linux system; specifically
          the <a href="http://www.gnewsense.org/" target="_blank">gNewSense</a> distribution. See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/distros" target="_blank">gnu.org/distros</a> for a list of the
          GNU+Linux distributions that are entirely free software.<br />
          I chose that machine because all the device drivers are free.
          Even the BIOS is free. <br />
          <br />
          <strong> A last word for our readers?<br />
            </strong>
          For more information about the GNU operating system and its variant,
          GNU/Linux, see <a href="http://www.gnu.org" target="_blank">gnu.org</a>. See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/help" target="_blank">gnu.org/help</a> for a list of ways you can
          contribute (mostly NOT programming).<br />
