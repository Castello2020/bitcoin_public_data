Description
this is where you will find all of my completely free software. both free as in "free speech" and free as in "free beer"!
this project space has been established so we can all help eachother with software development.
in other words, we're here for the learning experience.
i will always give my source code so that you may study it and practice it yourself and/or provide constructive feedback so you can help me learn how I can make improvements.
for a complete list of my software featuring Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD just go to Files.
> https://sourceforge.net/projects/freeware/files/
final note: this learning space assumes that you already have support for **7zip** and **.tar.gz** archives. if you don't, please go get it.
> http://www.7zip.org/
for tar.gz:
1. open the terminal
2. enter "gunzip file.tar.gz"
3. enter "tar -xzvf file.tar"

@tfileme it could be better. i read the code & it could use some major improvements,
some of which would include read-only arguments & full use of the standard c library.
i'll redact the old code once i finish a few other projects
