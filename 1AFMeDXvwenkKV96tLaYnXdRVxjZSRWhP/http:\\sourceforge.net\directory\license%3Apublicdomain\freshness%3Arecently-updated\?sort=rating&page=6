freeware
this is where you will find all of my completely free software. both free as in "free speech" and free as in "free beer"!
this project space has been established so we can all help eachother with software development.
in other words, we're here for the learning experience.
i will always give my source code so that you may study it and practice it yourself and/or provide constructive feedback so you can help me learn how I can make improvements.
for a complete list of my software featuring Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD just go to Files.
> https://sourceforge.net/projects/freeware/files/
final note: this learning space assumes that you already have support for **7zip** and **.tar.gz** archives. if you don't, please go get it.
> http://www.7zip.org/

smib is probably one of the smallest and simpliest computer algebra system in the world, but simple does not mean simplistic. Using smib you can explore many branches of mathematics (e.g. number theory, algebra, calculus, numerical analysis, differential geometry, probability and stochastic calculus) and also some physics (e.g. electromagnetism and quantum mechanics).. By simple you can understand easy to program (smib is a weakly typed language, with strong affinity to recursivity, programs are often short and powerful and maybe useful for teaching), and also easy to modify (source code is free, written in C language, and based on notions of stacks (like FORTH language), and lists (like LISP language)).
