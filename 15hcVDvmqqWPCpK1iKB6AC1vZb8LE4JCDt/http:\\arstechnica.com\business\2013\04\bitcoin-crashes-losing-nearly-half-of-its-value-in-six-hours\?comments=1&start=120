 <!-- cache hit --><!-- empty --> <p dir="ltr">On Wednesday afternoon, the Bitcoin bubble appears to have <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-04-10/bitcoin-tumbles-25-hours">burst</a>. As of this writing, its <a href="http://mtgox.com">current value</a> is around $160—<a href="http://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/">down from a high of $260</a>. (It fell as low as $130 today.) There is no obvious explanation for why the digital currency has fallen so far and so fast, although the market correcting after such a huge rise might be a good explanation. (Update 4:05pm CT: Bitcoin seems to have somewhat recovered and appears to be hovering around $200. Update 6:00pm CT: The exchange rate has fallen back to around $160.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some redditors have taken solace in a comment thread entitled "<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c2n5z/hold_spartans/">Hold Spartans</a>."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"This is just the market venting some pressure after these huge gains," wrote <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c2n5z/hold_spartans/c9cg43i">anotherblog</a>. "To be honest I'm glad it's happening now. If it recovers, it will demonstrate resilience in the market and give confidence to future buyers and current holders that they don't need to panic sell, reduce the chances of a crash in the future."</p>
<p dir="ltr" id="internal-source-marker_0.5470996945582044">Coincidentally, the plunge came several hours after a reddit user by the name of “<a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/bitcoinbillionaire">Bitcoinbillionaire</a>” suddenly, spontaneously decided to give away <a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1Hi9Nuh5pHCC3SkC1gH75k5AMV5hmZgdjd?sort=0">around $12,000 (more than 63 BTC) worth of the digital currency</a>. Bitcoinbillionaire rewarded 13 seemingly random redditors, then stopped the whirlwind spree after about eight hours. At the moment, no evidence links the currency's plunge with this random reddit charity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoinbillionaire <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-bitcoinbillionaire-2013-4">took advantage</a> of reddit’s <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcointip">Bitcointip</a> mechanism, which allows users to send each other small amounts of cash (usually less than $5). The mysterious benefactor appears to have given away 20 BTC (now worth slightly less than $4,000) as his or her first gift to one <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/karelb">Karelb</a>. This gift happened under a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c0yi4/i_wish_for_the_price_to_crash/">comment</a> titled: “I wish for the price to crash.” That comment now seems prophetic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A look at the account <a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1Hi9Nuh5pHCC3SkC1gH75k5AMV5hmZgdjd?sort=0">transferring all this money</a> shows that two hours before the giveaways began, Bitcoinbillionaire received 50 BTC (about $9,500) from another account without an IP address.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Business Insider</em> <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-bitcoinbillionaire-2013-4">reported</a> that Bitcoinbillionaire has left hints that he or she was an <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcointip/comments/1c1hp2/a_4680_tip_really/c9c7lm9">"early adopter,"</a> and had forgotten he or she even <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcointip/comments/1c1hp2/a_4680_tip_really/c9c7opm?context=3">had any bitcoins</a>. Not much is known beyond that, as Bitcoinbillionaire vanished as suddenly as he or she appeared.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"You've made me change my mind about this whole thing," <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c0er1/can_we_get_google_to_add_bitcoins_to_their/c9c5x16?context=3">Bitcoinbillionaire wrote</a>. "I'm done."</p>

That it was made by human labor is just history.  Now it is a hammer, valuable for its utility.</div><br /><br />Say I don't need a hammer, I need a saw and I don't have one on hand. That hammer has no value to me to complete the task I have before me. I could trade that hammer to someone who needs one in exchange for a saw, but it's only valuable to those that need a hammer but only have a saw. If I need a saw to complete my task and I don't have one, it has no value to me unless it can get me what I need, or perform a function it requires. So it has intrinsic value as a hammer, but to those that don't need one it doesn't hold much value. Even if I did have a saw when I needed it, not using it for it's intended purpose to <span style="font-style: italic">make</span> something with it the saw will go unused. It can't cut a board to make a table all on it's own. The labor performed to use the tool has the value at the very basic level.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">jdw wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">So while it's arguably true that everything that has value comes from labor, it's not necessarily meaningful.  You could just as well say that human labor comes from humans, and humans come from sex.  So nothing really has useful value unless sex is involved.</div><br /><br />When a woman is in the act of birthing a child, what is that called? <span style="font-style: italic">Labor</span><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Voo42 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">And since human labor comes from humans and humans are too the largest degree oxygen, which itself is created by nuclear fusion processes in stars (and we can continue that process even further down - why stop at element level?). So by your logic we shouldn't value anything but stars? Same principle only applied a bit more rigorously.</div><br /><br />Can you eat a star? Can a star build you a table? Can you drive a star to work? Does a star clean your carpet? No. Yes, it's the same principle, but applied in an illogical way.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">s73v3r wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Not necessarily. The first hammers were really just rocks. They were still valuable as tools, but not because they had human labor involved.</div><br /><br />You pretty much do miss the point. Even though the first hammers weren't made with human labor (or primates if you want to go that far), it's a tool used to <span style="font-style: italic">perform labor</span> somewhere along the chain. Whether it is used to smash ants into a paste, smash the skull of an animal, or bust open a coconut, that tock is used as a hammer to perform the work necessary to eat/kill your prey. The rock wasn't created with human labor, but the act of using it is laborious.

It's really been helping keep the volatility down.[/sarcasm]</div><br /><br />Wasn't bitcoin supposed to be a hedge against inflation? What is this, like 100% inflation in 1 day...I don't even want to start annualizing that. And the biggest early supporters were scared of hyper-inflatoin of 10-15% in the US...</div><br /><br /><br />The problem isn't inflation or deflation, it's extremely thin volume that leaves it vulnerable to price swings.<br />Inflation/Deflation has to deal with currency supply.</div><br />No.  Just, no.<br /><br />Inflation/deflation is only about prices.  Currency supply may affect prices, but is not the only possible source of inflation/deflation.</div><br /><br />We're going to have to disagree. Inflation/Deflation is about currency supply. If you talk about prices, then you have to talk about markets which all have their own influences including tariffs and taxation, fads, events (drought, flooding), seasons etc. Inflation and deflation are very typically slow, though Germans and Zimbabweans would argue otherwise. But it's all about money supply. That's why we don't just have CPI, but M1, M2 and to some extent M3. Those measure inflation. Not consumer prices which are over in the consumer price index. Inflation changes the economic value of a static bank account without any transactions. CPI only affects the value when things are bought by the money in the account.</div><br /><br />Not true.<br /><br />In the long run, the Money Supply is one of the main (but not only) factors that drives inflation. But an increase in the Money Supply doesn't always coincide with an increase in inflation. Take a look at this graph from FRED:<br /><br /><div style="padding: 3px;">
  <div style="margin-bottom: 3px; font-weight: bold;" onclick="var q = $(this).parent().find('.quotecontent > div');q.toggle();$(this).find('span').html(q.is(':visible')?'hide':'show');return false;">
    <b>Spoiler: </b>
    <span style="color: #FF5B00; cursor: pointer;">show</span>

  <div class="quotecontent">
    <div style="display: none;">
      <img src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=hp4" alt="Image" />
    </div>
  </div>
</div><br /><br />The blue line is inflation in the US as measured by the CPI. The red line is the Money Supply as measured by MZM. Both lines are indexed to 100 in 2003. As you can see, inflation is not keeping up with the increase in the money supply (due to the Financial Panic, Great Recession, and the Fed operating at the zero-bound).<br /><br />If you head over to <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">FRED</a> you can play around with whatever measure of inflation and money supply that you want. And they will all show that your definition is incorrect.

      The .05 Bitcoins I mined a little while ago for fun (back when the price was about $60) may have actually exceeded the cost of the electricity I burned mining them.  Bitcoin seems very interesting, but I tend to not be much of a gambler, so I never bought any.  It will be interesting to see if Bitcoin ever reaches a semi-stable (though moderately deflationary) value, or if it will just go through a series of bubbles and eventually crash hard.

Anti-counterfeiting measures. But since the Feds have already ruled that it's basically game currency, the point is moot.</div><br />Anti-counterfeiting is built in to the system.  That is why a digital value stored in RAM can be traded as a commodity.<br /><br />Consumer protection has nothing to do with the &quot;currency&quot; involved.  That is normally managed by making it illegal to commit the crime of fraud.  This includes the banking industry.  The behavior is regulated, not the currency used to record balances.<br /><br />If you want to discuss market manipulation of the value of the currency, then you may have a point as governments prefer to handle that themselves.

People want to hate on something and say &quot;I told you so,&quot; but the smartest people I know are incredibly excited about BTC and every day there are new stories cropping up about new retailers and services accepting it. We've had numerous requests to have it as a payment method in our online [retail] store, so we'll be implementing it as soon as our new site is ready to launch. Really excited to see how often it is used.</div><br />Unless you're converting it to cash real-time, it seems like a horribly unstable way to conduct business, since I assume you purchase all your own stock and services with real money.  Besides, you won't be pricing items in BTC, but rather the USD equivalent, since BTC is so volatile.

That's something well defined, and Bitcoin doesn't fit there.</div><br />&quot;A pyramid scheme is a non-sustainable business model that involves promising participants payment or services, primarily for enrolling other people into the scheme, rather than supplying any real investment or sale of products or services to the public.&quot; (wikipedia)<br /><br />I say that Bitcoins primary business model is to enroll other people into the scheme so that early adopters profit. Compared to speculation, it's actual use as a currency is laughable (and mainly restricted to illegal activity). Bitcoinstore &amp; co. are just feel-good services with no real value. You pay more than when you order directly from amazon.com and you need to enter your address anyway, so why?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Hinton wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Further more you're just looking at it as an investment object like gold, which is incorrect.<br /><br />The stated purpose of bitcoin is to fascilitate trading over the internet. Not purchasing to horde on the advice of Fox news.<br /></div><br />It doesn't matter what the purpose of bitcoin is. It's reality that matters. And reality is that bitcoin is primarily a speculative object.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">phipse wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Fact is that money supply of BTC is highly limited and couldn't keep up with even an extremely slow increase in adoption. So it is a given that it's value will massively increase when its adoption rate increases. Semi-intelligent people notice that and &quot;invest&quot; (i.e. speculate) in Bitcoin. They don't see that the reason they buy BTC in the first place will lead to its downfall. Deflation creates bubbles; bubbles pop which kills confidence.<br /></div><br /><div class="quotetitle">Hinton wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Bitcoin goes to fractions. So the amount of available currency is essentially unlimited.</div><br />This is a stupid argument that gets repeated over and over again. The fact that Bitcoin is essentially indefinitely divisable has nothing to do with the money supply or deflation. There's only a practical advantage when dealing with a massively deflated currency. However, this does not help to prevent speculative bubbles whatsoever.

People want to hate on something and say &quot;I told you so,&quot; but the smartest people I know are incredibly excited about BTC and every day there are new stories cropping up about new retailers and services accepting it. We've had numerous requests to have it as a payment method in our online [retail] store, so we'll be implementing it as soon as our new site is ready to launch. Really excited to see how often it is used.</div><br />Unless you're converting it to cash real-time, it seems like a horribly unstable way to conduct business, since I assume you purchase all your own stock and services with real money.  Besides, you won't be pricing items in BTC, but rather the USD equivalent, since BTC is so volatile.</div><br />This form of dual currency payment is quite common.  Prices are posted in one currency and payment accepted in another.<br /><br />Canadian money is used in the US border states.  The businesses simply post the current exchange rate and the payment is made based on that rate.<br /><br />With a currency that has serious volatility, then the exchange rate post will be updated frequently or else use a live tracker.  In this case the payment received will be sold to a money changer as soon as feasible to keep down the risk.<br /><br />On the other hand, money changers see this volatility as a hazard of doing business.  They keep enough of each currency they deal in to handle the expected business and use brokers to maintain their inventory at par levels.  To a money changer, money is not a currency, it is a fungible commodity like apples, coconuts or gold.

The value of a commodity is only related to the labor needed to produce or obtain it. For example, if I make a chair and sell it, the price should relate to the cost of materials plus my time or other factors that went into its production. I shouldn't just make up a price to profit.<br /><br />Today it's primarily associated with Marx, but it was also used by Adam Smith, various schools of anarchism (e.g., mutualism, American individualism), and a number of others.

      The inventor of Bitcoin certainly was a math/comp genius, but I doubt he understands economics. Why do people consider it currency when it is just a stock on a cloud-based market? Bitcoin can be forked, then you will have multiple stocks and trading. Guess what happens then.<br /><br />If the initial offering was a million coins at US$1, where is that US$1,000,000? If Bitcoin rises to US$10, there is no US$10,000,000 backing it. If everyone sells out, I doubt they would get much of the initial million back.

People want to hate on something and say &quot;I told you so,&quot; but the smartest people I know are incredibly excited about BTC and every day there are new stories cropping up about new retailers and services accepting it. We've had numerous requests to have it as a payment method in our online [retail] store, so we'll be implementing it as soon as our new site is ready to launch. Really excited to see how often it is used.</div><br />Unless you're converting it to cash real-time, it seems like a horribly unstable way to conduct business, since I assume you purchase all your own stock and services with real money.  Besides, you won't be pricing items in BTC, but rather the USD equivalent, since BTC is so volatile.</div><br />This form of dual currency payment is quite common.  Prices are posted in one currency and payment accepted in another.<br /><br />Canadian money is used in the US border states.  The businesses simply post the current exchange rate and the payment is made based on that rate.<br /><br />With a currency that has serious volatility, then the exchange rate post will be updated frequently or else use a live tracker.  In this case the payment received will be sold to a money changer as soon as feasible to keep down the risk.<br /><br />On the other hand, money changers see this volatility as a hazard of doing business.  They keep enough of each currency they deal in to handle the expected business and use brokers to maintain their inventory at par levels.  To a money changer, money is not a currency, it is a fungible commodity like apples, coconuts or gold.</div><br /><br /><br />The tiny slight difference here is the rate between the Canadian and US dollars is relatively stable with very minor day to day changes.  There is just no real risk in accepting payment on the boarder and this goes from the Peso even too.  <br /><br />Bitcoins 24 hours ago at the time I write this was about 240 it went up to 266 (this already is a huge swing) * then it crashed down to as low as 105  in 7 hours before going back to 177.  <br /><br />The point I am making here is no business that is actually worried about making money instead of hiding the transaction or making a political statement would ever entertain the idea of accepting bitcoins for a transaction.<br /><br />*just this is about the movement of Black Wednesday.

      Ha ha, the other shoe dropped. I'd say I was surprised, but, no. This seemed inevitable to me.<br /><br />Just a matter of time before the same thing happens to the iRL &quot;bitcoin,&quot; commodity gold values.<br /><br />People who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Unregulated markets can be like this.

No. Yes, it's the same principle, but applied in an illogical way.</div><br />Hmm yes I assume in theory you can actually eat humans directly, but let's hope that wasn't what you meant. You are already accepting transitive advantages (human creates tool -&gt; tool is used to actually get something done; you give the human the credit), so it just adds a handful more links to the chain: sun creates oxygen -&gt; oxygen creates human -&gt; human creates tool -&gt; tool actually does something useful.</div><br /><br />I never said anything about eating a human, I asked you if you could eat a star. Are you going to answer that question, or continue to completely ignore what I'm saying to fit your illogical arguments? Because as it stands, you're making zero sense because you clearly aren't using critical thought.</div><br />Can you eat humans or human labor? No? So what is your point?  You claimed that tools were made by people, so their usefulness can be traced back to humans. That's an obviously transitive chain of assigned value and I did nothing but introduce a few more links into that chain. That that pretty much shows the meaninglessness of the theorem is not a fault of its application. &quot;Damn it Newton's law of universal gravitation doesn't work very well with extremely massive objects! Clearly it's the fault of these objects!&quot;<br /><br />To quote yourself:<br />&quot;Without human labor almost nothing is created or sold. Ergo, nothing really has useful value unless human labor is involved&quot;.<br />Same is perfectly true for oxygen or stars.. doesn't make it a very useful though. Or did you change your argument since posting that? In that case, sorry, it's hard to keep up with people who change their opinion in a matter of hours.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">nathand496 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The theory they're working toward, and you're missing, is the labor theory of value.

      Greetings Ars people, I'm not really sure why I felt I should respond to this but here it is.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Onerunjunior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I never said anything about eating a human, I asked you if you could eat a star. Are you going to answer that question, or continue to completely ignore what I'm saying to fit your illogical arguments? Because as it stands, you're making zero sense because you clearly aren't using critical thought.</div><br /><br />I thought his answer was fairly clear, logically. You are saying, according to my understanding of your argument, that all value comes from labor. He is saying your ability to do that labor is a product of work done in stars. So all value can be traced back to stars. Are we to take your followup question about eating stars to mean that you think only things that both do physical work and are edible are a source of value?<br /><br />To answer your question however, yes you can eat the products of stars. You eat the products of stars every day, assuming that you eat at least that often.<br /><br />However I found your previous comment more interesting:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Onerunjunior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Say I don't need a hammer, I need a saw and I don't have one on hand. That hammer has no value to me to complete the task I have before me. I could trade that hammer to someone who needs one in exchange for a saw, but it's only valuable to those that need a hammer but only have a saw. If I need a saw to complete my task and I don't have one, it has no value to me unless it can get me what I need, or perform a function it requires. So it has intrinsic value as a hammer, but to those that don't need one it doesn't hold much value. Even if I did have a saw when I needed it, not using it for it's intended purpose to make something with it the saw will go unused. It can't cut a board to make a table all on it's own. The labor performed to use the tool has the value at the very basic level.</div><br /><br />This betrays the problem with the labor theory of value. A factor in the value of things is the conscious mind.<br /><br />In one possible outcome you pick up a rock and exchange it for something. In another you pick up the same rock and, finding nobody to exchange it with, throw it away. The labor is the same. The rock is the same. Only the desire for the rock, out of necessity or irrationality, is different. So obviously the mind's decision to ascribe a value to the rock plays some role in the value of the rock.<br /><br />So did the labor create the desire, or did the desire create the labor? IMO the arrow of causation can go both ways. Sometimes you decide to make/find/etc something because you know others have placed a value on it. Other times you make/find/etc something and then convince others that they need it. And there is a whole spectrum in between the extremes of intrinsic need and manufactured desire.<br /><br />But what if I play devil's advocate and assume that the only source of value is human labor and land? Reflecting on this I must say that the labor theory of value is unsatisfying as a theoretical framework.<br /><br />In the devil's advocate scenario we agree that humans and land are the only source of value. Yet that really doesn't tell us anything specific about the value of something. That is because in this scenario human labor has a value, but it can't be determined by the length or effort of that labor. The value of someone's labor might be disproportional to the length/effort or even negative. Let me explain by way of analogy:<br /><br />Suppose there is a field containing all living members of a rare species of butterfly. Collector A comes along and offers a kid $1000 to collect all remaining butterflies and pin them on a wooden block. Collector B comes along and offers the kid $2000 to collect one butterfly and kill the rest without collecting them. Then an environmentalist comes along and offers $3000 to leave the butterflies alone. The value of the kid's labor isn't directly proportional to how much time or effort he put into the collecting.<br /><br />Think that example is far fetched? Then let's talk about diamonds. The De Beers cartel actively avoids putting too many diamonds on the market. The market value of diamonds is proportional to the supply of diamonds. If De Beers were to do more work and extract the diamonds faster and transport them to the market faster then the value of the diamond would drop. It should be clear that this is a problem for the labor theory of value. If the labor is the same, the properties of the diamonds are the same, and the land they are harvested from is the same then does difference in value come from the scarcity or the mind's interpretation of that scarcity? Or something else?<br /><br />I have another example that is a bit more personal. Yesterday I found and picked up a rare mineral while hiking. Let's skip over the question of if the rock had value before I knew it was there. It has value now, however that value may have been achieved. Upon looking at the surface of this rock with my microscope I discovered some beautiful structures. However, if I were to break apart this rock, isolate a structure, and make a micro-mount I would lose money. The result of my labor would be negative value.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Lastly but most important, this bit of philosophizing by some individuals about the labor theory of value is really a tangent to the discussion of the value of bitcoins.</span> Even if the labor theory of value is true then bitcoins would still have some value. It takes human labor to develop a new cryptographic standard, to write software, build a computer, set it up, to build and run the power plant that supplies the computer's electricity, etc. Saying that only human labor produces value isn't a valid way to dismiss bitcoins as having no value.
