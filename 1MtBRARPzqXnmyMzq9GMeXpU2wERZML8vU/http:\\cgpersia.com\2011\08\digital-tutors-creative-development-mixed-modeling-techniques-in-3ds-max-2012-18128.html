In this collection of videos we learn several modeling techniques in 3ds Max 2012. These videos will delve in such modeling techniques as spline modeling, polygonal modeling, and sub divisional surfaces. Through these techniques we are going to create a highly detailed steam locomotive model. We will also be exploring some of the graphite modeling tools and their functionality while modeling. All the while keeping an emphasis on the importance of scene management in a production environment.

Can someone provide project files for this one ? It will be hard to follow without the references images.

sweet can you tell him nice video Samwise on 2011/08/23 at 6:41 AM said:
This guy really loves doing things the most complicated and inefficient way. For example, he has the quickslice button right in the middle of his screen, but decides to draw a line as a reference and move vertices manually, one by one. Or the way he keeps having to switch to wireframe to see the shapes he’s drawing when he could simply move the reference plane a fraction of an inch along the Z axis and it wouldn’t block the vertices in the first place.
Also, a basic fail in the whole tutorial is that he doesn’t mirror clones when he creates the other side of the locomotive, so if he changes extrude values later, the ones on the left side will extrude outwards while the ones on the right side will extrude inwards.
Good videos to see the various Max tools in action, but definitely not good in terms of learning proper modelling workflow.

Thanks for the review bro. I’ll just use the video as a reference for the Max tools and take the workflow with a grain of salt.

Hi – what would be some reccomended by you videos / tutorials to learn proper modeling workflow with Max and Graphite tools? Your answer, and pointing me somewhere will be greatly appreaciated.
