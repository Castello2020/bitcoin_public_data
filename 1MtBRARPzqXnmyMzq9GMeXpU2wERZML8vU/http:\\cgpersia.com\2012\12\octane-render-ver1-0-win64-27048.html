Octane Render Ver1.0 Win64	Posted by CG Blogger on 2012/12/20
Posted in: 3D, CG Releases, Downloads, Softwares, Torrent, Windows.	Tagged: Mirrors, Update.	Octane Render Ver1.00 Win64
Realtime 3D Rendering
Octane Render is the world’s first GPU based, un-biased, physically based renderer.
What does that mean?
It uses the video card in your computer to render photorealistic results fast…really fast.
This allows the user to create stunning works in a fraction of the time of traditional CPU based renderers.

Hello,
Which graphic card do you have?
AlexBBM on 2012/12/20 at 10:55 AM said:
Need Cuda 3.0, with 5.0 – does not work
IceTF on 2012/12/20 at 1:09 PM said:
That’s what Octane Render is. CUDA is needed and ATI GPUs do not work.
AlexBBM on 2012/12/20 at 1:28 PM said:
Did I say something about ATI? I am only talking about the versions of CUDA.

I don’t understand why companies forget ATI users.
crikster on 2012/12/22 at 4:02 AM said:

Feloem on 2012/12/20 at 3:57 PM said:
Octane has been made for nvidia, nobody forgot ATI users.

3db on 2012/12/20 at 10:33 PM said:
Does run with firewall blocking outgoing ports on Win7 x64 and Win8 x64 but does not display meshes. Tried in 4 different x64 wkstations. Using demo Demo does display right meshes with cuda 2GB GeForce GT 640M latest driver but when running same scene on the one here it does launch and seems to load scene but when hit render it reports error ( in red lower right on display screen) Display screen does not show any geometry, stays grey. Something is wrong with this fix. I was hoping it worked ikiB on 2012/12/21 at 12:57 AM said:

Feloem on 2012/12/21 at 3:05 PM said:
Torrent for what? This version doesn’t work… so a torrent is useless.
grogg on 2012/12/22 at 5:27 AM said:
Ugh. This build isn’t for GTX 6xx cards. Getting the same “failed” message here w/ a GTX 660M.
enigmasi on 2012/12/22 at 1:39 PM said:
I have licence and it works well with cuda 5 on my gtx 680
3dlatinazz on 2012/12/22 at 5:35 PM said:
Me too, using mac osx ML.
peronio on 2012/12/22 at 3:25 PM said:
ATI cards are great and more cheap…. the problem it´s the software, companies prefer to develop Cuda instead of OpenCL.
dom on 2012/12/23 at 8:27 AM said:
So does the Demo version work with CUDA 5? Because I have a grey screen in my official demo test scenes where the viewport should be.
