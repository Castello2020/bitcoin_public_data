Total Textures V18 – Sky Textures	Posted by Ir0nboy on 2011/06/28
Posted in: 2D, 3D, CG Releases, Downloads, Textures.	Tagged: Textures, Total Textures.	Total Textures V18 – “Sky Textures” is a collection of high resolution panorama textures that can be applied to a sky dome and are set up ready to work within such a 3D environment. Due to their huge size (over 17,000 x 5,000) they can alternatively be used as a background pass in 3D render composites or even mapped onto a plane. They incorporate different weather conditions ranging from stormy and overcast to clear and sunny and have also been taken at different times of the day from the morning through to afternoons and sunset.
This DVD contains 101 individual images. Each texture has been hand crafted from 100% original photography and is also of course totally flexible, meaning it can be used in many projects.
