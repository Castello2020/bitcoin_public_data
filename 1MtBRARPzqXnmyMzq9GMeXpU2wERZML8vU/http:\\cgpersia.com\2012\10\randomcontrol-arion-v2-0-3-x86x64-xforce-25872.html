RandomControl Arion v2.0.3 x86/x64 – XFORCE	Posted by CG Blogger on 2012/10/01

Arion 2.0
Because the most demanding productions require the sharpest tools, we have created Arion 2.0.
Packed with unprecedented flexibility, speed and output quality, the new Arion 2.0 technology is at the heart of our stand-alone renderer as well as the MAX LIVE and XSI LIVE plug-ins.
What is Arion?
Arion is a hybrid-accelerated and physically-based production render engine. It inherits all our expertise in light simulation and makes it run on steroids, thanks to our very unique massively parallel GPU+CPU approach.
Arion is a high performance production renderer capable of producing hyper-real images and animations.

So, this works perfect. One question: How do I render? Or is it just waiting until the “realview” looks good?

Your image is in public access on the randomcontrol site, the page and parent pages contain no visible legals, credits, any restrictions clearly declared, disclamers, etc. The article, meanwhile, contains the link to the source site. Then, you clearly make out that this image is a \photo\ that means this is not an artifical illustration. Want me to sue you with the whole randomcontrol crew for this fraud case? And the last, it seems you are the frequenter of similar to cgpersia places. Still want to discuss your criminal defendant future?
