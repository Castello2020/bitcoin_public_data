Gnomon Master Class 2011 – Stylized Visual Effects Animation	Posted by CG Blogger on 2011/12/06
Posted in: 3D, CG Releases, Downloads, Learning, Tutorials, Videos.	Tagged: Gnomon.	Gnomon Master Class 2011 – Stylized Visual Effects Animation
( Project Files Added )
This class will demonstrate how to use principals of animation to create a more compelling and stylized visual effects sequence. Using a plethora of 3D applications, including 3ds Max, Maya, Houdini, Vue and FumeFX, Slim will emphasize and build upon many animation tricks and techniques, focusing on shapes, color and motion semantics. The main project will be a large scale “Magical Effect” shot. Through execution of the main project, supplemental examples will illustrate the principals used including stylized fluid simulations and ultra-stylized structure destruction.

I haven’t seen all the videos yet, but he really messes up the explanation of the Houdini dynamics parameters in the first couple of videos.
Marx Sister on 2011/12/17 at 2:37 PM said:
The Max video is just as bad. I have a feeling this might in fact be be Matt Leonard doing a French accent.

certainly like your web site however you need to check the spelling on quite a few of your posts. A number of them are rife with spelling problems and I to find it very troublesome to tell the truth then again I will definitely come back again.
