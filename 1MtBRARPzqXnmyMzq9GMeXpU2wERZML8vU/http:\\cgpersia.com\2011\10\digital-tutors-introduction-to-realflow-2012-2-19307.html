Digital-Tutors – Introduction to RealFlow 2012	Posted by unowen on 2011/10/20
Posted in: Downloads, Learning, Tutorials, Videos.	Beginner | 3h 11m | 1.00 GB | Project Files 18 MB | Required Software: RealFlow 2012
In this series of lessons, we will be taking an introductory look at RealFlow 2012 and many of the key features of this robust fluid simulation software.
It is important to develop good workflow habits early in your RealFlow education, so we will start by learning the importance of properly setting up your RealFlow projects as well as how to efficiently move around within the RealFlow interface. From there, we will learn how to start working with RealFlow fluid particles – learning about the important attributes that affect particle behavior, as well as how we can use daemons to add dynamic forces such as wind, gravity, and air resistance to our simulations. Another critical concept to understand within RealFlow is the importance of scale. We will teach you how to properly compensate for real-world scale within RealFlow, ensuring that your liquids and other dynamics behave correctly. We will also take time to explore some of the powerful new features found in RealFlow 2012, including dynamic object fracturing, using the Retiming function to quickly add time-warping and slow-motion effects to our RealFlow simulations, as well as many other important tools and critical concepts that you will need to be aware of whenever starting out in RealFlow.
