								<p>After breaching Sony's security systems, online hacking community LulzSec is rapidly gaining notoriety.</p>
			</div>
		    <!-- Article Start -->
			Distributed hacking community LulzSec yesterday set its aim squarely on Bethesda and its online FPS game Brink.<br />
<br />
The news was delivered via the organisation’s Twitter feed <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/LulzSec/status/79912148557512704" target="_blank">at around 3pm BST yesterday</a>, with a Tweet stating: ‘<i>We were going to keep this little treasure chest to ourselves, but it appears the hand has been bitten. Say your prayers, Brink users.</i>’<br />
<br />
This was followed up by a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/LulzSec/status/79944355640643584" target="_blank">second tweet</a> saying: ‘<i>Big lulz coming up in the near future. Time to show these bitches how it's done. #Brink #Bethesda #ZeniMax</i>’<br />
<br />
The group <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/LulzSec/status/79952902390693888" target="_blank">later revealed</a>, again via its twitter feed, that it would have been ready to carry out the attack yesterday, but it was ‘<i>missing one vital ingredient to complete our victory soup. No ETA, but we're hoping in the next 24 hours.</i>’<br />
<br />
This seems to be a pretty poor omen for Bethesda and Brink fans, as the LulzSec community has proved to be more than a match for the security systems of <a href="http://armannd.com/lulzsec-completes-blackberg-security-hacking-challenge-for-the-lulz-tech.html/" target="_blank">Black &amp; Berg Security</a>, <a href="http://www.bit-tech.net/news/gaming/2011/06/03/sony-pictures-hacked/1" target="_blank">Sony</a> and the <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2011/06/lulzsec-breaches-british-health-system-polite-hack/38690/" target="_blank">NHS</a> over the last few weeks.<br />
<br />
Interestingly, the hacking collective later sent <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/LulzSec/status/79974779737743360" target="_blank">another tweet</a> asking followers to ‘<i>Snap your minds into a new realm, my friends. We did it because they couldn't stop us - and did it we did, as you'll see. We always deliver.</i>’ This indicates that the hack has been completed.<br />
<br />
Bethesda has yet to comment on the threats, but the game publisher is likely to be frantically working behind the scenes to make sure its systems are as secure as possible, and that any sensitive information is securely encrypted. Whether or not this will do any good remains to be seen, however. <br />
<br />
Are you a regular Brink player who's concerned by the LulzSec threats? Is the hacking collective ruining it for everyone? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="http://forums.bit-tech.net/showthread.php?t=211286">forums</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Updated:</b> Bethesda has released <a href="http://bethblog.com/index.php/2011/06/13/please-read-hack-attempts-against-our-websites-and-forums/" target="_blank">a statement</a> confirming the hack attempt over the weekend. The statement says that '<i>while no personal financial information or credit card data was obtained, the hackers may have gained access to some user names, email addresses, and/or passwords.</i>'.<br />
<br />
As a result, Bethesda recommends that all users of its community forums change their passwords.	        <!-- Article End -->

I have been a first hand victim of my bank account being stolen from by fraud and identity theft, and whilst yea, eventually the money is returned, it is a very distressing and difficult period of time before it is resolved. First of all, the banks require proof that it wasnt you that perpetrated the account withdrawals, and then they have to 'investigate' the matter, during which time you are very likely left with sod all money for at least several days.

But at the same time, going after end users is a bit harsh. It's not their fault that their accounts are stored insecurely and they are the ones who end up being hit hardest - it's not like the companies really care, as long as they make their money.<br />

					<div class="commentCopy">These guys are just a bunch of fame-seeking morons. If they really wanted to highlight security issues, why not highlight them to the companies concerned, or relevant authorities and leave it at that? But no, they have the claim some kind of moral justice by hacking a community and putting thousands if not millions of users ill at ease by not knowing what has happened to their infromation.<br />
<br />
'I robbed your bank because the bank doesnt have good enough security, to prove they don't have good enough security. Lulz'<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, the bank still got robbed. These people aren't doing anything productive or positive, just generating worldwide attention for themselves in some misguided attempt at notoriety and fame. They are clearly a bunch of losers who try and scare everyone who maintains a negative stance at them by threatening hacks and invasive action. Tehy are worse than Sony et al as far as i'm concerned. They bring NOTHING positive to the table.<br />
<br />
And also, 'Lulz' should rank up there as the most annoying and pathetic words ever created in our English.</div>

When was the last time you saw a Government take an approach like this? You should know full well that what will happen is an attempt to pass laws restricting the actions of, or invading the privacy of individuals on the internet under Terrorism laws. Don't think they won't just because it might be better to pursue companies to increase security. That won't happen because it is harder and more expensive to attain, and doesnt bring about the secondary benefits that internet policing would. Hence - LulzSec ARE ruining it for everyone else by being combative and not supportive.</div>

Haha, one day they'll find out that they may be safe tucked away in their basement behind the screen, but lets see what happens when the guys with guns turn up and kick the door down.

In my experience the worst perpetrators of nerd rage tend to actually be non-regulars on the interwobbles. The type who get annoyed about people hiding behind anonymity and talking to them without the fear of being beaten up to keep them polite. The type who seem to most of us how redneck yokels seem to most average non-geeks.<br />
<br />
Kojak, you would not cut their throats. That's childish to even pretend you would. If on the off chance you are actually insane enough that you <i>would</i> cut someone's throats for hacking a company you have no relation to, then you have big <i>big</i> problems and I hope you are swiftly removed from society.<br />
<br />
As for how I would feel if someone hacked into my bank and took my money, I'd feel very little. My bank would be legally required to replace the money in my account, and I would think that a bank is idiotic for not having extremely good protection against hackers. Just as I would feel that a bank is idiotic if it has a safe but leaves it open all the time because it's complicated to remember a combination.</div>

I do agree with the fact that there are bigger threats out there but this isn't just "some folks mucking around." This is people that have the ability to screw people over. Yes they are targeting "soft" or small targets now, but what happens when they target your bank, or your insurance company, or the defense network for any country. Things like this are VERY VERY bad. <br />
<br />
Im not disagreeing with what you say im just saying think a few more levels deep. Not what these people are doing but what they can do. That is what scares me. That is what makes me want them to be found now. <br />
<br />
On the topic of this though. Im skeptical that these people are just getting info and then doing nothing with it. There has to be something in it for them. Not just the Lulz (stupid). What is this groups endgame. That is what truly engages me in this topic. Makes me curious. AHH 3rd coming of the antichrist..... ok i put that in there for a laugh to lighten the mood some...</div>

You think the actions of Lulzsec have anything to do with the impending restrictions on our internet freedom? Those guys are small fries. You want to know about restrictions on the internet, look at what the RIAA, MPAA, and associate organisations want the internet to be like.<br />
<br />
Those are the fascist scum who seek to restrict our freedom in the name of maximising their own profits. Those are the people who are invited to conferences on the future of the internet. Not members of the electorate, not experts on the internet, not telecommunications company employees, not philosophers or experts on rights, but suits in the recording industry.<br />
<br />
You want to know why the internet will be screwed up in the next couple of decades? It's not because a few guys are hacking whatever company leaves it's backdoor unlocked. It's because the media industry has failed completely to adjust to the 21st century realities, and know that their business model is leading every single media sector to destruction, and will continue to do so unless they can put regulation restricting the internet in place across the glove.</div>

It's good in many ways to let these corporations know we do have the power to fight back against things they choose to do, I just want it to be a worthy cause.</div>

This is people that have the ability to screw people over. Yes they are targeting "soft" or small targets now, but what happens when they target your bank, or your insurance company, or the defense network for any country. Things like this are VERY VERY bad. <br />
<br />
Im not disagreeing with what you say im just saying think a few more levels deep. Not what these people are doing but what they can do. That is what scares me. That is what makes me want them to be found now. <br />
<br />
On the topic of this though. Im skeptical that these people are just getting info and then doing nothing with it. There has to be something in it for them. Not just the Lulz (stupid). What is this groups endgame. That is what truly engages me in this topic. Makes me curious. AHH 3rd coming of the antichrist..... ok i put that in there for a laugh to lighten the mood some...</div></blockquote><br />
<br />
Think though, What people? They aren't after "you" per-say more the firm which poorly holds your data. "They" who ever they are can go after my bank all they like frankly, as spec says its not my problem just like its not my problem if some one robs the local RBS or even if some one knocks over the local Sony center. <br />
<br />
What they can do is a slight worry but my comment is on these guys doing these hacks and reaction from some of the comments, some days the news comments sounds more like the daily mail... "Won't some one think of the children!!"<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe they're after "something" but I'd wager at the moment its just a laugh, why do people climb mountains or bungee jump? Personally I don't understand it but they still do.</div>

i don't like bethesda myself, they're a bunch of shitty programmers who only make games to make money.  although i don't support the company or their horribly made games (with the exception of graphics), targeting an online game is not going to hurt the company very much - it is more likely to hurt the customers more than anything.</div>

Those guys are small fries. You want to know about restrictions on the internet, look at what the RIAA, MPAA, and associate organisations want the internet to be like.<br />
<br />
Those are the fascist scum who seek to restrict our freedom in the name of maximising their own profits. Those are the people who are invited to conferences on the future of the internet. Not members of the electorate, not experts on the internet, not telecommunications company employees, not philosophers or experts on rights, but suits in the recording industry.<br />
<br />
You want to know why the internet will be screwed up in the next couple of decades? It's not because a few guys are hacking whatever company leaves it's backdoor unlocked. It's because the media industry has failed completely to adjust to the 21st century realities, and know that their business model is leading every single media sector to destruction, and will continue to do so unless they can put regulation restricting the internet in place across the glove.</div></blockquote><br />
Perhaps true enough, but the actions of dimwits like Lulzsec will be used as the thin end of the wedge for bringing in restrictive legislation like that. Things like true investigative journalism seeks to find out about sloppy things like insecure data storage, and then exposes the weakness to the world by reporting it to news sites. It certainly doesnt mean seeing the security hole, entering it to steal stuff or bring things down, and then posting 'laughs' about it - and this latest one where they 'threaten' Bethesda, or whoever - 'threats? Since when was this viewed as a wholesome way forward? Seems to me whomever these individuals are they believe that they are some untouchable and omnipresent internet deity. Very sad. I am very much against tight controls on the internet but I would certainly shop these morons if I knew who some of them were.</div>

					<div class="commentCopy">To be honest I'm kind of pleased that it is comparatively harmless grounds like Lulzsec and Anonymous that are causing all this havoc. I mean sure what they are doing isn't exactly helpful, but at the same time simply telling these companies that they are not secure would not have provoked action from them. And suppose rather than a bunch of juvenile pranksters some people with a real agenda, intent on real damage, were to start employing these tactics?<br />
<br />
I think if anybody is going to show internet security to be a farce, then I am glad it's a group that aren't looking to do too much damage to ordinary folks.<br />
<br />
The real outrage ought to be directed at the companies that insist on creating accounts, on taking our names and addresses, on collecting personal data, and then not protecting that information. If they can't keep our information safe they should not be asking for it.</div>

i can just imagine using that defence in court "yes your honour i did break into a bank, release its private data, but don't worry i only did it because i wanted to sure how easy it is."<br />
<br />
if all lulzsec did was hack into these various companies, then that wouldn't be so bad, but they don't they release user data, and because of that users suffer.</div>

					<div class="commentCopy">This attack is seemingly pointless, although with that said I still believe (perhaps naively) that this hacking will result in companies cowering in fear and actually securing their stuff. But what most likely will happen is what spec described, the regulation of the internet because of all the executives regulating it rather than changing.<br />
<br />
What really bothers me though is the future of the internet, it seems pretty doomed as far as I can see. Then again so does the future of the gaming industry. Perhaps now is the time that everyone consumer or company alike re-evaluate what's really going on, the current model of the internet vs the media magnates simply isn't working, the dynamics have changed rapidly compared to twenty years ago, and sadly most aren't willing to change and those who are are suffering because the rest refuse to move.</div>

it's the clients using online banking<br />
<br />
users are really tools, they don't understand anything about security in their own lans and then point at the banks when someone steals all their passwords, accesses everything they have<br />
<br />
I knew a guy who used to keep 3 character passwords back in the late 90's.. he used to brag about how much he knew until I made his rig tell him a bunch of **** using microsoft dictation.. unfortunately he found out it was me- but oh well, I was new to being stealthy.. more excited to hear 'grandma is going to beat that ass' coming out his speakers and imagining the look on his face<br />
<br />
there's even the snowball effect with users who keep the same password for everything.. on sites like this, it doesn't matter (unless you care if someone slanders you on a forum) but on sites that link to your money you should always go with good (numbers and upper/lowercase) long passwords<br />
<br />
basic stuff too like when logging in.. hover over next to the url and make sure ssl is'nt stripped by someone sitting in your lan.. be sure you have no trojans/keygens running and you have a good firewall that warns of lan and wan access and your able to set at least basic rules.. uac should be set all the way up, not the default in 7<br />
<br />
anyone who knows what they're doing exploits the easy first.. and since a majority of people are chickenheads, it's too easy.. for example the stuff I have/wrote personally, you wouldn't even see a slowdown in your network or even know I was monitoring you until I started to strip ssl.. then it would take someone who actually looks when logging in, to see if ssl is working<br />
<br />
I like monitoring myself because it's stealth.. you see where the persons going and get passwords like facebook that are unencrypted and they have no clue anything is happening.. stripping encryption relies on the victim being unaware- or even someone who's not a tool and is just unaware to look if the url starts with https or http<br />
<br />
that is all done without any trojans or compromising the rigs.. it's done by exploiting the way networks work.. like sitting outside your house on the telephone pole listening in on all your coversations<br />
<br />
in defense of these guys.. they found a hole- they got excited.. heck I doubt anyone could resist snooping around.. it's obviously something not on the grid yet.. that's the difference between a infosec hack who's paid off, fat and happy and one who's passionate<br />
<br />
it's not that hard really to get in good habits without being a technical person.. that's what should be given to new users..<br />
<br />
if bathesda can't get it together what chance does the little guy have</div>

					<div class="commentCopy">Personally, and rather selfishly, I hope Bethesda get royally screwed by them.  Myself and two other friends wasted £90 between us on Brink and even now, many weeks after launch, we still can't play because of crippling sound problems and dysfunctional (and sometimes completely non-functional) AI/bots.<br />
<br />
"Game" won't give any of us refunds because we've registered our Steam keys (obviously, otherwise we wouldn't know the game didn't work) and we're just out of pocket, owning a product we can't even use.  That's theft, in my book, so I hope lulzsec do their worst to Bethesda...and then go on to target Game.<br />

Greetings Internets,<br />
<br />
This is a story all about how we made Bethesda Softworks, ZeniMax <br />
Media, and everything they own, our bitch for life.<br />
<br />
As you should know, The Lulz Boat stores vast amounts of booty;<br />
much of this booty we don't release as it's simply too shiny and/or <br />
delicious. As of late, certain inferior sailing boats have discovered <br />
flaws in Brink (brinkthegame.com), thinking themselves exciting and new.<br />
<br />
Too late. The Lulz Boat controls this ocean, chumps.<br />
<br />
Some weeks ago, we smashed into Brink with our heavy artillery Lulz <br />
Cannons and decided to switch to ninja mode. From our LFI entry point, <br />
we acquired command execution via local file inclusion of enemy fleet <br />
Apache vessel. We then found that the HTTPD had SSH auth keys, which <br />
let our ship SSH into other servers. See where this is going?<br />
<br />
We then switched to root ammunition rounds. <br />
And we rooted... and rooted... and rooted...<br />
<br />
After mapping their internal network and thoroughly pillaging all of <br />
their servers, we grabbed all their source code and database passwords, <br />
which we proceeded to shift silently back to our storage deck.<br />
<br />
Please find enclosed everything we took, excluding one thing -<br />
200,000+ Brink users. We actually like this company and would<br />
like for them to speed up the production of Skyrim, so we'll<br />
give them one less thing to worry about. You're welcome! :D<br />
<br />
Please keep making awesome games, guys, and you should<br />
totally add an official LulzSec top hat to new releases.<br />
<br />
But anyway, bwahahaha... &gt;:]<br />

<br />
users are really tools, they don't understand anything about security in their own lans and then point at the banks when someone steals all their passwords, accesses everything they have<br />
<br />
I knew a guy who used to keep 3 character passwords back in the late 90's.. he used to brag about how much he knew until I made his rig tell him a bunch of **** using microsoft dictation.. unfortunately he found out it was me- but oh well, I was new to being stealthy.. more excited to hear 'grandma is going to beat that ass' coming out his speakers and imagining the look on his face<br />
<br />
there's even the snowball effect with users who keep the same password for everything.. on sites like this, it doesn't matter (unless you care if someone slanders you on a forum) but on sites that link to your money you should always go with good (numbers and upper/lowercase) long passwords<br />
<br />
basic stuff too like when logging in.. hover over next to the url and make sure ssl is'nt stripped by someone sitting in your lan.. be sure you have no trojans/keygens running and you have a good firewall that warns of lan and wan access and your able to set at least basic rules.. uac should be set all the way up, not the default in 7<br />
<br />
anyone who knows what they're doing exploits the easy first.. and since a majority of people are chickenheads, it's too easy.. for example the stuff I have/wrote personally, you wouldn't even see a slowdown in your network or even know I was monitoring you until I started to strip ssl.. then it would take someone who actually looks when logging in, to see if ssl is working<br />
<br />
I like monitoring myself because it's stealth.. you see where the persons going and get passwords like facebook that are unencrypted and they have no clue anything is happening.. stripping encryption relies on the victim being unaware- or even someone who's not a tool and is just unaware to look if the url starts with https or http<br />
<br />
that is all done without any trojans or compromising the rigs.. it's done by exploiting the way networks work.. like sitting outside your house on the telephone pole listening in on all your coversations<br />
<br />
in defense of these guys.. they found a hole- they got excited.. heck I doubt anyone could resist snooping around.. it's obviously something not on the grid yet.. that's the difference between a infosec hack who's paid off, fat and happy and one who's passionate<br />
<br />
it's not that hard really to get in good habits without being a technical person.. that's what should be given to new users..<br />
<br />
if bathesda can't get it together what chance does the little guy have</div></blockquote><br />
Unfortunately it my case was nothing like this at all, and you shouldn't assume that all identity theft crime is caused by people not bothering to use proper passwords. Kinda like saying "yeah, well she always wear slutty clothes - she deserved to get raped". Wrong in all ways possible.</div>

thought they removed the user info from the torrent.. just wonder how long it'll take before a fix is out (they figure out this new hole)- how many more servers will go down</div>

If you know about the ransoms criminals pester blue chips with on a daily basis and their threats of DDoS attacks (that very often succeed - the DDoS that is, very few blue chips will pay-up) just like back in the good old days of the IRA and bomb threats, then you'll get some idea of how quickly this will all end.

It's going to be interesting to see how this plays out.  Personally, I think that the actions of anonymous and lulzsec are the future, and aren't something to be afraid of.<br />
<br />
If I have a problem with a small local business, i vote with my wallet, and I don't shop there.  I tell my friends of my experience, and they don't shop their either.  My point is made.<br />
<br />
In days gone by, if people had a problem with the government or a business, they'd protest, and things would change.<br />
<br />
Business have gotten too big.  Governments have become too secretive.  No amount of protesting will ever amount to anything any more.  The only thing that big business feels is financial loss.  Businesses have been putting profits before their customers for far, far too long.  Look at Sony...<br />
<br />
Sony get screwed.  They tighten their security.  They spend hundreds of thousands/millions in the process.<br />
<br />
Sony get screwed again. They spend more money, lose more customers/developers. <br />
<br />
And so it goes on...UNTIL...<br />
<br />
Sony decides that they simply need to CHANGE.  They start putting their customers first, and their shareholders second....they accept they can't win the security war, no matter what they throw at it, and simply focus on being "good".<br />
<br />
Sony gets left alone.<br />
<br />
...and I say this coming from the standpoint of someone who runs a business, ethically.<br />
<br />
Viva la revolution.</div>

					<div class="commentCopy">Exactly - people need to stop making out that these idiots are fighting for some greater good. There's nothing grandiose or positive about 'lulz' it's a purile and misguided attempt to try and prove their superiority in the only way they know how to - by making the ordinary guy's life a misery. The REAL world would leave these morons behind in a second if they were 'unplugged'. How many people have had their gaming interrupted and are now worried about their details being spread all over some dirty little torrent site? Like I say - nothing noble here. Lulzsec need to wash themselves.</div>

Ha ha, yeah, I've yet to see a once-all-powerful-and-cocky hacker be caught by the law and NOT look like a scared little boy...<br />
