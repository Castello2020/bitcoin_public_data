Greetings Internets,

We have blissfully obtained records of every single citizen
who gave their records to the security-illiterate
UK government for the 2011 census

We're keeping them under lock and key though...
so don't worry about your privacy
(...until we finish re-formatting them for release)

Myself and the rest of my Lulz shipmates will then embark upon
a trip to ThePirateBay with our beautiful records
for your viewing pleasure!

Ahoy! Bwahahaha... &gt;:]

Cap'n Pierre "Lulz" Dubois

<p>This is not a <a title="BLOGDIAL   » Substitution" href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?cat=49">substitution</a>, or an <a title="BLOGDIAL  » Blog Archive   » ContactPoint Database Leaked: 2.3 Million Children in Danger" href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=750">extraploated future scenario</a> of the type we have used in the past to illustrate the dangers of centralized databases of your personal, private and sensitive data.</p>
<p>THIS IS <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REAL</span>! &gt;&gt; UPDATE: OR MAYBE NOT!</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/lulzsec/status/83168314527981568" target="_blank">LulzSec</a>:<br />
Not sure we claimed to hack the UK census or where that rumour started, but we assume it&#8217;s because people are stupider than you and I.</p>
<p>Anyone in the world can copy and paste The Lulz Boat ASCII art and general lighthearted theme. Smarten up, check the feed first.</p>
<p>But hey, if someone out there hacked the UK government in the name of #AntiSec, well done sirs!<br />
</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>It seems that LulzSec may NOT have access to the UK Census Data! Or maybe someone else does, and wants to post it under their name&#8230;. who knows? If something turns up on The Pirate Bay, then we will know that its true. Even if a single entry from the Census DB is leaked, with the table structure and everything, that would mean that the data is O.U.T. <strong>OUT</strong>!</p>
<p>LulzSec should start PGP signing their statements so that no one can forge them&#8230;</p>
<p>Even if this time, the data has not escaped, this doesn&#8217;t invalidate what we and all the people who understand this problem have been saying.</p>
<p>There is nothing in the world that can stop a determined person from copying the data from any database, and there is no way that the UK Census Data is secure in <i>any</i> database where it is stored. That is an incontrovertible and indisputable <b>fact</b>. There is no way of knowing wether or not this data has not already been copied by someone. The statement relased by the UK Census people in response to this fake Lulzsec announcement said only that they are &#8216;looking into it&#8217; not, &#8220;we have your data safe, and no one has copied it&#8221;. <i>See what I mean?</i></p>

					<p>This astonishing document is snarfed from <a href="http://www.tpuc.org/content/wirral-council-–-admits-council-tax-unlawf">the TPUC site</a>:</p>
<p>+++++++</p>
<p>This is taken from <a href="http://www.nocounciltax.com">nocounciltax.com<br />
</a><br />
OK &ndash; so now the cracks are really beginning to appear. </p>
<p>I am indebted to my good friend and fellow Freeman on the land, for allowing me to use his documentation for this:-<br />
Let me fill you in on the background so you have the case history:- </p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim&rdquo; (As we will call him&rdquo;) is a Freeman on the Land along with us (More on that here <a href="http://www.nocounciltax.com/www.TPUC.org" target="_blank">www.TPUC.org</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.thinkfree.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=48&amp;Itemid=97" target="_blank">www.thinkfree.ca</a>) &ndash; and a few months back he decided (Like many of us) that he wasn&rsquo;t going to pay the UNLAWFUL Council tax that they were trying to enforce upon him via thier unlawful statute legislation. So he stopped paying:-</p>
<p>In due course he started receiving the threatening letters until one day the &ldquo;summons&rdquo; appeared on his doormat. (Note: A summons is merely an invitation to attend their place of business to discuss a punishment &ndash; its an offer &ndash; <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/summons" target="_blank">Read more</a> &#8211; just as the Council Tax Bill is an offer to contract with them &ndash; read more on this)</p>
<p>The &ldquo;invitation&rdquo; was to appear before Wirral Magistrates Court for a hearing concerning the issuing of a liability hearing. Now as we all now ALL magistrates courts are merely a trading styles of the &ldquo;run for profit&rdquo; company called &ldquo;Ministry of Justice&rdquo; &ndash; see below and you can get a copy of the document I have acquired clearly showing:-</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The corporate status of the Ministry of Justice</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Directors (Lord Falconer of Thoroton &amp; Others)</strong></li>
<li><strong>The fact that Ministry of Justice has County Court Jugements against it</strong></li>
<li><strong>The trading styles of MOJ (Top right &ndash; which includes &ldquo;Magistrates Courts&rdquo;</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>MINISTRY OF JUSTICE IS A BUSINESS</strong><br />
<img align="top" size-thumbnail="" wp-image-72="" title="MOJ_1" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.tpuc.org/files/image/MOJ_1_1.jpg?resize=692%2C978" alt="MOJ_1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> </p>
<p>Now call me blonde but I would say this is pretty damned conclusive that we are dealing with a corporate court convened by a corporation to simply lift money from you and I. </p>
<p>So &hellip; &ldquo;Jim&rdquo; jotted the council a little letter which is shown below:- </p>
<p><strong>FIRST LETTER TO WIRRAL COUNCIL </p>
<p></strong><br />
<img align="top" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.tpuc.org/files/image/RGWCC_1_1.jpg?resize=692%2C978" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
Jim sent this letter about THREE WEEKS before the date that the hearing was due to be heard on.<br />
So &hellip; the DAY BEFORE the hearing, Jim received a phone call from the Wirral Council LEGAL DEPARTMENT and what they said was staggering &hellip; </p>
<p>THEY WERE GOING TO WITHDRAW THE APPLICATION FOR A LIABILITY ORDER!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Now this is incredible that on the back of one letter they decide to withdraw and more importantly confirms the following:-</strong></li>
<li><strong>Council tax is UNLAWFUL, as you and I well know that if these leeches had once ounce of a lawful case for taking this money then they would fight it to the death</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>They KNOW Council Tax is unlawful and are simply robbing those who haven&rsquo;t woken up to the facts yet to the tune of &pound;140,000,000,000 per annum (thats 140 BILLION of our money!)<br />
So, Jim being the experienced fellow he is &ndash; asked them to email him with confirmation that they were going to withdraw and printed below is their email. </p>
<p><strong>WIRRAL COUNCIL CONFIRMATION OF WITHDRAWAL BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO LAWFUL CASE</strong>  </p>
<p><img align="top" size-large="" wp-image-76="" title="RGWCC_2" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.tpuc.org/files/image/RGWCC_2_2.jpg?resize=692%2C978" alt="RGWCC_2" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
Jim then asked for further clarification in a formal letter and here is the letter that they sent! </p>
<p><strong>LETTER FROM WIRRAL COUNCIL CONFIRMING THEIR WITHDRAWAL FORM COUNCIL TAX LIABILITY HEARING</strong>  </p>
<p><img align="top" size-large="" wp-image-77="" title="RGWCC_3" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.tpuc.org/files/image/RGWCC_3_3.jpg?resize=692%2C978" alt="RGWCC_3" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
Then Jim asked them to confirm in writing that because there was now NO LIABILY that the council tax was no longer due<br />
This is the letter they and this is probably (in my opinion) one of THE single most important documents in the fight against Council Tax as it PROVES beyond ANY DOUBT that we DO NOT HAVE TO PAY this UNLAWFUL COUNCIL TAX.<br />
Look at the bit in red! </p>
<p><strong>LETTER FROM WIRRAL COUNCIL CONFIRMING THAT COUNCIL TAX DOES NOT HAVE TO BE PAID</strong> </p>
<p><img align="top" size-large="" wp-image-78="" title="RGWCC_4" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.tpuc.org/files/image/RGWCC_4_4.jpg?resize=692%2C978" alt="RGWCC_4" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
So not believing a word of the Council or the courts Jim rocked up to the court on the morning of the Liability hearing and standing as a Freeman on the Land asked the Judge to confirm the withdrawal of the other side which the Judge duly confirmed. The judge then told Jim that he needn&rsquo;t have turned up and then Jim hit with it.<br />
&ldquo;I know that sir, but there is the small matter of mys costs&rdquo; </p>
<p><strong>BAM! &ndash; They were not expecting that one!</strong> </p>
<p>So, Jim has now duly entered a claim for costs of &pound;1,400 against Wirral Council which is still ongoing at this time as the courts are trying to play silly buggers with Jim &ndash; he has even had one judge step down and refuse to adjudicate in favour of his costs &ndash; as you can see &ndash; its a stitch up! </p>
<p>Anyway &ndash; Jim has some other things planned and I will keep you abreast of developments but there you have it.<br />
A UK Council running away from a court hearing because they KNOW they dont have a LAWFUL leg to stand on and the whole Council Tax is a scam to relieve you and I of money.</p>
<p>+++++++</p>
<p>Now. After having read that, and caught your breath after having counted from one to ten slowly, you need to ask yourself two questions.</p>
<p><strong>
<ol>
<li>If the councils are nothing more than private companies, how is it that the &#8216;social services&#8217; attached to them are able to steal children? If Tesco&#8217;s came to your house asking to see your children, &#8220;to make sure they are safe&#8221; you would laugh in their face would you not?</li>
<li>How is it that these people think they can serve you with a school attendance order, if everything else they do is accepted by them as non binding without a written and signed contract?</li>
</ol>

					<p>The Renegade Parent has <a href="http://www.renegadeparent.net/post/Is-Ed-Balls-God.aspx" title="renegadeparent.net | Is Ed Balls God?">a great post about Ed Balls</a>.</p>
<p>I have been looking into this creature over the last few days, and found two articles that sum him up perfectly:</p>
<blockquote><h3>Our children have had the MMR jab, says Brown&#8217;s Cabinet friend</h3>
<p>By GLEN OWEN</p>
<p><i>A key Cabinet ally of Gordon Brown has let it be known his children have had the controversial MMR vaccine, in a clear break with former Premier Tony Blair&#8217;s policy of refusing to discuss the issue.</i></p>
<p><img src="http://i1.wp.com/img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/08_04/edballsMS0109_468x419.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"><br />
<i>Going public: Yvette Cooper and Ed Balls with baby Elle in 1999</i></p>
<p>Schools Secretary Ed Balls, who has three children with his wife, Communities Minister Yvette Cooper, sanctioned the release of the information in the week that officials revealed Britain is in the middle of the worst measles outbreak for 20 years.</p>
<p>In allowing the disclosure, Mr Balls &#8211; who was Mr Brown&#8217;s right-hand man at the Treasury for nearly a decade &#8211; has broken ranks with Mr Blair&#8217;s long-standing ban on Ministers saying whether their children have had the controversial vaccine.</p>
<p>Campaigners are now calling on the Prime Minister to declare publicly that his children, too, have had the MMR inoculation.</p>
<p>Take-up of the vaccine, which also protects against mumps and rubella, plummeted after Dr Andrew Wakefield published research in 1998 that claimed it was linked to autism and bowel problems.</p>
<p>Mr Blair &#8211; who has repeatedly refused to say whether his son, Leo, had the jab &#8211; was furious at the embarrassment caused to him in January 2001 when Ms Cooper told a newspaper that her daughter, Ellie, had received the inoculation.</p>
<p>He later slapped the ban on Ministers speaking about their personal decisions.</p>
<p>Since then, Mr Balls and Ms Cooper &#8211; who is also in the Cabinet &#8211; have had two more children reach vaccination age (there are two injections, one at 13 months and a booster between the ages of three and five).</p>
<p>Mr Balls&#8217; decision to lead by example follows a warning from the Health Protection Agency that the number of children suffering from measles has trebled in the past 11 weeks.</p>
<p>The HPA, concerned that even more children will be infected as the autumn term begins, has urged parents to add MMR to their back-to-school list.</p>
<p>After Dr Wakefield published his research in The Lancet, take-up of the vaccine fell to 80 per cent.</p>
<p>It has since recovered to 88 per cent, which is still short of the 95 per cent rate the HPA recommends.</p>
<p>The study is being scrutinised by medical watchdog the General Medical Council in a professional misconduct hearing involving Dr Wakefield and two of his co-authors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a series of briefings timed to coincide with the start of the new term, Mr Balls announced he will write to every headteacher in the country to urge them to help deliver &#8216;a world-class education for every child&#8217;.</p>
<p>The new term also sees the start of a ban on schools selling fizzy drinks, chocolates or sweets in vending machines.</p>
<p>From now on, pupils will have to choose from foods such as bagels, muffins and breadsticks.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-479368/Our-children-MMR-jab-says-Browns-Cabinet-friend.html" title="Our children have had the MMR jab, says Brown's Cabinet friend  | Mail Online">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/</a></p></blockquote>
<p>This is a man (and his &#8216;wife&#8217;) who would use (and if he gave the MMR specifically for this purpose, SACRIFICE) his daughter&#8217;s health to show support and undying loyalty for the evil gargoyle Gordon Brown, and to curry political favor.</p>
<p>If he will do this with his own child, <i>imagine what he would do with yours?</i> Well, you do not have to; you have the Balls and Badman report in your hands.</p>
<p>And here, we have an example of the Balls anti family agenda, where the school and the state are the new parent in the totalitarian dystopia being born in the UK:</p>
<blockquote><h3>Teachers &#8216;must worry about pupils when they go home&#8217;, warns education secretary Balls</h3>
<p>Teachers have a responsibility for what happens to children after they return home from school, Education Secretary Ed Balls warned today.</p>
<p>On the day that he and Gordon Brown are launching a national debate in Bristol on the future of children&#8217;s services, Mr Balls has urged schools to do more beyond their gates.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not every school sees their responsibility as worrying about what happens when the child goes home&#8230; and they should,&#8221; he told The Guardian.</p>
<p>Praising breakfast clubs for giving children a good start, Mr Balls added: &#8220;A little boy may not eat between leaving school and coming back the next day. There&#8217;s no way the school can solve that problem.</p>
<p><img src="http://i0.wp.com/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2006/06/eballs170606_228x218.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>&#8220;It requires parents with the support of social services to do that, but the school can provide an early warning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Balls dismissed Tory claims that society in Britain is &#8220;broken&#8221; following the spate of killings of teenagers in London and other cities.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are always going to be some kids that get into more serious trouble with the law, but we shouldn&#8217;t demonise young people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Gordon Brown today opened the first new school built under the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme.</p>
<p>He arrived at the Bristol Brunel Academy in the inner city Speedwell area flanked by Mr Balls.</p>
<p>The school is the first in England to be completed under the Government&#8217;s £45 billion BSF programme.</p>
<p>The initiative is intended to re-build or refurbish every one of England&#8217;s state secondary schools over the next 15 years.</p>
<p>About 1,000 pupils moved into the school this morning which replaces Speedwell Technology College whose crumbling buildings sit immediately in front of the gleaming new academy.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister will tour and then officially open the new school.</p>
<p>Later this morning he will take part in the first citizen jury held in the school&#8217;s sports hall.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister looked at a &#8220;wishing wall&#8221; at the school entrance which is covered in messages from pupils.</p>
<p>One message read &#8220;I wish I could eat toenails&#8221; while another read &#8220;I wish to become a successful accountant&#8221;.</p>
<p>He then chatted with pupils, each with their own personal laptop computer, in a Year 7 IT class being taught in one of the school&#8217;s many open-plan classrooms.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister then visited pupils undertaking a soldering lesson in a craft design and technology class.</p>
<p>The pupils were guided by overhead monitors in a state-of-the-art classroom as they worked on circuit boards.</p>

<blockquote><h4>Essex funds home tutoring</h4>
<p>Essex CC is to award a group of parents cash towards home tutoring.</p>
<p>The parents were given £10,450 after they refused to send their children to their local school, which has been placed in special measures. They had applied to several schools in the area but failed to get their fourth choice.</p>
<p>One of the mothers, Holly O’Toole, said the councils will find it ‘very difficult’ to refuse other people in her position.</p>
<p>She said: ‘Living locally, you just hear so much bad press about [the local school]. I don’t see why we should have to send our children there.’</p>
<p>Essex CC granted the money for the youngsters’ education because the private tutoring was draining the family’s finances.  </p>
<p>A spokesman from Essex CC said: &#8216;We have always considered and will continue to consider any requests from parents for financial support on their own merits.&#8217;</p>
<p>But he added that the council did not expect the pay outs to &#8216;become the norm.&#8217;</p>
<p>[...]</p>

<p>This is ASTONISHING news.</p>
<p>Hopefully it does not come with any strings attached.</p>
<p>The only problem with it is, of course, that the money the council is giving to these parents is stolen, but apart from that, it is very encouraging.</p>
<p>You would have expected the council to bus these students to schools that are further away instead of paying them to Home Educate. That they understand that Home Education is not only an option, but one worth paying parents to do is&#8230; breathtaking; especially in the current situation where Home Education is being viciously and maliciously attacked.</p>
<p>I can tell you something right now; £10,450 ($15,777.52 or 17&frac14;oz/au) to help home Educate is <i>a lot of money</i>; many HE families get along with a fraction of that, and succeed. Some Home Educating parents putting their children through exams cannot afford the cost of several private sittings in one go, and so have to opt for spreading the exams out. Finding exam centers outside of London is difficult; many parents have to visit the capital so their children can sit exams; that means extra costs. Money like this would help tremendously; even better would be to open the schools so that HE children can sit exams at their local school. Minor digression.</p>
<p>This means that other councils might decline to allocate stolen money to Home Educators, but will simply leave them alone.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Parents given home teaching money</b></p>
<p>A group of parents who refused to send their children to a failing Essex school has been awarded more than £10,450 towards home tutoring.</p>
<p>Essex County Council said it would help towards the education of six children aged between 11 and 12.</p>
<p>The pupils have been receiving private lessons since September after their parents stopped them attending Bishops Park College in Clacton-on-Sea.</p>
<p>The families said Essex County Council had set a precedent for other parents.</p>
<p>Holly O&#8217;Toole, whose 12-year-old son Harry is among the pupils being taught at home, said the education authority&#8217;s decision could prompt other parents to take similar action.</p>
<p>Ms O&#8217;Toole said: &#8220;I definitely think the council has set a precedent.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be very difficult for them to say &#8216;no&#8217; to anybody who is in the same position as us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms O&#8217;Toole said the six children didn&#8217;t even get into their fourth choice of school.</p>
<p>&#8220;People complain when they don&#8217;t get their first choice school but we didn&#8217;t even get our fourth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bishops Park is in special measures. You just hear so much bad press about it. I don&#8217;t see why we should have to send our children there.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Essex County Council said: &#8220;The payment followed an initial discussion around parents establishing their own school, and we are pleased to be in a position to assist.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have always considered, and will continue to consider, any requests from parents for financial support on their merits.&#8221;<br />
The families said the money would pay for the four boys and two girls&#8217; lessons until the end of term after which they hope to get into one of the four local schools they had initially applied for.</p>

<p>&#8220;The £10,000 grant will help parents pay the £100 a week per pupil to educate the children at home&#8221;</p>

<p>The joys of clubbing in England! That was at the M-nus event in London last weekend! Fuck me!! </p>
<p>Rules rules rules&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.you will become our subordinates you worthless, druggy, addicted cunts!! </p>
<p>I fucking hope people stop going clubbing in this cuntry. We&#8217;re the reason these promoter/club owner bastards are in fucking business! I know its not their fault about the law, but it IS their fault with all these additional rules &#038; charges. £1 for a fucking wristband that allows you to do exactly fuck all as you still have to do a fingerprint like a fucking criminal and a have a time limit imposed on you! </p>
<p>The people need to make a stand by not going anymore to clubs like this one! Only ones that are blatantly taking the piss though which one or two are starting to in my experiences. We should start a list on here of the worst offenders! Manchester&#8217;s Warehouse Project the night before wouldn&#8217;t let people take their £3.50 beers outside for a fag neither! You had to stand there and drink it first, go for a quick fag and then go in and buy another £3.50 beer! Another nice money making ploy! </p>
<p>By the way I&#8217;m not even a massive smoker. I just like the odd one or two through a night. Its the blatant way the clubs are screwing people for more money in these ways thats angered me! They&#8217;re starting to use a law as a way to line their pockets even more! And entrance fee&#8217;s to some of these nights ain&#8217;t exactly cheap to begin with! With all the fucking booking fee&#8217;s etc I paid £24 to the Warehouse Project!! Clubs are meant to be an escape from the real world for a few hours yet there are more rules in them these days than at work! Had to be in before 11.30pm even with pre bought tickets. Couldn&#8217;t put anything in the cloak room after 1.30am. Event finished at 6am instead of the advertised, &#8220;special&#8221; 7am license. Whats this shit all about?? </p>
<p>Revolution for change!! </p>

<p>Please go to the bar and purchase a smoking wristband for thenight, the cost will be £1.00.<br />
When you wish to smoke make your way to the designated smoking ares, where you will be requested to give an imprint of your finger, this will permit you 10 minutes to go out and smoke on the pavement opposite.<br />
On re-entrance to the venue you will be searched again, should you fail to re-enter the venue after 10 minutes, you will be asked to pay the full entry fee by our door staff at the entrance.<br />

					<p>Most of my life, say since the age of fourteen, I have used only one brand of toothpaste (except emergencies). One of the common ones, but probably the least popular in that it doesn&#8217;t <a href="http://www.crest.com/products/flavored.jsp">taste of birthday cake or doughnuts</a>. I chose it because it made my mouth feel good and was neither too sweet nor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthymol">tasted of week-old chewing gum</a>.<br />
Now over time the packaging has changed and so has the formulation, you notice now and then as you pick up the tube but it is similar enough to the last iteration to be called the same thing and your mouth doesn&#8217;t complain.<br />
I mentioned that it was probably the least popular variety and recently it was nowhere to be found, so we got a &#8216;natural&#8217; toothpaste, nice taste of fennel &#8211; how surprised I was &#8211; anyway my gumline complained a little so I went out and got MY toothpaste.<br />
Except now it wasn&#8217;t MY toothpaste anymore, into my mouth it went and what a shock, what chemical hodge-podge was this that was like napalm on my tongue, like bleach on my teeth and a blowtorch to my gums? What subtle changes had accumulated to take MY toothpaste away from me and replace it with this simulacrum, which although appearing to be MY toothpaste, in name, in colour, in active ingredients, was no longer anything of the sort.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a lesson in there somewhere…</p>

					<p><a title="Poor Haitians Resort to Eating Dirt" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/WireStory?id=4212012">Rising Food Costs Force Haiti&rsquo;s Poor to Resort to Eating Dirt</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti</strong></p>
<p>It was lunchtime in one of Haiti&rsquo;s worst slums, and Charlene Dumas was eating mud. With food prices rising, Haiti&rsquo;s poorest can&rsquo;t afford even a daily plate of rice, and some take desperate measures to fill their bellies. Charlene, 16 with a 1-month-old son, has come to rely on a traditional Haitian remedy for hunger pangs: cookies made of dried yellow dirt from the country&rsquo;s central plateau.</p>
<p>The mud has long been prized by pregnant women and children here as an antacid and source of calcium. But in places like Cite Soleil, the oceanside slum where Charlene shares a two-room house with her baby, five siblings and two unemployed parents, cookies made of dirt, salt and vegetable shortening have become a regular meal.</p>
<p><img src="http://i1.wp.com/a.abcnews.com/images/International/ap_Eating_Dirt2_080130_ssh.jpg?resize=497%2C384" alt=""  data-recalc-dims="1"><br />

<p>&ldquo;When my mother does not cook anything, I have to eat them three times a day,&rdquo; Charlene said. Her baby, named Woodson, lay still across her lap, looking even thinner than the slim 6 pounds 3 ounces he weighed at birth.</p>
<p>Though she likes their buttery, salty taste, Charlene said the cookies also give her stomach pains. &ldquo;When I nurse, the baby sometimes seems colicky too,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Food prices around the world have spiked because of higher oil prices, needed for fertilizer, irrigation and transportation. Prices for basic ingredients such as corn and wheat are also up sharply, and the increasing global demand for biofuels is pressuring food markets as well.</p>
<p><img src="http://i1.wp.com/a.abcnews.com/images/International/ap_Eating_Dirt9_080130_ssh.jpg?resize=502%2C389" alt=""  data-recalc-dims="1"><br />
<span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><em>A woman dries mud cookies in the sun on the the roof of Fort Dimanche, once a  prison, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Nov. 29, 2007. Rising prices and food shortages are threatening Haiti&rsquo;s fragile stability, and the mud cookies, made of dirt, salt and vegetable shortening, are one of very few options the poorest people have to stave off hunger. (Ariana Cubillos/ AP Photo)</span></em></p>
<p>The problem is particularly dire in the Caribbean, where island nations depend on imports and food prices are up 40 percent in places.</p>
<p>The global price hikes, together with floods and crop damage from the 2007 hurricane season, prompted the U.N. Food and Agriculture Agency to declare states of emergency in Haiti and several other Caribbean countries. Caribbean leaders held an emergency summit in December to discuss cutting food taxes and creating large regional farms to reduce dependence on imports.</p>
<p>At the market in the La Saline slum, two cups of rice now sell for 60 cents, up 10 cents from December and 50 percent from a year ago. Beans, condensed milk and fruit have gone up at a similar rate, and even the price of the edible clay has risen over the past year by almost $1.50. Dirt to make 100 cookies now costs $5, the cookie makers say.</p>

<p>Still, at about 5 cents apiece, the cookies are a bargain compared to food staples. About 80 percent of people in Haiti live on less than $2 a day and a tiny elite controls the economy.</p>
<p>Merchants truck the dirt from the central town of Hinche to the La Saline market, a maze of tables of vegetables and meat swarming with flies. Women buy the dirt, then process it into mud cookies in places such as Fort Dimanche, a nearby shanty town.</p>
<p>Carrying buckets of dirt and water up ladders to the roof of the former prison for which the slum is named, they strain out rocks and clumps on a sheet, and stir in shortening and salt. Then they pat the mixture into mud cookies and leave them to dry under the scorching sun.</p>
<p>The finished cookies are carried in buckets to markets or sold on the streets.</p>
<p>A reporter sampling a cookie found that it had a smooth consistency and sucked all the moisture out of the mouth as soon as it touched the tongue. For hours, an unpleasant taste of dirt lingered.</p>
<p>Assessments of the health effects are mixed. Dirt can contain deadly parasites or toxins, but can also strengthen the immunity of fetuses in the womb to certain diseases, said Gerald N. Callahan, an immunology professor at Colorado State University who has studied geophagy, the scientific name for dirt-eating.</p>
<p>Haitian doctors say depending on the cookies for sustenance risks malnutrition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trust me, if I see someone eating those cookies, I will discourage it,&rdquo; said Dr. Gabriel Thimothee, executive director of Haiti&rsquo;s health ministry.</p>
<p>Marie Noel, 40, sells the cookies in a market to provide for her seven children. Her family also eats them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hoping one day I&rsquo;ll have enough food to eat, so I can stop eating these,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s not good for me.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>A point of interest: in cities such as Amsterdam, these bikes are regularly stolen by junkies. No one seems to get upset. One simply whisks round to the thieves&#8217; market and buys a similar bike, perhaps even the very one that was stolen, for around £20. It is almost a form of socialism.</p>

					<p>Shall we scratch the surface of Mormonism?</p>
<p><b>17. Church Prejudice Against Blacks</b></p>
<p>From the translated scroll written by Abraham comes the important doctrine that descendants of Cain (taught by Mormons to be African-Americans) are unworthy to hold the priesthood, the authority to act in God&#8217;s name. This clearly racist policy was changed in 1978 through another &#8220;revelation.&#8221; While Blacks could always be baptized into the Mormon Church, up until 1978 they could not hold the priesthood. This excluded them from the &#8220;saving ordinances&#8221; of the temple, and thus kept them from exaltation as the Mormons defined it.</p>
<p>Consider the following declarations by church Prophets and Apostles:</p>
<p><b>President Brigham Young:</b></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Shall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African Race? If the White man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is death on the spot. This will always be so.&#8221; (<i>Journal of Discourses</i> 10:110)</p></blockquote>
<p>President Joseph Fielding Smith:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There is a reason why one man is born black and with other disadvantages, while another is born white with great advantages. The reason is that we once had an estate before we came here, and were obedient, more or less, to the laws that were given us there. Those who were faithful in all things there received greater blessings here, and those who were not faithful received less.&#8221; (<i>Doctrines of Salvation</i>, p. 61)</p></blockquote>
<p>Apostle Bruce R. McConkie:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Negroes in this life are denied the priesthood; under no circumstances can they hold this delegation of authority from the Almighty. The gospel message of salvation is not carried affirmatively to them&#8230; Negroes are not equal with other races where the receipt of certain spiritual blessings are concerned…&#8221; (<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>, p. 343)</p></blockquote>
<p>Apostle Mark E. Petersen: </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;God has commanded Israel not to intermarry. To go against this commandment of God would be in sin. Those who willfully sin with their eyes open to this wrong will not be surprised to find that they will be separated from the presence of God in the world to come. This is spiritual death…</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason that one would lose his blessings by marrying a Negro is due to the restriction placed upon them. &#8220;No person having the least particle of Negro blood can hold the Priesthood&#8221; (Brigham Young). It does not matter if they are one-sixth Negro or one-hundred and sixth, the curse of no Priesthood is the same. If an individual who is entitled to the Priesthood marries a Negro, the Lord has decreed that only spirits who are not eligible for the Priesthood will come to that marriage as children. To intermarry with a Negro is to forfeit a &#8220;Nation of Priesthood holders…</p>
<p>&#8220;The discussion on civil rights, especially over the last 20 years, has drawn some very sharp lines. It has blinded the thinking of some of our own people, I believe. They have allowed their political affiliations to color their thinking to some extent, and then, of course, they have been persuaded by some of the arguments that have been put forth…We who teach in the Church certainly must have our feet on the ground and not to be led astray by the philosophies of men on this subject… </p>
<p>&#8220;I think I have read enough to give you an idea of what the Negro is after. He is not just seeking the opportunity of sitting down in a cafe where white people eat. He isn&#8217;t just trying to ride on the same streetcar or the same Pullman car with white people. It isn&#8217;t that he just desires to go to the same theater as the white people. From this, and other interviews I have read, it appears that the Negro seeks absorption with the white race. He will not be satisfied until he achieves it by intermarriage. That is his objective and we must face it. We must not allow our feelings to carry us away, nor must we feel so sorry for Negroes that we will open our arms and embrace them with everything we have. Remember the little statement that we used to say about sin, &#8216;First we pity, then endure, then embrace&#8217;… </p>
<p>&#8220;Now let&#8217;s talk about segregation again for a few moments. Was segregation a wrong principle? When the Lord chose the nations to which the spirits were to come, determining that some would be Japanese and some would be Chinese and some Negroes and some Americans, He engaged in an act of segregation… </p>
<p>&#8220;When he told Enoch not preach the gospel to the descendants of Cain who were black, the Lord engaged in segregation. When He cursed the descendants of Cain as to the Priesthood, He engaged in segregation… </p>
<p>&#8220;Who placed the Negroes originally in darkest Africa? Was it some man, or was it God? And when He placed them there, He segregated them… </p>
<p>&#8220;The Lord segregated the people both as to blood and place of residence. At least in the cases of the Lamanites and the Negro we have the definite word of the Lord Himself that he placed a dark skin upon them as a curse &#8212; as a punishment and as a sign to all others. He forbade intermarriage with them under threat of extension of the curse. And He certainly segregated the descendants of Cain when He cursed the Negro as to the Priesthood, and drew an absolute line. You may even say He dropped an Iron curtain there…</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we are generous with the Negro. We are willing that the Negro have the highest education. I would be willing to let every Negro drive a Cadillac if they could afford it. I would be willing that they have all the advantages they can get out of life in the world. But let them enjoy these things among themselves. I think the Lord segregated the Negro and who is man to change that segregation? It reminds me of the scripture on marriage, &#8216;what God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.&#8217; Only here we have the reverse of the thing &#8211; what God hath separated, let not man bring together again. </p>
<p>&#8220;Think of the Negro, cursed as to the priesthood…This Negro, who, in the pre-existence lived the type of life which justified the Lord in sending him to the earth in their lineage of Cain with a black skin, and possibly being born in darkest Africa&#8211;if that Negro is willing when he hears the gospel to accept it, he may have many of the blessings of the gospel. In spite of all he did in the pre-existent life, the Lord is willing, if the Negro accepts the gospel with real, sincere faith, and is really converted, to give him the blessings of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost. If that Negro is faithful all his days, he can and will enter the celestial kingdom. He will go there as a servant, but he will get celestial glory.&#8221; (Apostle Mark E.

<p><b>Apologist Response</b></p>
<p>Apostle Bruce R. McConkie explained how earlier statements by church leaders on African-Americans and the priesthood should be disregarded because their understanding was limited at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are statements in our literature by the early Brethren that we have interpreted to mean that the Negroes would not receive the priesthood in mortality. I have said the same things, and people write me letters and say, &#8220;You said such and such, and how is it now that we do such and such?&#8221; All I can say is that it is time disbelieving people repented and got in line and believed in a living, modern prophet. Forget everything that I have said, or what President Brigham Young or President George Q. Cannon or whoever has said in days past that is contrary to the present revelation. We spoke with a limited understanding and without the light and knowledge that now has come into the world. </p>
<p>&#8220;We get our truth and light line upon line and precept upon precept (2 Ne. 28:30; Isa. 28:9-10; D&amp;C 98:11-12; 128:21). We have now added a new flood of intelligence and light on this particular subject, and it erases all the darkness and all the views and all the thoughts of the past. They don&#8217;t matter anymore.&#8221; (Apostle Bruce R. McConkie, <i>All Are Alike Unto God</i>, pp. 1-2)

<p>Marvin Perkins explained the <i>Book of Mormon</i> teaching that those &#8220;cursed&#8221; with a &#8220;skin of blackness&#8221; could remove the &#8220;curse&#8221; by coming unto God:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are Blacks here today who are members of the Church. Why have we not turned White? But there are Blacks who have joined the Church, married White spouse, and their children became lighter than their Black parents. Then those kids grew up to marry those that believe as they do, which most are White, so they married White, and their kids became even lighter, and so on. Makes you think a bit, doesn&#8217;t it? (Marvin Perkins, <a class="menu" href="http://www.fairlds.org/apol/misc/misc19.html">Blacks and the Priesthood</a>, FAIR)&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball described the process through which the church decided to bestow all church privileges upon African-Americans:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It went on for some time as I was searching for this, because I wanted to be sure. We held a meeting of the Council of the Twelve in the temple on the regular day. We considered this very seriously and thoughtfully and prayerfully.<br />
 &#8220;I asked the Twelve not to go home when the time came. I said, &#8216;now would you be willing to remain in the temple with us?&#8217; And they were. I offered the final prayer and I told the Lord if it wasn&#8217;t right, if He didn&#8217;t want this change to come in the Church that I would he true to it all the rest of my life, and I&#8217;d fight the world against it if that&#8217;s what He wanted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had this special prayer circle, then I knew that the time had come. I had a great deal to fight, of course, myself largely, because I had grown up with this thought that Negroes should not have the priesthood and I was prepared to go all the rest of my life till my death and fight for it and defend it as it was. But this revelation and assurance came to me so clearly that there was no question about it.&#8221; (President Spencer W. Kimball, <i>Deseret News</i>, Church Section, January 6, 1979, p. 19)
</p></blockquote>
<p>According to President Gordon B. Hinckley, he simply doesn&#8217;t know why Blacks were denied the priesthood until 1978:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;HN: Until 1978 no person of color attained the priesthood in your church. Why did it take so long to overcome the racism? </p>
<p>&#8220;GBH: I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know. I can only say that. (long pause) But it&#8217;s here now. We&#8217;re carrying on a very substantial work on Africa for instance and in Brazil. We&#8217;re working among their people developing them. We&#8217;ve had them among the leadership of the Church and they&#8217;re able to do a great work and we love them and appreciate them and we respect them and we are trying to help them.&#8221; (Gordon B. Hinckley Interview, ZDF German Television, Salt Lake City, Utah, January 29, 2002, Conducted by Helmut Nemetschek)</p></blockquote>

<p>And we continue&#8230;</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Friction between Mormons and other other Christians has been present during the entire history of the LDS Church. There were a number of reasons why most Christians rejected the <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153, 255, 153);">Mormon</b> movement during the 19th century:</p>
<p>Their religious exclusivity, communal lifestyle, and &#8220;<i>Mormons first and for themselves</i>&#8221; lifestyle were criticized. Joseph Smith&#8217;s visions were rejected as frauds. Some of his theological teachings about the nature of God, structure of Heaven, requirements for salvation, history of the Americas, etc. were rejected as heresy. Plural marriage in particular was considered totally unacceptable behavior. Smith&#8217;s elevation of three writings to equality with the Bible was considered offensive. Smith&#8217;s new translation of the Bible was viewed as heretical. Smith&#8217;s political goals were viewed as threatening to his neighbors. They feared that he wanted to establish a theocracy.</p>
<p>The movement has been growing rapidly &#8212; on the order of 10% per decade &#8212; since it was founded. This is perceived by some Christian groups as a threat.  </p>
<p>Today, even though plural marriage has been at least temporarily suspended for over a century, many of the above points of conflict continue. <a href="lds_hist.htm?PHPSESSID=a53d05ecc1b9bf94e31d62a1eb0d2fcb">During the early years, opposition</a> by other Christians was violent. Much blood was shed. Now, the battle it is a mainly war of words:  The general meetings of the <i>United Methodist Church</i>, and <i> Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)</i> and <i>Southern Baptist Convention</i> have stated, in their opinion, the LDS is a denomination that is separate from the Christian religion:</p>
<p>The <i>General Conference</i> of the <b> <i>United Methodist Church</i></b> approved a document on 2000-MAY-10: &#8220;<i>Sacramental Faithfulness: Guidelines for Receiving People From the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons)</i>&#8221; The document says, in part, that:<br />
<blockquote> &#8220;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, by self-definition, does not fit within the bounds of the historic, apostolic tradition of Christian faith&#8230;[Mormons'] explicitly [profess] distinction and separateness from the ecumenical community.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>The document also recommends that individual Mormons first formally remove themselves from the LDS before seeking membership in the <i>United Methodist Church</i>. <sub><b>1</b></sub></p>
<p> According to a pamphlet produced by the <b><i>Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)</i></b>,&nbsp;<br />
<blockquote> &#8220;&#8230;Mormonism is a new and emerging religious tradition distinct from the historic apostolic tradition of the Christian Church, of which Presbyterians are a part&#8230;Latter-day Saints understand themselves to be separate from the continuous witness to Jesus Christ, from the apostles to the present, affirmed by churches of the &#8220;catholic&#8221; tradition. Latter-day Saints and the historic churches view the canon of scriptures and interpret shared scriptures in radically different ways. They use the same words with dissimilar meanings. When the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints speaks of the Trinity, Christ&#8217;s death and <a href="resurrec.htm?PHPSESSID=a53d05ecc1b9bf94e31d62a1eb0d2fcb">resurrection</a>, and <a href="salvatio.htm?PHPSESSID=a53d05ecc1b9bf94e31d62a1eb0d2fcb">salvation</a>, the theology and practices related to these set it apart from the Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant churches.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>Presbyterians do not recognize the baptism administered to Mormons. A convert must be re-baptized. Similarly Presbyterians do not allow LDS officials to administer the Lord&#8217;s Supper.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p>LA Times, reporting on Governor Romney&#8217;s possible 2008 bid for the presidency, wrote&nbsp; that: &#8220;Pastor Ted Haggard, [at the time] president of the <i>National Association of Evangelicals </i>(NEA)<i> </i>in Colorado Springs, CO said:<br />
<blockquote>&#8221; &#8216;We evangelicals view Mormons as a <a href="ccm.htm?PHPSESSID=a53d05ecc1b9bf94e31d62a1eb0d2fcb">Christian cult group</a>. A cult group is a group that claims exclusive revelation. And typically, it&#8217;s hard to get out of these cult groups. And so Mormonism qualifies as that&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;In addition, Haggard said, evangelicals do not accept <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153, 255, 153);">Mormon</b> Church founder Joseph Smith as a prophet. &#8216;And we do not believe that the Book of <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153, 255, 153);">Mormon</b> has the same level of authority as the Bible,&#8217; he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When Romney says that he accepts Jesus Christ as his savior, &#8216;we appreciate that,&#8217; Haggard said. &#8216;But very often when people like Mormons use terms that we also use, there are different meanings in the theology behind those terms&#8217;.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/lds_crit.htm" title="Theological criticism of the Mormon movement">http://www.religioustolerance.org/lds_crit.htm</a></p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Hmmm &#8220;Messy&#8221; is one of the first words that comes to mind.</p>
<p>Once again, Romney, whatever he believes, cannot do the job because he is not a man of peace and reason. He is a man of deception, war and ignorance, with a palpable lust for power.</p>
<p>I would be very surprised if this doesnt become a huge issue for Mitt, even more than it has so far. Against Ron Paul it wont make a big impact, but in a theoretical contest between Romney and O-Bomb-a, the Mormon racist issue will explode.</p>
<p>Finally, the best description of why the Mormons accepted &#8216;Blacks&#8217; is to be found <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/mo2/blackmormon/homepage.html" title="Black Mormon Homepage">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>THE 1978 Revelation</b></p>
<p>In the early 1970s the Church was building a Temple in Sao Paulo, Brazil, only to discover that most white Brazilian men had at least one Negro ancestor. According to Church policy, white men with one Negro ancestor were under the Curse of Cain and could not hold the Priesthood. But, all of these white men had already been ordained to the Priesthood. What to do? If the priesthood-ban policy continued, it would disqualify 85% of white Brazilian Mormons from the Priesthood and the Higher Ordinances of the Temple, then being built in Sao Paulo.</p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball then spent many hours in the Upper Room (Holy of Holies) in the Salt Lake Temple, supplicating the LORD, and asking Him to remove the Curse of Cain from those with a Canaanite bloodline. The LORD accepted the supplications of his Prophet, and told Spencer W. Kimball that the curse upon the lineage was over. President Kimball decided to announce this on June 8th, 1978, seven years (to the day) that the Genesis Group of Black Latter-day Saints was founded by three black Mormons: Ruffin Bridgeforth Jr., Darius Gray, and Eugene Orr.</p>
<p>The Priesthood-ban Policy continued until June 8th, 1978, when it was recinded by Mormon Church President Spencer W. Kimball. Since then, black Mormons have all the same rights and blessings as any other Mormon.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>June 8 1978</b><br />
To all general and local priesthood officers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints throughout the world:<br />
Dear Brethren:</p>
<p>As we have witnessed the expansion of the work of the Lord over the earth, we have been grateful that people of many nations have responded to the message of the restored gospel, and have joined the Church in ever-increasing numbers. This, in turn, has inspired us with a desire to extend to every worthy member of the Church all the privileges and blessings which the gospel affords.</p>
<p>Aware of the promises made by the prophets and presidents of the Church who have preceded us that at some time, in God&#8217;s eternal plan, all of our brethren who are worthy may receive the priesthood, and witnessing the faithfulness of those from whom the priesthood has been withheld, we have pleaded long and earnestly in behalf of these, our faithful brethren, spending many hours in the Upper Room of the Temple supplicating the Lord for divine guidance.</p>
<p>He has heard our prayers, and by revelation has confirmed that the long-promised day has come when every faithful, worthy man in the Church may receive the holy priesthood, with power to exercise its divine authority, and enjoy with his loved ones every blessing that flows therefrom, including the blessings of the temple. Accordingly, all worthy male members of the Church may be ordained to the priesthod without regard for race and color. Priesthood leaders are instructed to follow the policy of carefully interviewing all candidates for ordination to either the Aaronic or the Melchizedek Priesthood to insure that they meet the established standards for worthiness.</p>
<p>We declare with soberness that the Lord has now made known his will for the blessing of all his children throughout the earth who will hearken to the voice of his authorized servznts, and prepare themselves to receive every blessing of the gospel.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,<br />
SPENCER W. KIMBALL<br />

<p>Note the last name on that list.</p>
<p>That site really is well worth a very close look.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that Mormons had trapped themselves by trying to expand their organization around the world. They could either cut off the Brazilians, Nigerians and all other people world wide (and all of their money) or admit their &#8216;religion&#8217; is false. They took the third way; <b>they changed the religion to suit their needs</b>.</p>
<p>They are free to do so, and believe it, and act on it. Everyone else is also free to act on their beliefs and like I said above, to vote based on them, wether it be voting on breasts, skin color or against a &#8216;cult&#8217;.</p>

<p>A standard 1954 civics test on the U.S. Constitution on which student Kenny Hignite received a 98<sup><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></sup>% score.</p>
<p>You will remember Naomi Wolf and <a href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=701" title="BLOGDIAL  &raquo; Blog Archive   &raquo; Naomi Wolf&#8217;s essay: not nearly enough">our post about her</a>:</p>
<blockquote><blockquote>Because Americans like me were born in freedom, we have a hard time even considering that it is possible for us to become as unfree &#8211; domestically &#8211; as many other nations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Only the weak minded and people who never watched Star Trek re-runs have a hard time ‘considering’ this. This person is of the exact age she needed to be to have this built in apprehension. Also, the American Constitution and its founding fathers designed the country SPECIFICALLY to stop the emergence of tyranny; every REAL american understands that ALL government, ESPECIALLY your own is capable of turning to tyranny. Americans of her generation were taught about this ever-present danger in great clarity; everyone who did ’social studies’ class was given lessons in this, in healthy distrust of government. it is bewildering that an american of that age can even say this.</p>
<blockquote><p>Because we no longer learn much about our rights or our system of government</p></blockquote>
<p>You did, and you forgot!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I wonder if Kenny Hignite remembered his &#8216;Social Studies&#8217; lessons in his adulthood and realized that his country was being dismantled. Even if he did not have a full grasp of the meaning of everything in that exam, he was able to memorize all the facts and reproduce them on the day of the exam in fairly neat handwriting; I know a ten year old and an eight year old who have better handwriting by the way.</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that the principles of freedom, the very core ideas of it are what need to be instilled in the young, and they need to be fully understood before you start talking about government. That is the only way you can be fully prepared and made to see clearly just how unjust and bad government is.</p>
<p>This is the threat that the Germans understand fully; Home Schoolers produce people that are able to think for themselves in ways that are unpredictable, non standard and, to them, undesirable. The Buskeros child simply walked away from the detention centre where she was being held, reminiscent of the scene in THX-1138 where the two felons and the hologram penetrate the infinite white void and SEN, astonished says, &#8220;nothing stopped us!&#8221;. This is the ultimate nightmare for all governments; the tipping point when people understand that their cage is an imaginary one and that there is no one there to stop them from being free.</p>
<p>Of course the Germans are insane for suppressing Home Schoolers; it is precisely those people who create <a href="http://www.oddmusic.com/gallery/om08800.html" title="Daxophone,experimental musical instrument invented by Hans Reichel,bowed and plucked idiophone">the greatest most imaginative works in the future</a>.</p>

					<p>From <a href="http://www.edri.org">Edri</a>-gram:<br />
====================================<br />
8. ELOI &#8211; a French database to manage the expulsion of illegal migrants<br />
====================================</p>
<p>On 26 December 2007, the French government published a decree creating the ELOI file, a database aimed at facilitating the expulsion of illegal migrants. In March 2007, the French highest administrative court cancelled a first attempt by the government to create this file, after 4 French NGOs, among which EDRI member IRIS, filed a case against the Interior ministry.</p>
<p>While the March text was cancelled by the Conseil d’Etat for procedural reasons only, the new version shows some important progress related to concerns raised by the NGOS. The main changes are that no data will be kept on visitors of illegal migrants in retention centres, and that personal data of citizens with which illegal immigrants are staying, when not in retention centres are kept for 3 months rather than 3 years.</p>
<p>While this step backwards from the government side is a direct result of the French NGOs action, the ELOI database remains unacceptable, according to the authors of the former complaint, with regards to the migrants themselves and their families. The duration of the retention of their data remains 3 years for most of the data, and data on their children are still kept in the ELOI file. Last but not least, the database still contains data on “the need for specific surveillance (of the migrant) with regards to the public order’. According to the NGOs, this demonstrates that the government makes a direct association between immigration and criminality.</p>
<p>Moreover, the decree contains new provisions, adding to the ELOI database an impressive amount of administrative and judicial data dealing with all aspects of the expulsion process, most of them to be retained for 3 years. In addition, a new purpose has been set to this file, which is to produce statistics on expulsion decisions and their actual executions.</p>
<p>These problems, as well as the Sarkozy administration setting up quantitative objectives &#8211; a minimum of 25000 expulsions targeted in 2008 &#8211; have made the French NGOs declare that the actual meaning of this file is the government willingness to manage the expulsion of migrants at an unprecedented level. They consider that with the ELOI database, this expulsion policy has reached an industrial level.</p>

					<p>If I may add to Georgia Clifton&#8217;s <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig8/clifton1.html">Open Letter to Home Schooling Parents on Behalf of Ron Paul</a>: </p>
<p>When the <a href="http://www.hslda.org/">Home School Legal Defense Association</a> (HSLDA), an organization of which I am a lifetime member, <a href="http://www.hsldapac.org/dnn/Home/HuckabeeforPresident/tabid/93/Default.aspx">announced this past summer</a> that they were endorsing Mike Huckabee&#8217;s candidacy for President, I had barely heard of Mike Huckabee and decided to do some research and learn about this candidate. As Christians, it is our duty to judge not according to appearance (or words), but to judge righteous judgment. When making weighty decisions such as who will become our next leader, we need to evaluate our choices carefully. My desire is to lay out the facts that I found concerning Mike Huckabee and ask that you receive them with an open spirit of discernment. I will conclude by presenting you with a powerful alternative that you should prayerfully consider.</p>
<p><b>Why did the HSLDA endorse Huckabee?</b><br />
In endorsing Huckabee, the HSLDA said that he is:</p>
<p>1) &#8220;a principled conservative&#8221;<br />
2) &#8220;a friend of homeschooling&#8221;<br />
3) &#8220;a man of character&#8221;<br />
4) &#8220;a man with a mature faith in Jesus Christ.&#8221;  </p>
<p>These are the four reasons the HSLDA gave for supporting Mike Huckabee. Incidentally, this was the actual order in which they gave them. Let&#8217;s examine each one, in order of my own priorities: </p>
<p><b>A man with a mature faith in Jesus Christ?</b><br />
It&#8217;s easy to make this claim, but it&#8217;s difficult to speak against it, so I won&#8217;t. The only way to know with certainty whether a brother has a &#8220;mature faith in Jesus Christ&#8221; is not to listen to their words, nor to even look at their actions, but to examine their fruit. Along this line, I would ask why Huckabee&#8217;s son David was accused of <a href="http://www.utopiarescue.com/oldsite/stop_animal_torture.htm">hanging a dog, slitting its throat and then stoning it to death</a>?</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Putting aside for a moment his irreverent attitude, consider this: he was presented with an opportunity to show us just how strong his faith is in the Scriptures and ultimately the Lord Jesus Christ, but he floundered. He then pointed out that he was the only one on that stage with a theological degree. I would remind all of us that Jesus warned us to &#8220;beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep&#8217;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.&#8221; This is the same man who took a pretend <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yj_okz7ZwI">phone call from God</a>. Blasphemous sacrilege!</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><b>A friend of homeschooling?</b><br />
I count myself blessed to have known the beauty of loyalty in friendship. The word friend is a powerful word and brings to mind words like &#8220;loyalty,&#8221; &#8220;defense,&#8221; and &#8220;familiarity.&#8221; A friend stands by you through thick and thin and makes sacrifices for you when necessary. It may surprise you, then, that the New Hampshire NEA has also endorsed Huckabee. The NEA is the largest labor union in the United States and represents public school teachers. How can Mike Huckabee be loyal to both homeschoolers and the powerful public school lobby? The answer is: he can&#8217;t. Whoever will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God, and whoever is the friend of the public school union is the enemy of homeschoolers. This may explain why his &#8220;<a href="http://www.mikehuckabee.com/?FuseAction=Issues.View&amp;Issue_id=7">Issues: Education</a>&#8221; webpage has only one brief and token sentence mentioning homeschooling. It may also explain why he <a href="http://blog.thehill.com/2007/04/30/huckabee-backs-no-child-left-behind/">defends the No Child Left Behind Act</a>. </p>
<p>Where are Huckabee&#8217;s loyalties? Well, one morning in 1999, homeschoolers in Arkansas woke up to learn that they had been betrayed by their governor and friend, Mike Huckabee. The HSLDA had <a href="http://www.hslda.org/courtreport/v15n3/V15N3AR.asp?PrinterFriendly=True">reported</a> that under Gov. Huckabee, Arkansas became the first state in the nation to add restrictions to its existing home school law. From the report linked above, Huckabee signed the bill that the HSLDA specifically did not support. Can you call this man who signed legislation taking away our homeschooling freedoms a friend? Only if you are the NEA. Why did they pass this law? According to the HSLDA, the &#8220;public school lobby had been working overtime to convince the Arkansas legislature that the home school law was too permissive.&#8221; Rather than stand up against the powerful public school lobby, Huckabee caved in and took away freedoms that were previously given to homeschoolers. As the Psalmist wrote, &#8220;Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.&#8221; </p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><b>A man of character?</b><br />
Where do I begin? I believe a man is only as good as his word, and when someone lies to me, I find it difficult to ever have that trust restored. I take lying very seriously. Mike Huckabee has been caught telling and repeating an outright falsehood. Read carefully <a href="http://www.hakubi.us/foundation/513/">this webpage</a> that details how he got caught in this pretty blatant lie. How can you trust a man&#8217;s character when he is caught lying red-handed? Someone who tells lies is a liar, and that makes Mike Huckabee a liar.  Why did the Arkansas Ethics Commission <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15853756/">officially reprimand him</a> for violations five times in 14 years? </p>
<p>What do his peers in Christianity say? The conservative &#8220;700 Club&#8221; <a href="http://www.cbn.com/CBNnews/257943.aspx">has disowned him</a>. What is his reputation like among those outside the church? He is known as someone who has <a href="http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=12205">&#8220;a mean streak, a thin skin and a penchant for revenge.&#8221;</a>  Huckabee is a member of a music band called &#8220;<a href="http://www.myspace.com/capitoloffense">Capitol Offense</a>.&#8221; Would Jesus form a band? If he did, would he name it something like that? According to the band&#8217;s website, they formed it because of their &#8220;love of &#8230; classic rock-n-roll.&#8221; Where is the gravity and sobriety that Titus chapter 2 calls for in an older man? It&#8217;s not a gospel music band, either. It is a cover band with a set list including songs such as &#8220;<a href="http://www.steppenwolf.com/lyr/brntbwld.html">Born to be wild</a>,&#8221; the highly sexually charged &#8220;<a href="http://www.guntheranderson.com/v/data/devilwit.htm">Devil with a Blue Dress</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="http://www.lyrics007.com/Lynyrd%20Skynyrd%20Lyrics/Freebird%20Lyrics.html">Freebird</a>, &#8220;<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/r/rolling+stones/honky+tonk+woman_20117865.html">Honky Tonk Woman</a>, and other similarly ungodly songs. Go read the lyrics to <a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/r/rolling+stones/honky+tonk+woman_20117865.html">Honky Tonk Woman</a> (it&#8217;s offensive) and imagine the pastor of your church singing that song. If a leader in my church formed a band to play that kind of music, I would call that a very serious problem. And we call him a man of character? On the campaign trail and in debates, Huckabee frequently makes mention of his theological training and his status as an ordained minister. Jesus told us to beware of hypocrites who stand in street corners [feigning spirituality] wanting to be seen of men. We are told to go into our closet and close the door when we pray, so the Father can see us in secret. Why is Huckabee so vocal about his faith and his theological ordination? The only reason I can think of is that he&#8217;s doing it for political gains. </p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><b>A principled conservative?</b><br />
Huckabee&#8217;s history of <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/huckabee-on-rapist-murderer/?hp">pardoning violent felons</a> with disastrous outcomes has been a major problem for his campaign. On immigration, he is a flip-flopper. As Arkansas&#8217;s governor, Huckabee <a href="http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/blog/2007/12/immigration_advocate_shame_on.html">supported in-state college tuition for young illegal immigrants</a>, but recently, presumably for political expediency, has completely reversed his position.  How about taxes? By the end of his ten-year tenure as governor of Arkansas, Huckabee <a href="http://www.clubforgrowth.org/2007/01/a_report_on_mike_huckabees_fis.php">was responsible</a> for a 37% higher sales tax, 16% higher motor fuel taxes, and 103% higher cigarette taxes, according to Americans for Tax Reform. Check out <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-102793292534815602">the infamous video</a> of Governor Huckabee practically begging for any new tax. </p>
<p>What about pro-life issues? When asked about embryonic stem cell research, <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/Mike_Huckabee_Abortion.htm">he said</a>, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s right to create a life to end a life.&#8221; So far, so good, but then he added, &#8220;That&#8217;s not a good health decision.&#8221; What on earth does that mean? He was later asked, &#8220;As president, you would seek to ban abortion?&#8221; and his response was that &#8220;I would seek always to promote the view that life is precious and should be protected. But I think it has to be won on a battlefield of one heart at a time rather than pieces of legislation at a time.&#8221; He clearly does not have a clear plan to stop or at least slow abortion.</p>
<p><b>I&#8217;m convinced, but what choice do we have? He&#8217;s the best candidate we have!</b><br />
For this, I only need refer you to our brother, Dr. Ron Paul. For the sake of careful discernment, please look at Ron Paul with a fresh and unbiased eye. Ron Paul is a <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/vance/vance127.html">humble brother in Christ</a> with a blameless record. His enemies have no ammunition against him, and his voting record as a 10-term congressman is <a href="http://www.house.gov/paul/bio.shtml">consistent</a>. He is a man who has proven himself to be trusted with the power he has been given. As an OB/GYN, he has delivered over 4,000 babies. He has been married for 50 years and has <a href="http://www.dailypaul.com/node/11664">5 children, 18 grandchildren and 1 great-grandchild</a>. He is passionately <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul240.html">pro-life</a> and successfully defends that view against liberal pro-deathers. He has <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul240.html">a plan to end abortion</a>, starting with overturning Roe v. Wade and returning the decision to the local level where it will be handled by local leaders who must answer to their local voters. </p>
<p>His platform is strictly constitutionalist. His principle is that if the Constitution doesn&#8217;t specifically allow it, then the Federal government has no business doing it. He wants to abolish entirely the Department of Education, as well as many other massive unconstitutional government bureaucracies, and replace them with nothing. The beautiful thing is that <u>we can trust him</u> to actually do what he promises. He often repeats the mantra that he wants to &#8220;keep the government out of our lives.&#8221; As homeschoolers who want to raise our children ourselves, this should be music to our ears. </p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><b>Is Ron Paul a friend of homeschoolers?</b><br />
Ron Paul is the only candidate who has <a href="http://www.ronpaul2008.com/homeschoolers/">an entire microsite</a> devoted specifically to the issue of homeschooling. According to Ron Paul, &#8220;The best way to improve education is to return control to the parents who know best what their children need. Congress should empower all parents, including home-schoolers, to control their children&#8217;s education&#8230;&#8221;  Ron Paul also believes that &#8220;No nation can remain free when the state has greater influence over the knowledge and values transmitted to children than the family.&#8221; Amen! Back in the year 2001, Dr. Paul said, &#8220;Under the United States Constitution, the federal government has no authority to hold states &#8216;accountable&#8217; for their education performance. In the free society envisioned by the founders, schools are held accountable by parents, not federal bureaucrats.&#8221; Virginia Baker, a national pioneer of present-day home schooling, and the first mother in Texas to do so, has formally endorsed Dr. Ron Paul. She said, &#8220;Dr. Paul is the homeschoolers best friend.&#8221; </p>
<p>A friend is someone who will loyally defend you, even to the point of sacrifice, and I personally trust ONLY Ron Paul in this area. There is no candidate that can be trusted to protect the rights of parents to direct their own children’s upbringing and education, except for Ron Paul.  Jim Fedako, economist and homeschooling father of five wrote, &#8220;As a homeschooling father of five, I recognize that there are many individuals and groups who would like to force my children back into the public schools. In fact, the NEA has a statement on their legislative platform that advocates the end of the homeschooling movement. Ron Paul stands for Liberty. He stands for the right of my wife and I to educate our children at home, away from the influences of the NEA and other such organizations.&#8221;  Ron Paul isn&#8217;t swayed by powerful lobbies. He never accepts bribes or gifts, and votes his conscience regardless of how unpopular it makes him. Ron Paul often finds himself casting the only &#8220;No&#8221; vote on bills before Congress that he sees as unconstitutional. In the face of what must be unimaginable intimidation, Dr. Paul stays true to what he believes.  There are literally hundreds of other reasons to support Ron Paul&#8217;s candidacy, and I would encourage you to begin at <a href="http://www.ronpaul2008.com/">Ron Paul&#8217;s website</a>. </p>
<p><b>But the media keeps saying that he can&#8217;t win! I don&#8217;t want to waste my vote.</b><br />
What right does the media have in telling us who can and can&#8217;t win an election? Can they see the future? Or do they have information that is not generally available to the public? What is their track record in correctly predicting the outcome of elections? The truth is, Ron Paul dominates in straw polls, and he has raised many millions of dollars from tens of thousands of personal donations. He has an excellent chance of winning, despite what you may have been told. I would say that to simply vote the way the media tells you to vote is the only way to waste your vote. Vote for who you believe is the best candidate, regardless of who you are told is winning.  Please, for the sake of our future liberty as homeschooling families, give this serious thought, discernment, and prayer. Should you choose to support Ron Paul, please pray for him, his family, and his candidacy. Support him financially, and tell other homeschooling families about this champion of our liberty.</p>

<strong> An &#8220;SMS Keyboard&#8221; for Conventional Computers</strong></p>
<p>A novel product has been launched which offers a mobile phone style keyboard to replace the more conventional QWERTY keyboard for computers. It is aimed at people who have become so comfortable with sending SMSs that they are not able to use a conventional computer layout any more. The cre8txt keyboard connects directly to a PC running Windows and provides quick character entry via the mobile phone style key layout.The company who sell this keyboard have also developed a software program which converts &#8220;txt slang&#8221; into correct English. The cre8txt software comes with over 140,000 words in a cre8txt English wordbank and SMS Slang translator. Users can add their own words and SMS slang at anytime.The Design Registered and patent pending invention is being brought to the market by a group of education technology specialists and edutainment experts with over 76 years of experience between them. They have been working on the project for two years.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cellular-news.com/story/27359.php" title="An ">http://www.cellular-news.com/story/27359.php</a></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jaa2X0g9bhA" title="YouTube - your shits all retarded">You&#8217;re fucked up, you talk like a fag and your shits all retarded.</a></p>
<p>Yes indeed.</p>
<p>That is a quote from the film, <em>&#8216;<a href="http://www.mininova.org/tor/567703" title="Idiocracy[2006]DvDrip AC3[Eng]-aXXo : Movies &gt; Comedy - Mininova">Idiocracy</a>&#8216;</em> where in the future, thanks to bad breeding, everyone on earth has a moron level IQ.</p>
<p>The keyboard above is a very clever device, and the people who put it together are smart guys. What it does however, is stop people from learning English by allowing them to use a shorthand language to input real English words into a computer. If you have a device that does your thinking for you, then <em>you suffer</em>. How long will it be before this is the only keyboard find attached to a computer in schools? Thinking about it, you could argue that speech to text software is just as bad, but in fact, it is not, because speech to text software doesn&#8217;t involve a intermediary form of &#8216;sub-english&#8217; that needs to be translated before you get the words on the page.</p>
<p>All of this brings us to the most important point; <em>what to do about breeding</em>.</p>
<p>The people who are facing the facts about uncontrolled breeding are considered monsters today, but I wonder how many people would change their minds and soften their hostility to selective breeding if they knew that an overpopulated &#8216;Idiocracy&#8217; future was coming?</p>
<p>The documentary <a href="http://www.endgamethemovie.com/" title="Alex Jones' Endgame">Endgame</a> spells out the plans of some people to control the breeding of everyone on earth, after exterminating 80% of the population. What that great piece doesn&#8217;t address is <em>what will happen if these bad guys are stopped</em>, and things are left exactly as they are.</p>
<p><a href="http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:mvnD4glGnXIJ:www.population-security.org/rockefeller/001_population_growth_and_the_american_future.htm+%22alternatives+to%22+human+population+growth&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=5&amp;client=safari" title="Rockefeller Commission on Population and the American Future - Intro and Chapter 1">Here is an interesting report</a> &#8216;The Report of The Commission on Population Growth and the American Future&#8217; from <em>The Center for Research on Population and Security</em>, published March 27th, 1972. Just from the titles under each chapter it looks like disturbing reading.</p>
<p>I would like to read some thoughts about how either the current ideas that population growth at its current level is by some method sustainable, or alternatives to controlling population growth that do not involve brutal culling ending in <a href="http://www.spiteyourface.com/lego/thx/index.html">THX-1138</a> style hive living.</p>
