<h4>2013-12-31 Log Templater (<a href="Projects/logtemplater/index.html">tmpltr</a>) v0.6 is now available</h4>
<h4 style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Lucida Grande&quot;; color: black;">
I have been laying some ground work for implimenting log chain templates in the next version of Log Templater.
Part of that work includes adding support for more field types (IPv4, IPv6, MAC Address and HEX numbers).
These changes clean up the templates and make it simpler and faster to find some key data when responding to
a threat.

<h4 style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Lucida Grande&quot;; color: black;">
My last <a href="http://www.tenable.com/webinars/geeking-out-with-marcus-ranum-security-data-aggregation">session</a> 
with Marcus in February may have lacked "Marcus", but there was enough participation and positive feedback that he
asked me to come back and have a more detailed discussion.  This time, we had a chance to dig much deeper into the topic and
came up with a couple of interesting ideas that we are now percolating on.  Perhaps this will lead to a new tool in our kit.
<br><br>
The <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/7927/69819">webcast</a> is available and who knows what may come next.

<h4 style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Lucida Grande&quot;; color: black;">
I was looking forward to spending some quality 
<a href="http://www.tenable.com/webinars/geeking-out-with-marcus-ranum-security-data-aggregation">geek out</a> 
time with Marcus today talking about logging
and log analysis.  Unfortunately, Marcus fell victim to the Webcast gremlins at a hotel in Germany and
was not able to join me.  I still had a good time talking with Allan
about all things "logging" but I am looking forward to geeking our with Marcus some other time.

<h4>2012-06-27 Upgraded GPU Cracker</h4>
<h4 style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Lucida Grande&quot;; color: black;">
With the recent breaches of authentication credentials around the Interwebs, I decided to upgrade my GPU 
Cracker and see how it performs and how hot my office can get all at the same time.  I replaced my aging 
Radeon 5xxx boards with three <a href="http://www.amd.com/us/products/desktop/graphics/7000/7970/Pages/radeon-7970.aspx">Radeon 7970</a>'s 
and one Radeon 6970.  SHA1 is now running at almost 6T computations
per second using <a href="http://hashcat.net/oclhashcat-plus/" title="oclHashCat-Plus">oclHashCat-Plus</a>.
Time to port <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nightingale-project">Nightengale</a> (<a href="http://www.uberadmin.com/Projects/index.html#BARACUDA">BaraCUDA</a>) to OpenCL and see how she runs!

I tried to use Mike Poor's <b>"development via osmosis"</b> trick with a couple of buddies but in the end, I was forced

I pulled out the paperclips, rubber bands and chewing gum.  Then I read the docs on <a href="http://libnids.sourceforge.net/" title="libnids Home Page">libnids</a>.

<h4 style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Lucida Grande&quot;; color: black;">
After some very helpful and specific feedback about the last version of tmpltr, I have added a few additions
including faux clustering for the occasion when it is handy to know what on a given log line has not changed.
There is a performance penalty for this extra processing, but not as much as I had orignally expected.  The
table below shows average performance metrics on a Linux VM running on an i7 @ 3.2GHz.

<br>
In addition, I have added a greedy mode where the templater will ignore double quotes.  This is very useful
when processing web server logs.  In non-greedy mode, tmpltr will assume most things in between a pair of double
quotes are a single string.  In greedy mode, all data will be handled the same.

<h4 style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Lucida Grande&quot;; color: black;">
I picked up a couple of <a href="http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/products/laptops/laptop-hdd/">Seagate MomentusXT 500Gb</a> 
Solid State Hybrid drives to see how they stacked up to
my four 120Gb SSDs running RAID-0.  I pulled out the very handy <a href="http://www.hdtune.com/download.html" target="_blank">HD TunePro</a> and 
the sad fact is, configured as a RAID-0, they were no where near as fast as the pure SSD RAID-0. The linear read and the seek speed was also unpradictable.
Even worse, they did not out perform a couple of 1TB spindle drives running RAID-0 as the chart below shows.  <br>

<h4 style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Lucida Grande&quot;; color: black;">
During the last security incident that I worked on, I needed to grind through 20gb of log files looking
for any odd log lines that would indicate the point where the bad guys got in.  If I had done it manually,
I would still be looking at log data.  Instead, I built a tool that converted logs into pattern
templates and looked for templates that I had never seen before.  This allowed me to zero in on just a
few hundred log lines out of all the data.

After re-implementing some parser code in <a href="Projects/difftree/index.html">difftree</a> with bug
fixes and improved bounds checking, I have ported those changes back to this tool.  So, I now present
the new and improved quick parser with less bugs and more bounds checking.  Re-energized after touching

key=value formatted logs.

I have released a new version of difftree with more features and less memory leaks.

you can hash and compare files if accuracy is more important the speed.

That
may not look too impressive, but if you compare it to the same read

<h4 style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Lucida Grande&quot;; color: black;">In
the spirit of tricking people into reading what I write, I have given
in to temptation and deliberately misled you. &nbsp;Yes, my old

annoying if I did not have an air cooled system running two dual GPU
graphics cards and a Tesla super computer sitting under my desk at the
same time. &nbsp;My GPU password cracking box just hummed along
without
any overheating issues while my game system learned how to swim in low
conductivity cooling solution. &nbsp;So, I upgraded my case to an
Antec
1200 &nbsp;to match my GPU cracker and replaced my pair of ATI
4895's
with two ATI 5970's and I am back to the races. &nbsp;The 3DMark
numbers speak wonders about both the video cards and the difference
between running Windows XP and Windows 7.&nbsp;</span></h4>

<h4>2010-03-19 Mining A/V logs continues to extract gold</h4>
<h4 style="font-weight: normal;">After updating my
simple Symantec A/V log <span style="font-family: &quot;Lucida Grande&quot;; color: black;"><a href="http://www.uberadmin.com/Scripts/index.html#avParser.pl">parser</a></span>
I used it to convert syslog Symantec A/V logs to CSV files and loaded
the data into <a href="http://www.advizorsolutions.com/products.htm">Advizor
Analyst</a>. This type of graph shows interesting re-infection
patterns for individual hosts (horizontal lines), signature updates
following malware blooms (vertical patterns with the same colors) as
well as others.</h4>

<br>
The y-axis is a list of all infected machines so each horizontal line
is a single system (Hostnames clipped for anonymity). The color coding
is based on the name of the malware with similar names having similar
colors on the pallet. Analysis of the four solid verticals outside of
the weekly schedule scan pattern (the consistent vertical pattern
across all the plots) were four different outbreaks of a network
scanner where signature updates were loaded across all systems and the
IPS started detecting and blocking immediately. The analysis was done
to evaluate the effectiveness of an A/V deployment. The initial impact
was a clear determination that the A/V system needed some attention and
over time, the analysis was used to re-enforce the value of enabling
additional options in the A/V system. Ongoing analysis shows the tempo
of malware detects and changes to the A/V environment.

<h4>2009-09-21&nbsp;A/V logs can help you find troubled
systems</h4>
<h4 style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Lucida Grande&quot;; color: black;">I
was culling through the logs on one of my systems the other day and
realized that I was getting a fair amount of alerts from my Symantec
A/V servers. &nbsp;At first, I was not interested in what malware
was
being detected and cleaned but it got me thinking about what
interesting patterns existed. &nbsp;I suspected that the majority
of
malware infections were caused by a minority of users as most malware
these days require some user action. &nbsp;To test this theory I
wrote
a simple <a href="http://www.uberadmin.com/Scripts/index.html#avParser.pl">parser</a>
to convert the logs to something that I could push into
a <a href="http://www.advizorsolutions.com/products.htm">visualizer</a>
and started looking for interesting patterns.</span></h4>

</h4>
Above
is a histogram plotting A/V detects over time. &nbsp;Each dot is an
piece of malware color coded by host. &nbsp;Horizontal patterns are
a
large quantity of the same piece of malware and vertical lines show
patterns in the A/V detections indicating a schedule for scanning.
&nbsp;This was helpful in deducing the infection and detection
patterns
but not very useful for mapping infections to individual hosts.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 749px; height: 507px;" alt="A/V Heat Map" src="http://dl6ev0qgbazhk.cloudfront.net/Images/2009-09-17_AV_HeatMap.png"><br>
<br>
This heat map is much more interesting as it shows that a small number
of systems have a disproportionate<span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"></span>
number of detected infections. &nbsp;About 50 systems have more
than
3,000 detected pieces of malware while the rest average just two.
&nbsp;This gives the admin teams a short list of systems that they
can
focus on both with technical as well as awareness based remediation.<br>
<h4>2009-05-21 I just switched from air to <a href="http://www.koolance.com">liquid cooling</a></h4>
<h4 style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Lucida Grande&quot;; color: black;">After
many years of dreading summer and the system overtemp lock-ups I just
made the leap into liquid cooling. &nbsp;I had resisted for the
last
couple of years because the cost of entry in money and time was just
too much. &nbsp;After a couple of days to reading on the net I
decided
that it was too simple and cheap, that waiting any longer was silly.</span></h4>

<br>
So
far, I am running 32c on my CPU and 35c on both of my GPUs on fan speed
4 of 10.&nbsp; This is not bad considering ambient is 46c and my
CPU
averaged around 50c on air. &nbsp; I will play with this for a
couple
of weeks while I overclock this and that. &nbsp;Once I have
gathered
more data, I will switch from a serial to a parallel flow configuration
and see if that makes any significant difference.<br>

<h4>2008-06-19 Transitive Distrust</h4>
<h4 style="font-weight: normal;"> <span style="font-family: &quot;Lucida Grande&quot;; color: black;">I have
watched our capability to detect threats degrade year after year as our
adversaries invest more and more time and effort in the pursuit of
stealthiness. As with all arms races, the winner is the faction with
the deepest pockets and lowest overhead. &nbsp;In the corporate
world,
that is a guarantee that the adversaries will always win. &nbsp;I
have
been toying with a different paradym to identifying threats called
transitive distrust, or as a good friend of mine commented, trust
engineering.</span></h4>
<h4 style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Lucida Grande&quot;; color: black;">Thesis:<o:p></o:p></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Lucida Grande&quot;; color: black;"><o:p></o:p></span></h4>
<h4 style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Lucida Grande&quot;; color: black;"><o:p></o:p><span style="font-style: italic;">Internal systems that interact
with "bad" systems on the
Internet are less trustworthy than internal systems that do
not.&nbsp; "Bad" systems on the Internet
exhibit repeating and detectable properties.&nbsp;
A system that exhibits these properties is less trustworthy than a
system that does not.&nbsp; A system that
interacts with an untrustworthy system is itself less trustworthy.</span><span style=""></span></span></h4>
<h4 style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Lucida Grande&quot;; color: black;"><span style=""></span>To
test this, I am building with the help of some friends, a system of
instrumentation that applies a simple set of 30-40 rules to all systems
that interact with a given network. &nbsp;Once the rules are
applied, a
trust/distrust map is compiled. &nbsp;This is a very effective
filter
to separate the trusted, and therefore not interesting, from the
untrusted</span></h4>
<h4 style="font-weight: normal;">The system can run
constantly, correcting the evaluated trust/distrust as the data points
change. <span style="font-family: &quot;Lucida Grande&quot;; color: black;">Distrust
degrades over time so a system that was previously untrusted but no
longer exhibits these traits will become more trusted.<o:p></o:p></span></h4>
<h4>2008-05-31 Monitoring and logging removable media
access with OS/X</h4>
<h4 style="font-weight: normal;">I wrongly assumed
that it would
be simple to find an intellectual property (IP) leakage monitoring tool
for removable media on OS/X. &nbsp;It is unfortunate that the
abundance
of this type of tool on Windows has not rubbed off on Mac.
&nbsp;That
said, I hacked together a volume monitoring daemon (<a href="Projects/index.html#VMD">vmd</a>)
to provide logging of file activity on removable devices on systems
running OS/X. &nbsp;It is the poor mans solution to the problem.
&nbsp;It uses syslog, so it is possible to have all of your Mac's
point
to a central syslog server and gain arms length auditing of removable
media across all of your OS/X based systems with this little daemon.
&nbsp;A word of caution, I used the fsevents functionality of
&nbsp;10.4 and 10.5 which is not a standard hook for applications.
&nbsp;So don't be surprized if this stops working in a future
version of
OS/X. </h4>
<h4>2008-04-26 Malware detection through data visualization</h4>
<h4 style="font-weight: normal;">Raffael over at <a href="http://secviz.org/">secvis.org</a> has been
working to improve the overall state of information security data
visualization. &nbsp;Along with logging, data visualization has
been a
pet project of mine for several years. &nbsp;I have, from time to
time
used visualization to filter through large volumes of data looking for
intruders, malware and data breaches.</h4>
I have been trying to find a way to go through firewall logs at a large
corporation where a days worth of traffic equates to 25Gb of
uncompressed logs
and mapping portions of the logs to simple 2D graphs helps
to point out obvious and sometimes subtle anomalies.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
When you plot the destination IP address as an integer over time, many
interesting patterns are highlighted.<a href="http://dl6ev0qgbazhk.cloudfront.net/Images/DestIP_Over_24h.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 30px; height: 19px;" alt="Dest IP over 24 hours" src="../Images/DestIP_Over_24h.png"></a>
&nbsp;Even more interesting than the horizontal patterns indicating
continuous traffic to specific IP addresses are the vertical clusters
with regularly repeating frequencies.<br>
Next, a plot of the same data using the destination port number over
time points to obvious port scanning in the form of &nbsp;diagonal
lines as well as odd patterns that sync with the previous destination
IP address plot. <a href="http://dl6ev0qgbazhk.cloudfront.net/Images/DestPort_Over_24h.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 30px; height: 19px;" alt="Dest port over 24 hours" src="../Images/DestPort_Over_24h.png"></a><br>
<br>
The last plot of source ports over time points to crafted packets.
&nbsp;Normal sockets allocated through the operating system will
have
positively incrementing source ports for each new connection.
&nbsp;Look for the horizontal lines and you have most likely found
tools
that are not using the operating system to instantiate new sockets.
&nbsp;To me, this screams packet crafting. <a href="http://dl6ev0qgbazhk.cloudfront.net/Images/SrcPort_Over_24h.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 30px; height: 19px;" alt="Source port over 24 hours" src="../Images/SrcPort_Over_24h.png"></a><br>
<br>
All of these graphs were created by parsing firewalls logs using a <a href="http://cpan.perl.org/">perl</a> script and
loading them into <a href="http://www.advizorsolutions.com/">Advizor
Analyst</a>.<br>
<br>
Web server logs are another source of interesting data if you are able
to separate the wheat from the chaff. &nbsp;<a href="Scripts/index.html#Apache2Dot.pl">Apache2Dot.pl</a>

<br>
Now that the US Federal Government is regularly seizing, coping and
snooping into the computers of US Citizens returning home, what can we
do to protect the privacy that we hold dear? &nbsp;The most obvious
response is to encrypt your drives using whatever tools you deem
appropriate. &nbsp;I had considered a "<a href="http://www.ncl.cs.columbia.edu/publications/usenix2000_fist.pdf">FiST</a>
US Customs" campaign, but I suppose that would not be very
professional. &nbsp;I had also considered implementing some
anti-forensic countermeasures on my computers. &nbsp;A simple
change to
one of the many open source disk wipers could fill your unallocated and
slack space with billions of partial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format">GIF</a>
images. &nbsp;That sure would make going through the preview in <a href="http://www.encase.com/">EnCASE</a> a bit more
tedious. &nbsp;And I suppose there are even more '<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/07/25/Forensics-software-can-be-hacked_1.html?SECURITY">active</a>'
countermeasures available to those who are not squeamish about fighting
back. &nbsp;After all, I have nothing to hide, and its not my job
to
make it easy for Law Enforcement to do theirs. &nbsp;Then it
occurred
to me as I was ranting to a fellow infosec practitioner. &nbsp;What
we
need is the equivalent of a EULA for our computers. &nbsp;Something
that warns off would-be snoopers who decide to look at our computers
without a warrant. &nbsp;I suppose putting one of these stickers on
your computer and your hard drives is just asking for them to be
confiscated, never to be seen again. &nbsp;But it sure would make a
great story.

<h4>2007-09-22 Regexless log parsing (<a href="Projects/index.html#QUICKPARSER">quickparser</a>)</h4>
<h4 style="font-weight: normal;">A co-conspirator
and I have been
building some log analysis tools. &nbsp;To feed data to the tools,
we
needed to convert log files into a psuedo XML format. &nbsp;I built
a
couple of regex log parsers in perl but they were very slow.
&nbsp;We
have spent some time talking about other ways of parsing logs and I
cannibalized a log compression tool that I had built using regexless
parsing and found out that it is pretty fast. &nbsp;By fast I am
talking 2.6M lines per minute on a single processor 2.5GHz PC running
linux and 950K lines per minute on a SunBlade 2000 with 1GHz processors.</h4>
<h4 style="font-weight: normal;">Check out my <a href="Projects/index.html#QUICKPARSER">quickparser</a>,

<h4>2007-08-17 "Better out than in, that's what
I&nbsp;always say!" -Shrek</h4>
<h4 style="font-weight: normal;">InfoSec is from
Pluto, NetOps is from Jupiter<br>
<br>
As
the tenth largest body orbiting our sun, Pluto has in recent years been
center stage to heated discussion about what makes a planet.&nbsp;
Living on
Pluto as it spins around its eccentric orbit at a chilly 29 AU to a
really chilly 49 AU from our Sun would be quite a challenge.&nbsp;
It's cold
and lonely and most people don't even consider Pluto a planet including
the IAU which on August 24th, 2006 relegated Pluto to 'dwarf planet'
status.&nbsp; It is surprisingly similar to the life as an InfoSec
professional.&nbsp; They are center stage to heated discussions
about the
significance, priority and impact of information security on
organizations.&nbsp; Aside from government and financial circles,
InfoSec is
at best an ugly stepchild and at worst is the bastard child of an
adulterous relationship. To the rest of the world, information security
is the curse of 'due diligence and care' that is resisted, ignored and
hated with vim and vigor likened to paying taxes.&nbsp; In short,
information security is the group that tries to make organizations do
silly things that cost too much and delay projects for no good reason
because "security breaches only happen to the other guy, not us". <br>
<br>
The fifth planet from our Sun, Jupiter, stacks up as the
largest body in our solar system at 2 ½ times more massive
that all the
other planets put together.&nbsp; Jupiter keeps showing up in the
press with
missions like Voyager, Cassini and Galileo.&nbsp;&nbsp; If that
was not enough of
a spotlight, consider the Shoemaker-Levy 9 Impacts in July of
1994.&nbsp;
Jupiter is big, bright and full of hydrogen.&nbsp; Everybody knows
what
Jupiter looks like and we thank Jupiter for its gravitational pull, we
all prefer to have things hit Jupiter instead of us.&nbsp; Network
operations, like Jupiter, gets lots of visibility, is generally large
in comparison to other operational bodies and is full of an amazingly
diverse class of gases.&nbsp; And we all know to make a bee-line to
NetOps
when we can't surf the Internet. <br>
<br>
Putting aside the above analogies, there are some fundamental
differences between InfoSec and NetOps and over the years I have
struggled to understand those differences as a way to improve my
interactions with my family on Jupiter.&nbsp; At its most
fundamental level,
the difference between "network" people and "security" people is that
one is focused on ensuring that packets move and the other
isn't.&nbsp; I
will leave ascribing the correct labels to you, the reader. <br>
<br>
This fundamental schism is surprisingly wide and deep.&nbsp; And,
we are talking astronomic units (AU) here, not Grand Canyon
distances.&nbsp;
Countless times, I have gone to my brothers and sisters on Jupiter
asking for help in reducing the 'attack surface' of a problem and time
and time again, I have received feedback and lumps.&nbsp; With each
tongue-lashing and stroke I have heard "We don't have time or
resources".&nbsp; For a long time, I assumed that part of my family
was just
lazy. <br>
<br>
The epiphany came to me last week, NetOps is from Jupiter, not
my home town over on Pluto.&nbsp; When I ask network operations to
install
an ACL or firewall, they resist.&nbsp; Not out of laziness but as
an
instinctive response built into the very fabric of each resident of
Jupiter.&nbsp; Asking to block traffic is like asking them to move
to Pluto,
which is far too small and cold.&nbsp; When I look at the problem,
I see it
through the eyes of a happy resident of Pluto where blocking traffic is
just a matter of simple changes to router and firewall
configurations.&nbsp;
Add in a little audit trail and some monitoring for giggles, and it is
a happy place for all.&nbsp; But when someone from Jupiter looks at
preventing packets from reaching their final destination, it is like
preventing a packet from reaching it's pre-ordained and rightful place
in the universe and the ramifications will topple everything.&nbsp;
Not to
mention making a mess in the holiest of places, the change control
archive. <br>
<br>
So, consider this, the next time you endeavor to make the
journey from Pluto to Jupiter to request a packet filter, start the
conversation with "Every packet is sacred", and bring lots of photos of
home to reassure them that Pluto is not all bad, because a network
operator who turns up a firewall is actually a Plutonian on vacation in
a warmer climate. <br>

<h4>2007-07-31 Blatant C.a.S.E.</h4>
I am sorry Marcus, I just can't keep it to myself . . .<br>
<a href="https://www.notevil.org"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 241px; height: 287px;" alt="&quot;You hit the nail on the head&quot; -mjr" src="http://dl6ev0qgbazhk.cloudfront.net/Images/southpark-ron.JPG"></a>

<h4>2007-07-30 Passive syslog monitor v1.0 (<a href="Projects/psmd/index.html">psmd</a>) has been
released</h4>
Thanks to mjr for suggesting an interesting solution to the problem of
how to handle broken time in logs. &nbsp;By broken I mean logs from
systems without accurate time, mixed time zones and the most annoying
of all . . . daylight savings. &nbsp;The new version of psmd
inserts
time marks which record the time skew between log time and the time
that the log is sucked off the wire.<br>

<h4>2007-03-22 Yet another project (<a href="/Projects/pirat/index.html">PiRat</a>)</h4>
I just picked up a <a href="http://www.nokiausa.com/N800">Nokia
N800</a>
with the intent to port all of my InfoSec related tools to this
ultra-small computing platform. &nbsp;There is a pretty well put
together development environment and a strong open source development
community branded as <a href="http://www.maemo.org/">Maemo</a>.

<h4>2006-09-25 &#220berAdmin has a new website</h4>
After several years of a really plain website, I decided to give up
using vi for web development and switched to a more modern tool which
was capable of making really fancy websites. &nbsp;Though I opted
not
to make this site much fancier than the vi version, I at least used
more than one font this time.

<h4>2006-09-18 Passive syslog monitor daemon has a new home
at SourceForge (<a href="Projects/psmd/index.html">psmd</a>)</h4>
After tweaking on my code an hour at a time over the last year, I have
finally been pushed and prodded enough to actually release it to the
public. &nbsp;As I am not a programmer by trade and know just how
much
gum and how many rubber bands are used to hold it together, I do so
with a bit of reservation. &nbsp; With all the messages on the logs
mailing list about signing syslog, what else could I do?<br>
