				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems a long time ago since I stopped playing EVE.  Back in January I had this urge to return but never actually did.  EVE is still at the back of my mind, yet there is no interest to return back.  Not to any other game either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess it&#8217;s the age; making sure that my habits and interests change (slowly but inexoribly) as time goes by.  It is a good thing because otherwise there&#8217;s no &#8220;maturing&#8221; going on.  Time is being spent in pursuit of other things which have an impact in real life, unlike the efforts in EVE which result in nothing other than lost time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was also an avid reader of all the blogs about EVE.  Since the discontinuation of Google Reader I only read Gevlon&#8217;s blog.  The guy amazes me because he&#8217;s still at it &#8211; I would have thought that he&#8217;ll burn out sooner but amazingly he has not.  I (almost) enjoy reading his blogs.  I see his attitude very similar to mine and the way he thinks about pvpers and the &#8220;for fun&#8221; dudes is almost spot-on with mine.  Yet I cannot fathom what&#8217;s in it for him, what is he after out of a game?  Certainly a guy with his depth of criticism isn&#8217;t doing this just for the isk or any other target the game has to offer?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/handown.wordpress.com/126/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/handown.wordpress.com/126/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=handown.wordpress.com&#038;blog=20419933&#038;post=126&#038;subd=handown&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Introduction</span></p>
<p>A long, long time ago I wrote a <a title="Turrets!  Of Autocannons, Blasters and Pulse weapons" href="http://handown.wordpress.com/2011/04/03/turrets-of-autocannons-blasters-and-pulse-weapons/" target="_blank">post</a> in which I tried to analyse the differences between turrets. I was looking to form my own opinions on the subject, rather than guessing or accepting what others said, especially in a game like EVE Online in which there are many players with opinions. Due to my limitations with the latest developments in software at that time (my skills were focused on C and C++ as applied to science and engineering), I extracted the data manually (from the info page of each item) for the meta 0 items only, and did an analysis with the understanding that the higher meta variants kept their relative differences unchanged – meaning that the meta 0 rankings would still remain true for the meta 5 items. Since I was only interested in the relative comparison between the turrets, and not actually looking for the dps (or any other) value, such a reasoning seemed valid (I still think it is).</p>
<p>Nowadays, I discovered the beauty of SQL together with the EVE data dump, and I am proudly presenting you with the latest analysis, this time including all items. I must admit that spreadsheets were still employed to carry out the sorting and comparison functions, as I am still in the process of learning how to do that directly in SQL. I tell you, if ever you need to learn new software and techniques, do that on the data dump of your favourite MMO! In this regard, a big <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>thank you</b></span> goes to the authors of <a title="EVE Online database dump and SQL Server 2012" href="http://phoenixdiaries.co.uk/eve-online-database-dump-and-sql-server-2012?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ThePhoenixDiaries+%28The+Phoenix+Diaries%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader" target="_blank">this</a> and <a title="Working with Eve Static Data" href="http://k162space.com/2012/04/13/working-with-eve-static-data/" target="_blank">this</a> post.</p>
<p>So I will be posting a series of articles in order to present the data and make it readable and manageable. The plan for the posts is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Presentation of the series (this post);</li>
<li>The analytic framework;</li>
<li>Raw data for small turrets;</li>
<li>Analysis, comparison and rankings for small turrets;</li>
<li>Raw data for medium turrets;</li>
<li>Analysis, comparison and rankings for medium turrets;</li>
<li>Raw data for large turrets;</li>
<li>Analysis, comparison and rankings for large turrets;</li>
<li>Raw data, analysis, comparison and rankings for the extra large turrets.</li>
</ol>
<p>In carrying out my research, I was very frustrated at not finding the raw data readily available for copy-pasting in a spreadsheet. In this series you will find the raw data available for your enjoyment. I also hope to stimulate your creativity in playing with the numbers and come out with your own discoveries and conclusions. Based on feedback and RL time availability, I also plan to carry out a similar study of the numerous hulls available ingame.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/handown.wordpress.com/98/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/handown.wordpress.com/98/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=handown.wordpress.com&#038;blog=20419933&#038;post=98&#038;subd=handown&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I read two blog posts about the recent situation between CFC and HBC.  These are the two blocs controlling EVE’s null sec and relations seem to have deteriorated but no true war is forthcoming.</p>
<p>One <a href="http://scaurus.com/the-greatest-war-that-wasnt/">blog</a> author, Marc Saurus, attributes this to the sovereignty mechanics, quoting the sources as saying that they are not willing to go through the lengthy grind of the mechanic in order to win sov (again).</p>
<p><i>“</i><i>A war that would’ve involved 20,000 players, 75% of nullsec space, and hundreds of supercapitals was halted not by diplomacy, but by a game mechanic so dreadful that those who have experienced it previously have no desire to do so again.” </i>[Marc Saurus]<b></b></p>
<p>The second <a href="http://poeticstanziel.blogspot.com/2013/01/test-alliance-vs-goonswarm-taming-of.html">blog</a> author, Poetic Stanziel, attributes this lack of will to warring to the fact that it will be economically damaging to the big boy, so in the face of such costs the will to war dwindles.</p>
<p>Being in EVE since 2009 – I am now unsubscribed (since a couple of weeks) but follow it attentively out of game – I tend to agree with Poetic Stanziel more.  Before unsubscribing I was in wormholes.  I liked them because they resembled null sec, the place I loved most in EVE.  The place I couldn’t live in due to the way the “leaders” there expect others to play – a requirement which ultimately results in the leaders’ benefit, not the players.  It is always for their benefit, the few who assure for themselves a massive passive income by dictating the gameplay of others.  In the years since I left I had been experiencing a “I can’t live with you – I can’t live without you” situation which ultimately lead to not renewing my subscribtion.</p>
<p>Marc Saurus is also right although he misdiagnosed the situation and put the blame on the game mechanic and CCP.  Sov warfare is an endless grind because the players, the same few who do not want this war and dictate the gameplay of others, made it such by hoarding so much space under one cap.  This in itself is the problem: the sheer quantity of systems that need to be attacked; and not the mechanic.  The mechanic is great when holding or wanting a handful (or a few more) of systems.  In the mechanic systems are owned by Corporations, not alliances.  This was meant to create a dynamic environment in which corps leaving/joining alliances would change the sov scenario and make it highly dynamic.  This mechanic allowed for attacking key corporations, breaking them, thus breaking the alliance.  The leaders do not like this – they want the ultimate control, to the point that even with a few corps they can still hold on to the space until the next bill comes along.  These alliance leaders created the system in which solar systems are held by the alliance’s infrastructure corp, thus avoiding this dynamism and in the process creating the bloc spanning multiple regions.  Corps joining or leaving the alliance do not have an effect on the alliance’s holdings.  THIS is the problem.</p>
<p>The tendency (or drive by the few in safeguarding their interests) for the focus to be on alliances rather than corps.  THIS is the problem.</p>
<p><b>Can I do something about it?</b></p>
<p>Poetic Stanziel referred to moon resources (in particular technetium) as the reason behind it.</p>
<p><i>“</i><i>The only reason why this war will not happen is because of technetium. The Mittani can try to spin it any way he wants. As crappy as the sovereignty mechanics in EVE Online may be, it certainly did not stop The Mittani from prosecuting several wars to capture more of New Eden&#8217;s technetium supply. And at least one war to protect the tech cartel he helped create.”</i> [Poetic Stanziel]</p>
<p>Technetium inevitably pops up whenever null politics is discussed.  The location of this (and other valuable) mineral is unknown to the common folk – those who would eagerly harass the establishment through guerrilla tactics.  Its location is a heavily guarded secret and whoever has this information will not divulge it readily.  This is also part of the information that keeps the large null sec alliance beyond the reach of the smaller ones.</p>
<p>I believe in the old adage that information is power (or a good part of it).  I think that if the location of moon minerals is known with precision, initiatives for targeted attacks will arise and a serious challenge to the establishment can be created.  The biggest threat will be from those whose only aim will be to watch the world burn, and for these guys I’ll be acting!</p>
<p><b>The Moon Survey Project</b></p>
<p>I will return to the game and start a survey of the moons in the North of New Eden and publish here, for public knowledge, my findings.  You can help too, by doing the same and posting your own findings.  Most importantly I urge you to use my findings and get a fleet to disable these POSes, or go do some other damage and harassment.</p>
<p><b>THEY deserve nothing better.  Because null sec is ours, not theirs.  It is mine too!</b></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/handown.wordpress.com/117/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/handown.wordpress.com/117/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=handown.wordpress.com&#038;blog=20419933&#038;post=117&#038;subd=handown&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In reading about EVE Online, especially the debates amongst players-bloggers on their blogs about whether the behaviour in-game reflects one&#8217;s real life personality, there seems to be the understanding, accepted as true, that players are allowed to have a separate personality in the game world.  These go to lengths in explaining that griefing (and doing all sorts of bad things to) other players is ok because that is the game world, and there are no real world repercussions because after all, this is just a game!</p>
<p>I have tried it myself.  I have tried griefing, I have tried being part of null sec alliance, I have tried doing what others command, just to be part of the team, I have tried playing all those style which other players, especially the most loud and verbose of the pvpers and (some) bloggers call fun.  As a general conclusion, I cannot behave in a way which is different from that which comes natural to me.  I repeat, I CANNOT behave in two different ways in-game and in the real world.  I cannot even manage to have two accounts which behave differently from each other.  I have settled with two accounts which complement each other.</p>
<p>To clarify a little bit, it&#8217;s not the behaviour that I cannot do; it&#8217;s what comes afterwards, the conscience if you may.  That stays the same, no matter how much you try.  If you behave in a way which goes against your inner set of rules, you will feel it.  Conversely, if you behave repeatedly in a bad way, even in game, you don&#8217;t have those internal set of rules which make you a good decent person.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d say that this is a wild conclusion based only on my personal experience.  How can I generalise based on one, my own, experience.  Well, I tell you that based on my same experiences, there are certain realities which are true to all, and this is one of them.</p>
<p>So stop justifying your bad, psychopatic behaviour as ok because it&#8217;s ingame.  If that excuse consoles you, well I tell you that you have done a good job in killing your conscience, and that I do not want to meet you in real life, because deep down, you&#8217;re bad.  Yes you are!  Unless you are perfectly capable of having multiple personalities, in which case I also do not want to meet you, for obvious reasons.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/handown.wordpress.com/87/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/handown.wordpress.com/87/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=handown.wordpress.com&#038;blog=20419933&#038;post=87&#038;subd=handown&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday (Saturday) I logged on to add some skill training to the queue and check mails.  In alliance there was a message that today (Sunday) there were going to be 3 ops.  I made a mental note to check whether on Sunday there was going to be 100% tax on Corp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And on Sunday, as expected, there was a corp mail by the leader saying that since these ops were important, 100% tax was going to be set ALL DAY to encourage participation in these ops.  Now some things really piss me off about this policy:</p>
<p>Firstly, the moment I see it, I just log off and go to another game.</p>
<p>Secondly, 100% tax affects only those who rat (like me).  I think I&#8217;ll be turning miner in view of all these 100%-tax occassions.</p>
<p>Thirdly, any op seems to be a CTA these days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just wonder, from a management point of view, how effective is 100% tax to encourage participation.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/handown.wordpress.com/83/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/handown.wordpress.com/83/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=handown.wordpress.com&#038;blog=20419933&#038;post=83&#038;subd=handown&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following is an entire conversation I had with a friend of mine today, 4th October 2011 at 17:39 EVE time.</p>
<p>[17:39:05]  my friend&gt; ever take part in ctas, han? <span class='wp-smiley emoji emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>
<p>[17:46:42]  Handown&gt; not much</p>
<p>[17:47:18]  Handown? I don&#8217;t care about them, had a burn out earlier on, and I don&#8217;t give a shit any longer</p>
<p>[17:51:58]  my friend&gt;  null sec alliances are pretty insane regarding ctas</p>
<p>[17:52:08]  my friend&gt;  they think ppl have nothing else to do</p>
<p>[17:52:42]  my friend&gt; and ultimitely all those alliance things are just for few alliance leaders, so you fight in reality for them</p>
<p>[17:57:11]  Handown&gt;  indeed</p>
<p>[17:57:19]  Handown&gt;  that is exactly what I think</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To say that I have been thinking about writing a post on this topic for four months!  A couple of words and it delivers it very well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;ll elaborate someday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My vision is to start an anarchist movement, a New Eden wide rebellion against the alliances, against the frame of mind that numbers are important and that you need to be part of something for anything!  A movement that will return THE Capsuleer in its rightful place, in the centre of EVE, rather than the Alliance, as it is today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I refuse.  I resist!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I resubscribed after a very good summer period of real life enjoyment.  The sea this summer was exceptionally great with no jellyfish sightings throughout the season.  I could finally enjoy the sea and all its sports without the constant checking for those mean pests!  +1 to God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also had time to do hand crafts, some DIY around the house and also sports.  I also tried a couple of new games, most notably Pirates of the Burning Seas.  After Elite, which led me to EVE, Pirates of the Burning Seas has strong resemblance with Sid Meiers&#8217; Pirates, a game which I loved when I was a kid, and I still have installed to this very day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pirates of the Burning Seas also thought me a very important lesson.  These are GAMES (lots of stress on this word).  Games are meant to be tried and played thoroughly; losing is also part of the game.  I came across a mission in Pirates of the Burning Seas which I could not muster, and for a while I was starting to get angry about.  Then it dawned on me.  After 2 years playing EVE, I became accustomed to HATE losing; to do everything in my powers to avoid losing.  But these are games, and after all, after loosing many times, I got through and onto the next levels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EVE and its community of players do not tolerate loss, and this is a very dangerous state of mind.  I cannot say what&#8217;s linked with it in scientific or academic terms, but it does not feel right that a game teaches you not to lose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how long EVE will last this time.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/handown.wordpress.com/77/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/handown.wordpress.com/77/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=handown.wordpress.com&#038;blog=20419933&#038;post=77&#038;subd=handown&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
