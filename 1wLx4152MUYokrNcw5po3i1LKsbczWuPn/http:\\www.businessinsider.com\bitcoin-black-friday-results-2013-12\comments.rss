				<description>Please sign the bitcoin petition that I started today on the White House's We the People website. 

You can sign at the petition at &lt;a href=&quot;http://wh.gov/lkF6o&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; &gt;http://wh.gov/lkF6o&lt;/a&gt;

It says:

&quot;WE PETITION THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO:
We petition the Obama administration to expedite SEC clearance for the IPO for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust.
The Winklevoss twins (of Facebook fame) are trying to start an ETF that would allow ordinary Americans to invest in bitcoins, as easily as investing in stocks. However, their attempt to do so is bogged down in regulatory inertia. On July 1, 2013, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust submitted a S-1 to the Securities Exchange Commission for an IPO. Months later, the SEC has still not given the go-ahead. The Obama Administration should direct the SEC to greatly expedite its processing of IPO requests by bitcoin ETF's, such as the Winklevoss'. The delay by the SEC is inexcusable. In a world in which innovation occurs at lightning speed, the SEC needs to move quickly. Their failure to do so creates a risk that the U.S. will fall behind.&quot;

Reason this is important: A bitcoin ETF is the single fastest way to bring bitcoin to the mainstream.</description>

				<description>People have been forever exchanging their gains from fiat (now digital) currencies to real assets. Whether it's from cash, stocks, or bitcoins to real estate, businesses, or commodities.</description>

				<description>People jumping out of one highly speculative item (bitcoins) into a somewhat less speculative item (physical commodities). Presumably betting that bitcoins are at or near one of its peaks, and commodities are at or near the trough.</description>

				<description>Well the answer is simple these are the same people that know the dollar bust will come and are covering their options. The real question is why are 85% of them Chinese?
