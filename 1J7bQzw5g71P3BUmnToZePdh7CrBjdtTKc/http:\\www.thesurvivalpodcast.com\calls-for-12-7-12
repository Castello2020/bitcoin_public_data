		<div class="comment-body"><p>Jack I agree with you 100% on the vaccine issue. There is seems to be no balanced approach or common sense to them or for any health issues it seems.</p>
<p>The one thing you didnt mention was that the vaccine companies can not be sued or held responsible for damages done, the government handles this with tax money from each vaccine sold. Not only is this a carte blanche for the companies but its probably a big part of the reason they need to drive the volume of vaccines because the settlement money has to come from somewhere.</p>
<p>To the lady that called in: You are a brave mother, your child will thank you some day for caring enough to ask the questions. Just make sure  you have good answers if you decide not to because you will in most cases need a waiver for school and information to share with the sheeple who will criticize you. </p>
<p>I love mercola and he is teamed up with <a href="http://www.nvic.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nvic.org/</a>, which is a great resource as well.</p>
<p>Ive researched this extensively for my child and decided against it so if the caller wants research advice and not my opinion Id be glad to help.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Peter W. Oh there is a scientific reason for our current life expectancy, the only thing is you don’t know what it is.  I do and it is simply that it is about how long well fed and well housed humans live.  The whole everyone died young in the past thing is a lie; yep lie a myth is too mild for this reality.</p>
<p>I looked up the age of death of the twenty top founders of the US, it averaged 72 years.  The average age of death for white males in the US today according to the CDC is 72.8.  The low average age from say 200  years ago is misleading due to what a 0 does to an average.  It was drug down by death at child birth by both infants and women.  The big medical advancement there was doctors learning to wash their hands.</p>
<p>If you look at the disease of every major illness we vaccinate for they were already in massive decline before vaccinations were started.  This is one of the greatest deceptions ever committed on mankind.  It isn’t that modern medicine doesn’t save lives and contribute to some people living longer.  It is simply that things like modern plumbing, climate control and food distribution have done 1000 times more to the same end and medicine got all the glory for it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I actually went further than Jack did, and dug up life expectancies assuming you had already lived to a given age. The key take away, was if you live to 30, you will likely live to your early 70&#8242;s, and it has been that way since the 1700&#8242;s. Probably even before.</p>
<p>Around the 40&#8242;s infant mortality started to plummet. Everything since about the 60&#8242;s has only been a compensation for things we as a society have been doing to ourselves.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You mentioned the problem of multiple vaccines for a single illness. When I was researching the question prior to the birth of my first child, I asked that same question to a panel of nationally recognized pediatric immunolgists. They told me that the reason is due to the fact that a young child&#8217;s system does not have the ability to react fully to one single exposure to an antigen. Which led me to the question of why do we immunize infants. The answer to that was because they were the most compliant population &#8211; they are the ones who get brought in regularly for shots, and they (and the elderly) are the ones whose bodies are most heavily impacted by the illnesses.</p>
<p>My final decision after speaking with the Dr.s was to give some vaccines but not others, to delay as many as possible until my child was older, and to give each one singly (requires special order to avoid the 7-in-1, etc.) with plenty of recovery time in between.</p>
<p>It may or not be connected, but my now 9yo has never had to have an antibiotic, needed to look up the word &#8216;diarrhea&#8217; in the dictionary since she had never experienced it, and has never had an ear infection.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;Top skills for being marketable in a rural environment&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to hear about this. I have been trying to build a foundation to attempt exactly this. My wife tells me I need to take life more seriously by acting more professional, but im the opposite and would rather let people who think im stupid believe im stupid. there&#8217;s no use trying to change someone&#8217;s opinion who may have been thrown off track about another&#8217;s intelligence by their own doing. you can only adjust and move on to the next. what i learned is that when it comes to intelligence and smarts, there&#8217;s only a certain level most (and by most, i mean the top 10% smartest peeps in the world) people can reach before it starts to become counterproductive. counterproductive in the sense that after a while of being really intelligent, you forget that other people have brains too, and other ppl aren&#8217;t as dumb as you take them for even tho you may be smarter. for example, take this piece im righting rite now, the average genius would take one look at it and think a piece of trash wrote this when in fact i have a phd in psychology. so i tend to avoid those people who are clouded by their own prejudice and ignorance. i agree that after 35 years i should prob mature a bit, but when my wife keeps treating me like a dumb 17 year old when i have a phd in psychology its pretty demeaning and destroys any motivation i have for serious change. i know that status is important to many, and people wouldnt be caught dead giving a homeless person a dollar. status only matters to the extent you dont imprison yourself in your status. some people dont see it that way, and they may be right. but there&#8217;s a time and place for everything. anyway back to my wife. until my babes can begin to take me more seriously, and not judge me at face value, then ill make a greater effort to change and please her. i bet we&#8217;ll eventually end counseling as a result. but the things gotta be mutual. she can point her fingers at me all she wants, but i know what she&#8217;s judging (FV), and i know it&#8217;s not indicative of the person i am and can be. sometimes i play stupid with her and she gets so mad at me later and i just tell her what are you mad about, you think im stupid anyway. we always kiss and makeup though. anyway until she accepts some responsibility for cheating on me with my brother and destroying my childhood dreams i will always have some buyers remorse. that&#8217;s what we go to counseling for, but i need to see results. and if she says she doesn&#8217;t have the capacity to deliver, i&#8217;ll ask her; &#8220;well, sweetheart, you had the capacity to screw me over and stab me in the heart, so what do u mean you cant deliver??&#8221; she can go on all she wants during therapy about how sorry she is and yadda yadda yadda, but deep down inside she knows most of my vulnerabilities so she knows exactly what to say to shut me up and keep me happy for the moment. soemtimes i wonder if she even loves me because at the end of the day i think everyone in the world agrees that what matters most are results. talk is cheap. im emotionally spent, depressed, and surprised that i can still function normally because of what she&#8217;s done. and yes i may have deserved about 15% of it, but deep down inside i have a feeling she&#8217;s disappointed that im still here instead of appreciative of everything ive endured and yet im still a faithful husband to her.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Good response for the question about swales. Ian in AZ and anyone else looking for desert permaculture information should do a google search for Brad Lancaster: he is a permaculture designer who lives in Tucson. He has YouTube videos and has several books on dryland permaculture.<br />

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hi Jack, great answer on the desert swales, and yes Brad Lancaster is an amazing resource for arid climate permaculture.<br />
Another option for this person would be to hire someone with a Yeoman&#8217;s to plow to come and keyline plow the whole property. This would allow the rainfall to infiltrate across the whole landscape and would be even cheaper than putting in swales. You could also put in  a swale at the point where you can get the longest line and then contour plow above and below it. Use the swale to catch the large rain events and use the contour or keyline plowing to rapidly build topsoil to hold water across the whole property. Keyline plowing builds topsoil faster than swales.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yeah Keyline is just another tool, like swales and terraces. I only really understood how powerful it was after seeing a plow in action and then visiting a farm that had been plowed for the full three years. With every year going deeper, than the year before. The topsoil was so soft, the pastures were lush green while the nieghbours were dead or dormant, and there were springs, this was in a 500mm (on a good year) a year rainfall area.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Just a FYI, I know you hate the flu shots, but you have to realize that the flu shot is not there to protect you. In a messed up way, it&#8217;s actually there to protect the elderly and young. Its all an indirect effect. If you happen to catch the 3 strains of the flue virus (the ones that were put in the shot as a dead virus) your body would already have the antibodies to better fight off the virus. This is a shot in the dark though since there are so many strains. </p>
<p>But the main point is that they put out the 3 most common, meaning the ones that will spread and have spread the most. In essence it helps you not get infected, then in turn infect the elderly or young who have a Much higher risk of death for something as simple as the flu. </p>
<p>But I get it how you this is BS, I also think the retarded amount of vacinations kids get is INSAINE as well. (check out this chart&#8230;. NUTS <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/child/0-6yrs-schedule-pr.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/child/0-6yrs-schedule-pr.pdf</a> ) But for the flu, I get it to help protect the ones I love, (friends kids and elderly family members). Just my 2 pennies. </p>
<p>LOVE the show keep it going Jack <img src="http://www.thesurvivalpodcast.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /><br />

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@ Steve S, have you read the CDC&#8217;s web site about the &#8220;:actual facts&#8221; regarding flu shots? Their own published findings about what THEY consider the efficacy of the vaccination and what they consider &#8220;a good matching year?&#8221;? About how &#8220;if&#8221; they get it right (the virus match) and &#8220;if&#8217; it matches your body type &#8211; it still does NOTHING to protect against the dozens of &#8220;flu like illnesses&#8221; that are out there?<br />
That it is highly likely that you will get sick from getting the shot? No it you won&#8217;t be &#8220;the flu&#8221; per se, but you&#8217;re still going to puke, hurt all over, run a fever, etc, probably miss some work.. Regardless of what label you put on it, you&#8217;re still sick. That is, unless you&#8217;re a  dedicated &amp; considerate employee and get the shot on a Friday afternoon, like some employers suggest,  so you can be sick on YOUR time &#8211; not theirs.<br />
Have you looked at the true mortality rates?<br />
If the elderly and the very young are truly the ones at risk and the flu shot is SO GOOD, why not just give them the shot? </p>
<p>The CDC just put out a scare article the other day about how &#8220;this could be a bad year, and it&#8217;s started earlier than normal&#8221;. Imo, that&#8217;s because only a 1/3 of the population has bought into the line, 112 m by the story I heard. Why? Maybe because contaminated steroid shots are killing people from something believed &#8220;safe&#8221;? maybe because it&#8217;s not &#8220;my&#8221; responsibility to protect &#8220;you&#8221;? </p>
<p>No, sorry, I choose to protect my body&#8217;s natural defenses, and take other measures rather than have a bunch of dead viruses made by who knows who pumped into my body. Good luck with your choice.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Good answer on vaccines. It should be a choice to do or not to do them.. One of the reasons I quite  being an EMT was they were getting ready to make hepitus vaccines mandatory . If we got the government out of medicine ,no regulation no funding, quilaty of health care would go up. It might actually  be come healt care instead of sick care. My 2€ worth.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I agree on the &#8220;choice&#8221; issue. My wife works at a hospital in Business Services/Accounts Payable and has no contact with patients, but the hospital has issued a directive hat ALL employees must get vaccinated for the flu or be forced to wear a mask that must be changed every 2 hours. (Though provided at company expense as PPE) And the masks were handed out at 3 PM Friday afternoon. Really?  The &#8220;kicker&#8221; is that she doesn&#8217;t have to wear it on her breaks or in the cafeteria  ???<br />
The pressure on my wife to &#8220;just break down and get the shot, will ya?&#8221; and &#8220;why can&#8217;t you be like everyone else?&#8221; has been amazing. Getting informed and knowing the FACTS from CDC regarding the shots have no place in a modern &#8220;health care&#8221; organization.</p>
<p>The funny side, imo, is that one of her co-workers (who DID get the shot) came in coughing &amp; hacking and had to leave early. My wife pointed out to her supervisor (shot also) that the mask was helping to further protect her from her co-workers, while THEY were all exposed to this worker&#8217;s infection spread, whatever it may be. <img src="http://www.thesurvivalpodcast.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

<p>Excellent response to the martial arts question.  I have been studying several systems for over 5 years.  I have a low cost option for the gentleman looking for instruction for himself and his kid.  I worked with my teacher in instructing adults, but he had issues with getting instructors for children.  Perhaps if he volunteered to help with the class he would get some base instruction for just the price of his kid&#8217;s admission.  This may be an option or asking for a package deal for himself and his kid may be better.  Sometimes haggling can be a skill worth developing too.</p>
<p>I would recommend asking if they teach conflict resolution and consequences of your actions as well.  This is very important.  Good luck to anyone that pursues this path!  It&#8217;s fun.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Jack, I appreciated your comments on vaccines. On one hand I am glad that there are vaccines for illnesses that people can take if necessary or if wanted. For example, someone I know had to get a rabies vaccine after an encounter with a potentially rabid bat. On the other hand I did NOT vaccinate my kids with all the bazillion vaccines. There was incredible pressure from my pediatrician when my baby was 2 months old and we went in for a &#8220;well-baby visit&#8221;. When I told the doc that I was going to research and see which vaccines I wanted to give my child, he put more pressure on and said &#8220;wait here, a nurse will come in with the shots, and don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;ll only take a few minutes.&#8221; I took my baby and walked out of the room while telling him &#8220;no thanks&#8221;.  I got a new pediatrician after that.  What I have learned over the years, is to always ask &#8220;Why?&#8221;, and not just blindly follow someones &#8220;recommendation&#8221;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My butternut squash harvest from last year was excellent. The ONLY thing I did to store it was put them whole in my basement. I had squash last all through the winter , spring, and ate our last one in June. They all lasted well (as long as they were fully ripe when stored &#8211; tan colored). That&#8217;s the beauty of winter squash! It stores through the winter with no fuss- better than other root crops like carrots and potatoes IMO.<br />
And the best way to eat it is cut in half lengthwise and baked in the oven with a little butter and brown sugar- yum!  Great in soups too, but baked really brings out the delicious flavor. An awesome food source!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Jack makes a great point about the typical kind of person who goes into politics.  I’d only add that things are slightly better with the town meeting form of government we have in New England.  That’s because town meeting is a form of direct democracy that’s usually going to include several hundred people voting, most of them just average townsfolk with no agenda or ax to grind.  They might go along with some bad proposals if there’s no one to make the opposing case… but if someone does appeal to common sense in a professional manner, any dumb idea can be stopped.  I’ve seen individual citizens stop proposals by both the police department and the school system.  And in liberal Massachusetts I’ve seen restrictions on firearms defeated by a voice vote in a school auditorium.  (Of course, you still don’t really want to live in a town with a lot of dumb ideas being proposed to begin with, which was the point made by the caller.)</p>
<p>Town meeting certainly isn’t perfect, and it doesn’t change the fact that much of Massachusetts is way too happy with big government.  I’ve also seen bitter personal disputes caused by town politics.  But town meeting does help those of us with an opposing point of view to influence the system by appealing directly to our good neighbors.  (It’s amazing how the false dichotomy falls away when it’s just a bunch of neighbors hearing each other out!) </p>
<p>There’s a reason Thomas Jefferson admired the New England town meeting form of government &#8212; because local, direct democratic control really does help preserve liberty.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m the caller and I do agree with you. This is what I took from Jacks response. If some of us liberty minded people did take an interest in the process, less of these issues would arrise. The people on the board where I was have mostly been there for years. They do always open up debate to the people in attendance. No one ever stands up and speaks as a member of the community. Maybe if some of us made it a point to show up and voice a liberitarian viewpoint, in a common sense well spoken way, some of these towns won&#8217;t be so bad. But, with 4 of 5 members so concerened with zoning, and even silly things down to apprving the landscaping plan and the size and amount of parking spaces compared to square footage of the building, it&#8217;s hard to believe that the one voice could make a difference. My main concern is this. I moved to New England from Upstate NY for work. It was simple then, NY had no work, NE did. Now, I am a homeowner, small farm opperator, restaurant General Manager, and prepper. New England is no longer the place for me. I want to relocate. I learned at that board meeting, watching simple hard working folks get shot down for simply trying to expand their livelihood, that one can get e general idea of the restrictive nature of a community just by sitting in on a simple one or two hour board of selectmen meeting. Of course, my real question is; which state does one move to do run a Joe Salatin style, permaculture based, start from scratch, low to no restriction style farm? And still stay East of Texas, and preferably not in the Mid West ( I have family in TX and NY). Thanks for sharing my observation, Jack. I&#8217;m honored that you agree. You&#8217;ve really changed my perspective on life.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hi Jon, thanks for the response.  There are towns in MA that are run like small cities with a council that does everything.  Others, mostly small towns, have open town meeting, where any citizen can show up to vote.  Then there are larger towns where not every citizen can vote in town meeting, but several hundred people are elected to the position (and it&#8217;s really easy to get elected).  In either case, there are elected boards that do most of the regular work throughout the year &#8212; but only the people, organized in town meeting, can vote to approve budgets, bylaws, new programs and taxes, etc.  In town meeting, every citizen-vote is equal and boards have advisory powers only.  Of course I&#8217;ve also seen individual boards do a lot of damage on their own (ie, boards of health banning smoking in town restaurants and hassling farmers).  Some towns are going to be beyond repair and I&#8217;m certainly not saying that I&#8217;d suggest moving to MA &#8212; but every New England state has some form of town meeting, which is a plus.  Checking out the local government is definitely a smart move, wherever you go.</p>
<p>Jack seems to like New Hampshire a lot &#8212; you don&#8217;t see any good towns there?  I&#8217;d also consider Maine &#8212; the state gov&#8217;t is more liberal than NH, but plenty of the towns aren&#8217;t (Ron Paul won most of the interior areas!).  I understand Maine has a good local food scene as well, and of course lots of land to farm.  Even Vermont is a place where leave-me-alone types can find a place for themselves (check out Sugar Mountain Farm for a great blog on pastured-raising pigs in Vermont).  There&#8217;s lots of Salatin-inspired farms in Massachusetts, but it doesn&#8217;t sound like you&#8217;d be happy with the political climate down here.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t like NH, it&#8217;s the ridiculous land taxes up here. Otherwise, it&#8217;s perfect. Easily created and already established markets, decent soil,ok climate, prices arent bad at all.  In general, the Northeast has insane land taxes. They price, appraise, and tax the land up here like they are in the damn Florida Keys. I don&#8217;t want to go any farther north than where I am in Southern NH, as the farming season shortens. Even just an hour North of here causes you to lose about 2-4 weeks of good early or late farming. Here are the states I have on the list so far: Vermont, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Verginia, Georgia, Texas, and North Carolina. Also, I have heard in some states you get a serious tax break if you farm, but I have yet to look into that yet. I would consider Western MA as well, just not sure about the regulations. NY is possibly one of those tax break states, but I grew up there and I have a really bad taste in my mouth from it. Also, their gun laws are getting worse. Hell, I cant buy handgun ammo there as an out of state resident and you have to own the gun to get ammo. I get the logic, but it sucks.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Jon, thanks for sharing some details of your situation.  I’ve heard horror stories about real estate taxes in NH, although I’ve also heard that towns vary quite a bit.  Maine does have some sort of tax exemption for farmland.  I think we have something in MA as well, but I don’t recall the details.  </p>
<p>With the exception of potato country in the far north, the agricultural parts of Maine are actually warmer (per hardiness zone, at least) than most of Vermont.  The forum at city-data.com/forum/maine/ has some farmers and homesteaders who could answer questions.</p>
<p>Western Massachusetts is a place where Manhattanites have summer homes and it feels a bit like Vermont in many spots.  The Connecticut River Valley (north of Springfield) has a bohemian/hippy feel due to the colleges.  Central MA is generally one of the more conservative parts of the state (at least outside of Worchester).  MA does have restrictive gun laws.  goal.org and the forum at <a href="http://www.northeastshooters.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.northeastshooters.com</a> are your best resources on MA gun laws.  If you’re into CCW, avoid the red and orange towns on this map: <a href="http://keiiken.net/images/macitytowngun.png" rel="nofollow">http://keiiken.net/images/macitytowngun.png</a></p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Dr. Mercola is a mixed bag &#8212; he’s on the cutting edge of some things that will probably be generally accepted medical advice in the future.  On the other hand, he has his own personal spin on things and I’ve even found him to be misleading when I’ve done my own research.  His video “Vitamin D not flu shots,” is a good example:</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/15ycdbSsnAU" rel="nofollow">http://youtu.be/15ycdbSsnAU</a></p>
<p>He says the flu shot “exceeds the toxic dose of mercury.”  Not true.  It only exceeds the amount of mercury recommended for a single day, which isn’t toxic unless you do it 365 days/year.  The amount of mercury in a flu shot could easily be exceeded by a tuna fish sandwich.  So yes, if you were to get a flu shot (or eat a tuna fish sandwich) every day, you would eventually be at risk for mercury poisoning.  But as an occasional thing, the risk of such a small amount of mercury is pretty close to zero.  Misleading statements like that make me question the rest of his position &#8212; and as he says, you should do your own research anyway.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he has very good advice about vitamin D that you won’t hear from many people.  I used to get bad head colds until I started taking 5,000 IU/day during cold season.  Mercola’s advice on vitamin D is similar to what you’ll find on vitamindcouncil.org, which makes the case for getting a lot more vitamin D than the government recommends.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This is a comment on the Swales in az, what I caught that no one else caught is, Ian said 2 acres in northern az. Northern az is a totally different cilmate than the desert in the southern half and has many different climates. Flagstaff is different than show low and they are both different than Page but they all have brutal winters unlike Tucson and Phoenix. Ian please clarify which part of northern az, not hacking on ya but the climates are different, it might or might change the design</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I really liked Jack&#8217;s response on the martial arts question and there are a few things that I can add.  I have been a student of several different styles, especially Krav Maga, where I am also an instructor.  In training and teaching over the years, I have learned that it truly is the instructor as well as the content of what&#8217;s being taught.  </p>
<p>A good place to start that is usually low cost is YMCA&#8217;s and rec centers.  Once again, evaluate the instructors.</p>
<p>Another consideration maybe wrestling and/or boxing.  Many times I have found that these programs provide the participants with many of the valuable traits that we want our children to garner; hard work, humilty, managed aggression, sportsmanship, and toughness.</p>
<p>A real good video resource that I highly recommend is a video titled &#8220;I Am Not A Target.&#8221;  Here is an amazon.com link:<br />
 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Am-Not-Target-Artist-Provided/dp/B000CPH9JI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1355013557&#038;sr=8-1&#038;keywords=i+am+not+a+target" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Am-Not-Target-Artist-Provided/dp/B000CPH9JI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1355013557&#038;sr=8-1&#038;keywords=i+am+not+a+target</a> </p>
<p>I have shown this video to both of my boys and they learned from it.  My boys have wrestled competively as well as studied Tae Kwon Do and they got a lot out of it.  I also know several other parents whom have shown this DVD to their kids as well and they have had nothing but praise for it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>One of my daughters is a freshman at college.  There is a group there which teaches aikido at no cost.  She joined, and has been quit happy with it.  It is very much a self-defense martial art.   Possibly there are such groups in other areas.  </p>
<p> I was also surprised to see when she was home Thanksgiving, checking her email, one from the university encouraging students to take a concealed carry class offered at the school.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Good comment on the Martial Arts-you need good hands on training to build a solid foundation and understanding of distance, timing, balance &amp; coordination and other fundamentals before you could hope to learn much from DVD or books.  I have been training in the Martial Arts since 1982 and in 1984 my Kung Fu instructor was leaving town so me and my fellow students shopped around town for another instructor and funny but we all agreed on the same instructor.  Why?<br />
Fair honest and honorable-he let me work off park of my monthly dues as I was a poor college student.<br />
Law Enforcement-he actually had some knock down drag out fight experience<br />
de-escalation and bully handling strategies<br />
A Martial Art should have a good mix of techniques including strikes, takedowns, use and defense vs weapons and grappling<br />
So my advice would be to shop around town and find yourself a good instructor&#8230;sometimes the best instructors are small neighborhood instructors not teaching for money but their passion of the Martial Arts.</p>

<p>I agree with the computer skills assessment.   I work for the department of Health in PEI as a Database Analyst.  My specialty is Oracle&#8217;s PL/SQL.  I write extract queries, custom reports for our Data Warehouse.  I recently discovered &#8220;Odesk.com&#8221;  Where you bid on work.  It is global in nature.  And you build up a portfolio and get ratings, much like vendors on Ebay.  A co-worker of mine has pulled in about 12k Canadian working with clients.  So the point is, you can be rural and work anywhere.</p>

<p> Good word there on vaccines .. I am pretty scared to death of the medical industry and all he propaganda and flu scares that always seem to come out. I heard em talking about how all people should get vaccinated against AIDS in the next few years. It never seems to end and I appreciate hearing you spreading the truth on this which you said enough to satisfy me there and I was impressed.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Regarding public land: Our 20 acres are sandwiched between state and national forest. Only once did we have a lost hunter wander onto our place looking for directions. The closest access road is 1/2 mile away. For the most part, it provides us with a huge buffer zone and additional area to get firewood. On the downside, when the National forest side was logged several years ago, they were flying helicopters over our place at 4:30 am. and smoked us out when they burned their slash (what a waste). Mostly positive though.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thanks for the swales answer, Jack. You&#8217;re right about 6&#8242; hugel beds being out of the question. I really have a hard time picturing a 3&#8242;x6&#8242; swales coming close to actually filling up in my climate. I&#8217;m in an area much more temperate than Phoenix (6000+ feet elevation), but we still only get 2-3 inches of rain in our wettest months, with maybe a half inch of rain max in any single storm. </p>
<p>As a quick followup, if you were doing &#8220;standard&#8221; size swales, how far apart would you run them?</p>
<p>Also, I will definitely be looking up the permaculture guy in Tucson mentioned above.</p>

Anyone considering inoculating their children should view this.  And Jack is right.  Dr. Mercola is a superior source.  I get his postings.  Sign up on his email listing asap if you have not already.</p>
<p>A friend of mine has a beautiful daughter who was born 100% normal.  It was time for her shots.  She became terribly ill within a short time period after the injections and remained so for over 24 hours. The dr. assured her this was &quot;normal&quot;&#8230;some babies run a temp, etc.  This wasn&#039;t &quot;normal&quot;.  She is now permanently brain damaged and will require assistance all of her life.  She is able to function but could be equated to a lightly retarded level.  She is in the special ed classes at school.  This couple did have another child, a son.  He has had NO inoculations and never will.</p>
<p>When they try to force you to inject these foreign substances into your baby be prepared with the correct paperwork to opt out should you make that decision.<br />
Public gov&#039;t run schools will really fight you on this issue as well.   But then they&#039;ll want your child on ADHD drugs as well&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>Give us a posting on FB when your baby is born!  Would love to hear about the littlest TSPer!  <img src="http://www.thesurvivalpodcast.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The answer given on inverter generators might lead everyone to think that all electronics will run properly from crappy square wave type inverters&#8230;thats not the case.  I live off-grid and have some experience getting things to run from my 12V power system (also an EE which helps).</p>
<p>Transformer style wall worts will work fine on any kind of inverter, but switching power supplies might not appreciate the power from a cheap inverter.  A good example of this is the 60W notebook adapters from Apple won&#8217;t start 100% of the time (usually not at all).  Many &#8220;wall worts&#8221; these days are not transformer based but have a little switching power supply in them.</p>
<p>The question asking for a whole house (the term is) &#8220;true sine wave&#8221; output is not a bad one since you never know what household electronics you need to drive.  The EU series generators are sine wave generators and will power anything (regular &#8220;loud&#8221; generators are also sine wave BTW).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>About self defense question for children: often your local YMCA or Local High Scholl Adult Education will have a free or inexpensive class. I like traditional styles of martial art for the qualities it teaches but they are not always best for &#8220;self defense&#8221;. Until then, get or make a punching bag and buy a couple of of hand targets that you can hold for your kid to strike/kick. (Movement is key). And remember- when choosing a school- ask yourself- is the instructor the kind of person I want my kid to be like?  Choose an instructor not so much a style! (And join yourself!! Family is key)</p>

<p>Flu shots are BS and they protect nobody. The virus mutates and changes from person to person, science cannot predict the exact strain you will be exposed to during a flu season. It&#8217;s one wild ass guess which strain will hit you.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Great show. A couple ideas.</p>
<p>1) Learn to make Biodiesel. Either through algae, switch grass, etc. Youtube has some videos on this. IMHO it&#8217;s not something I&#8217;m seeing a lot of discussion about. If we have a deep collapse people won&#8217;t be needing a tank a week. Just enough for the farmers market once a month. Or a farmer might need enough for planting a new crop seasonally. People would probably kill for one gallon.</p>
<p>2) Basic electronics. If you have the components and the plans. You could make radios for people. Maybe even powered by a Potato. Add to that a 1 watt transmitter and you could have your own little radio station. People could trade food for advertising.</p>
