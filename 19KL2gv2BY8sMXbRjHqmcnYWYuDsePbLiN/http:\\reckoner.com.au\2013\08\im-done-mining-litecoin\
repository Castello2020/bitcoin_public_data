<p class="footnote">Image: <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=243341.0" target="_blank">Physical Silver Litecoins</a> by <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?PHPSESSID=27onj3f9sfs50sudrq9bo1h9e2&amp;action=profile;u=25960" target="_blank">Smoothie</a></p>
<p><a href="http://reckoner.com.au/2013/07/my-three-months-as-a-litecoin-farmer/">In my previous Reckoner feature about Litecoin</a>, I came to the conclusion that I had three options on the table at that stage of my experiment mining the crypto-currency:</p>
<p><strong>Option 1</strong> - sell up and cut my losses.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2</strong> &#8211; keep mining at my current rate.</p>
<p><strong>Option 3</strong> &#8211; buy more rigs and mine even more Litecoin with the hope that the price rises.</p>
<p><em>Option 1, the path of least resistance.</em> That&#8217;s the choice I ultimately ended up at.</p>
<p>My Litecoin mining adventure wasn&#8217;t profitable and —if I&#8217;m honest—a waste of time. To redeem something out of the experience, I can at least share with you what I did wrong. If you are thinking about mining Litecoin or some other sort of crypto-currency, you can learn from my mistakes.</p>
<p class="excerpt" style="text-align: center;">The main thing everyone wants to know is <em>&#8220;how much money did you lose, man?!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s cut to the chase.</p>
<p>My costs were:</p>
<ul>
<li>$16,056.10 on set up <em>(hardware, equipment, shelving)</em></li>
<li>$5,075.00 on electricity, rent &amp; internet access</li>
<li>$454.92 on credit card interest <em>(approx)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Which is a <strong>total spend of $21,586.02</strong>.</p>
<p>My income was:</p>
<ul>
<li>$10,709.78 on selling the gear <em>(post ebay fees, postage, etc.)</em></li>
<li>$2,693.00 selling LTC previously</li>
</ul>
<p>That puts me at a total loss of <strong>$8,183.24</strong>. However, I do have 894LTC in my wallet.</p>
<p>The current price of LTC right now is hovering around $2.50 <em>(ugh)</em>, which means if I was to sell my entire LTC stash, I will have lost <strong>$5,948.24</strong> all up.</p>
<p>A good scenario is the price of LTC <em>maybe</em> hitting $5 once it&#8217;s announced on <a href="https://www.mtgox.com/" target="_blank">Mt. Gox</a> (see their <a href="https://www.mtgox.com/press_release_20130805.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> which addresses this further). Which means, realistically, I will have lost<strong> $3,713.24</strong> in total.</p>
<p>Ideal circumstances? If I was to sell that LTC for $9.15 per coin, I could break even on the whole thing. If I sell for $10, I&#8217;d make $756. If I sell my stash for $72.50 per coin, I&#8217;d be able to buy a sweeeeeett <a href="http://www2.mercedes-benz.com.au/content/australia/mpc/mpc_australia__website/en/home_mpc/passengercars/home/new_cars/models/a-class/w176/facts_/sportsmodel.html">Mercedes Benz A250 Sport</a>.</p>
<p>Yeah, that isn&#8217;t going to happen.</p>
<h1>What went wrong? What could I have done better?</h1>
<p>I was naive enough to think that the price of LTC would grow so quickly, that it could meet the minimum repayment on my card and cover the costs of electricity, rent &amp; an internet connection. Unfortunately, this did not happen. I see now—with the benefit of hindsight—that this goal was unrealistic.</p>
<p>I totally underestimated the sharp rise in mining difficulty too. I knew it would rise, but not at the rocketing rate it has. Between April and August, LTC mining difficulty grew by 437% &#8211; that&#8217;s insane!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1103" alt="Litecoin rig" src="http://reckoner.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/IMG_20130603_211638.jpg" width="1200" height="900" /></p>
<p class="footnote">Image: <a href="https://forum.litecoin.net/index.php/topic,3095.msg29305.html?PHPSESSID=ggl58b63spr96tn9q8rc99iuk5#msg29305" target="_blank">Litecoin rig by Snootch</a></p>
<h1>Setup Efficiencies</h1>
<p>My setup could have been more refined. I could have been running rigs with 5 cards per motherboard, resulting in a slightly lower initial setup cost and slightly lower power consumption. I could have also flashed the graphics cards&#8217; BIOS (and hence, underclocked the GPUs) for a good balance of power consumption and performance, ultimately saving more power.</p>
<p>With 7&#215;5 card rigs, I would have spent $12,502.23 on gear and $1,910.67 on miscellaneous setup equipment. This would have saved me a total of $1,644, which at the end of the day would have been a noticeable difference.</p>
<p>There would have been a small decrease in power consumption by having less rigs with more cards, but not by a lot and it&#8217;s hard to work out the exact power usage in the real world, especially after system tweaks. Let&#8217;s say I achieved a 10% reduction in my power consumption — a generous estimate based on the result of GPU tweaking and rig consolidation. That would have made my power bill $3,796, instead of $4,218, decreasing my loss by $422.</p>
<p>Tweaking the system and consolidating my rigs would have made a difference (to the tune of almost $2000), but not <em>that</em> much of a difference in the overall scheme of things. I still would have lost over $1,000.</p>
<h1>You Need Cheap Power</h1>
<p>The key to crypto-currency mining (in Australia at least) is cheap power. Ideally, free power. Many of the people who purchased my gear are mining Litecoin and other coins, and when I asked them how they&#8217;re justifying the low profitability, they all said said they&#8217;re able to snag free electricity from somewhere. Normally stashing a few rigs at work, hoping nobody notices (hah). Good luck to them I say!</p>
<p>If you can find free power, here&#8217;s how it breaks down:</p>
<p><strong>Spend $14,500</strong> to set up a farm that should generate around 600LTC month. If you don&#8217;t have to pay for power—and assuming the LTC rate of difficulty increases at the same rate—you should have accumulated around 7200LTC. If you end up selling that LTC for say, $6 a coin, how much would you make?</p>
<p><strong>$28,000 in profit</strong>.</p>
<p>Turn around and sell the gear for at least half of its original value, and that number rises to around $35,000.</p>
<p>Assuming your source of free power doesn&#8217;t disappear, or find out and call the police for stealing&#8230;</p>

<p class="footnote">Image: <a href="https://canadiandirtbags.wordpress.com/2013/05/06/spring-2013-update/" target="_blank">Solar panels by Canadian Dirtbags</a></p>
<h1>Solar? Wind? Exploring Alternative Power Solutions</h1>
<p>But what about solar power? The sun gives us free electricity! Let&#8217;s use it to power our Litecoin farms!</p>
<p>Over the course of a year, our 30x GPU Litecoin farm will use 73,634kWh of electricity. Charged at 18.225c/kWh (still the cheapest power I can find in Australia), the annual power bill will be $13,419.</p>
<p>A solar system with enough average peak output to supply 8400W of electricity would cost about $10,000 (you can get 10kW systems installed for $10k these days, cool!). Solar panels that output 10kW will be able to supply all the power we need! Spend $10k to save $13.5k and the panels will last for 20 years giving out free electricity! Let&#8217;s go buy solar panels now!!!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get too excited, though. There&#8217;s a few harsh realities of solar power we need to step through.</p>
<p>First of all, the sun doesn&#8217;t shine 24/7. At night, we&#8217;d need an alternative power source. Normally that&#8217;s the grid, but you could also install batteries. If you do, you&#8217;ll need enough of them to power 8400W for the time when the sun doesn&#8217;t shine, and then enough solar panels to charge the batteries <em>and</em> power the farm itself.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d be looking at just $25,000 for the panels, let alone the insane amount of batteries you&#8217;d need (probably 40 of the biggest deep cycle batteries you can find, which will set you back another $35k). Spending $50,000 doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s wind power, which if you&#8217;re in a windy enough area, can supply power at night, but a 10kW turbine is huge and will set you back $20k easily. Good luck getting a permit to put one up anywhere in Victoria too. <em>Thanks anti-wind farm nutjobs.</em></p>
<p>So the only real alternative is to get a discount on our electricity use by using solar when it shines brightly to give 8.4kW of power, then supplementing it with grid power when there&#8217;s not enough light. Solar panel output varies greatly depending on the amount of sunlight. Take these <a href="http://www.pvoutput.org/list.jsp?id=11002&amp;sid=9028">PVOutput stats</a> from a 10kW system out in suburban Melbourne.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pvoutput.org/list.jsp?id=11002&amp;sid=9028" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1078" alt="Output chart from a 10kW system out in suburban Melbourne" src="http://reckoner.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/pvoutput-chart.png" width="800" height="316" /></a></p>
<p>The 10kW solar panels only generated 11,350kW of power over 12 months (there&#8217;s a few days missing, so I rounded the number up). Our farm needs 73,634kWh of power per year, so there&#8217;s still a shortfall of 62,284kWh &#8211; leaving us with a power bill of $11,352.</p>
<p>All we will save is about $2,000/year.</p>
<p>In other words, it would take 5 years of mining to pay back the cost of the panels and even once the panels are paid off, you&#8217;re still only saving $2,000/year.</p>
<p>Solar panels are great and every home should have them, but as far as Litecoin mining goes, unless you&#8217;re in for the super long haul, I wouldn&#8217;t bother.</p>
<h1>What could I have spent my money on instead?</h1>
<p>There&#8217;s always an opportunity cost involved with this sort of thing. What else could I have done with the same resources and what would have been the result of that? I can&#8217;t go back in time to change what I&#8217;ve done, but it&#8217;s interesting to see what could have been. I whipped up a few spreadsheets to either justify my actions or remonstrate myself for wasting money.</p>
<ul>
<li>$16,000 worth of shares on my credit card, investing in CBA, TLS, BHP and WES would have gained me a $1030 profit, probably less once it&#8217;s taxed.</li>
<li>$16,000 of sports betting on the AFL, based on my footy tips results would have left me over $12,000 in debt.</li>
<li>$16,000 worth of LTC on the 3rd of April 2013, those 3655 coins would have been worth $9,913 on the 3rd of August.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I guess losing approximately $3,800 overall isn&#8217;t so bad. Investing in shares like banks and mining seems like a good idea to be honest, especially since how they&#8217;re so protected by the government in Australia at least. Would I have done it instead of LTC? Probably not <img src="http://reckoner.com.au/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<h1>What next?</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty obvious that if you can score free electricity, get mining Litecoin <strong>NOW</strong>. You&#8217;d be dumb not to. If you are a bit less risk averse with your investments and an interest in crypto-currency, take a look at these Australian guys making a Bitcoin mining ASIC device. It sounds really good, and particularly if you&#8217;re also in Australia, as you can catch up and talk to the people making it &#8211; they seem to be much more transparent than the other ASIC hardware vendors out there. There&#8217;s also the bonus of Bitcoin being a bit more legit and more ecosystem and culture around it than Litecoin, which is nice.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty much it for me in regards to crypto-currency. I don&#8217;t really intend to write any further regarding Litecoin or Bitcoin in the near future. There&#8217;s so many other interesting things in technology going on out there!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll find something else to suck myself into pretty quick.</p>

I echo Alec&#8217;s sentiment and wish this had turned out better for you. I usually recommend people go in small; one or two rigs like the ones featured at <a href="http://www.coinminingrigs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.coinminingrigs.com</a> does the trick. The key is diversify, diversify, diversify. Buy a few Bitcoins, a few Litecoins and maybe build a rig or two. Come back in a year, and you&#8217;ll almost certainly have made a profit. Just don&#8217;t quit your job to do this. It&#8217;s just a diversification of your income producing assets.</p>

<p>I think there will be some people in Australia who make money out of it, but seems like free or cheap power is a must. No doubt there&#8217;s a bunch of IT admins piggy-backing smaller rigs in the midst of their pre-existing work infrastructure as we speak.</p>

If you would had diverted the all the idle CPUs to mine Primecoins when it first released about a month ago. You would have mined over 3K worth in less than one week. Gotta stay well informed on what&#8217;s new and profitable to mine here. </p>
<p>While you were mining exclusively with LTC, it would have been better if you mined other alt coins and trade up for BTC/LTC. I&#8217;ve setup my mining rig after you and it already paid for itself and I don&#8217;t have any free power here either. </p>
<p>Best of luck to you, I enjoyed reading your articles.  Keep your current LTCs that you still have and come back in a couple years to see if it multiple in price.

<p>You needed to mine *alt-coins* and then sell them for LTC. Profitability mining Scrypt alt-coins has been consistently significantly higher than mining LTC. For months straight there&#8217;s been coins at 150% &#8211; 250% profitability of Litecoin mining. Obviously you mine the most profitable coins and switch to other coins as they become more profitable. Or you use an auto-switching pool. Recently I spent a few weeks mining ADT at an average of 200% profitability of LTC. I&#8217;ve also kept track of which coins were going to be added to Cryptsy, and mined them at low difficulty before they were added, coming to 1000% profitability of LTC for some.</p>
<p>I used a rig similar to yours, and with expensive power costs. And I&#8217;m way in the green &#8211; tripled my investment. I use the auto-sale feature on Cryptsy which sells the coins for BTC or LTC automatically as they&#8217;re mined.</p>
<p>Your plan to &#8220;only mine Litecoins&#8221; makes you simply stupid. This whole article can be disregarded as stupidity because you missed out on such a basic requirement.</p>
<p>You spent $16,000 on hardware and then couldn&#8217;t be fussed to switch the coin you were mining.</p>
<p>Fools are easily parted with their money.</p>

At least you have learnt something &#8211; we still spend thousands of dollars to have university education. As we stand right now, there are thousands of people just about to start in mining the coins and some will make immense profits within the next two years or so. Start again but first on a small scale using only one GPU rig. If one card rig will make a profit for you, then two will, and then four, and so on and so forth. Initially, do not go in the direction of using solar panels; otherwise electricity generating firms would already have been using the same to run factories. All in all, this is a very good article you have here.</p>

<p>Maybe the right thing is mining with solar only when is shining, and dont waste money on paid electricity. Also, you forgot the magnetic power generators. They will run 24/7 for you <img src="http://reckoner.com.au/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>If you live near to electricity wires, you can install an electro-static generator and get redundant power for free and also creep hair.</p>
<p>If you want to make profit with Litecoins, be the pool not the miner. Is a good analogy to &#8220;be the boss not the worker.&#8221;</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

You bought &#8211; with money you didn&#8217;t actually have &#8211; equipment that depreciates in order to make money that has zero value until you actually have a buyer for it &#8230; amusing!</p>
<p>First rule of not falling on your ass. Don&#8217;t buy speculation with a credit card. Second rule, the more money you invest, the longer you need to hedge your bets for. Of course it&#8217;s risky, but you knew that going in, right? Third rule, never expect anything fueled by speculation to follow set trends.</p>
<p>I started mining with my piffly little Radeon 6970 about a week ago. So far, I&#8217;ve spent a grand total of USD$18 on electricity. However, the profit margin I am now making as the LTC price soars to USD$48 is ridiculous because I didn&#8217;t spend any real money on this, let alone money I didn&#8217;t have in the first place. </p>
<p>I will keep doing this because that electricity cost is a fixed-rate expense, and I can rely on it remaining fixed rate.</p>

<p>It might be a punt but, it doesn&#8217;t seem too wild to believe that LTC might hold at least 1/5 the value of BTC at sometime in the future, at present that would be $200usd. if BTC tails back, maybe LTC could reach $100 a pop, no?</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-399" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Litecoin is trading at $37 and was as high as $42 at this current time and more likely will trade higher in the next few days. The problem is most people get greedy, or ether expect it to replace there income and expect to get a quick return and blow money they don&#8217;t have, &#8220;hence buy rigs on credit&#8221;. Rule number one, never spent, loan, or donate money, you don&#8217;t have, or going to need to pay bills. When ever you deal with a project like this, you have to be very patient, it can some times take years to get a return. Plus mining isn&#8217;t the best way to make quick cash, actually buying the coins and trading it is and is pretty much what I did, plus had a couple mining rigs. I actually made over 20k profit and still held onto a huge amount of coins, plus the rigs.</p>
<p>Just hope you at very least you held onto the 894LTC you had, or have?</p>

That is if you think there is still more upside.  But before anything, DIVERSIFY!  If you really consider mining litecoin an investment, you have to stick with it for longer than a few months -treat it like a business.  If you still have the resources (or still have some capital), your start up costs are already paid for.</p>

LTC is going to keep going up because btc is going to get harder and people are going to jump ship. ltc is the easier alternative to mining.

<p>I still don&#8217;t know if you have your 3655 coins saved up but if you do this was not a sad story at all just fun and entertaining reading about your mining project and possible options.</p>

I guess the days for BitCoin mining with easily available hardware has become close to impossible unless you literally own a mining farm. In my opinion, LiteCoin is the way to go now! I&#8217;ve been building some of my own mining rigs since a year now and I&#8217;m willing to build them for other people too. What&#8217;s in it for me? Of course, the more people joining the race, the more those coins will climb. Result: The early bird wins.

Funnily enough i found this because of the guy pseudo-explaining bitcoin on the 7:30 report. Reading the responses is always amusing, in typical crypto-community fashion, they&#8217;re all &#8220;the nature of the currency isn&#8217;t shit, you just failed the currency, everythings up uP UP, GET ON THE HYPE TRAIN, CHOO CHOO&#8221;. It&#8217;s refreshing to see that you cut your losses. The fact that the people you talked to were all using &#8216;free power&#8217;, externalising all the costs onto other people is a typical &#8216;fuck you, got mine&#8217; attitude that shows that people can&#8217;t think outside of their own little world about the real costs of their actions.</p>
<p>The effort you put into this article is pretty good and I&#8217;m glad to see that you actually EVALUATED trying to use alternative power, and in the process actually showed why a typical setup is an eco-disaster.</p>
<p>I really can&#8217;t wait untill this bullshit bubble bursts.</p>

<p>How much power goes into the current financial transaction systems that have those problems inherent in their design &amp; always will? It&#8217;s probably a lot.</p>
<p>Which system is more wasteful overall? I don&#8217;t know the answer, but it&#8217;s not quite as cut-and-dried as the idea that &#8216;mining Bitcoins is a waste of power&#8217;.</p>

If you can accumulate 7200LTC with &#8216;free&#8217; electricty, at today&#8217;s value [ Feb 2014]. it is about $151,200. Nothing to laugh about and it repeats itself again for 2014 and so forth. Imagine LTC hitting $50?</p>

How long would a $10k solar investment take until it pays off?<br />
Also, making money is NOT just about making more money, its about budgeting and accountability to know your losses and expenses ahead of time.</p>
<p>You could mine 12 hours a day over 24… Take no energy cost while its offline, its not like NOT mining would cost you money.</p>
<p>So the least resistance in making money while having little to no expenses, is selling to consumers something renewable in itself.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a technology idea going around that you can create solar farms via special paint instead, which could be considerably cheaper in starting costs.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-753" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This post is somewhat inactive (last post being<br />
a month ago) so I hope my post gets read. Firstly I would like to say that Mr<br />
Agius&#8217; report is commendable as it is a form of intellectual capital given<br />
without any expectation of reward except to educate/inform individuals such as<br />
myself. Secondly, I don&#8217;t even know what a GPU is but I find the whole<br />
crypto-currency form of exchange incredibly fascinating.  Historians<br />
will no doubt look back on this period of time as a defining point in the way<br />
individuals and countries engaged in trade and commerce. To be part of that<br />
-for me at least-is exciting. Thirdly, and most importantly I want to make the<br />
following point. Once you have your litecoins, bitcoins etc forget the cost of<br />
acquisition. Cost of acquisition is only relevant when you decide whether or<br />
not to invest (i.e. mine) once you have your coins your mindset has to change<br />
because at this point in time you are holding an asset e.g. a stock. The 2 most<br />
important rules when selling a stock are as follows: 1) No emotion! Thinking<br />
about concepts such as &#8216;breaking even&#8217; is a type of emotion; i.e. &#8216;I don&#8217;t want<br />
to lose money&#8217; 2) only sell when there is a downward trend in the market.<br />
Pre-determine what constitutes a downward trend (this can be difficult with<br />
cyber-currency as price fluctuations are greater than traditional currencies).<br />
An example may be 3 consecutive days of declining value of &gt;3% or a 10 %<br />
loss in a 7 day period or some other form of measurement. Once this measurement<br />
has been satisfied, regardless of whether you’ve made a profit or loss, SELL,<br />
SELL, SELL. No one picks the bottom of a market nor does anyone pick its peak<br />
(other than by chance). I have no idea as to whether mining of coins is<br />
profitable. But I do know about trading. Mr Agius stated that his 894 LTC were<br />
hovering around $2.50, he went through some scenarios, ‘sell at $9.15<br />
break even’, ‘sell at $10 make $756’ etc. Never, in advance, decide what price<br />
a share/coin should be sold at, or speculate about scenario&#8217;s out of your<br />
control e.g. mt Gox doing this or that. Let your profits run. That is how<br />
traders make money (successful traders generally have more losses than gains,<br />
however those gains, although fewer in number are greater in size). Let your<br />
profits run, like in sport momentum is everything. Once you&#8217;ve identified a<br />
downward trend SELL, SELL, SELL. Most of all, don’t expect to get rich only<br />
invest what you’re prepared to lose. I’m not qualified to give financial advice<br />
nor am giving financial advice. I would simply like to see entrepreneurs like<br />
Mr Agius, get some reward for being brave enough to have a good-old-fashioned<br />
crack at it.</p>
