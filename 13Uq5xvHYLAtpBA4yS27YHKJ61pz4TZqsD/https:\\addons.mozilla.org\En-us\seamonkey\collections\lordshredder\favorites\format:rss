After installing the ACR, you can report if the Firefox add-ons that you're using are working properly. If you notice that one of your add-ons doesn't seem to be working the same way it did in previous versions of the application, just open the Add-ons Manager and click 'Report Issue' next to that add-on to send a report to Mozilla.

Three weeks after a Firefox version bump, we will be prompting users using Aurora/Beta for information about whether their add-ons work. This will be a popup panel. The panel can manually be initiated by clicking the add-on icon in the Add-ons Bar.

Even if your add-ons all work fine, if they're marked incompatible, please let us know that they work fine by submitting a success report so we can encourage the add-on developer to update their compatibility information.

We'll collect all of the reports and let add-on developers know what users are having problems with, or if their add-ons seem to work just fine in future versions of the product.

If you're an add-on developer trying to find reports submitted for your extension, head over to the Report Viewer here: &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/compatibility/reporter" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://addons.mozilla.org/compatibility/reporter&lt;/a&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Mozilla</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2014 14:20:10 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/add-on-compatibility-reporter/versions/2.0.4</guid></item><item><title>Xmarks Sync 4.3.2</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/xmarks-sync/</link><description>Xmarks lives and has been acquired by &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/1009538ed26d367e389256ef2891c8433d6f5fc2/http%3A//lastpass.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt;!

&lt;b&gt;Thanks to You, WorldIP will live!&lt;/b&gt;

FF29 does not have add-on bar anymore, therefore if you want to see all infos bottom, you have to install "The Addon Bar" (for Firefox29) additionally for some useful add-ons
&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/the-addon-bar/"&gt;https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/the-addon-bar/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Please report the bugs you found here &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/402263784b9b2df8a53e0204b83a443c8d51598ec4f48472bb951ef70bb128e8/https%3A//worldip.userecho.com/"&gt;worldip.userecho.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

WorldIP provides the following information:

- all IP addresses of the server (IPv4 and IPv6), Reverse DNS, web-server
- all DNS entries for domains (A,AAAA,MX,NS,SPF,TXT,SOA,CNAME,PTR), their Time to Live (TTL)
- real country, flag
- data center, provider, autonomous system (AS)
- your external IP address, ISP and change log (by time or when changing proxy)

- ping and traceroute from all continents (around 40 servers worldwide). Advanced traceroutes with three protocols simultaneously (TCP/UDP/ICMP)
- ping and traceroute from your computer
- links to Looking Glasses of 43 global providers (by provider name or by country/city). Not every global provider has an open LG
- whois, BGP connections on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/b10f9e4a77ca8fb915276d1ab7cd44daf5e43c8d72185a70e7c615d26c38148e/http%3A//bgp.he.net"&gt;bgp.he.net&lt;/a&gt;
- DNS ping and custom request to any server

- verification of compliance of the website with the IP address, protection against &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/55917361d102073c728bae50a44bc7826cf86caf5134a2e0df36765b55517ab4/https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing"&gt;DNS spoofing&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/709c2f284ec511e734f5d8fe6c63d547a4b4819f85c8abc12fe40aee8317c04d/https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_hijacking"&gt;DNS hijacking&lt;/a&gt;. These attacks are used by different viruses and trojans, some unscrupulous providers, governments and security agencies.

DNS attacks redirect legitimate traffic to a fake website, or when proxying traffic in the Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks for different purposes such as 

- stealing passwords
- listening to internet traffic
- providing falsified information
- intercepting online banking transactions
- for censorship.

DNS requests are sent to a randomly selected server from the list prescribed in the options. To detect DNS spoofing, the address is verified through an external DNS server as well.

By default, there are the fastest public servers from Google and Level3 in the list. Additionally, it is recommended to use DNS servers from OpenNIC independent of companies and governments (link in the options). &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/b181d9311e3ecbc139a3922359e33ca2d0eab61cde86465f707614078a5d2979/http%3A//www.opennicproject.org/"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; you can read more about the project.

If spoofing is suspected, the additional DNS requests to 8.8.8.8 and to the website's DNS server (from NS entries) are possible by using the TCP protocol.

From the version 3.0.0, all requests to WIP database will only be sent via https for more protection and security (also against PRISM, xkeyscore, tempora). They will be redirected to the server located on the same continent, where the user is. That is, all European requests are sent to the European server, etc.. Our servers are in the United States, Germany, Chile, Singapore, Japan and Australia.

WorldIP is a WIPmania's product based on WIP-database. Its results are based on data from core routers, so it is more correct than the other databases  based on whois (those databases only provide the geographical location of the network owner but not the geographical location of the network itself).

IPv6 support is incomplete and experimental.
All requests are asynchronous, so WorldIP does not slow down the site loading time.

If you noticed a bug, please report it to mail@wipmania.com or via bug report system &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/402263784b9b2df8a53e0204b83a443c8d51598ec4f48472bb951ef70bb128e8/https%3A//worldip.userecho.com/"&gt;worldip.userecho.com&lt;/a&gt;

If you constantly get the red spoofing-sign, please &lt;b&gt;check whether your external DNS work&lt;/b&gt;. In the menu there is an option "DNS request/ping", enter ping there, it might also be with empty fields (by default, the request is sent to the server 8.8.8.8)</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Alrond</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2013 22:37:44 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/worldip/versions/3.0.8</guid></item><item><title>Ghostery 5.3.2</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/ghostery/</link><description>&lt;b&gt;DETECT&lt;/b&gt;
Ghostery sees the "invisible" web, detecting trackers, web bugs, pixels, and beacons placed on web pages by Facebook, Google Analytics, and over 1,000 other ad networks, behavioral data providers, web publishers - all companies interested in your activity.
 
&lt;b&gt;LEARN&lt;/b&gt;
After showing you who operates behind the scenes, Ghostery also gives you the opportunity to learn more about each company it identifies, including links to their privacy policy and opt-out options.
 
&lt;b&gt;CONTROL&lt;/b&gt; 
Ghostery allows you to block scripts from companies that you don't trust, delete local shared objects, and even block images and iframes. 
 
&lt;b&gt;COLLABORATE&lt;/b&gt;
Ghostery also includes the optional, opt-in feature called Ghostrank, which sends Ghostery servers anonymous information about the trackers you encounter and where you encounter them. This allows us to create a more comprehensive list of detectable items, and helps us create a more transparent behavioral advertising ecosystem.
 
&lt;b&gt;PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY&lt;/b&gt;
Ghostery is built and maintained for users that care about their online privacy, and is engineered with privacy as a primary goal. Ghostery use is anonymous. No registrations or sign-ups are required. The Ghostery plug-in does not place cookies into your browser. Ghostery never receives any data from Ghostery users unless the user opts-in to participate in Ghostrank. Ghostrank data itself is anonymous, is NEVER used for advertising targeting purposes, and is only shared in aggregated, non-personal, statistical form.

This extension even allows you to control selectively for which webpages form history data is stored (either blacklist or whitelist). Also stores text from editor fields as you type for easy recovery in case of disaster.

This extension enables you to selectively delete privacy sensitive information without having to delete the entire history. With the help of powerful regular expressions, information can simply and effectively be retrieved, edited or deleted. Use it to correct misspelled entries, get rid of sensitive data like private banking info or delete  passwords that were entered into the wrong formfield.

This plugin also stores text from editor fields as you type, so you never have to loose your work when disaster strikes. Recover your lost work after session timeouts, network failures, browser crashes, power failures and all other things that will destroy the hard work you just put into writing that important email, essay or blog post. 

Form History Control can filter data either by keyword, active page, active field or cleanup criteria. Powerful advanced search options allows you to find information by name, value, timeframe, usage or host. Optional regular expressions provide a very effective way to retrieve any information you might look for. The advanced search option comes with a list of predefined regular expressions which can be altered or extended to fit any need. 

The extension also offers the possibility to export/import form history data and configuration settings, allowing you to exchange data between multiple browser configurations or import history data into your own application of choice.

Form History Control can also be used to easily autofill textfields in a web form using either the most used or the last used formhistory data.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Stephan Mahieu</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2014 07:35:51 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/form-history-control/versions/1.3.3.0</guid></item><item><title>Password Exporter 1.2.1</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/password-exporter/</link><description>After installation, you can export and import your passwords from the following locations:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Options/Preferences -&amp;gt; Security pane -&amp;gt; Passwords -&amp;gt; Import/Export Passwords button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools -&amp;gt; Add-ons -&amp;gt; Extensions tab -&amp;gt; click Preferences button next to the extension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
NOTICE: An optional obfuscation feature is provided that makes the exported files hard for humans to read, and is mainly to prevent casual users from stumbling upon your passwords. It will in no way stop someone who actually wants to see them, as they could just import your file anyway. Better encryption will be added in the future.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Justin Scott (fligtar)</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2010 01:44:52 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/password-exporter/versions/1.2.1</guid></item><item><title>Groundspeed 1.2</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/groundspeed/</link><description>&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; I presented some of the ideas behind Groundspeed in the OWASP NY/NJ chapter meeting on Nov 2nd. You can find the slides &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/e38e35d892bee48aacf9fa092e6b2beac920c52d6493b979506c01128691062a/http%3A//www.slideshare.net/groundspeed/groundspeed-presentation-at-the-owasp-nynj" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.


&lt;strong&gt;What can I do with Groundspeed?&lt;/strong&gt;

Groundspeed allows you to modify the forms and form elements loaded in the page. Some practical uses include:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Changing the types of form fields, for example you can change hidden fields into text fields so you can easily edit their contents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quickly removing size and length limitations on text fields so you have more space to type your attack strings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Changing form target so the form submits in another tab.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Removing or editing the JavaScript event handlers to bypass client side validation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;How does Groundspeed compare to the other web application security tools?&lt;/strong&gt;

Groundspeed was not created to replace other tools used for webapp security like Firebug or Burp, but it was designed to make the life of penetration testers a little easier.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">fmsnewyork</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jan 2011 12:48:16 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/groundspeed/versions/1.2</guid></item><item><title>HackBar 1.6.2</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/hackbar/</link><description>This toolbar will help you in testing sql injections, XSS holes and site security. It is NOT a tool for executing standard exploits and it will NOT teach you how to hack a site. Its main purpose is to help a developer do security audits on his code. If you know what your doing, this toolbar will help you do it faster. If you want to learn to find security holes, you can also use this toolbar, but you will probably also need a book, a lot of Google and a brain :)

# The advantages are:
 - Even the most complicated urls will be readable
 - The focus will stay on the textarea, so after executing the url (Ctrl+Enter) you can just go on typing / testing
 - The url in textarea is not affected by redirects.
 - I tend to use it as a notepad :)
 - Useful tools like on the fly uu/url decoding etc.
 - All functions work on the currently selected text.
- MD5/SHA1/SHA256 hashing
- MySQL/MS SQL Server/Oracle shortcuts
- XSS useful functions
- And lots more ;) Go test it!

# Shortcuts
- Load url ( Alt + A )
- Split url ( Alt + S )
- Execute ( Alt + X, Ctrl  + Enter )
- INT -1 ( Alt - )

Currently, Mozilla Personal Security Manager (PSM) allows import and export of keys but does not provide GUI for local key generation. Our KeyManager tool extends the Certificate Manager wizard in Mozilla PSM and adds the capability for key generation and SCEP based certificate enrollment.  Our extension enables Mozilla PSM to act as a key management tool. In addition, the tool supports signing of proxy certificates for credential delegation and provides XUL based GUI for signing of XPI files as well as update manifest. 


The KeyManager tool has following features : 
  - Generation of keys and &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/8cfe5aeda2ab6112ba31daa7659f25e7e1022ad3a8fb8a64957979ef01fc6c44/http%3A//www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt" rel="nofollow"&gt;X.509&lt;/a&gt; based self-signed certificate
  - Generation of &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/ac5132a38357325d1a2072d34b29e5e7ae96e47efed5bc7fda9ff190519af8d7/http%3A//tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2986" rel="nofollow"&gt;PKCS#10 based Certificate Signing Requests&lt;/a&gt; (CSR)
  - &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/7e6765741879eb1edb42dd647c73ebc3d3144055188ca3e4211172c1d11df984/http%3A//tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nourse-scep-20" rel="nofollow"&gt;SCEP&lt;/a&gt; based Certificate enrollment - it enables Firefox to acts as SCEP client.

------------ Description --------------------------
The mandatory companion tool for downloading sites with WGET
A very minimum extension : no psychedelic design. Just the needed feature.

Why you need it? Many web sites are protected by either
-&amp;gt; authentication forms
-&amp;gt; Captchas ("Please enter the following code...")
-&amp;gt; vicious access rules like "you must first see some introductory or advertisement pages"
-&amp;gt; JavaScripts ("Please wait XY seconds...")

Such sites can't be downloaded with the well known WGET tool - usually

Export Cookies is the answer to this kind of restrictions.

-------- How it works ------------------
A typical scenario to download a web site with WGET becomes:
* Using Firefox, browse to the desired web site
* Go through all authentication, captcha, ... stuff
* Execute Export Cookies (just a simple item added in Firefox Tools menu) to make cookies.txt file
* Launch wget with
   wget --load-cookies=cookies.txt &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/9958dfea6041b24a2bad8d58590965ad34891ed5/http%3A//foo.com"&gt;http://foo.com&lt;/a&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">fliwatüt</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2010 15:36:39 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/cookie-exporter/versions/1.5</guid></item><item><title>CuteButtons - Crystal SVG 0.3.6</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/cutebuttons-crystal-svg/</link><description>beta versions:

++ Note for 1.5: Security updates where done like and https was added.

Firefox 4 users, please find an updated version here:
&lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/a8d269ece6064e5d12727ad4fa348437623361983c29e323cee3bd98065e931d/http%3A//firefox-showip.googlecode.com/files/showip_1rc3.xpi" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://firefox-showip.googlecode.com/files/showip_1rc3.xpi&lt;/a&gt;

Show the IP address(es) of the current page in the status bar. It also allows querying custom services by IP (right mouse button) and hostname (left mouse button), like whois, netcraft. Additionally you can copy the IP address to the clipboard. This extension was formerly known as ipv6ident.

If only the domain name is shown and not the IP address, check the setting of the network.proxy.socks_remote_dns preference. It has to be turned off for proper operation. Alternatively you can try the version available at &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/76074acddb4c2c5b8a28b26121478c58d1d4f6919c3f1f0a2155c00918f5cb6b/http%3A//firefox-showip.googlecode.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://firefox-showip.googlecode.com&lt;/a&gt; where a switch in the preferences dialog has been added to force ShowIP to do DNS look-ups.

Flash Video Downloader – the addon that will help you download video and audio from practically any website.

Flash Video Downloader helps to find links to videos, pictures, audio and files of other formats (such as .swf or .exe) at the site you are viewing.

When the arrow on the addon button changes its color to blue, it means that the addon has found a downloadable video on the page that you are viewing.

For instance, you will be able to record video from YouTube in several different formats (HD, MP4, Low FLV, etc).

It’s worth pointing out that the addon can also filter out ad clips!

Open "Tools" menu and click the item "Bandwidth Meter". You can perform upload and download bandwidth measurement. It also shows your public IP address and public domain name.

2. Broadband troubleshooting.

When Firefox fails to load a webpage, the extension will automatically check whether Internet connction is working or not. You can perform further diagnostic tests (ping, traceroute) or check the archived version of the failed webpage. Just try to type a non-existent domain name(e.g., qwqwqwq121212.com) to see this in action ...

Note: if you use windows, you may use a more advanced version that can perform windows specific diagnosis.

You can also make a selection and chose "Remove everything else" to clear the page and only leave the selected text.

Once you decide what you want to Remove, Right click on it or select it, then select "Remove this Object" from the menu.

The effect of this extension is temporary, which is useful before printing a page, you can use another extension, 'Remove It Permanently' if you want your removed objects to be remembered.

If you move the mouse over "Remove this object" and wait for a second without clicking, the object that will be removed blinks in red.
If this bothers you and you want to remove it, you can go to about:config search for extensions.nuke_anything_enhanced.autoblink and set the value to empty.
If you want less intrusive blinking you can set it to "3px solid #ccc" or "1px dashed red" without quotes.

Please note that you can undo removing of objects only, undoing the removing of selections is not yet supported.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Patrick Abi Salloum</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2009 11:48:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/nuke-anything-enhanced/versions/1.0.2</guid></item></channel></rss>
