Dear WorldIP User,You can support the Further Development of Add-on!Here acceptedBitcoin 13Uq5xvHYLAtpBA4yS27YHKJ61pz4TZqsDLitecoin LTiNLPkwZZDtQHbQpsjawT5eBPH1jXrgAZDogecoin D8Y5PcDfBh9nEn86KAboWoq2bVsjkgxLfhThanks to You, WorldIP will live!FF29 does not have add-on bar anymore, therefore if you want to see all infos bottom, you have to install "The Addon Bar" (for Firefox29) additionally for some useful add-onshttps://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/the-addon-bar/Please report the bugs you found here worldip.userecho.comWorldIP provides the following information:- all IP addresses of the server (IPv4 and IPv6), Reverse DNS, web-server- all DNS entries for domains (A,AAAA,MX,NS,SPF,TXT,SOA,CNAME,PTR), their Time to Live (TTL)- real country, flag- data center, provider, autonomous system (AS)- your external IP address, ISP and change log (by time or when changing proxy)- ping and traceroute from all continents (around 40 servers worldwide). Advanced traceroutes with three protocols simultaneously (TCP/UDP/ICMP)- ping and traceroute from your computer- links to Looking Glasses of 43 global providers (by provider name or by country/city). Not every global provider has an open LG- whois, BGP connections on bgp.he.net- DNS ping and custom request to any server- verification of compliance of the website with the IP address, protection against DNS spoofing / DNS hijacking. These attacks are used by different viruses and trojans, some unscrupulous providers, governments and security agencies.DNS attacks redirect legitimate traffic to a fake website, or when proxying traffic in the Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks for different purposes such as - stealing passwords- listening to internet traffic- providing falsified information- intercepting online banking transactions- for censorship.DNS requests are sent to a randomly selected server from the list prescribed in the options. To detect DNS spoofing, the address is verified through an external DNS server as well.By default, there are the fastest public servers from Google and Level3 in the list. Additionally, it is recommended to use DNS servers from OpenNIC independent of companies and governments (link in the options). Here you can read more about the project.If spoofing is suspected, the additional DNS requests to 8.8.8.8 and to the website's DNS server (from NS entries) are possible by using the TCP protocol.From the version 3.0.0, all requests to WIP database will only be sent via https for more protection and security (also against PRISM, xkeyscore, tempora). They will be redirected to the server located on the same continent, where the user is. That is, all European requests are sent to the European server, etc.. Our servers are in the United States, Germany, Chile, Singapore, Japan and Australia.WorldIP is a WIPmania's product based on WIP-database. Its results are based on data from core routers, so it is more correct than the other databases based on whois (those databases only provide the geographical location of the network owner but not the geographical location of the network itself).IPv6 support is incomplete and experimental.All requests are asynchronous, so WorldIP does not slow down the site loading time.If you noticed a bug, please report it to mail@wipmania.com or via bug report system worldip.userecho.comIf you constantly get the red spoofing-sign, please check whether your external DNS work. In the menu there is an option "DNS request/ping", enter ping there, it might also be with empty fields (by default, the request is sent to the server 8.8.8.8)

Privaatheidbeleid
WorldIP add-on is created to protect the user. We respect your privacy! and do not sell or pass your personal information to third parties.1) CookiesWorldIP add-on does not send any cookies to any web server.2) Geolocation and Datacenter DatabasesTo display up-to-date information about physical location of a web server and data center, the WorldIP add-on uses API, it sends the requested IP addresses to api.wipmania.com. The format of API-request is IP-addr?hostname. To prevent the use of API from the name of add-on, we check that IP and hostname accord with each other.Any other information about the site or user will not be sent to WIPmania, except for its domain name, that says about its IP address. IP addresses will be also used to correct the database. WIPmania do not collect any personal information about visitors.Requests to the remote database may be also disabled by turn off the checkboxes "Get geolocation and data center information" and "Enable showing my external IP" in the main options. However, you can get the information for current IP by click in menu.From the version 3.0.0, all requests to API will only be sent via HTTPS for more protection and security. In rare cases, if the SSL-connection breaks up, repeated request to API is via HTTP. Enabled by default.3) External DNSDNS requests are sent to a randomly selected server from the list prescribed in the options. To detect DNS spoofing, the address is verified through an external DNS server as well.By default, there are the fastest public servers from Google and Level3 in the list. Additionally, it is recommended to use DNS servers from OpenNIC independent of companies and governments. http://www.opennicproject.org/If spoofing is suspected, then the additional DNS requests to 8.8.8.8 and to the website's DNS server (from NS entries) are possible by using the TCP protocol. The request to API will be sent for the confirmation as well. Protection against DNS spoofing and receiving DNS entries are enabled by default, but they can be disabled in the options. All requests are sent unencrypted because of the nature of the DNS protocol.4) Socks proxyIf your option "socks_remote_dns" is enabled, all requests to GeoAPI and to the internal and external DNS servers are disabled.Protection against spoofing will be disconnected as well. The only enabled options are receiving your own information and reverse DNS.This is done for your security to prevent leakage of your browsing via DNS requests.It is also possible to enable a local resolver in the options, but in this case all DNS requests will be unencrypted.To get the geo-information is also possible manually using the corresponding option in the menu. This occurs over a secure SSL connection. But the DNS servers stay still disabled. Accuracy of IP address obtained in this way cannot be guaranteed due to the settings of DNS-resolver of your proxy. The HTTPS method is not always correct because of the geolocation character of some DNS entries.5) WIP-RankWIP-Rank is a rating of hosting companies/datacenters.It is based on data such as network infrastructure, availability, attendance, and on many other factors, that allow the most objective assessment of hosting companies and their servers.Partially, the rating is created on the basis of the site visits, located on company servers.If you would like to participate in the formation of the rating, just enable the "WIP-Rank".We don't collect any personal information! But only calculate non-personalized the websites visits. By default disabled.
