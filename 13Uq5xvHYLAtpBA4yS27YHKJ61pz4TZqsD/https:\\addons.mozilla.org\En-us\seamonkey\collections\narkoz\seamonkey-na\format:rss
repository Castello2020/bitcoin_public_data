&lt;b&gt;Thanks to You, WorldIP will live!&lt;/b&gt;

FF29 does not have add-on bar anymore, therefore if you want to see all infos bottom, you have to install "The Addon Bar" (for Firefox29) additionally for some useful add-ons
&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/the-addon-bar/"&gt;https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/the-addon-bar/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Please report the bugs you found here &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/402263784b9b2df8a53e0204b83a443c8d51598ec4f48472bb951ef70bb128e8/https%3A//worldip.userecho.com/"&gt;worldip.userecho.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

WorldIP provides the following information:

- all IP addresses of the server (IPv4 and IPv6), Reverse DNS, web-server
- all DNS entries for domains (A,AAAA,MX,NS,SPF,TXT,SOA,CNAME,PTR), their Time to Live (TTL)
- real country, flag
- data center, provider, autonomous system (AS)
- your external IP address, ISP and change log (by time or when changing proxy)

- ping and traceroute from all continents (around 40 servers worldwide). Advanced traceroutes with three protocols simultaneously (TCP/UDP/ICMP)
- ping and traceroute from your computer
- links to Looking Glasses of 43 global providers (by provider name or by country/city). Not every global provider has an open LG
- whois, BGP connections on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/b10f9e4a77ca8fb915276d1ab7cd44daf5e43c8d72185a70e7c615d26c38148e/http%3A//bgp.he.net"&gt;bgp.he.net&lt;/a&gt;
- DNS ping and custom request to any server

- verification of compliance of the website with the IP address, protection against &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/55917361d102073c728bae50a44bc7826cf86caf5134a2e0df36765b55517ab4/https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing"&gt;DNS spoofing&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/709c2f284ec511e734f5d8fe6c63d547a4b4819f85c8abc12fe40aee8317c04d/https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_hijacking"&gt;DNS hijacking&lt;/a&gt;. These attacks are used by different viruses and trojans, some unscrupulous providers, governments and security agencies.

DNS attacks redirect legitimate traffic to a fake website, or when proxying traffic in the Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks for different purposes such as 

- stealing passwords
- listening to internet traffic
- providing falsified information
- intercepting online banking transactions
- for censorship.

DNS requests are sent to a randomly selected server from the list prescribed in the options. To detect DNS spoofing, the address is verified through an external DNS server as well.

By default, there are the fastest public servers from Google and Level3 in the list. Additionally, it is recommended to use DNS servers from OpenNIC independent of companies and governments (link in the options). &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/b181d9311e3ecbc139a3922359e33ca2d0eab61cde86465f707614078a5d2979/http%3A//www.opennicproject.org/"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; you can read more about the project.

If spoofing is suspected, the additional DNS requests to 8.8.8.8 and to the website's DNS server (from NS entries) are possible by using the TCP protocol.

From the version 3.0.0, all requests to WIP database will only be sent via https for more protection and security (also against PRISM, xkeyscore, tempora). They will be redirected to the server located on the same continent, where the user is. That is, all European requests are sent to the European server, etc.. Our servers are in the United States, Germany, Chile, Singapore, Japan and Australia.

WorldIP is a WIPmania's product based on WIP-database. Its results are based on data from core routers, so it is more correct than the other databases  based on whois (those databases only provide the geographical location of the network owner but not the geographical location of the network itself).

IPv6 support is incomplete and experimental.
All requests are asynchronous, so WorldIP does not slow down the site loading time.

If you noticed a bug, please report it to mail@wipmania.com or via bug report system &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/402263784b9b2df8a53e0204b83a443c8d51598ec4f48472bb951ef70bb128e8/https%3A//worldip.userecho.com/"&gt;worldip.userecho.com&lt;/a&gt;

If you constantly get the red spoofing-sign, please &lt;b&gt;check whether your external DNS work&lt;/b&gt;. In the menu there is an option "DNS request/ping", enter ping there, it might also be with empty fields (by default, the request is sent to the server 8.8.8.8)</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Alrond</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2013 22:37:44 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/worldip/versions/3.0.8</guid></item><item><title>Web Developer 1.2.5</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/web-developer/</link><description>The Web Developer extension adds various web developer tools to the browser.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">chrispederick</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2013 06:59:38 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/web-developer/versions/1.2.5</guid></item><item><title>PrefBar 6.4.0</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/prefbar/</link><description>PrefBar started as a simple toolbar to get easy access to common preferences like Javascript, Flash, the proxy used for web access, ... Over the time, PrefBar got further developed to be a container for nearly anything, that can be placed on a button, checkbox or menulist.

All items may be placed and grouped freely on PrefBar's bar. The bar itself may be moved using the browser built-in "toolbar customize" feature to anywhere you like (even in foreign toolbars, next to the menubar, ...).

A full list of built-in buttons is available here: &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/d6bed313e85eb288b5591655f5c8f183ebd027f16a6446f13e3a9a2dc7041bdb/http%3A//prefbar.tuxfamily.org/help/buttons.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://prefbar.tuxfamily.org/help/buttons.html&lt;/a&gt;

This extension even allows you to control selectively for which webpages form history data is stored (either blacklist or whitelist). Also stores text from editor fields as you type for easy recovery in case of disaster.

This extension enables you to selectively delete privacy sensitive information without having to delete the entire history. With the help of powerful regular expressions, information can simply and effectively be retrieved, edited or deleted. Use it to correct misspelled entries, get rid of sensitive data like private banking info or delete  passwords that were entered into the wrong formfield.

This plugin also stores text from editor fields as you type, so you never have to loose your work when disaster strikes. Recover your lost work after session timeouts, network failures, browser crashes, power failures and all other things that will destroy the hard work you just put into writing that important email, essay or blog post. 

Form History Control can filter data either by keyword, active page, active field or cleanup criteria. Powerful advanced search options allows you to find information by name, value, timeframe, usage or host. Optional regular expressions provide a very effective way to retrieve any information you might look for. The advanced search option comes with a list of predefined regular expressions which can be altered or extended to fit any need. 

The extension also offers the possibility to export/import form history data and configuration settings, allowing you to exchange data between multiple browser configurations or import history data into your own application of choice.

Form History Control can also be used to easily autofill textfields in a web form using either the most used or the last used formhistory data.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Stephan Mahieu</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2014 07:35:51 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/form-history-control/versions/1.3.3.0</guid></item><item><title>Flagfox 5.0.5</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/flagfox/</link><description>Flagfox is an extension that displays a flag icon indicating the current webserver's physical location. Knowing where you're connected to adds an extra layer of awareness to your browsing and can be useful to indicate the native languages and legal jurisdictions that may apply. Additional information can be obtained via a multitude of external lookups and users can add their own custom actions. All actions can be added to the flag icon's context menu and set to icon click or keyboard shortcuts for quick access.

Clicking the flag icon loads our default action, &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/58915c9e1ba87a23947cafa56b5ccae26a44a1225c93d71037ff3fc5704f7791/http%3A//geoip.flagfox.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Geotool&lt;/a&gt;, which gives a detailed map showing the city the server is in and other useful information such as its local time and &lt;abbr title="Internet Service Provider"&gt;ISP&lt;/abbr&gt;. Many other actions are available for a wide range of uses such as:

  • Site safety and malware checks
  • Finding similar sites and reviews
  • Automatic translation to your language
  • &lt;abbr title="Search Engine Optimization"&gt;SEO&lt;/abbr&gt; and web development research
  • Diagnostics like pings and traceroutes
  • Whois and &lt;abbr title="Domain Name Service"&gt;DNS&lt;/abbr&gt; information
  • Page code validation
  • Quick URL shortening
  • Copying a server's &lt;abbr title="Internet Protocol"&gt;IP&lt;/abbr&gt; address or other info
  • or you can create your own custom actions!

Flagfox is simple, unobtrusive, and uses relatively little resources. In order to protect your privacy, country lookups are done locally rather than asking an external server about every page you browse to. It works by accessing an internal IP address location database, basically a rough map of the physical layout of the Internet, based on data provided by &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/72ad5f0e70c9e5559f036c696af8dd762d3572b0c9b327c4fc9993a5462ed7a2/http%3A//maxmind.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Maxmind&lt;/a&gt;. This gives a flag for the nationality of the actual location of the server you're connected to, rather than just the nationality of the domain name which may be different. Flagfox updates are provided on a monthly basis to keep this internal database accurate.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dave G</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2014 19:55:04 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/flagfox/versions/5.0.5</guid></item><item><title>Stylish 1.4.3</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/stylish/</link><description>User styles are themes for web sites. User styles empower your browsing experience by letting you customize web sites. Take out irrelevant content, change colors, or completely redesign the entire site. You can even use user styles as themes on the interface of Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey themselves.

Stylish lets you easily manage user styles. Add, delete, enable, disable, and organize with a few clicks of a mouse, no code to edit, no obscure configuration to find. Stylish's companion website, &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/76374e85d2e814e19408c9d3b3617798bf666a44/http%3A//userstyles.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;userstyles.org&lt;/a&gt;, hosts tens of thousands of user styles made by other Stylish users that you can try.

For you technical types out there, think of it this way: Stylish and &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/76374e85d2e814e19408c9d3b3617798bf666a44/http%3A//userstyles.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;userstyles.org&lt;/a&gt; are to CSS as Greasemonkey and &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/15b9fa0fe1920f09bd1c69eea79f7043cbb8dcb6/http%3A//userscripts.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;userscripts.org&lt;/a&gt; are to JavaScript.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jason Barnabe</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 16:05:46 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/stylish/versions/1.4.3</guid></item><item><title>NoScript Security Suite 2.6.8.33</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/seamonkey/addon/noscript/</link><description>Winner of the "PC World World Class Award", this tool gives you with the best available protection on the web. 
It allows JavaScript, Java and other executable content to run only from trusted domains of your choice, e.g. your home-banking web site, guarding your "trust boundaries" against cross-site scripting attacks (XSS), cross-zone DNS rebinding / CSRF attacks (router hacking), and Clickjacking attempts, thanks to its unique ClearClick technology. It also implements the DoNotTrack tracking opt-out proposal by default, see &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/bd4266094d321e473190ea27c5ce1eeb6f3ae9aaa99ce33f14cdf3ec1d7dd070/http%3A//snipurl.com/nsdntrack" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://snipurl.com/nsdntrack&lt;/a&gt; .
Such a preemptive approach  prevents exploitation of security vulnerabilities (known and even unknown!) with no loss of functionality... 
Experts do agree: Firefox is really safer with NoScript ;-)
