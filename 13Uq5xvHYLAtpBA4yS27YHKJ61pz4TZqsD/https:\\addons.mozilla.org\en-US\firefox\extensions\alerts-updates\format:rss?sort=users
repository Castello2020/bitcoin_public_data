Knowing where you're connected to adds an extra layer of awareness to your browsing and can be useful to indicate the native languages and legal jurisdictions that may apply. Additional information can be obtained via a multitude of external lookups and users can add their own custom actions. All actions can be added to the flag icon's context menu and set to icon click or keyboard shortcuts for quick access.

Clicking the flag icon loads our default action, &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/58915c9e1ba87a23947cafa56b5ccae26a44a1225c93d71037ff3fc5704f7791/http%3A//geoip.flagfox.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Geotool&lt;/a&gt;, which gives a detailed map showing the city the server is in and other useful information such as its local time and &lt;abbr title="Internet Service Provider"&gt;ISP&lt;/abbr&gt;. Many other actions are available for a wide range of uses such as:

  • Site safety and malware checks
  • Finding similar sites and reviews
  • Automatic translation to your language
  • &lt;abbr title="Search Engine Optimization"&gt;SEO&lt;/abbr&gt; and web development research
  • Diagnostics like pings and traceroutes
  • Whois and &lt;abbr title="Domain Name Service"&gt;DNS&lt;/abbr&gt; information
  • Page code validation
  • Quick URL shortening
  • Copying a server's &lt;abbr title="Internet Protocol"&gt;IP&lt;/abbr&gt; address or other info
  • or you can create your own custom actions!

Flagfox is simple, unobtrusive, and uses relatively little resources. In order to protect your privacy, country lookups are done locally rather than asking an external server about every page you browse to. It works by accessing an internal IP address location database, basically a rough map of the physical layout of the Internet, based on data provided by &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/72ad5f0e70c9e5559f036c696af8dd762d3572b0c9b327c4fc9993a5462ed7a2/http%3A//maxmind.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Maxmind&lt;/a&gt;. This gives a flag for the nationality of the actual location of the server you're connected to, rather than just the nationality of the domain name which may be different. Flagfox updates are provided on a monthly basis to keep this internal database accurate.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dave G</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2014 19:55:04 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flagfox/versions/5.0.5</guid></item><item><title>MinimizeToTray revived 1.1.2</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/minimizetotray-revived/</link><description>MinTrayR lets the user minimize Mozilla powered applications such as Firefox, Thunderbird or Songbird to the system tray.

Display all Google services as buttons or as a space-saving dropdown menu next to your address bar or anywhere you like it. Reach services like Gmail, Google reader, Google maps, Google calendar, and many more in a single click from your browser.

By adjusting the settings you decide which services should be available for you as buttons.
Left click on a button opens the service in the current tab, MIDDLE CLICK opens a new tab. Left click + Ctrl + Alt opens the service in a sidebar (nice for Google Contacts).
You can also change the main appearance from a toolbar with all buttons you've selected to a single space-saving dropdown menu.

If you don't see any buttons:
Add the buttons on menu, view, toolbars, customize! Or install version &amp;gt;1.7.2 which adds Google Shortcuts automatically.

WorldIP provides the following information:

- all IP addresses of the server (IPv4 and IPv6), Reverse DNS, web-server
- all DNS entries for domains (A,AAAA,MX,NS,SPF,TXT,SOA,CNAME,PTR), their Time to Live (TTL)
- real country, flag
- data center, provider, autonomous system (AS)
- your external IP address, ISP and change log (by time or when changing proxy)

- ping and traceroute from all continents (around 40 servers worldwide). Advanced traceroutes with three protocols simultaneously (TCP/UDP/ICMP)
- ping and traceroute from your computer
- links to Looking Glasses of 43 global providers (by provider name or by country/city). Not every global provider has an open LG
- whois, BGP connections on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/b10f9e4a77ca8fb915276d1ab7cd44daf5e43c8d72185a70e7c615d26c38148e/http%3A//bgp.he.net"&gt;bgp.he.net&lt;/a&gt;

These attacks are used by different viruses and trojans, some unscrupulous providers, governments and security agencies.

DNS attacks redirect legitimate traffic to a fake website, or when proxying traffic in the Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks for different purposes such as 

- stealing passwords
- listening to internet traffic
- providing falsified information
- intercepting online banking transactions
- for censorship.

DNS requests are sent to a randomly selected server from the list prescribed in the options. To detect DNS spoofing, the address is verified through an external DNS server as well.

By default, there are the fastest public servers from Google and Level3 in the list. Additionally, it is recommended to use DNS servers from OpenNIC independent of companies and governments (link in the options). &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/b181d9311e3ecbc139a3922359e33ca2d0eab61cde86465f707614078a5d2979/http%3A//www.opennicproject.org/"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; you can read more about the project.

If spoofing is suspected, the additional DNS requests to 8.8.8.8 and to the website's DNS server (from NS entries) are possible by using the TCP protocol.

From the version 3.0.0, all requests to WIP database will only be sent via https for more protection and security (also against PRISM, xkeyscore, tempora). They will be redirected to the server located on the same continent, where the user is. That is, all European requests are sent to the European server, etc.. Our servers are in the United States, Germany, Chile, Singapore, Japan and Australia.

WorldIP is a WIPmania's product based on WIP-database. Its results are based on data from core routers, so it is more correct than the other databases  based on whois (those databases only provide the geographical location of the network owner but not the geographical location of the network itself).

IPv6 support is incomplete and experimental.
All requests are asynchronous, so WorldIP does not slow down the site loading time.

If you noticed a bug, please report it to mail@wipmania.com or via bug report system &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/402263784b9b2df8a53e0204b83a443c8d51598ec4f48472bb951ef70bb128e8/https%3A//worldip.userecho.com/"&gt;worldip.userecho.com&lt;/a&gt;

If you constantly get the red spoofing-sign, please &lt;b&gt;check whether your external DNS work&lt;/b&gt;. In the menu there is an option "DNS request/ping", enter ping there, it might also be with empty fields (by default, the request is sent to the server 8.8.8.8)</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Alrond</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2013 22:37:44 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/worldip/versions/3.0.8</guid></item><item><title>Gmail Twitter &amp; Facebook Signature - WiseStamp 3.13.31</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wisestamp-email-signature-gmai/</link><description>&lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/43ee6ab6da28bc880ebb270938f23276c354b5effcaffb15101c2e59bdb13d2a/http%3A//www.wisestamp.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;WiseStamp Email Apps&lt;/a&gt;- Bring your emails to life in Gmail, Google Apps, Outlook .com Hotmail, AOL, Thunderbird....etc .

WindowShopper will present products from more than 50,000 stores including Amazon, eBay, Best Buy, Newegg, Macys, Nordstorm, Overstock, Staples, Target, and Wal-mart. Our index covers over 200 million products in practically every product category. If we find a deal, we'll show it.

"Window Shopper's still in beta--and it's free--so these are a minor complaints, really. It's worth checking out if you do a lot of online shopping." &lt;strong&gt;CNET&lt;/strong&gt;, Jasmine France, November 2010

"Since its launch last spring, Window Shopper has grown to over 1 million active users and continues to expand across all sectors as it competes with other similar visual shopping sites like Spezify and Google..." &lt;strong&gt;NY Times&lt;/strong&gt;, Riley Mcdermid, November 2010

"This holiday season some predict that more consumers will use visual search rather than traditional text searches to find products. Why? The old saying 'a picture is worth 1,000 words' may be part of it, but really visual search can give consumers a better idea of the product, business or brand they are researching.", &lt;strong&gt;BizReport&lt;/strong&gt;, Kristina Knight, December 2010

"What's more, Superfish see themselves as a platform rather than a destination search engine. In fact there is no destination site – just a browser plugin.

Webmasters and app developers can build Superfish into their own site and even earn revenue for doing so. Such technology could be a boon for the latest breed of image led social networks looking to monetize with search ads." &lt;strong&gt;Search Engine Watch&lt;/strong&gt;, Jonathan Allen, July 11, 2012
