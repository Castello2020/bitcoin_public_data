Personas Plus extends that built-in functionality to give you even greater control and easier access to new, popular, and even your own favorite Personas.

Installing the add-on places a small "fox mask" icon in your status bar or add-on bar which, when you click on it, pops up a menu where you can select, change, or even randomize your Firefox Persona.

If you create an account on the &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/4ea3be30b1f3003c2592801e96d9e378a18b10069f02c17d63b2bcdc8a6a21f8/http%3A//www.getpersonas.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;GetPersonas website&lt;/a&gt;, you can "star" your favorite Personas there, which will then appear in your Personas Plus menu!

Even more fun is the ability for Personas Plus to automatically rotate your Personas.  If you select, for example, "Random Selection from Abstract" on the "Abstract" Personas menu, Personas Plus will randomly select a new Persona from that list every 60 minutes or so, and each time you open your browser.  This works with any selection of Personas, including your favorites!</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Mozilla</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 24 Oct 2013 16:09:27 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/personas-plus/versions/1.7.3</guid></item><item><title>TidyRead 0.4.0</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tidyread/</link><description>TidyRead is a service that extracts the text from almost any web site and displays it on an easy to read page that removes all of the clutter that can make reading on the internet so hard sometimes. While reading is one of the main activities on the internet, a lot of sites pay very little attention to the readability of their text and the display on smart phones, such as iPhone, iPod Touch and Android phones. Instead, the reader's eye is constantly drawn to other UI elements, ads, and widgets. This problem is even worse when surfing on smart phones. TidyRead is setting to change this and makes online reading and surfing on smart phones enjoyable.

TidyRead provides a browser add-on which strips away all the extra stuff from news or blog article pages, leaving you with some nicely formatted text to read. The extracted article is overlayed with the original page and it is easy to switch back and forth to TidyRead layer or the original content layer.

In the TidyRead mode, you can customize the styles, font size and margin site by site and those customization info are saved on the cookies.

TidyRead can work in Smart Mode that means it automatically extracts and displays the article if TidyRead believe it is an article page with confidence. So you don't need to manually click a button or link to activate the TidyRead.

Furthermore you can customize TidyRead with disallow and allow list.

TidyRead supports Right to Left (RTL) languages and displays well.

TidyRead does it best to keep the original article layout, and intelligently extracts the content images, videos and other objects.

All the image and script files are inside the add-on package and it doesn't send out any information to other outside servers.

Starting from version 0.3.0, TidyRead works with NoScript. Now NoScript users can run TidyRead.

Starting from version 03.5, TidyRead automates the "next page". When scrolling near the end of the page, TidyRead detects and renders the next page, so you need not to click the next page anymore.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Matthew Chen</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jun 2009 05:38:28 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tidyread/versions/0.4.0</guid></item><item><title>WorldIP - Geo Add-on with Security Features 3.0.8</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/worldip/</link><description>&lt;b&gt;Dear WorldIP User,

FF29 does not have add-on bar anymore, therefore if you want to see all infos bottom, you have to install "The Addon Bar" (for Firefox29) additionally for some useful add-ons
&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/the-addon-bar/"&gt;https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/the-addon-bar/&lt;/a&gt;

WorldIP provides the following information:

- all DNS entries for domains (A,AAAA,MX,NS,SPF,TXT,SOA,CNAME,PTR), their Time to Live (TTL)
- real country, flag
- data center, provider, autonomous system (AS)
- your external IP address, ISP and change log (by time or when changing proxy)

- ping and traceroute from all continents (around 40 servers worldwide). Advanced traceroutes with three protocols simultaneously (TCP/UDP/ICMP)
- ping and traceroute from your computer
- links to Looking Glasses of 43 global providers (by provider name or by country/city). Not every global provider has an open LG

These attacks are used by different viruses and trojans, some unscrupulous providers, governments and security agencies.

DNS attacks redirect legitimate traffic to a fake website, or when proxying traffic in the Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks for different purposes such as 

- stealing passwords
- listening to internet traffic
- providing falsified information
- intercepting online banking transactions
- for censorship.

DNS requests are sent to a randomly selected server from the list prescribed in the options. To detect DNS spoofing, the address is verified through an external DNS server as well.

By default, there are the fastest public servers from Google and Level3 in the list. Additionally, it is recommended to use DNS servers from OpenNIC independent of companies and governments (link in the options). &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/b181d9311e3ecbc139a3922359e33ca2d0eab61cde86465f707614078a5d2979/http%3A//www.opennicproject.org/"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; you can read more about the project.

If spoofing is suspected, the additional DNS requests to 8.8.8.8 and to the website's DNS server (from NS entries) are possible by using the TCP protocol.

From the version 3.0.0, all requests to WIP database will only be sent via https for more protection and security (also against PRISM, xkeyscore, tempora). They will be redirected to the server located on the same continent, where the user is. That is, all European requests are sent to the European server, etc.. Our servers are in the United States, Germany, Chile, Singapore, Japan and Australia.

WorldIP is a WIPmania's product based on WIP-database. Its results are based on data from core routers, so it is more correct than the other databases  based on whois (those databases only provide the geographical location of the network owner but not the geographical location of the network itself).

IPv6 support is incomplete and experimental.
All requests are asynchronous, so WorldIP does not slow down the site loading time.

If you noticed a bug, please report it to mail@wipmania.com or via bug report system &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/402263784b9b2df8a53e0204b83a443c8d51598ec4f48472bb951ef70bb128e8/https%3A//worldip.userecho.com/"&gt;worldip.userecho.com&lt;/a&gt;

If you constantly get the red spoofing-sign, please &lt;b&gt;check whether your external DNS work&lt;/b&gt;. In the menu there is an option "DNS request/ping", enter ping there, it might also be with empty fields (by default, the request is sent to the server 8.8.8.8)</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Alrond</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2013 22:37:44 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/worldip/versions/3.0.8</guid></item><item><title>Xmarks Sync 4.3.2</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/xmarks-sync/</link><description>Xmarks lives and has been acquired by &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/1009538ed26d367e389256ef2891c8433d6f5fc2/http%3A//lastpass.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt;!
