				<h2 id="earn-bitcoins-by-accepting-them">1. Earn Bitcoins by accepting them as a means of payment &#127980;</h2>
				<p>	In my opinion, the best and easiest way to earn Bitcoins is to accept them as a means of payment. If you have a small business,
					the integration is done quickly and easily. No matter if you have a 
				<strong>brick and mortar shop</strong> or an <strong>online business</strong>, no matter if you sell goods or services.
					You just have to complete the following three steps:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Get a free <strong>online Bitcoin wallet</strong> from <a href="http://blockchain.info/" target="_blank">Blockchain.info</a>. If you're not sure what a Bitcoin wallet is,
							check out my <a href="what-is-bitcoin.html">What is Bitcoin</a> section. There are also many other providers apart from Blockchain.info.
							Find out which works best for you. And remember, no wallet is absolutely safe, so be careful with your money.
							</li><br>
								<img alt="bitcoin wallet image" src="images/bitcoin-wallet.png"
									title="A visualizied Bitcoin wallet" width="107" height="84">

						<li>Display a <strong>QR-code with your Bitcoin address</strong> next to your cash register. There are two options here.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>When you have your Blockchain.info account go to 'Receive Money'. 
								Under the 'Actions' drop-down 
								menu select 'QR-code'.
									Print out the image with the QR-code and place it next to your cash register. Your customers will typically have a
									Bitcoin app installed on their smartphone where they can enter the value of the purchase in USD or EUR. 
								Their app calculates the corresponding
									Bitcoin value. It automatically takes the current exchange rate to get the right amount. On your Blockchain.info account you can
									check the confirmation of your incoming payment.</li>
								<li>The other option you have is again on your Blockchain.info account. Go to 'Receive Money' and then under the 'Actions' drop-down this time
									select 'Create Payment Request'. Now you enter the Bitcoin amount the customer has to pay and it will show the
									corresponding QR-code. This way the customer 
									doesn't need to enter an amount. For this method you
									need to calculate the Bitcoin amount from your USD or EUR price before you can enter it for the QR-code to generate.</li><br>
								<img alt="sample bitcoin address qr-code" src="images/earn-bitcoins-donations-qr-code.png"
									title="This is a sample QR-code (create your own!)" width="100" height="100">
									
							</ul>
						<li>Display the <strong>'<em>Bitcoin accepted here</em>' logo</strong>
							at the entrance to your shop to show everybody your innovative payment integration. You will find a printable version of the logo plus a <strong>free guide</strong>
							under <a href="downloads.html">Downloads</a>.</li><br>

				<h2 id="earn-free-bitcoins">2. Earn free Bitcoins by completing tasks on websites &#10004;</h2>
				<p>There are many websites which offer you to earn free Bitcoins. With most of these sites, the concept is
					that you visit the site and just for looking at it you get a small amount of Bitcoins. The concept has something in common with watching good old free TV.
					You watch a lot of ads and inbetween you get something you actually want to see, like a film or music clips.</p>
				<p>While this is a legitimate concept, the <strong>return on your invested time is very little</strong>. So when you earn Bitcoins from these advertising sites, the Bitcoins
					actually come at the cost of your time. As the saying goes 'there is no free lunch'. But see for yourself, here is a list of some of the sites that I find interesting</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.bitvisitor.com/" target="_blank">BitVisitor</a> :: Earn Bitcoins for <strong>watching websites or videos</strong>.
						Every page is shown for five minutes.
						Then you can click 'Next' for confirmation and move on to the next page. What I like about this site is that payouts come within roughly an hour.
						This is a major advantage compared to other sites that pay Bitcoins for completing tasks. Also, you don't need an user account here, you just enter
						your Bitcoin address. The amount of Bitcoins you can earn here is limited though. Per five minutes you get something like &micro;BTC 100
						(that's 100 microcoins or BTC 0.00001)
						which means that your hourly payout is something like BTC 0.00012. That's not too much money but it is a start to make you first Satoshis and get familiar with Bitcoin.
						And note, payout per five minute period varies. So the above calculation only holds if the <em>average</em> payout per five minutes is &micro;BTC 100.
					</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.freedigitalmoney.com/en/Home" target="_blank">freedigitalmoney.com</a> :: Earn Bitcoins by <strong>getting rewards fo
						purchases made in Bitcoin</strong>.
						On this site you also don't need a user account and just have to enter your Bitcoin address to earn Bitcoins.
					</li>
					<li><a href="http://coinworker.com/" target="_blank">CoinWorker</a> :: Earn Bitcoins by <strong>completing analytical tasks</strong>.
						A user account is required here. I haven't tried this service but payouts seem to be a bit higher than with the aforementioned sites.
					</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.bitcoinplus.com/" target="_blank">BitcoinPlus</a> ::
						Earn Bitcoins for <strong>providing computing power to a mining pool</strong>. The good thing about this site is that you do
						not actually have to spend time on it because your computer works in the background while you can do other things.
						However, when you check the task manager of your computer you see that CPU usage skyrockets.
						That means your machine consumes more electricity. And since the payouts per hour on BitcoinPlus are really small, you need to do a proper calculation that takes
						the power consumption of your hardware, your electricity costs and the current Bitcoin value into account. If this turns out profitable for you,
						BitcoinPlus is a fine thing.</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.rugatu.com/" target="_blank">Rugatu</a> :: Earn Bitcoins by <strong>answering forum questions</strong>.
						This is a nice service because it brings people together who are interested in Bitcoin and many other things and allows to pay rewards for answering questions.
						This is something that would not have been possible 
					without a currency like Bitcoin that has low transaction 
					fees and instant transfers 
					</li>
					<li><a href="http://faucetbtc.com/" target="_blank">FaucetBTC</a> :: Earn Bitcoins just by <strong>visiting this site</strong> (and looking at the ads).
						There is a large number of other sites like this and I picked this particular one quite randomly. All you do here is go to that site, enter your Bitcoin address
						and fill out the CAPTCHA. You can repeat this as often as you like but only once 
					every 30 minutes. For each visit you get BTC 0.0000025 (as of August 2013; this is likely
						to change when the Bitcoin exchange rate goes up). After your visit, your reward is sent to <a href="http://coinbox.me/" target="_blank">CoinBox.me</a>. This happens to
						collect many small payments and to combine them for one bigger payout. When you visit many sites in parallel, this could be a way to keep you busy throughout the day
						and make some change.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Earning Bitcoins from completing tasks on websites is a viable option to actually earn <em>some</em> Bitcoins, but don't expect your income to be very large.
				I regard it as a first step to get familiar with Bitcoin in general. Also, it is interesting to see what kind of services are enabled through frictionless money transfers.
				</p>

				<h2 id="earn-bitcoins-from-interest">3. Earn Bitcoins from interest payments %</h2>
				<p>If you already have some Bitcoins, <strong>put your Bitcoins to work for you</strong>. Earn 
				Bitcoins through interest payments by lending them out.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Lend directly</strong> to someone you know. This allows you to assess personally, whether you regard the borrower as 
					trustworthy. Then the two of you
					only need to agree on the terms like duration and interest rate and off you go. The drawback is, however, that you probably will not have too many acquaintances who
					match your amount, duration and interest rate requirements. But it's a nice way to earn Bitcoins.</li>
					<li><strong>Peer to peer Bitcoin lending</strong> websites with listings from various borrowers are another option. <a href="https://www.bitbond.net/" target="_blank">Bitbond</a>
					is such a peer-to-peer lending site. Borrowers publish funding requests
					and you can contribute to their loan. You can fund small portions of many loans and thereby diversify default risk.
					Bitcoin loans usually work the same way as fiat currency loans. The borrower gets a certain amount of money over a specified time
					and repays the money with interest. There are two things you need to be aware of when you lend Bitcoins. <strong>The site needs to be trustworthy</strong> and
					<strong>the borrower needs to be trustworthy</strong>. When the site assesses the creditworthiness of their applicants
					the information given about borrowers can be more credible.</li>
					<li>A <strong>Bitcoin banking</strong> like model. Here you place your Bitcoins as a deposit with a site that pays you a fixed interest rate on these deposits. As everything
					here, this method has advantages and disadvantages. The good thing is, that you don't need to diversify your Bitcoins over many borrowers. You just place your Bitcoins with your
					Bitcoin bank and that's it. You earn Bitcoins as a steady stream of interest income. However, be very careful. In the previous case of peer to peer lending you diversify your
					lending activity over many borrowers. In the banking model 
					<strong>you trust one single borrower which is the bank</strong>. If they don't do a good job in managing your Bitcoins, everything
					can be lost at once. That's because the bank takes you deposits and invests them in assets, the most important assets usually being loans. If they do a good job you are fine
					because you simply collect the interest payment. If they don't do a good job you take the hit. An there is no deposit insurance in the Bitcoin world, too.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>To sum it up, Bitcoin lending is a good way to make more 
				Bitcoins from what you already have. <strong>And please notice this disclaimer: only lend through sites that
				you trust.</strong> Such sites will comply with the <em>usual</em> requirements that you expect from non-Bitcoin related sites as well. That means they have
				proper terms and conditions in place, they disclose their status of incorporation and contact details. Some sites in the 
				Bitcoin world do not do this and in the end people wonder what 
				happened
				to their Bitcoins. Therefore, when you earn Bitcoins from Bitcoin lending 
				watch who you deal with and only use Bitcoins which you can afford to lose.</p>

				<h2 id="earn-bitcoins-from-mining">4. Earn Bitcoins from mining &#128142;</h2>
				<p>Bitcoin <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining" target="_blank">mining</a> is the <strong>process by which new Bitcoins are originated</strong>. 
				When you perfom mining, your computer adds new Bitcoin 
				transactions to the block chain (a public ledger where all 
				Bitcoin transactions are saved) and searches for new blocks. A 
				block is a file that has the most recent Bitcoin transactions 
				recorded in it. When your computer discovers a new block, you receive a 
				certain number of Bitcoins. Currently a block contains BTC 25. This number changes
				throughout time and gets smaller by the factor 0.5 every four years.
				</p>
				<p>If you want to earn Bitcoins through mining, be aware that it is a costly and time consuming process. <strong>Read the respective introductions and
				manuals</strong> to learn more about it. <a href="https://www.weusecoins.com/en/mining-guide" target="_blank">This website</a> is a
				good starting point. Unless you are mining just out of curiosity and want to get to know the
				technology, it is important to make a cost / benefit analysis. It is quite similar to what has been mentioned at the above
				<a href="http://www.bitcoinplus.com/" target="_blank">BitcoinPlus</a>
				entry. Hardware prices, electricity costs, <a href="http://bitcoin-difficulty.com/" target="_blank">bitcoin difficulty</a>
				and the Bitcoin value influence the profitability of Bitcoin mining.				
				If all this seems interesting to you and you want to
				earn Bitcoins from mining make your first calculations on the <a href="http://mining.thegenesisblock.com/" target="_blank">Mining Dashboard</a>.

				<h2 id="earn-bitcoins-by-getting-tipped">5. Earn Bitcoins by getting tipped &#128079;</h2>
				<p>When you earn Bitcoins through tips, it is much like accepting Bitcoin as a means of payment. You need a wallet, a QR-code with your Bitcoin address on it and the people
				who can potentially give you a tip need to be aware of it. There are various places where you can receive Bitcoin tips.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Again, your <strong>shop</strong> is the first thing to start with in case you have one. It's just a bit simpler because since tips are voluntary you don't
					really need to check the incoming payment and the exact amount. Simply display the QR-code and check each day what came in.</li>
					<li>With tips, the nice thing is that you don't necessarily need to have a shop. A <strong>blog</strong> for instance or any other website is sufficient.
					You can display the QR-code or just your Bitcoin address at the bottom of your page or wherever it seems convenient and let people decide how much
					they want to tip you. You can also view how this looks like in the footer of this German blog <a href="http://bitcoins21.com" target="_blank">bitcoins21.com</a>.</li>
					<li>Imagine you have a restaurant and want to encourage your customers to tip with Bitcoins, there is this nice service:
					<a href="https://www.bctip.org/" target="_blank">bctip</a> is a website where you can print little 
					<strong>paper vouchers</strong> that have a certain Bitcoin balance on them.
					When your customer has one of these, he or she can simply give it to you or your employees and you can redeem it like a coupon.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 id="earn-bitcoins-through-trading">6. Earn Bitcoins through trading &#128200;</h2>
				<p>Some people would say that trading is a form of gambling. While there these two things have something in common, there are also fundamental differences.
				When you gamble (and assuming that it's a fair game) you have a certain probability of winning and losing. When you trade assets, this gets much more complex.
				I don't want to go into too much detail here. I just want to outline the concept how you can 
				<strong>earn Bitcoins with trading</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>The safest way to make money with trading is through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage" target="_blank">
				<strong>arbitrage</strong></a>. In short, this means
				that you see an opportunity to buy an asset in one place for a certain price and sell it immediately at another place for a higher price. It is important that
				you <em>know</em> you can sell the asset <em>immediately</em> at a <em>certain price</em>. If this does not hold, then we are talking of speculation - or gambling if you prefer.</p>
				<p>The Bitcoin world, in my opinion offers such arbitrage opportunities. But they are not as simple to execute as it might seem at first sight. Price differences between exchanges
				often come for certain reasons. The speed of fiat money transfers and access restrictions are just the most striking ones. You have to find out the concrete opportunities yourself.
				One place to start is this thread on <a href="http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/121/is-there-an-efficient-way-to-exploit-arbitrages-between-the-different-exchanges"
				target="_blank">Bitcoin StackExchange</a>. Also, not every opportunity is available to everyone.
				Go and have a look at the price differences between exchanges and check out if you can find opportunities.</p>
				<p>If you want to give arbitrage a try, <b>you need to get Bitcoins almost instantly</b>. One of the few sites where you don't need to sign up is
				<a href="https://bit4coin.net/en" target="_blank">bit4coin</a>. If you spot an opportunity and want to act on it immediately, this is a way to get a hold of Bitcoins fast.
				If you manage to earn Bitcoins from arbitrage, this can be very profitable after all. But start cautiously as it really does require some experience.
				</p>
				<p>
				The other way to earn Bitcoins from trading is <strong>simple speculation</strong>. In this case you would <a href="https://bit4coin.net/en" target="_blank">buy Bitcoins</a>,
				wait until the price increases, then sell for a fiat
				currency. When the price drops again, you buy more Bitcoins and start all over. For this to work out you either need to be very lucky or capable of predicting the future.</p>
				<p>There are people who are good traders and who can recognize patterns from price charts. But that's something very specialized and I'm not sure if I believe in this. So for me,
				if you want to earn Bitcoins from this form of trading it could also be categorized as gambling. And actually it's even more risky if you compare it to a fair game where
				you know your odds. When you speculate with assets, you can extract your odds from historical prices. But never start believing this would tell you something about the future reliably.

				<h2 id="earn-bitcoins-as-income">7. Earn Bitcoins as a regular income &#128104;</h2>
				<p>Getting your <strong>monthly paycheck in Bitcoins</strong> is probably the steadiest way to earn Bitcoins. There aren't many organizations who would pay you in Bitcoins but
				there are <em>some</em> at least. And maybe there will be more as acceptance increases continuously. Gavin Andresen, core Bitcoin developer of the
				<a href="https://bitcoinfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Bitcoin Foundation</a> stated in this
				<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/already-bigger-than-some-currencies-bitcoin-can-get-bigger-gavin-andresen-says/" target="_blank">interview</a>
				that he gets paid in Bitcoins. And chances are, that when your employer accepts Bitcoins
				they might be willing to pay you in Bitcoin, too.</p>
				<p>Apart from being employed by a company or a non-profit you can be self-employed and get paid in Bitcoins. Here is a list of sites where you can search job offers
				or where you can post an offer yourself. It's a very convenient way to earn Bitcoins, because many jobs can be completed from home.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.bittask.com/" target="_blank">WorkForBitcoin</a> is a site where you can do both, post job listings and search available listings. Many of the listed
					    open jobs are related to programming. But there are also other fields and it's worth checking if there is something you are interested in doing.</li>
				    <li><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=52.0" target="_blank">Bitcointalk Forum Services Section</a> is another starting point to look for job listings
				        that are paid in Bitcoins. Some of the jobs are done easily within a short amount of time so it's a good way to earn Bitcoins quickly.</li>
				    <li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4Bitcoins/" target="_blank">Jobs 4 Bitcoins on reddit</a> has a focus on job listings for programmers. But again, it's not purely
				        programming and it's definitely worthwile to browse through the different offers.</li>
				    <li><a href="http://bitgigs.com/" target="_blank">BitGigs</a> is an online job board with many diverse job offers. The variety is reall amazing so go check it out.</li>
				    <li><a href="http://coinality.com/" target="_blank">Coinality</a> has a different approach by not simply listing jobs where you can earn Bitcoins, but displaying them on a map.
				        This comes in handy when you are interested in a local job somewhere near you. The number of listings could be higher but when it keeps growing it will become more interesting.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Then of course, you can <strong>start your own Bitcoin related business</strong> and earn Bitcoins this way. Either as a fully fletched business of goods
				or services or you could run a website and place ads from
				<a href="https://coinurl.com/index.php?ref=5338040ee9f69f6eaba8631d9661b442 " target="_blank">CoinURL</a>. If you want to start or already have a brick and mortar shop check out the earn Bitcoins

				<p>To be honest, I'm not a big friend of gambling. But it is a way to earn Bitcoins so in order to make this list complete it needs to be mentioned here.
				However, I won't list any links to gambling sites here. It's fairly easy to research them if you are interested. And if you clicked on some of the above
				links you probably already came across some Bitcoin gambling sites.</p>
