Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.

Community rules
Do not use URL shortening services: always submit the real link.
Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.
News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.
Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies.
No referral links in submissions.
No compilations of free Bitcoin sites.
Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like "Buying 100 BTC" or "Selling my computer for bitcoins" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion.
Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system.
No wallet addresses in posts/comments. The tipbot can be used.

The more I think about it, if they are indeed a single individual it just seems like the logical thing to do in his position. He amassed ~900k coins which is likely one of the largest pre-mines coin stakes in the whole crypto-sphere, that runs counter-intuitive to his original vision. Essentially everyone has factored him out of the picture into today's price, if his coins started moving the exchange rate would go into a immediate panic, and the media would cry "PONZI". It would be a would be a pretty poetic ending to the bitcoin movie, just a shot of satoshi at his computer hitting the delete key and moving on to "more complex ideas."
Edit: Pre-mine is a poor choice of words, Hal was the second miner around block 70 so everything after that is obvious far game, and clearly he didn't stop mining after Hal joined. I just meant relative to bitcoins currently in circulation ~900k is quite a large percentage, ~7.5%.
Edit: ~900k figure based on this blockchain analysis which claims satoshi owns a stake of ~1000k: http://bitslog.wordpress.com/2013/04/17/the-well-deserved-fortune-of-satoshi-nakamoto/

Until he does this, there is no reason for others to believe he did such things - thus making it an useless act.

permalinkparent[+]prof7bit 9 points10 points11 points 5 months ago (33 children)[–]prof7bit 9 points10 points11 points 5 months agoThese are addresses for which nobody knows the private key.
permalinkparent[+]Scane 7 points8 points9 points 5 months ago (32 children)[–]Scane 7 points8 points9 points 5 months agoThanks but who confirms or ensures that nobody knows the private key?
permalinkparent[+][deleted] 28 points29 points30 points 5 months ago (22 children)[–][deleted] 28 points29 points30 points 5 months agoReal addresses look random because they are a hash of a public key. You can still create vanity addresses by generating a bunch until you find one that matches your criteria, but for each character that you want to chose, it will take 58 times longer to find an address.
For example, finding an address that starts with 1Scane will take 5810 (about 658 million) tries on average, which is easily doable. For 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE on the other hand, ALL characters where obviously chosen, except for the mandatory 1 at the start and the checksum at the end. Finding such an address would take more time and energy than is available to inhabitants of our universe. Therefore, it's safe to say that nobody knows a private key that would correspond to it. permalinkparent[+]r3m0t 8 points9 points10 points 5 months ago (0 children)[–]r3m0t 8 points9 points10 points 5 months agoYou mean 585 surely?

permalinkparent[+]BlubQ 7 points8 points9 points 5 months ago (0 children)[–]BlubQ 7 points8 points9 points 5 months agoActually if People would think like me then lotteries wouldnt exist.
I have never played any lotterie stuff because its not worth it. Just because I made a comment joking about something doesnt mean that thats how I think about something. ;)
permalinkparent[+]yotta 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago (2 children)[–]yotta 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoThat would be equivalent to winning something like six lottery jackpots in a row.
permalinkparent[+]BlubQ 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago* (1 child)[–]BlubQ 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago*Well. i have heared of people winning two times in a row. and of a family where everyone but one person has won the lottery. i think it was a nordic EU family and 4/5 people won the lottery.
6 times in a row is highly unlikly but just remember: nothing is impossible
permalinkparent[+]yotta 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago (0 children)[–]yotta 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoThere is no meaningful difference between 2-160 (1/1048) and 0. It is technically "possible" however it can be safely said that it never happen.
To do it other than by luck would require an efficient preimage attack on ripemd160(sha256()) and a quantum computer that can solve the ecliptic curve discrete logarithm problem for 256 bit values - and the quantum computer won't help much with the preimage. Not happening any time soon. permalinkparent
