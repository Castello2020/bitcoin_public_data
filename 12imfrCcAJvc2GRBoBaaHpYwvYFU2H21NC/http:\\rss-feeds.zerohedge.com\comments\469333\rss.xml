    <title>Because the hedge fund guys</title>
    <link>http://www.zerohedge.com/node/469333#comment-3221161</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Because the hedge fund guys are the market&#039; &quot;experts&quot;. &amp;nbsp;The retail invester isn&#039;t, he represents the &quot;dumb&quot; money; nobody follows the retail investor or copies what they do or cares what they do. &amp;nbsp;But if a couple of big hedge funds decide to take profits I think that other hedge fund managers will follow and then institutional money managers will want to run, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Why do you think that a large hedge fund or two withdrawing from the market would have a greater effect than the loss of the retail investor?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Good analysis, MMP, and I</title>
    <link>http://www.zerohedge.com/node/469333#comment-3219510</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Good analysis, MMP, and I don&#039;t necessarily disagree, but the stock market will be moved, I believe, by action at the margins. &amp;nbsp;If and when one or two of the larger hedge funds decide to cash out this will probably cascade. &amp;nbsp;The Fed can prop things up (maybe indefinitely), but that is very different from stopping a run once that has started. &amp;nbsp;There are real dangers here and I wouldn&#039;t put any of my resources into this equity market. &amp;nbsp;It&#039;s not that people aren&#039;t making money, it&#039;s the risk/reward that turns me off.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What a load of shit.
Free</title>
    <link>http://www.zerohedge.com/node/469333#comment-3219450</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;What a load of shit.Free market prices aren&#039;t determined by &#039;value&#039; or any other formula, they are determined by the balance of selling and buying.Value is something that&amp;nbsp;exists merely in the eye of the beholder. But there are millions of beholders, so&amp;nbsp;ascribing a&amp;nbsp;correct valuation is an&amp;nbsp;impossible task.&amp;nbsp;All that really&amp;nbsp;matters is how the balance of buyers and sellers will compare in the future. Everything else is a distraction, designed to sway your thinking. There are a million reasons why people buy and sell, working out one of those reasons to the Nth degree is futile any such insight is negligible.&amp;nbsp;All Wall St does is tends to the herd and occasionally drives everyone into a corner so they can bet on them coming out again. You can see when this is happening as correlation across markets will tend towards 1.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;while some might say so, i don&#039;t think the author meant what he said below. &amp;nbsp;a better way would have been to note that leverage needs to fall from 410% to 310% of gdp, about 25%. &amp;nbsp;&quot;It can be assumed conservatively that the total-debt-to-GDP ratio needs to fall by 100 per cent before the debt position becomes sustainable in advanced economies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I see you are tired and want</title>
    <link>http://www.zerohedge.com/node/469333#comment-3219309</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;I see you are tired and want to leave the floor, so I won&#039;t ask for a dance but please forgive me&amp;nbsp;as I critique your last dance.&amp;nbsp; You profess that you don&#039;t see a meaningful difference between physical and paper gold.&amp;nbsp; Well, most gold bugs are buggy about gold because they see the ongoing destruction and eventual (near term) failure&amp;nbsp;of our financial system which consists of a mountain of paper products derived out of a molehill of tangible products.&amp;nbsp; In a world that was going to plod on indefinately as is, I&#039;d say you may be right.&amp;nbsp; But, again, us bugs are buggy because we believe the system is going to tilt. Paper derivitives will become worthless in a crashed system.&amp;nbsp; People who are holding their gold in hand will be able to use&amp;nbsp;the historically validated and human nature inspired value holding properties of precious metals in any new replacement system.&amp;nbsp; In all likelyhood, the paper derivitives and promises to deliver will be firestarter only.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, the holders of a loaf of bread will be better off than someone with a fistfull of wheat futures that rely on a coherent system in place to provide the value.Also, you mentioned a generational bearish attitude being&amp;nbsp; fostered in the market and that being needed before gold can truely go bullish again.&amp;nbsp; We have had a generational bear market from approx. 1983 to 2001 and I put forward that while we may have had a bullish market since 2001, it was in price only, as the mainstream market makers&amp;nbsp;always maintained a predominately bearish view and commentary all during that time.&amp;nbsp; This served to keep a true bull market from developing where the proletariat jumped in.&amp;nbsp; In essance, the current so called bull market in PMs was and is generated by the bugs.&amp;nbsp; There is no bubble and no irrational exuberance by the masses;&amp;nbsp;quite the contrary, actually.&amp;nbsp; In my view, the true bull awaits and needs no correction to begin it.Peace be with you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;All it will take is another good drop for the government to make a pitch to take over 401k&#039;s/private retirement/private pensions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; They already floated a trial balloon saying in a market decline they&#039;ll reimburse part of the loss to your portfolio if you hand it over to them.Watch for this topic to come around again soon, if and when, watch out because you know there will be a major market decline.They will be running out of taxing power soon, knowing they&#039;ll kill the host too quickly, and/or treasury refi&#039;s getting tougher and tougher.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hm. I&#039;ll give a 7/10 rating. In the event of actual currency collapse, or in the event of grid-failure including banking grid, your plan is hindered but you&#039;d surive. You&#039;re clever so you&#039;ll adapt of course. Toss back in gold, silver &amp;amp; multiple locales to live in &amp;amp; I bump that up to 9/10. 10/10 needs another legal jurisdiction to safely live in AND store some of the goods.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I have been thinking about</title>
    <link>http://www.zerohedge.com/node/469333#comment-3219034</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about this a lot. Are not both of the following statements true?: 1. The Fed and the US government will do anything and everything (and  I mean that in the strongest literal sense) to prop up the stock  market. Otherwise, pension funds, public and private (but especially  public) are utterly bankrupt overnight. Obviously, anything and  everything includes (at a minimum) printing money and giving it to  others to buy stocks, if necessary. There are even some on this website  who have made a compelling case that such is already being done. 2. The Fed and the US government are actively undertaking debasement  of the dollar to monetize debt and to keep the system from outright  imploding quickly. Again, I have read enough articles and commentary  here that I am persuaded that this has already begun, and, further, that  this policy will be pursued until the very end. I am aware that there is what appears to be a disconnect between the  economy and the market; viz., the market no longer reflects the  underlying economy or fundamentals of any particular company or sector,  but instead is being manipulated to enrich certain individuals, prevent  utter pension and system collapse, and to give the appearance (via  television sound bite talking points) of normalcy or better. Nevertheless, given the certainty of the two policies mentioned  above, is it not impossible that the market will decline in any  significant manner (at least nominally), and likely will provide growth  commensurate with real inflation for some period of time (which may well  prove to be longer than my remaining days here on Earth)? Really, it seems like the big questions are: 1. How long? When? 2. What will prove the harbinger of real decline? 3. Will manipulation and support include all stocks (including  Facebook, Netlix, Amazon, and their ilk) or just some? How to identify  those that will enjoy the most support the longest?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Doc I hope you dont mind if I</title>
    <link>http://www.zerohedge.com/node/469333#comment-3218995</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Doc I hope you dont mind if I stay brief and let us pick this up again tomorrow, but let me just note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. I sort of dont buy the argument that there is real inherent difference in phyz vs. paper gold. Clearly if bullion prices surged, paper would track it to some degree. Likewise, if paper prices plummeted, I cant help but think the same would occur. Really gold is no different from scrap iron that way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Larger investors have to play in the paper market. Paulsen and others (smart and dumb money alike are bullish gold) cant feasibly take delivery of gold. It doesnt really work except in a few small cases. Its just like when oil prices sometimes go up and the media starts going into a huff about &#039;forcing speculators to take delivery&#039; and we all know how absurd that is. I think gold is no different from the rest of paper commodities in that the vast majority of price action is paper based and if suddenly paper prices plunged as big investors (ahem, Paulsen) all had to start dumping because gold is dead money, the bullion prices would follow suit. All thats left to pick them up afterwards (which you say is the smart money) is in my mind nothing but the most die hard gold bugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. In my thesis doc, the Bernank comtrol interest rates and artificially keeps them under 4%. Interest rates will never go up as TPTB simply wont allow it. It doesnt give a shit what the market thinks, as long as the US has the worlds dominant military, it will set its own interest rates, thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. You would of course have to come back to the national debt argument to support the underlying hyperinflation thesis in the first place. However, its not really fears of inflation that gold is reflecting imho, rather fears of bond/currency collapse, as people feel hard assets in the form of PMs are truly a last resort. However, imagine a scenario such as i propose: a few years of Bernanke keeping commodities totally flat, ramping stocks at 10%+ per year and *allowing* interest rates to calmly however between 2-4%. After years of this, nobody will really believe in the possibility of imminent collapse anymore and the only enthusiasm left in the gold market will be the die hard bugs who still expect hyperinflation just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Dont you think Bernanke will personally see to it to crush gold as an asset class for a generation? Wouldn&#039;t you, if you were him? It will be the crowning achievement of his behavioral financing experiment. A giant cherry on the &quot;fuck you bernanke&quot; cake.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You bring up some solid</title>
    <link>http://www.zerohedge.com/node/469333#comment-3218951</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;You bring up some solid points, but I will maintain that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Paulson invests in GLD and doesn&#039;t take delivery of real gold. He&#039;s a one hit wonder that doesn&#039;t grasp the real reason why you hold physical gold over paper  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) there are very few &quot;investors&quot; ( renters) who hold assets in gold. If they allocate a mere 5% of their allocation to gold that means we go higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) interest rates are at their lowest and they will eventually go higher. Sure they may tac down to sub 1% on the 10 year and I expect them to, but the long term trajectory is up, and gold will follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) overlay the national debt with the gold price and you get an interesting picture. Without massive growth there is no hope for the deficit, so the debt goes higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) I forgot what five is because I&#039;ve been drinking wine, but I&#039;m sure it was a good point. Bottom line is I expect paper gold to get hammered (much like me) the weak hands to get shaken out , and gold to go higher.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;A 100 percentage point decrease would make things manageable?&amp;nbsp; I don&#039;t think so.&amp;nbsp; It is in the nature of markets to see a debt/GDP slide from 400% to 0% without pause.&amp;nbsp; Markets always over react.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I really see where you&#039;re</title>
    <link>http://www.zerohedge.com/node/469333#comment-3218881</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;I really see where you&#039;re coming from Doc but I think we&#039;re due for a repeat of the 90&#039;s. A soaring market and flatlining commodities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with your current contention in my opinion is that its tough to make the case that the &quot;smart&quot; money will be in gold as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. The smart money got into gold WAY before it was on everybodys lips and if anything needs to get out here at the peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. When idiots like John Paulsen are basing their investing philosophy on &quot;buy gold&quot; its tough to say the smart money is going to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C. The main investment idea behind gold is extremely simple- the hyperinflationary outcome. Due to the fact that this is so widely discussed and debated, it doesnt take a very smart individual to figure this out. If the Fed, is indeed in control of markets and does manage to keep all commodi prices stable as I suspect, the hyperinflationary argument will lose traction until there is nothing left until a core group of staunch die-hard gold bugs, and they will be too small to propo up e price against the Fed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D. The enthusiasm for gold is way out of hand among gold bugs (they are the biggest permabulls out there, it makes Tom Lee look rational when he talks equities). Whenever anyone is 100% every opportunity is a good chance to buy the dip, as they do in gold, they are just asking to get crushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E. I think its the personal objective of the Bernank to crush gold (as the enemy of fiat) and see to it that it is dead money for an entire generation just as a huge fuck you to you guys. My moneys on the Bernank...&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I would be inclined to believe you if only for the reason that no sane person would be fighting the fed at the moment. Look back to that chart listing prices from last year vs. the beginning of the decade with potatoes up some 500%.Start a garden, buy some chickens, buy long term storable food, sure. It is harder/impossible for them to attack the value of these things. But as you point out, and as everyone here is surely aware, silver and gold are quite easily manipulated.&amp;nbsp;BTC: 12imfrCcAJvc2GRBoBaaHpYwvYFU2H21NC&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;You had me until you said &quot; once retail goes you guys will fight a losing battle&quot;, because I totally agree with the first part of your statement. I believe that the weak hands have to go and retail has to plow  into stocks. But we all know what happens then..  retail will be  holding the bag in stocks and the&quot; smart money &quot; will be in gold. Then retail will chase gold higher, while the smart money is selling to them. That&#039;s generational wealth creation game.&lt;/p&gt;
