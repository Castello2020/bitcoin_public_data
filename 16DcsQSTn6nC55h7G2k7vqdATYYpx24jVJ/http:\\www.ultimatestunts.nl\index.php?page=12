Donations
Ultimate Stunts now accepts donations through the Bitcoin system.
In the table below, you can see to which Bitcoin addresses you can send money to donate for
certain purposes. You can also add your own feature requests here. If you do that,
please fill in your e-mail address, so that I can contact you if something is not clear.
The donated money will not be spent until the requested feature has been added to a new release of
Ultimate Stunts. Please be aware that I (CJP) am the only one who judges whether a certain feature
has been included in a new version. I will send the donated money to the person(s) who contributed
the feature; this can be e.g. myself. If you have any questions, please
contact me.
If you are a computer programmer or a game artist, and you wish to receive some of the donated
money, you can contact me as well. We can agree to the details of the job and to a certain
percentage of the donations (most will go to you if you do most of the work). In the end, I will
decide whether your work is of sufficient quality to be included in Ultimate Stunts. I will not
use your work as long as I haven't sent you the promised part of the donations.
