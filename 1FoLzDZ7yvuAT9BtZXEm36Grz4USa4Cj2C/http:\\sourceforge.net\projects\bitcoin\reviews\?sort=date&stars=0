Help please. my bitcoin-qt suddenly stops updating from the network with up to several weeks of updates missing. i can cure it by deleting everything except my wallet and letting it reload every bit of the history. I have no idea how to fix it.

1MJN7MrxG95B5h7dn4hpVhyUnjjEGnQZLo. I am very new to the Bticoin world, like days new! I am starting a foundation for my sister's genetic disease and thought this would be a wonderful way to fund such an important foundation. 95% of proceeds will go to research and treatment development for familia dysauntonomia! It is an extremely rare disease that limits the nervous system and reacts poorly to any malfunction of the body such as blood pressure, stress, and/or illness. Please contribute whatever you can to 1MJN7MrxG95B5h7dn4hpVhyUnjjEGnQZLo

A BIG dis-advantage is that you can not set where the program should download the data it is downloading. So it would be nice to see a option that you can enter the location where is going to put the 5GB of data, on a disc of your own choice with enough space. Many people use a prgram disc and a harddisc for data. Thanks!

The guy below me (bitcoinadvisor) is lying. Please do not send anything to anyone promising to "double your money."
If you got a letter in the mail from someone you didn't know telling you that if you sent money to an address you never heard of, they would send you twice as much money back... would you do it? Now imagine there is no return address on the envelope, and the address to send the money to is a PO Box registered to John Doe? That is essentially what this guy is asking. The story is untrue, and the guy is an idiot.
The wallet he wants you to send bitcoins to is empty. It has never had bitcoins sent to it. Odd for a money-doubling magician, right? Why wouldn't he just send a bitcoin to himself, double it, then repeat? There is a reason for that: it is a scam.
bitcoinadvisor: if you're gonna try to scam people, do it on Bitcointalk like everybody else (where you will be called out on it). Keep this garbage off of the project page.

Works good ofcourse but the way it deals with updates, files and directories (W7) I find very confusing. There's 3 things that I like to save on separate locations: 1. the program files (small and needs to be updated) 2. the wallet (contains your money) and 3. the blockchaindata (because its big and getting even bigger).
I got an old version installed with the pf on D: and now I want to update without losing my wallet and ofcourse without downloading the complete blockchain again. I tried several things but I am not able to work it out...
Greatfullness for all the work by the bitcoindevelopers, but the truth is this program is not yet ready for serious use.

Works for me on Mac OS X 10.8.3 (Mountain Lion). I like the lower fee as well.
Just to be safe, I moved most of my BTC to another wallet and did the install. I had my wallet encrypted, and when I installed the new software I replaced the previous version and all worked fine.
Great job!

This is a bogus currency the only people who can win are those who already have coins. Don't waste energy leaving your computer switched on to mine for only the benefit of others. Go lookup what a PONZI scheme is on Wikipedia.

the best project so far....as long as could not be controlled by another finance system would retain the real value.
