<p>Today at 2PM Rutgers' Helix New Music Ensemble will perform KaleidoPsychoTropos for Flute, Clarinet, Violin, Cello and Piano, Tchoupitoulas Byrd Song for Clarinet and Piano and Tango de Tonnerre (World Premiere) for Viola and Piano. I've been commenting on rehearsal videos and this is going to be really fantastic. </p>

<p>Here's the new music I've written since the last blog entry, as usual, all of the demos are available <a href="http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/">here</a>:</p>

<p><b>2013:</b></p>

<p><a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/For_Solomon_Eagle_(Harrington,_Jeffrey_Michael)">For Solomon Eagle for Alto Recorder, Continuo, Bass</a>, a strange hallucinogenic commentary on a Division by Solomon Eccles.  Part of  <a href="http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/The%20New%20Division/Index.html">Daniel Wolf's New Divison project</a>.  </p>

<p><a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/Pastorale_for_Solo_Flute_(Harrington,_Jeffrey_Michael)">Pastorale for Flute</a>, a short quirky not too difficult piece with interesting cross rhythms and East European melodic influences. <br />
 <br />
<a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/Jeux_d%27eau_et_de_rochers_(Harrington,_Jeffrey_Michael)">Jeux d'eau et de rochers for piano</a>, a piano piece, full of curlecews and Scarlatti-esque wonder inspired by the waterfalls at Fontaine de Vaucluse. </p>

<p><a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/With_Sails_Unfurled..._(Harrington,_Jeffrey_Michael)">With Sails Unfurled... for Saxophone Quartet</a>, an exploration of East European melodies in rhythms, with some exciting transitions and climaxes.  </p>

<p><a href="http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Un_Voyage_a_Cythere_for_8_Euphoniums.mp3">Un Voyage a Cythere for 8 Euphoniums</a>, a piece commissioned by euphonist, Robert Benton, for live ensemble or pre-recorded and one soloist.  The score will be available after the premiere which looks to be sometime in the fall.  It's a quasi-orchestral study in massive washes of sounds and heraldic anthems.  </p>

<p><a href="http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Traversees_nocturne_pour_flute_clarinette_violon_violoncelle_et_piano.mp3">Traversees nocturne pour flute, clarinette, violon, violoncelle et piano</a>.  A study in the colors of night.  Score available shortly.  </p>

<p><b>2012:</b><br />
<a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/La_perle_(Harrington,_Jeffrey_Michael)">La Perle for Flute Quartet</a> a strange and ecstatic piece, inspired by my electronic piece, <a href="http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/obliterature/02-Turning_the_Pearl.mp3">Turning the Pearl</a>.  </p>

<p><a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/Tango_for_Piano_No.2_(Harrington,_Jeffrey_Michael)">Tango #2 for Piano</a> a nocturnal tango.  </p>

<p><a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/Tango_Milonga_III_(Harrington,_Jeffrey_Michael)">Tango Milonga III for Clarinet, Cello and Piano</a>, the final movement in my Tango Milonga Suite, fast and furious, but still soulful.</p>

<p><a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/Visto_d%27Avignoun_for_Reed_Quintet_(Harrington,_Jeffrey_Michael)">Vistuo de Avignoun for Reed Quintet</a>, a 5 minute piece which explores the sound worlds around our new home, Avignon, France.</p>

<p><a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/Tango-Phantasie_for_Piano_Trio_(Harrington,_Jeffrey_Michael)">Tango-Phantasie for Piano Trio</a>, a full length piano trio tango, full of flair and quiet desparation.  </p>

<p><a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/Ox_for_Solo_Cello_(Harrington,_Jeffrey_Michael)">Ox for Solo Cello</a> a slow, almost static cello piece in a single line, inspired by the Bach C minor Sarabande.  </p>

<p>And finally, after 22 years of putting it off, I've created a performable version of my <a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/Acid_Bach_(Harrington,_Jeffrey_Michael)">Acid Bach Suite for Quarter-tone Tuned Keyboards</a>.  It requires 2 full size keyboards.  </p>

<p>Here's a new realization: </p>

<p>In the past 3 months, I've written and revised a bunch of new pieces, Tango Ondulado for Solo Flute, Tango de Tonnerre for Viola and Piano, L'appel du large for Harp and Viola, Tango Feroz for Violin and Piano, a Tango for Solo Piano (the first of an intended series), Cello Duet II and a second Tango Milonga for Clarinet, Cello and Piano which will form the 2nd movement of a suite.  I've also finally finished and published my massive virtuoso Hammered Wind Dances I for Flute and Piano.  </p>

<p>First, my new tango for viola and piano is an extremely dramatic work, with virtuoso parts for both viola and piano.  It's got recurring massive chords and dramatic ostinati on the piano which give it gigantic climaxes.</p>

<p>My new solo flute tango is 3 minutes of rhythmic excitement.  It's named Tango Ondulado for its undulating manner, florid and eccentric.  </p>

<p>My Tango Feroz for Violin and Piano is an encore piece, written for a contest that turned out to have more than a passing interest in amateur endeavors.  Nonetheless, a composer really can't have too many violin encores!  It's 4 minutes of punchy, 12/8 tango/salsa madness with windups and climaxes galore.  </p>

<p>My new Tango for Piano #1, is a meditation on the tango, brooding and almost laconic in places.  It's intended to be the first in a series, and I'm modelling the pieces after the compositional manner of the Chopin Mazurkas.  </p>

<p><a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/Tango_for_Piano_No.1_(Harrington,_Jeffrey_Michael)">Score for Tango for Piano #1 - IMSLP.org</a><br />

<p>My second big piece for clarinet, cello and piano, is the 2nd movement in an intended Tango Milonga Suite.  It's slower, brooding and has some very delicate slow parts throughout the piece.  </p>

<p>And finally the last new piece, which I finished yesterday, is a new Cello Duet II.  It is a ferocious, but stately piece, manic in places and brooding in others.  </p>

<p>And regarding The Hammered Wind Dances I for Flute and Piano, this was a piece that I wrote back in 2001.  I remember listening to a demo of it on the train to the OughtOne Festival in Vermont and then 2 weeks later, 9/11 happened and everything got sidelined.  I revised the piece in 2004 and finally have finished the parts and scores.  It was intended to be a big piece, like my BlueStrider for Piano, monumental, but with an eccentric funk/jazz approach within its very strict brutal classicism.  Both the piano part and the flute part are very difficult, but certainly not more than most modern flute and piano pieces (certainly easier than the Boulez Sonatine?). </p>

<p>Recent performances, include the premiere of my <a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/Duo_Oscuro_for_Bass_Clarinet_and_Vibraphone_(Harrington,_Jeffrey_Michael)">Duo Oscruro for Bass Clarinet and Vibraphone - Bassoon Version</a> in Seville, Spain and the world premiere of my solo horn piece, <a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/Laudis_Praeco_for_Solo_Horn_(Harrington,_Jeffrey_Michael)">Laudem Praeco</a> at Morehead State University, by M. Wyatt Elam.  Upcoming performances include the bass version of my Tango del Aquelarre, two or three performances of my Tango Milonga, the premiere of my Tango for Solo Violin by Karen Bentley Pollick and the premiere of my new piece for harp and viola, L'appel du large for Harp and Viola by Duo Esprit.  </p>

<p>I've got a bunch of exciting news and 5 new pieces, of which I'm only talking about three - so 3 new pieces.  Two are finished; they're just being kept secret for the time being.  The first new piece, which I'm talking about, is the big new solo cello/viola tango - Tango del Aquelarre.  It's the sister piece for my Grand Tango for Solo Violin that I wrote for <a href="http://www.kbentley.com/">Karen Bentley Pollick</a>.  It's in a similar style, but has some new Baroqueisms that put it over the top.  </p>

<p>The second piece, I've recently completed is a short solo flute piece that called &agrave; part.  It's a meditative piece which uses rhythmic quirks to appear to be 2 voices at once, but without the virtuosity necessary to realize the piece as in my last 3 solo flute pieces.</p>

<a href="http://parnasse.com/pdf/a_part_pour_flute_solo.pdf">&agrave; part for Solo Flute - Score</a></p>

<p>And finally, my big new Tango Milonga for a trio of clarinet, cello and piano.  It's a fiery, dramatic tango with a lot of variety in the textures.  I've arranged it for clarinet, bass clarinet and piano at a musician's request and I've made an arrangement for piano trio too.  All the arrangements are available at my <a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/Tango_Milonga_for_Clarinet,_Cello_and_Piano_(Harrington,_Jeffrey_Michael)">IMSLP page</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a demo recording via YouTube.  <br />

<p>And some news, The Hutchins Consort has informed me that they've been in the studio recording my big piece for them, The Song of R'lyeh.  I can't wait to hear it, as it's a quasi-orchestral piece with quartertone melodies throughout!  </p>

<p>Duo Ahlert und Schwab's new CD of <a href="http://www.naxos.com/catalogue/item.asp?item_code=8.559686">American Mandolin and Guitar Music</a> is out on Naxos.  You can hear it on <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/50HusmaghZio5GEp6jhMZm">Spotify</a>, iTunes, or order it through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007DB7E5I/ref=dm_sp_alb">Amazon</a>.  </p>

<p>Here's a playlist of all my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6D34E8C63D9348D4">YouTube performances</a> and a few electronic pieces I've put together.  </p>

<p>A couple of friends in Paris, violist/composer <a href="http://www.nigelkeay.com/">Nigel Keay</a> and pianist <a href="http://www.trioartdente.com/trio-art-dente/dora-cantella-piano/">Dora Cantella</a> put together a recording session for my Tango for Viola and Piano and here's the very lively result. </p>

<p>Before I get to the new pieces, here's a video of <a href="http://www.thetwiolins.de/en/the-twiolins/">The Twiolins'</a> premiere of my 2 violin piece, Grand Duo.  It was performed at Der Alten Synagoge Hirschberg-Leutershause, Germany accompanied by the beautiful Butoh dancer, Damaris H&auml;rtl.  </p>

<p>And Kate&#345;ina Pavlikova's husband, Vit V. Pavlik, has created a video of live painting to accompany my piece, Par-Del&agrave; des Eaux Profondes for Baritone Sax and Electronics.  </p>

<p>Now on to the four new pieces.  I've composed 20 pieces this past year!  I wrote a very short piece for flute, viola and contrabass, Ainsi l'aube.... It's full of bird songs and string harmonics.</p>

<p>And I wrote a very dramatic tango for solo violin for <a href="http://www.kbentley.com/">Karen Bentley Pollick</a>.  The piece came together almost miraculously and Karen already has it under her fingers.  It'll be premiered early 2012 and it's already sounding unbelievably good.  </p>

<p>My swirling Bach-ish solo flute piece, <a href="http://parnasse.com/pdf/en_un_clin_doeil_for_solo_flute.pdf">En un Clin d'Oeil</a>, will be premiered in London by the superb, <a href="http://www.hoitenga.org/">Camilla Hoitenga</a>, October 30 at the Flute School.  It's 1:00PM at The Hall School, Swiss Cottage, London NW3 4NU. She'll be playing it with Sciarrino's transcription of Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, which was the piece that inspired me to write it! Also, my monumental guitar and mandolin piece, Bidon Cinque, will be premiered in Bottrop, Germany, November 11 by <a href="http://www.ahlert-schwab.de/">Duo Ahlert und Schwab</a>. The next week, my Lovecraftian string octet, written for the <a href="http://www.hutchinsconsort.org/">The Hutchins Consort</a>, will be premiered in La Jolla and Newport Beach on the 18th and 20th respectively. And I've been told my Grand Duo for 2 Violins will be premiered in the next couple of weeks in Mannheim. Also, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/CROSS-ISLAND/230540313931?v=info">Cross Island Ensemble</a> will be performing my Nocturne for Cello and Piano November 1 for their CD release concert: November 1, 8:00 PM: Classical Concert Series, Saint Peter's Church, 619 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY!</p>

<p>I've also finished my 7th String Quartet - a monstrous and dramatic tango!  It's about 11 minutes of static drama, flourishes and big climaxes.  </p>

<p>This month, I've been working on a few slow pieces, a cello and piano piece, Ballade #2 and a duo for 2 cellos.  Both pieces are easier to play than my music normally is and are finished and available.  </p>

<p>The Ballade is an 8 minute brooding meditation with a few quirky surprises.  <br />

<p>I've also just finished a piece for toy piano entitled, Tantrum.  It was an interesting project for me as I had to reduce my gestures to the simplest shapes in order to make it work.  As somebody who's been getting more extravagant in his writing, this was a challenge and the result is a piece, more violent and more belligerent than I've written in years.  It's 4 minutes of pounding toy piano mayhem, with the material driven by minor 2nds.  </p>

<p>Just got the recording that the Calefax Reed Quintet made of my piece, Ranae for Reed Quintet.  It's a little bit less than 4 minutes of odd motion, Dixieland layering and almost orchestral grandiosity thanks to the group's phenomenal way of blending their sounds.  </p>

	<p>JW Turner premiered my quartertone-filled solo cello piece, Quarter Dollar Tones, last Friday night.  Here's a YouTube of his exciting performance.</p>

<p>I've just written a duo for bass clarinet and vibraphone, Duo Oscuro.  It's in the general style of pieces like Gnomos and Tchoupitoulas Byrd Song, a relaxed atmospheric funk.</p>

The Hutchins Consort
<br />
</span>
</div>

<p>Joe McNalley, artistic director for <a href="http://www.hutchinsconsort.org/">The Hutchins Consort</a> contacted me last month and asked if I'd like to write a piece for their incredible octet of violins of all sizes.  Here's a brief history of the ensemble from a recent profile in the <a href="http://www.hutchinsconsort.org/press.php">New York Times:</a><br />
<i><br />
'The ensemble was assembled to play the so-called new violin family designed and built by Carleen Hutchins, a luthier who during the 1950s sought to enable a putative musical revolution from her home workshop in Montclair, N.J.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hutchins, who died in August, was spurred by a request from the avant-garde composer Henry Brant. He wanted a range of instruments that would share the specific tonal qualities of a violin instead of the varying sounds produced by the modern viola, cello and double bass. A decade of experimentation resulted in a set of eight violins ranging in size from the 11-inch treble to the 7-foot contrabass, each pitched half an octave apart.</i></p>

<p> I was eager to work with this type of sonically experimental ensemble and quickly got to work.  The result is <a href="http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-The_Song_of_Rlyeh_for_Violin_Octet.mp3">The Song of R'lyeh for Violin Octet</a>.  It's 8 minutes of almost orchestral textures, featuring quartertone-enhanced melodies.  The title comes from H.P. Lovecraft, and is a other-worldly graveyard in the middle of the Pacific Ocean where sleeps unspeakable monsters.  The piece is both monstrous, otherworldly, and ecstatic.  They'll be starting rehearsals shortly I'm told in both the San Diego and the New York City sister consort.</p>

<p>Bassist Matt Gold asked me to write a piece for his new trio, comprised of trumpet, vibraphone and bass and the result was my latest piece, a dark bit of slow walking funkiness, <a href="http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Trio_Diverses_for_Trumpet_Vibraphone_and_Contrabass.mp3">Trio Diverses</a>.  It's in the realm of my older pieces such as <a href="http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Gnomos_for_Flute_Bassoon_and_Piano.mp3">Gnomos for Bassoon, Flute and Piano</a>, a cassoulet of funk and poignant tunes.  I'll be putting up the score and parts sometime next week.  </p>

<p>Fellow composer and Paris-based violist, Nigel Keay, has been working up my new <a href="http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Tango_for_Viola_and_Piano.mp3">Tango for Viola and Piano</a> and they're looking at getting into a studio to record it sometime in the next couple of months.  Nigel has also helped me tweak the viola part so that it's a bit easier to play - the revised score and parts are here:</p>

<p>Last month I also wrote a <a href="http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Tango_for_Piano_Quintet.mp3">Tango for Piano Quintet</a>.  It's 6 or so very hot minutes of reflective atmospherics and hot, explosive action.  I'll put the score up sometime next month.  </p>

<p><a href="http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Tango_for_Piano_Quintet.mp3">Tango for Piano Quintet - Realization</a></p>

<p>I've got two more solo cello pieces in the works, one with quartertones and not as folky as <a href="http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Quarter_Dollar_Tones_for_Solo_Cello.mp3">Quarter Dollar Tones</a> and one quite Bach like in its harmonies, but with a ferocious vibe.  And I've started writing a few violin duets.  The <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/CROSS-ISLAND/230540313931?v=info">Cross Island Ensemble</a> has performed my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVkICHz42K8">Nocturne for Cello and Piano</a> a few more times and they plan on recording it for their next CD in March.   </p>

<p>As always, if you're interested in requesting a piece from me, all I require is that you promise me a good performance and a recording.  No money down!  </p>

<p>The stupendous <a href="http://www.calefax.nl/home_en.asp">Calefax Reed Quintet</a> awarded my piece, Ranae for Reed Quintet their 2010 Composer's Competition prize December 28th, which nicely enough was also my birthday.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.calefax.nl/nieuws_en.asp">Harrington Wins Composers Competition 2010</a></p>

<p>I had the great pleasure of being at the concert virtually through Skype video, giving a small interview and listening to them premiere my piece.  There will be a studio recording sometime in the next couple of months.  I'll not be putting up a demo in lieu of what I expect to be an amazing studio performance.  The piece, Ranae, or frogs in Latin, is 4 minutes of what I've described as the beginning of Le Sacre as seen through the dense funk polyphony found in Dixieland bands (but without the jazz influences).  </p>

<p>I've also just finished a big piece, Passages Rituels for String Quartet and Electronics.  Passages Rituels is an exploration of the use of string instruments combined with electronic audio which acts as a quasi-orchestral accompaniment and additionally adds quartertone colorings to the piece (without requiring that the quartet perform quartertones). The piece functions as a slow walk, almost a walking meditation, like Kin-Hin, through a ritualistic landscape, fluctuating emotionally between lamentation and fury.  </p>

<p>While I'm not putting up demos or the scores for these last two pieces, I do have 3 new pieces I am distributing free to all.  First, a new crazy solo cello piece using lots of quartertones, <a class='mp3' href="http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Quarter_Dollar_Tones_for_Solo_Cello.mp3">Quarter Dollar Tones for Solo Cello</a>.  The piece has an extreme folky intensity and uses quartertones throughout as a kind of wrong note flavoring.  A premiere is promised sometime in the spring, probably April, by cellist <a href="http://jwturner.com/">JW Turner</a> who recently premiered and performed again my solo cello piece The Empty Fist.</p>

<a class='pdf' href='http://parnasse.com/pdf/quarter_dollar_tones_for_solo_cello.pdf'>Quarter Dollar Tones for Solo Cello - Score</a>  </p>

<p>Last month I started a new nocturne for piano, but it got side-tracked by the bluesiness and off kilter beats which resulted in my new piano piece, <a class='mp3' href='http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Blues_Intermezzo_for_Piano.mp3'>Blues Intermezzo for Solo Piano</a>.  I'll get the score out shortly.</p>

<p>And I've been writing so fast these days, that I completely forgot about a Tango for Viola and Piano that I wrote just before we moved to Avignon, France.  It's got gospel-like material and grooves on top of the tango beats.</p>

<p>After the events in the Gulf of Mexico since late April, Elsie and I decided to leave the sub-tropical paradise of Sanibel Island and brave a trans-continental move to France.  It's been a dream of ours for years; Elsie has French citizenship, it was mainly a case of coming up with the nerve to risk the costs of the move, the costs of finding an apartment and the nightmare of navigating the different bureaucracies.  </p>

<p>We've now parked ourselves in an empty 15th century apartment in Avignon, France with 5 giant rooms, 12 foot ceilings and a view of a winding street from 3 floors up that reminds one of Diagon Alley in the Harry Potter movies.  The building we're in used to be the stables of the 15th century King Rene, his castle is around the corner.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avignon">Avignon</a> is a medieval walled city of incredible beauty and history.  It hosts the largest annual festival of theatre and multi-media spectacles in Europe every July and our quarter is surrounded by theatres.  We await the cross-oceanic delivery of our furniture, scores, books, cd's and paintings.  </p>

<p>I've just finished a 2nd tango for cello and piano and frankly, it's one of my best pieces yet, of any type.  It's got a fluidity of motion, which combined with a violent dramatic competition between the two instruments informed by the form of the tango itself, produces something I haven't achieved very often in my music in such a short piece.  I've already got a number of cellists interested in performing the piece!  </p>

<p>Kate&#345;ina Pavlíková premiered my piece for baritone sax and electronics <a href='http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Par-Dela_des_Eaux_Profondes_for_Baritone_Sax_and_Electronics.mp3'>Par-Delà des Eaux Profondes</a> last week outside of Prague in a preview concert with video and graphics by her husband, visual artist, <a href='http://www.vitpavlik.cz/index1.php?act=news'>Vít Vav&#345;inec Pavlík</a>.  Local TV there put together a profile of the preview concert and Pavlik.  It's in Czech, but you can hear my piece throughout the video.  I could only get it to play on my Vista laptop.  <a href='http://www.prachatice.cz/n_videotv_show.html?d=1004_02&vf=03vernisazvystavyasociacejihoceskychvytvarniku-highqualitywmv'>Video Profile of Vít Vav&#345;inec Pavlík and Kate&#345;ina's performance</a></p>

<p>Currently in the works is a big piece for 2 pianos in 19ET.   My plan is to have it playable either as one performer and a recording (either created earlier or supplied by me) or by 2 performers live.  I'm also writing a tango for viola and piano.  Also, if you downloaded my new electronic piece, <a href='http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-For_Erzulie_Dantor.mp3'>For Erzulie Dantor</a> last week, please do so again.  I idiotically put up the wrong file; that was a sketch!  Here's a little YouTube video I made of the piece.  I'm currently learning various software-based video production systems that I can use to make more than slideshows for my music.  <br />

<p>In my continuing series of short pieces for strings and winds and piano the latest one is a monstrous tango for cello and piano.  I've written it so that it should not be quite as difficult as my more ambitious chamber music, but still very much over the top.  And I'm going to be writing several tangos for various instruments and piano.  </p>

<p>Last January after the tragedy in Haiti, I contributed a track, For Erzulie Dantor to the <a href='http://sonicanta.bandcamp.com/album/new-music-haitian-relief'>New Music Haiti Relief CD</a>.  It's been 4 months now, so I'm releasing it for general consumption.  It's electronic, and uses material that I later developed in a different manner for my sax and electronics piece, <a href='http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Par-Dela_des_Eaux_Profondes_for_Baritone_Sax_and_Electronics.mp3'>Par-Delà des Eaux Profondes</a>.   </p>

<p>It's a strange, hellish kind of dance with quartertones and outrageous retro synth stylings.  </p>

<p><a class='mp3' href='http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-For_Erzulie_Dantor.mp3'>For Erzulie Dantor</a></p>

<p>On that note, the premiere of Par-Delà should be in a couple of months in Prague and I'm beginning development of some new electronic pieces for an album I'll probably release at <a href='jeffharrington.bandcamp.com'>BandCamp.com</a>.</p>

<p>Way, way back in the past, 1986 to be exact, I was a different composer, a composer obsessed with discovering a way to integrate 18th century harmonies with contemporary practices and rhythm.  The last piece I wrote in that style, and probably my most successful was a solo violin sonata in the classical style.  It's first movement is in 5/4, and the last movement is hysterically rhythmic in a way that classical music would never be.  I've finally gotten around to making recordings of them.  </p>

<p>I finally finished the septet I've been writing for Alexey Kurkdjian and his group Sphaera in São Paulo, Brazil.  It's for flute, clarinet, string quartet and bass and is called <a href="http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Seven_Walls_for_Septet.mp3">Seven Walls</a>.  It's a swirling mass of tunes and winds with some harsh barbaric climaxes and dark, empty, bluesy moments throughout.  </p>

<p>I've also been working on piano music here's my latest nocturne from the suite Oceana (as yet untitled).  It's my most barbaric nocturne yet, a driving mass of syncopated sound that is like the wind turbulently tearing at the trees in a gale.</p>

<p><a class='mp3' href='http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Nocturne_6_for_Piano.mp3'>Nocturne #6 for Piano</a></p>

<p>I've been working on the draft scores of my 6 nocturnes and the final scores should be available sometime next week.  </p>

<p>And I've started a series of short pieces for various combinations of strings, winds and piano as a project to have a set of pieces that are less difficult and easy to add to chamber music programs.  The first in this series is my <a href='http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Nocturne_for_Cello_and_Piano.mp3'>Nocturne for Cello and Piano</a>.  It's a dramatic, but slightly bluesy bit of darkness.  </p>

<p>I've just finished a new piece for baritone saxophone and electronics called Par-Delà des Eaux Profondes. It's totally nuts psycho-classicism, quartertones galore and harsh Led Zep/prog-rock climaxes.  The piece was written for the Czech sax player, <a href="http://www.katerinapavlikova.cz/?s=bio&l=en&d=">Kate&#345;ina Pavlíková</a> and she plans on touring with it in a video/interactive graphics setting created by her visual artist husband.  I'm definitely going to be cutting a bit here and there and polishing up the mix but this is pretty much how it's going to sound.</p>

<p>I recently contributed a track and helped promote a great project to help the folks of Haiti in their time of crisis, <a href="http://sonicanta.bandcamp.com/album/new-music-haitian-relief">New Music Haitian Relief</a>.  The short electronic piece I created was called For Erzulie Dantor and you can preview it <a href="http://sonicanta.bandcamp.com/track/jeff-harrington-for-erzulie-dantor">here.</a>  It's a great project and we've already raised close to a thousand dollars so please consider picking it up if you like the track(s).  </p>

<p>Composer and Pianist <a href="http://www.aronkallay.com/">Aron Kallay</a> has informed me he'll be premiering my 3rd Piano Prelude in 19-ET at MicroFest 2010 in Los Angeles on April 24th.  This will be the first time one of my microtonal compositions has ever been played live!  </p>

<p>I'm currently in the process of writing a big new septet for the Brazilian group, Sphaera and it's conductor, Alexey Kurkdijan.  It'll be scored for flute, clarinet, strinq quartet and bass and will likely be premiered at Festival Musica Nova 2010 (New Music Festival 2010) in Sao Paolo!  </p>

<p>Also, new piano nocturnes are on their way and I've been proofing the scores of the first 5.  I'll be uploading final scores for these works shortly.  <a href="http://www.ahlert-schwab.de/">Duo Ahlert & Schwab</a> are in the process of preparing for the premiere and recording of <a href="http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Bidon_Cinque_for_Mandolin_and_Guitar.mp3" class="mp3">Bidon Cinque for Mandolin and Guitar</a>.

<p><br />
I've now completed 5 piano nocturnes which will be released in a set called Oceana.  Each one is titled based on inspirations I've found on the island.  </p>

<p>My first one, The Song of the Waves on the Shells, is a very static pasacaglia of sorts, kind of a Le Gibet meets Radiohead but with a little Feldman.  <br />

<a class='pdf' href='http://parnasse.com/pdf/nocturne_for_piano_1.pdf'>Nocturne #1 - The Song of the Waves on the Shells - Draft Score</a> </p>

<p>The second one is based around a quiet repeated note motive and is static and dark.  <br />

<a class='pdf' href='http://parnasse.com/pdf/nocturne_for_piano_2.pdf'>Nocturne #2 - Stars Reflected in the Pitch Black Sea - Draft Score</a> </p>

<p>The third one is very pianistic and ecstatic.  <br />

<p>The fourth one is foreboding, gloomy and constantly switching between major and minor modes.  <br />

<p>The fifth one is one of my most ecstatic pieces yet.  It starts off slow and brooding and develops a Middle Eastern riff which slowly takes over until it becomes Lisztian mystical mayhem.  <br />
<a class='mp3' href='http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Nocturne_5_for_Piano.mp3'>Nocturne #5 - Untitled - Recording</a><br />
<a class='pdf' href='http://parnasse.com/pdf/nocturne_for_piano_5.pdf'>Nocturne #5 - Untitled  - Draft Score</a> </p>

<p><a href='http://www.ahlert-schwab.de/deu/index.php'>Duo Ahlert und Schwab</a> have informed me that Naxos will be release a new recording of theirs next year which will have a recording of the new piece I wrote for them, <a class='mp3' href='http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Bidon_Cinque_for_Mandolin_and_Guitar.mp3'>Bidon Cinque</a>!  This is very important for me, because that piece represented a true breakthrough in my attempt to create a new more melodically romantic style within the framework of my propulsive textures.  </p>

<p>I've written my first in a set of nocturnes for piano.  It consists of layers of quiet sounds building up like waves crashing on rocks until it becomes symphonic in scope. It's simultaneously one of the most static and one of the most active pieces I've ever written. Elsie described it as something like Le Gibet plus Radiohead. The score will be available sometime next week.</p>

<p>This summer was very productive for me; the results being a big piece for cello and piano, a solo guitar piece written for the fabulous Philippe Bertaud, and a piece for flute and guitar.  </p>

<p>Undertow, is my new piece for cello and piano.  It's got a monstrous bluesy beginning which pushes the piece into alternating hyper-rhythmic sections with impressionistic/romantic sections.  The score and parts are finished and available for download.  </p>

<p>My new solo guitar piece is probably one of the most harmonically beautiful pieces I've written, using an approach which tries to combine modern chromatic Radiohead-ish harmonies with Baroque and my usual modal harmonies.  The score is still being tweaked a bit for playability.  </p>

<p>My new piece for flute and guitar continues the musical impressionism and harmonic lushness of the previous two pieces.  It's called Sombras y Luces de La Selva for Flute and Guitar.  The score and parts are finished and available for download.  </p>

<p>I've finished a piece commissioned by Brian Kauth for his group, the Traverser Saxophone Quartet.  It's my most radical piece since I stopped writing complex atonal music back in the 80's, full of incredibly wrong notes that are intended to sound incredibly right.  There are quartertones throughout the piece serving both as coloristic and as harmonic devices. The piece, also captures something of the rainy mangrove jungle we live in the middle of down here on Sanibel Island.  When we were looking for a title, last night, it's swampiness reminded us of New Orleans and their Haitian voodoo traditions, thus the name, in its intentionally illiterate spelling, Grigri.  </p>

<p>Nigel Keay informs me that the premiere of my String Quartet #5 was a great success and a studio recording should be available shortly.  Please email me if you'd like to hear the concert recording.  </p>

<p>And the Iranian conductor, Keyvan Yahya, surprisingly wrote me the day after my Paris premiere to tell me that my 2nd Symphony was premiered that Thursday night in Tehran too!  That was some Thursday!  Maestro Yahya promises me a recording and a video of the performance.  </p>

<p>In the works is a new sax quartet I'm writing for Brian Kauth.  It's going to have lots of quartertones and be a real maelstrom of funk and crazed wind gestures.  Here's a snippet of the beginning:</p>

<p>April 30 at the Fondation des Etats-Unis, my fifth string quartet will be premiered in Paris by the Quatuor de l'Orchestre 2021.  </p>

<p>String Quartet #5 is a transcription/extension of my string trio, Tetra-Mnemosyne VII.  I'm told that a studio recording is also in the works and I'll put this up as soon as possible!  </p>

<p>Program Notes:</i><br />
My String Quartet #5 is a transcription and a musical extension of my seventh string trio, written in early 2001. My music, for the few years before that, had been becoming increasingly complex and this piece was an attempt, to write in a simpler and more directly emotional style. I had been seriously listening to the middle string quartets of Beethoven for several months, and that listening informed the composition of the piece harmonically, texturally, and in the approach to the climax. The great 8th string quartet of Shostakovich was also a model in my attempt to have simple materials drive a piece, not in a naive folkloric or utopian way, but in a manner that was new in how it continually digested its materials, reusing them in a single movement. There are continuous disruptive interruptions that cause the listener to rethink the musical materials and these are accomplished not in modernist or ironic modalities but through the innate dramatic possibilities of the musical materials. The materials, were chosen, in fact, to be explodable, and reconfigurable in multiple ways. Many of the materials are influenced by Middle Eastern melodies, and additionally, some themes were directly influenced by recent American heavy metal tunes. These melodic influences are intentionally subtle and chosen for their musical potential and are not intended to promote any type of political or cultural reading. </i></p>

<p>The title came from my spouse, Elsie, who told me about a mythical (but real) place in the Sahara desert of Algeria. It's on a stretch of road that is so desolate that there's a single oil drum there which is kept full of oil for stranded travellers. Bidon Cinque means Oil Can 5 - here's a picture of it (with a passing camel caravan).</p>

<p>I've finished my first microtonal piece using conventional instruments!  It's for soprano sax and piano and was commissioned by the brilliant young saxophonist, Brian Kauth.  The piano part plays no microtones, but I was astonished to hear it seem to, because of the way the sax's quartertones resonate with the chords.  It's called Dans le Délire de l'Inutile; the title is from a poem by the French surrealist poet Robert Desnos.  </p>

<p>I'll have draft scores up shortly once I get back some breathing phrases from Brian.  If you really want to see it, drop me a line.  </p>

<p>And today, I've finished my second in the series of Celestographs, Celestograph II.  It's an almost orchestral electronic composition, again, using the Wendy Carlos harmonic tuning.  I used Csound for post-processing and shaping of the final version and my Yamaha TG77 for the dry recording.  The sounds were inspired by Vangelis' soundtrack to Blade Runner - I think you'll be able to hear the influences.  </p>

It's just damn near impossible for first novel's to be published now and when it is - they receive no promotion.  Then when they are published if they don't sell like crazy, they're taken off the market and the author loses rights to have them re-published.  It's just crazy.  We decided to go DIY.  

<p><a href='http://parnasse.com/pdf/In_Over_Her_Head_by_Elsie_Russell.pdf'>In Over Her Head - Free Download Plus Front Cover</a></p>

<p>If you like the book, you can buy it at <a href='http://www.lulu.com/content/2714656'>Lulu.com</a> and in about 6 weeks at Amazon.  After reading several articles about this new download literature environment, and one in particular by <a href='http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2008/07/results-of-free.html'>Neil Gaiman</a> we decided to give it away for free, with the front cover and hope people like it enough to buy it.  I've read it 10 times now and I couldn't put it down every time I read it.  Which is pretty weird.  But of course, I'm biased.  But not really that much...haha!  </p>

<p><i>Synopsis:<br />
The debut of Penny Bell's's groundbreaking musical composition—featuring the use of mysterious extremely low frequency waves—takes a startling and tragic turn when several concert-goers die in their seats during the performance. The once-bright horizons of Penny's career collapse, and she retreats to a dank Soho basement apartment lit only by the glow of computer monitors and electronic synthesizer displays. There, using herself as a guinea pig, she sets out to unlock the secrets of her beautiful and deadly symphonies. But a series of strange coincidences intrude upon her solitary quest. Her apartment is ransacked. Her neighbor, the ethereal erotic performance artist Ulla Nova, disappears after her studio is broken into. And then Ulla's charming and damaged young choreographer appears, and sweeps Penny off to Europe to search for the diva, plunging Penny into a seedy and unfamiliar world of jet set artists and international intrigue.<br />
</i></p>

<p>And I designed the cover.  I'm sure some of you guys recognized my crazy graphics!  </p>

<p>Here's a brief bio of the author:</p>

<p>Elsie Russell's bohemian upbringing with artist parents in Europe and the states provided much of the material for this novel. Her mother Andrée, a Beaux Arts Graduate, frequented the postwar Paris avant-garde art scene with her photographer brother Robert Déscharnes where she met Alfred Russell, then a rising star abstract expressionist painter, soon married him and had Elsie. Robert Déscharnes went on to become famous for his art books and life-long friendship and collaboration with Salvador Dalí. From the start she was dragged around with the rolled up canvases until deposited for high school in Rome at St. Stephen's, a prep school warehouse for jet set kids where she got a great education with her disaffected aristocratic classmates. Summers were often in Cadaquès, Spain, with her cousins and Dalí and his colorful entourage. Later, while struggling in New York as a painter, she met her spouse Jeff Harrington, Juilliard trained composer and software architect, exposing her to yet another world of dazzling misfits.

Back from the dead, 
<a href="http://netnewmusic.ning.com">NetNewMusic</a>, possibly the first music website on the web, and certainly the first new music website on the web is back as a complete social network.  

<p><a href="http://netnewmusic.ning.com">NetNewMusic</a></p>

<p>We (that is me and the other inmates) offer the new music world a place to blog, share music and videos, set up their own sub-groups and forums.  I'm piping the traffic from the old site directly into the new network, and it's growing extremely fast.  Almost a hundred full blown members in the first 24 hours.

Using leftover material from my new <a class='mp3' href='http://www.jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Brass_Quintet.mp3'>brass quintet</a> I put together my most massive chamber piece evah!  <a class='mp3' href='http://www.jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Tamiami_Heat_for_Brass_Quintet_Saxes_Piano_and_Bass.mp3'>Tamiami Heat for Brass Quintet, Saxes, Piano and Bass</a>.  A nonet, with a super funky heart and percussive and resonant brass, wind and piano writing.  It reminds me of my bassoon piece, <a class='mp3' href='http://www.jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Gnomos_for_Flute_Bassoon_and_Piano.mp3'>Gnomos </a> because of its low down dirty south feeling.  

<p>The title comes from a conversation I had with a semi-pro cyclist who was giving me a ride in his truck a couple of weeks ago to pick up Elsie who'd gotten a flat tire in the middle of the island.  He was describing a ride across the Everglades to surprise his wife, who was attending a conference in Miami.  He said, once he ran out of water about half way through the ride and had decided to commit to finishing the ride, that it was all a blur, a heat stroke of haziness.  When we were looking for a title, that image returned, because of the intense heat wave trills throughout much of the piece.  The <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamiami_Trail'>Tamiami Trail</a> is the famous 2 lane road that goes across the Everglades from Fort Myers (near Sanibel) to Miami, through alligator-infested swamps.  </p>

<p>I'm going to send it out to publishers, this and my new brass quintet, so if you'd like a copy, email me and I'll get one out to you for perusal purposes.  The score is also for sale at <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/3445128">Lulu.com</a> where I'm slowly putting all my scores up (and designing crazy covers for each one) so that people can buy them printed and bound.  </p>

<p>Now onto work for Sphaera's septet.  I plan to make it a similar type of swirling chaotic funk.  </p>

<p>Oh, and that new pic of me up there, is in front of the huge strangler fig tree in our parking lot backyard.  Elsie took it a few weeks ago.<br />

	<h3 class="title">New Piece - Brass Quintet and Some Revisions and Arrangements</h3>

	<p>I've finished my new brass quintet and am proofing the score and parts.  It's a piece that's a little bit like my 4th string quartet arrangement for sax quartet, <a class='mp3' href='http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Spirale_dArco_for_Saxophone_Quartet.mp3'>Spirale d'Arco</a> in its breadth and generous emotional spaciousness.

<p>The piece for flute and vibraphone I wrote for <a href="http://dueeast.net">Due East</a> has undergone a few revisions, some at their suggestion.  In particular, the ending is now a huge virtuoso splash!  They've played it twice now, I'm hoping for another performance this year.  <br />

<p>I've arranged my piece Irae for Violin, Viola and Contrabass for the same grouping but with clarinet instead of viola at the request of conductor/violinist Alexey Kurkdijan who works out of São Paulo.  I've made a new realization and the new score and parts are available too.  I really like it; it seems much more disturbed and bizarre than the original arrangement.  Rehearsals have started and the premiere of this arrangement should be July 26th in São Paulo!  </p>

	<p>I've written another short brass fanfare for large brass ensemble.  It's almost 2 minutes long and is basically a gigantic blast.  I'm gearing up to write much more brass and wind music; at the moment I am starting work on a brass quintet.  The score and parts for the fanfare are available upon request for now.  </p>

<p>More exciting news - I've been commissioned by Alexey Kurkdjian, conductor of the Sphaera Ensemble, to write a septet for flute, oboe, clarinet, violin, cello, contrabass and piano.  They're also working on my nonet at the moment for a possible performance later this year.  </p>

Big news!  We moved to a tropical desert island off the west coast of Florida in December after I was laid off from my 6 figure computer programming job in January.   It's completely bike-centric, ecologically-minded and 75% bird sanctuary/mangrove swamp. The rest is housing for extremely rich people, including a lot of celebrities. </p>

<p>The island is famous for some of the most beautiful beaches and the best sea-shelling in the Western Hemisphere. Over 1500 different types of shells. There are birds everywhere. Loggerhead sea turtles nest on the beach. We have a red-shouldered hawk living in the jungle behind the parking lot. There's an osprey nest in our backyard! We downsized so we can live without working off of our savings over the past 11 years and I can just work on music. I can always do a little freelance work if that doesn't work out. Plus there are plenty of tourist t-shirt shops I could get a cashier's job at!  Haha...  </p>

<p>We're renting a tiny apartment in the back of a high-end strip mall with a fossil shell parking lot as our front yard and it's fantastic! I ride my bike to a deserted tropical beach every day and walk for about 2 hours and then come back and have lunch and get to work on my music. I'm not that worried about not being in NYC for my career because most of my music performances are outside NY and are web-connected.</p>

<p>So far I've composed two new pieces, gotten 4 scores polished and have started a new one... so I think it's going to work. Main risk was the $$$ and getting our own health insurance but things are looking pretty good. Got the health insurance going last week. Freakin' nightmare... And we've stopped eating out and got a bread machine to save more $$$.</p>

<p>Anyways... I'd rather live off of absolutely nothing than work another year in a cubicle farm with no natural light in NYC with crazy people!  </p>

	<h3 class="title">New Violin Sonata and New Electronic Piece - Celestograph I</h3>

	<p>I've finished a new violin sonata, my 4th, and have uploaded a realization.  It's a bit more poetic, a bit less bombastic than the 3rd but full of energy and harmonies.  </p>

<p>And yesterday I finished my first full length electronic piece in 5 years!  It's called <a class='mp3' href='http://www.jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/celestographs/Jeff-Harrington-Celestograph_I.mp3'>Celestograph I</a> and will be part of a series of pieces called hmmm... Celestographs!  The piece uses the Wendy Carlos harmonic series tuning and is a celestially inspired processional.  The title comes from a photographic series by August Strindberg in which he made photographs directly exposed to the night sky, without a lens.  He believed the lens warped the direct expression of the stars.  </p>

<p>Here's an article about his work <a href='http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/3/celesographs.php'>The Celestographs of August Strindberg</a></p>

	<p>I've finally got a chance to get the score of my monumental string trio (if there can be such a thing) Tetra-Mnemosyne V.  It's my favorite of the 7 pieces and is as dark and soulful as I can get.  Can't believe I wrote it 9 years ago!  Yikes!  I'd better get off my ass with the other ones... still have to do I, II, III and VI.  I wrote them at a time when I was really stressed at work (the launch of the dot bomb enhanced video system, HyperTV, barely sleeping for 3 weeks at a time), and decided to focus on one genre over a period of 2 years.  It was a very productive time, but a very tiring time too.  Most of my piano preludes come from the same period.  </p>

	<p>My spouse <a href="http://parnasse.com/erlist.htm">Elsie Russell's</a> first novel about a brilliant young composer whose experimental music accidentally kills several audience members was selected as one of the Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award semi-finalists!   It's a farce/thriller/romance...</p>

<p>You can read an excerpt here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00126597U">In Over her Head</a></p>

<p>Elsie Russell Speaks About In Over Her Head - Official ABNA Entrant:<br />
The debut of Penny Bell's musical composition, featuring the use of mysterious extremely low frequency waves takes a tragic turn when several concert-goers die in their seats during the performance. The once-bright horizons of Penny's career collapse, and she retreats to a dank Soho basement apartment lit only by the glow of computer monitors and electronic displays. There, using herself as a guinea pig, she sets out to unlock the secrets of her beautiful and deadly symphonies. A series of strange coincidences intrude upon her solitary quest. Her neighbor, the erotic performance artist Ula Nova, disappears after her studio is broken into. And then Ula's charming and damaged young choreographer appears, and sweeps Penny off to Europe to search for the diva, plunging Penny into a seedy and unfamiliar world of jet set artists and international intrigue where the threads of every encounter always seem to lead back to those ELF waves and their pint-sized progenitor.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.duoconsensus.de/'>Duo Consensus</a>, a group out of Weimar, Germany has written me telling me that they'll be performing Erg (again?) soon.  They performed it in Berlin earlier last year, apparently.   The score and parts for Erg are available through <a href="http://www.ahlert-schwab.de/eng_corvus/index.php">Edition Corvus</a>.</p>

	<p>My third violin sonata is now finished and it's a doozy.  It's kind of a <a class='mp3' href="http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-DeltaBandResonator_for_Piano.mp3">DeltaBandResonator</a> for violin and piano with its folkiness but has even more bombast and a surprising amount of delicacy.

	<p><a class = 'mp3' href='http://www.jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Surge_for_Disklavier.mp3'>Surge for Disklavier</a> will receive its world premiere at the amazing <a href="http://artsaha.org/?page_id=5">ARTSaha! Festival</a> tonight in Omaha, Nebraska.  It's on a program with a disklavier realization of George Antheil's Ballet Mécanique, pieces by Joseph Drew (of <a href="http://www.analogartsensemble.net/">Analog Ensemble</a>, <a href="http://www.analogartsensemble.net/blog.html">ANAblog</a> fame), Kyle Gann, Nancarrow and Lamonte Young, among others.  Big props to <a href="http://zenphstudios.com/">Anatoly Larkin</a> for patiently troubleshooting a piece that I wrote away from the Disklavier around a 6 piano concept and making it work.  It took me hours of perl scripting and getting feedback from Anatoly while practially destroying several Disklaviers to get to this point.  Thanks Anatoly!  </p>

<p>I'm presently working on a new Violin Sonata, which will be the third piece for violin and piano I've written in the past few years.  It is going to be very intense and lyrical and hopefully as popular as my 2nd violin sonata.  </p>

<p>I've finished the piece for <a href="http://dueeast.net">Due East</a> Valley Spirit and Wind Master for Flute and Vibraphone.

	<p>I've finished the Disklavier piece I was writing for the <a href="http://artsaha.org">ARTSaha! Festival</a>.  It'll be 'premiered' sometime during the festival. September 4 - 10  in Omaha, Nebraska.  </p>

<p>It's my densest piece yet and is in truth a virtuoso 6 piano composition of around 7 minutes long.   The piece was inspired not only by obvious recent historical events but by the fact that the piece constantly surges though huge densities forcing gospel-inspired riffing to be overwhelmed by massive Arabic-influenced chords.  </p>

	<h3 class="title">New Sonatina for Violin and Piano</h3>

	<p>A young Dutch violinist wrote me a few weeks ago suggesting I write her and her pianist friend a piano piece.  I've been in the violin writing mode for the past month so I said sure.  I wrote it this weekend, and it incorporates a few new things for me, notably a more chromatic harmonic palette inspired by some experiments I did this summer with Radiohead-like harmonies.  The material was rather simple, and frankly, I'd practically forgotten about it!  Anyways, I think it's going to be a fun piece and is about 6 1/2 minutes long.  It's definitely written for intermediate level violinists and pianists - although my rhythms are admittedly always syncopated and a bit problematic because of that.  </p>

	<h3 class="title">New Sonata for Violin and Piano #2</h3>

	<p>After writing the short solo violin piece for Piotr I was left with a bit of material and this piece just miraculously came together.  It's folky and barbaric and full of contrasts - and probably one of my best pieces from this year.  I finished it yesterday, so this will be the last piece of 2006.  </p>

	<p>I've written a 3 minute solo violin piece for brilliant composer/violinist <a href="http://www.verynewmusic.com/violinist.html">Piotr Szewczyk's</a> project, <a href="http://www.verynewmusic.com/violin_futura_1.html">ViolinFutura</a>.  The project aims to promote contemporary music through exciting and innovative short solo violin pieces.  </p>

<p>My piece is <a href="http://parnasse.com/pdf/puce.pdf">Puce for Solo Violin</a>, an eccentric jumpy (Puce means 'flea' in Fre3nch) mashup of divergent soloist impulses.  Piotr plans to put up video and audio of his repeat performances of this series.  Should be an extremely exciting project and I'm honored to be included with the big names already participating.   </p>

	<p>Piano preludes 15 and 19 are now available as Acrobat scores.  Number 15 is a pounding almost rock-like piece, exploring just how dissonant an almost white-note composition can be:</p>

	<h3 class="title">Three Concerts and Piano Preludes 10, 11, 13 Scores Available</h3>

	<p>This week I had the honor of receiving 5 performances of my music in a 36 hour period - all in different parts of the world.  <a href="http://duo46.com">Duo 46</a> premiered L'Ecume des Temps in Cincinatti the same night that <a href="http://www.omicronarts.com/html/beliavsky1.htm">Daniel Beliavsky</a> gave the New York premiere of Piano Preludes 6, 7 and 8 at the <a href="http://sequenza21.com">Sequenza21</a> Concert to rousing applause.  <a href="http://www.ahlert-schwab.de/">Duo Ahlert und Schwab</a> performed Cassotis for Mandolin and Guitar the night before.  So it's been an exciting week!</p>

<p>Because of recent interest in my piano music, I spent most of the Thanksgiving vacation polishing the scores to my piano preludes.  I'd written many of them at a time when my job required a lot of late nights and rather than slow down the compositional process I decided to postpone the output of the scores.  Preludes 10, 11 and 13 are now available and I made new realizations of them to boot.  </p>

<p>Number 10 and 11 are invention like preludes and were intended to be part of a suite of pieces for less than virtuoso performers.  <br />

<p>Number 13 is a crazy virtuoistic piece, stopping and starting and using Caribbean rhythms ecstatictally throughout.  It's also one of the longer preludes and harkens forward to the ambitious 16, 17 and 18.  </p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://www.omicronarts.com/html/beliavsky1.htm">Daniel Beliavsky</a> found a few mistakes in the score to Piano Prelude 7 and those have now been corrected.  The tempi indication were straight quarter notes instead of dotted quarter notes.  Although the tempi were accurate, they were misleading.  </p>

<p>And at the suggestion of composer/pianist <a href="http://brucestarkmusic.com">Bruce Stark</a> I've made a new recording of my Piano Sonata #3 which is slowed down and possibly not quite so intimidatingly impossible in sound.  </p>

	<h3 class="title">New Realization of Piano Sonata #3</h3>

	<p>I've made a brand new realization of my new piano sonata, and it's really pretty incredibly lifelike (if I do say so myself).  I used an 80MB Steinway piano soundfont and wrote a custom perl script to slightly randomize the velocities of the file.  The results are one of the best simulations of piano playing I've produced.   </p>

	<h3 class="title">New Piece - Piano Sonata #3</h3>

	<p>I've finished my first big piano piece since DeltaBandResonator!  It's a real monster of a piece, employing new Lisztian effects, chromatic scales and lots of dissonances which seemingly create a microtonal musical environment similar to <a class='mp3' href='http://www.jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington_Marteau-pilon_Epouvantable_Implacable_for_Piano_and_Amplified_Harpsichord.mp3'>Marteau-Pilon</a>.  It also shares many of the huge pounding effects and primitivist inclinations of that last piece.  </p>

<p>While I'm still searching for a title for it, I decided not to delay putting the piece up for lack of a creative title and instead lump <a class='mp3' href='http://www.jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-BlueStrider_for_Piano.mp3'>BlueStrider</a>, <a class='mp3' href='http://www.jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-DeltaBandResonator_for_Piano.mp3'>DeltaBandResonator</a> and this piece together as Sonatas - meaning large piano pieces.  </p>

	<h3 class="title">New Piece - Marteau-pilon Épouvantable-Implacable for Piano and Amplified Harpsichord</h3>

	<p>I've just finished a new piece which came together very quickly for piano and amplified harpsichord.  The grouping worked very well for me, as is obvious, by how quickly I wrote the piece, and frankly, how exciting the piece became in the process.  It's one of my most visceral and belligerent pieces yet, something like my  Acid Bach on steroids, or BlueStrider, but with more timbral color and even more oomph.  The piece is extremely barbaric, with evocations of late 80's and early 90's industrial music and recent death metal in its rhythms and use of pounding bass.  It's also inspired to a certain degree by the Russian Futurists, Mossolov in particular but with a very new approach to this type of primitivism/barbarism.  By the constant use of chromatic clusters, I also approach the bizarre tonalities of my microtonal music.  </p>

<p>While I was in Paris, violinist Erik Carlson and cellist Claire Bryant of the <a href="http://nyme.org">New York Miniaturist Ensemble</a> premiered a set of 3 pieces at the Juillaird School, May 15th, <a class='pdf' href="http://parnasse.com/pdf/tre_composizioni_di_cento_note_per_il_violino_ed_il_violoncello-score.pdf">Tre composizioni di cento note per il violino ed il violoncello</a>.  I'm told the premiere was a great success.  This July and August we should see a repeat of that performance and the premiere of a set of solo violin pieces, <a href="http://parnasse.com/pdf/cinque_compositioni_per_solo_violino.pdf">Cinque composizioni di cento note per il violino solo</a>.</p>

<p>Currently on my composing plate:</p>

<p>1.  Beginning work on a new piece for string orchestra.<br />
2.  Continuing work for a new string quartet.  (And I have no idea what number it is now, so I'll probably call it #5).<br />
3.  More pieces for the <a href="http://nyme.org">New York Miniaturist Ensemble</a>.  Possibly a few pieces for string quartet.<br />
4.  Finishing up the score and parts for my nonet and starting to shop it around for a performance.  <br />
5.  Solo pieces for guitar and mandolin for <a href="http://www.ahlert-schwab.de/">Duo Ahlert und Schwab</a>, probably a suite for each instrument, my recent experience with composing miniatures has revived my interest in short pieces.  <br />
5.  Beginning work on a new piano trio.  </p>

	<h3 class="title">Nonet for Woodwind Quintet and String Quartet Finished</h3>

	<p>I've finished the most ambitious piece I've written in years, my new nonet.  It's also probably the densest and richest in material composition I've ever written.  Basically a piece for 9 soloists, it could be called a Chamber Concerto because of its consistent soloist flair.  Full of minimalist conventions (so I'm told - it's actually more of a Ravellian flavor, but the minimalist folks will dig it) and Brucknerian climaxes, the piece flows through a territory partially explored in my Anamorphosis for String Quartet in how the strings often play cross rhythms which produce their own melodies.  I'll probably be tweaking the piece here and there and am considering adding a brief pause before the blow up at the end.  </p>

	<h3 class="title">Betwyxt for Flute and Two Violins Score Available</h3>

	<p>Betwyxt for Flute and 2 Violins, my 100 note miniature, written and premiered last night by <a href="http://nyme.org">The New York Miniaturist Ensemble</a> is available for downoad now as a PDF score.  It was exciting to meet the ensemble, hear all the pieces, and be a part of this thought-provoking experiment in new music concertizing.  The pieces ranged from the Kurtag-esque violent atonal, to Feldmanish meditations and minimalist pieces that obviously used extended definitions of what a 'note' was (as the ensemble allows).  </p>

<p>I'll have more miniatures performed in their upcoming concerts.  It's just a lot of fun to see what can be done in such a small place and a good way to cannibalize all the thousands of measures I have of material that ends up going into the bit bucket.  Thanks to Erik Carlson et al, for a fantastic evening and opportunity to hear music.  </p>

	<h3 class="title">New Spirale d'Arco Arranged for Saxophone Quartet and Premiere of Betwyxt for Flute and 2 Violins</h3>

	<p>While in the middle of composing a saxophone quartet, I spent a little time listening to how some of my chamber music sounded through the lens of a sax quartet and became very intrigued and then obsessed with how my <a href="http://www.jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Spirale_dArco_for_String_Quartet.mp3">4th String Quartet, Spirale d'Arco</a> sounded as one.  As a result, in the past 48 hours I've dedicated myself to an arrangement of that piece for that ensemble and I think the results are fantastic.  The tunes and fiddling of the piece, have become transposed into a funky and wonderful type of saxophone energy.  </p>

It's a very Feldmanesque 100 note composition, as is the group's wont.  I'll put the score and parts up, after the premiere.  </p>

<p>Also, my new nonet for WW5 and SQ is coming along nicely.  While I had been improving my contrapuntal expert system (in hopes of producing more results) I'm focussing now on the more coloristic materials for this piece.  Much of the material will harken back to the complex, polyrhythmic impressionisms of Anamorphosis, my 3rd String Quartet.  </p>

	<h3 class="title">Looking at 2006</h3>

	<p>This year could be a really interesting musical year for me.  Highlights (in no particular order) are the premiere and recording and several performances of <a class='mp3' href='http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/Jeff-Harrington-Cassotis_for_Mandolin_and_Guitar.mp3'>Cassotis for Mandolin and Guitar</a> by <a href="http://www.ahlert-schwab.de/eng/index.php">Duo Ahlert and Schwab</a>, a premiere and possible recording of my horn trio, the finished recording of TetraMnemosyne VII, and the premiere (finally!) of my woodwind quintet, Morph-Fantasia, at a new music festival in Mississippi.  I'm writing a big piece for chamber orchestra ala Chawswizzler for WW5 and SQ, a new solo cello piece (requested by a prominent cellist) and a few electronic music pieces ala Espace.  And I've got some interest in Chawswizzler also, who knows?  On the programming web front, <a href="http://cacophonous.org">Cacophonous.org</a> continues to grow and my blog, <a href="http://beepsnort.org">beepSNORT</a> has more information about the thoughts behind it.  Maybe all these years of hard work will pay off!  </p>

<p>The draft score to my clarinet trio has been updated.  Parts are available to interested parties.  </p>

	<p>The draft score and a synthetic realization are now available for my new trio for clarinet, violin and piano.  This piece, the first piece I've written since the whole Katrina nightmare, reflects a more sombre and grotesque style of expression with lots of glissandi and morbid pianisms.  Thirteen minutes in length, it continues the series of pieces begun with the violin sonata which attempts to create an orchestral effect with microscopic forces.  </p>

<p>Also, I've just about finished a new piece for Clarinet, Violin and Piano.  A synthesized version should be up this weekend.  It's a bold new step for me, lots of glissandi and a very disturbing tone in general; less beliggerent, more color.  My first piece since Katrina and an homage of sorts to the horrors that recently hit New Orleans.  </p>

<p>Mr. <a href="http://webjay.org">Webjay</a> and all around new web media guru <a href="http://gonze.com">Lucas Gonze</a> also proclaimed it to be <a href="http://gonze.com/weblog/story/jeffh">Jeff Harrington Day</a>.  Thanks Lucas!    </p>

	<p>This is a very close to final draft of the score to my new Horn Trio:</p>

<p>This score and my last piece, the Violin Sonata represent to me a big breakthrough in my approach to drama, especially with regards to the use of inherent instrumental techniques as driving forces.  The Horn Trio has a symphonic quality I haven't attempted since my symphonies.  </p>

	<h3 class="title">Revelations in Tuning</h3>

	<p>I spent most of the morning, coding up a little program in Java to write SYSEX tuning files to my old Yamaha TG77.  It was a bit of a pain, because it involved a lot of 'bit-twiddling' which Java programmers just don't do that much of these days, thankfully.  Here's the source if anybody wants it, it's not commented and is a bit rough but it works.  It takes a text file with 128 values and spits out a MIDI Sysex file which can then be transmitted to your Yamaha TG77, SY77 or SY99.   Feel free to take, steal, not give me credit... whatever.   It doesn't use the Javax MIDI classes, cuz I just couldn't get them to do the arbitrary data I needed for a tuning dump.  </p>

<p><a href="http://parnasse.com/code/TG77Tune.java">TG77Tune.java</a></p>

<p>The good news after all that pain, is that I can now realize <a href="http://michaelharrison.com">Michael Harrison</a>'s Revelation tuning.  A microtonally modified Just Intonation tuning that uses the black keys to produce beats by using them as 'comma' tones.  Tones, almost in tune with the note below them, but in tune in a Just way to the other black notes.  </p>

<p>Here's a little improv I did this afternoon on my TG77 using that tuning.  It produces heavenly beats and pulses.  I'll probably write a few piano pieces with it next.</p>

<p>A word about the lack of a cool title.  We searched and searched for something enigmatic and varied in its meaning that could resonate with this piece, but failed.  There was just something about the way in which the music seems to forever not adopt a <i>manner</i> which was conducive to the discovery of a name.  Thus the ridiculously old-fashioned moniker, Sonata.  There will probably be more.  What I've discovered in the last few pieces, Cassotis and this one, is a  way to extend my formal scale and this has produced an un-cool-nameable music.  </p>

	<h3 class="title">Studio Recording of Oneiromancer for Flute, Viola, and Harp Available</h3>

	<p>A remarkably vibrant and exciting recording of my piece Oneiromancer for Flute, Viola, and Harp (written in 1996) is available for download.   The recording was made in Paris by New Zealand composer/violist Nigel Keay, flutist Eric Kohenoff and Harpist Alix Couillaud last month.  Oneiromancer (which means 'someone who divines through the interpretation of dreams') uses African-American inspired material to create an atmosphere suggestive of a ritual dance.  The very syncopated and rhythmically driving material is interpreted through the piece in a series of dream-like dance collages and canons, becoming an Oneiromancer itself in the process.  </p>

	<p>I've just finished a new violin sonata of 15:30 minutes length.  It's a more direct, emotionally driven piece with a more poetic use of the piano than is usual for me.  Tunes are inspired by middle eastern and African American influences.  Its dramatically abstract nature made me go for an unusually traditional title .  </p>

<p>"Different Light, Same Window" is a collection of work by the Seattle composer Steve Layton, all of it realized in 2004. In addition to his own compositions, Layton has included a performance of the 2003 Beethoven-meets-Bayou piano epic "DeltaBandresonator" by Brooklyn composer Jeff Harrington (b.1955).</p>

<p>The music is unafraid of unsual forms and biting harmony, yet there is always a strong connection with all that's gone before; a sense of that the dead never really die, but are just us (and we them) displaced by a few years.</p>

<p>Every part of the performances and recording are all realized directly by Layton himself, using a technique that makes score, performance and recording a single entity.</p>

<p>Steve Layton (ASCAP) was born in 1956 in Pasco, Washington. Long working out of Seattle, his music is played and listened to worldwide, and has often been used in film, video and dance.</p>

<a href='http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/espace''>Espace</a>, my 2nd complete electronic album, has been released gratis and online.  A collection of slow, sometimes brooding works, often employing granular resynthesis and time warping of timbres.  Espace features orchestra time-warping (Eroica Spettrale, Kin Hin) and Wendy Carlos glass harmonica organs (Lamentation Siderales and Lachrimae Crystallinum).  The popular piece, Espace des Cloches, for Csound, uses a rapturous DX7-derived gong that resonates into deep space.   AgnusDeiWave uses formant synthesis/resynthesis of gregorian chant to create a choral space of lament.   High Noon uses a physically modelled shakuhachi in deep resonant space to explore virtuosic gestures.  </p>

<p>Four song EP from 2003. <a href='http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/transcension'>Transcension</a> uses subtle beats over a funk bass with a gothic chorus. A Moist Mirage in Desert Eyes, a protest song against the Iraq war, mixes dub rhythms with constantly shifting artificial vocalisms. Arddha Jangala explores orchestral electronic spaces where the timbres constantly morph. Yes or No is a big beat song with bizarre choruses chanting Yes, No... All songs experimental and bizarre but using a completely original approach to sound, melody and beats.</p>

<p>Transcension, an electronic EP from 2003, has been released gratis and online.  Transcension is a suite of 4 works exploring artificial vocalisms and morphing timbres.  To some degree, Transcension represents work in the more vernacular electronic vein, as there is ample percussion, and rhythmic tension in each of the pieces.  </p>

<p><a href='http://jeffreyharrington.org/mp3/obliterature'>Obliterature</a>, the complete album and cover is now available for download. I'll also be selling real CDR's through CafePress sometime in the near future for those who can't stomach downloading 100MB.  Selling it through MP3RIA.com was not appropriate for this type of experimental music; the number of Preview Listens I was receiving demonstrated that.  If you were one of the few people to buy it through MP3RIA.com please write me and I'll refund you the $3.00.  </p>

<p>The complete set of ecstatic improvisations from 1992-1993, Obliterature is an exploration of realtime extravagant sonic spaces with eccentric tunings, both microtonal and just, textures and orchestral climaxes</p>

<p>The album was completely drawn, in realtime with 2 layers for each piece on an Amiga 1000 using MidiLyr, a piece of software that created a large repeating drawable, MIDI surface. No edits, no revisions; the improvisations were selected from hundreds of takes and have been newly remastered with contemporary hi-resolution effects added.</p>

	<p>My first piece resulting from my recent explorations of the 19 equal-tempered tuning has been finished, a short prelude.  It's basically a floating piece with minimal drama, but it does explore the incredibly in tune chords and resonances that this tuning allows.   Written in standard notation, assuming a MIDI sampled piano (or other keyboard) for the score.  </p>

	<p>I've just finished a new piece, written especially for <a href="http://www.ahlert-schwab.de/index2eng.htm">Daniel Alhert and Birgit Schwab</a>, Cassotis for Mandolin and Guitar.  Inspired by seeing them live in NYC in March, the piece combines my usual diverse world influences, but with a new denser and more complex textural approach.  It clocks in at 14:30 minutes now, once its been humanized, I'm sure it'll approach 15 minutes or more.  </p>

	<p>Michael Manion, composer, performer and Stockhausen assistant will premiere Croche et Tient for MalletKAT and K5000 synthesizer June 7 at the <a href="http://genterstr.hypermart.net/events.html">Feedback Studio</a> in Cologne, Germany.  </p>

<p>Commissioned by <a href="http://genterstr.hypermart.net/m_e_perc/start.html">Michael Manion</a>.  Using <a href="http://www.cycling74.com">MAX</a> or <a href="http://www.nosuch.com/keykit/">KeyKit</a> MIDI echoing processes and a quartertone-tuned synthesizer,  the piece explores territory charted in my Acid Bach series but with a more dramatic and longer tension-building form. Periodically, in the slower sections, the percussionist lets quartertone clusters sustain, creating a night-like atmosphere.  The title, Croche et Tient, (Crush and Hold in english) is from a post card we received from Elsie's cousin who's in the French special forces (now stationed in the Coite d'Ivoire). </p>

	<h3 class="title">Complete Album - Obliterature - Available Through MP3ria.com</h3>

	<p>I've decided to release my Ambient/Abstract/Dark Ambient album, Obliterature, recorded in 1992-1993 on MP3ria.com, a side project of BitPass.com - <a href="http://www.mperia.com/displayfull.php?searchby=artist&searchfor=Jeff+Harrington&id=180&fulltxt=1#bio">Jeff Harrington</a>.  These are completely remastered with 5 never before released tracks.  </p>

<p>The complete set of ecstatic improvisations from 1992-1993, Obliterature is an exploration of realtime extravagant sonic spaces with eccentric tunings, both microtonal and just, textures and orchestral climaxes  </p>

<p>The album was completely drawn, in realtime with 2 layers for each piece on an Amiga 1000 using MidiLyr, a piece of software that created a large repeating drawable, MIDI surface.    No edits, no revisions; the improvisations were selected from hundreds of takes and have been newly remastered with contemporary hi-resolution effects added.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.mperia.com/displayfull.php?searchby=album&searchfor=Obliterature&id=112">Obliterature</a></p>

<p>The individual tracks are available for download at $.50 a piece or the whole album, 12 tracks for $3.00.</p>

<p>One of my favorite tracks on the album - Turning the Pearl II - is available for a free download.  <a href="http://netnewmusic.net/mp3/Jeff-Harrington_Turning_the_Pearl_II.mp3"'>Turning the Pearl II</a></p>

	<p>Continuing his exploration of composition and performance with "virtual" piano, Seattle-based composer Steve Layton (b. 1956) offers the third in his series of "The Composer Plays" CDs. For the first time in the series, in addition to his own works Layton here performs compositions by two other excellent composers: New Yorker Jeff Harrington (b. 1955), and the late master Iannis Xenakis (1922-2001).</p>

<p>Harrington's "BlueStrider" is a pounding monster of a piece, with the drama and contrapuntal skill of Beethoven and Stravinsky married with Harrington's own New Orleans barrel-house-blues roots. Obsessive riffs weave their way through both iron-clad logic and exuberance.</p>

	<h3 class="title">The Hammered Wind Dances for Flute and Piano Revised and Newly Rendered</h3>

	<p>Now that I've got those 2 quartets and the 4th trio almost finished with parts, I've turned my attention to two pieces for flute and piano I composed back in 2000, The Hammered Wind Dances.  I've been revising the first one and I've realized it afresh.  Those scores will be the next ones I finish... These two pieces have some of the same barbarism and contrasting textures as found in BlueStrider and DeltaBandResonator.  </p>

<p>Both pieces are finished, and the new realizations updated 2/08/04.<br />

	<p>My second large scale work for piano, DeltaBandResonator for Piano is an eccentric mix of Americana folk elements contrasting with blues, and boogie-woogie influences, and a clustery barbarism inspired by recent electronic music.  Duration is around 12 1/2 minutes long.  Score available shortly!  </p>

	<h3 class="title">Biography</h3>

	<p><a href="../../jeffl.jpg"><br />
<img src="../../jefflS.jpg" align=left hspace=10></a>Jeffrey Harrington was born in 1955 in Forest, Mississippi. His mother and father were amateur musicians who played the popular music of the 40's and 50's for fun.  In high school he taught himself blues and boogie-woogie piano and built a synthesizer from parts.  He began composing when he was 17 and won a composition contest for a serial composition using an isorhythm derived from a Billy Cobham song bass line.  During that same time, he and his friend Barney Kilpatrick began working at the New Orleans Jazz Festival where he was a stage hand.  During these times he received impromptu guidance and some informal lessons from piano greats Professor Longhair and Roosevelt Sykes.  He also got to set up stage and meet many other blues greats, (Bukka White, Snooks Eaglin, B.B. King, et al) and this experience formed a powerful musical and personal confirmation that the blues and New Orleans funk music were to remain a driving influence throughout his life.  He also helped organize high school dances where they arranged for one of the worlds greatest funk bands, The Meters to play at both the Junior and Senior Proms.</p>

<p>Harrington continued his composition studies at LSU and at the Juilliard School where he studied in the Master's program with Elliott Carter and Roger Sessions.  He has also studied with Morton Subotnick, Jacob Druckman (master class), Joan LaBarbara, James Drew, Barbara Jazwinski and Deborah Drattell.</p>

<p>In 1981 he began a series of compositions using the harmonic idiom of the 18th century with rhythms from jazz and African-American music.  In 1987 he returned to a more chromatic style of composition while retaining his interest in melody and counterpoint and the dramatic/developmental processes of the music of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. In 1990 he retracted all but a few of his compositions written to date (approximately 100).</p>

<p>In 1991 he programmed an expert system in C (inspired by a book by Taniiev - <i>Convertible Counterpoint</i>) which assists him in his discovery of the contrapuntal possibilities inherent in his melodies.  The system takes up to 6 tracks of music and determines (using a pre-selected harmonic rulebase) the  points at which the melodies mesh to produce effective counterpoint.  The system produces music files ready to audition in realtime, so he can simultaneously be developing a transition while he produces the next section of counterpoint.</p>

<p>Harrington currently supports himself as a Java programmer for <a href="http://www.eschoolonline.com">eSchool Online</a>, a division of Classroom Connect. He's also worked at <a href="http://www.ctw.org"> Children's Television Workshop</a> where he wrote a suite of prize-winning educational, yet silly, <a href="http://www.ctw.org/sscentral/kidsite/java/">Sesame Street Java games</a>, which were the first online games for Sesame Street and a prize-winning Castanet channel.</a>.  He has also been a counselor/computer programmer for Choice in Dying: The National Council for the Right to Die (now defunct) and he set up the first web site for the <a href ="http://www.amc.net/">American Music Center</a>.  Harrington's vision for the American Music Center of a complete portal to new music with scores and MP3's has since been realized with their <a href="http://newmusicjukebox.org">NewMusicJukeBox</a>.  He's also worked in the offshore oil fields of Louisiana as a galley hand, in music libraries at Tulane and Loyola University, and at several record stores including the world's first record store, Liberty Music (Madison Ave. behind Saks), where he met Frank Sinatra and learned how to sneak into Carnegie Hall. (Practice, practice, practice). </p>

<p>Harrington's <a href="http://parnasse.com/vrml.shtml">3D visual creations</a> have been featured in the prominent design magazine, <a href="http://www.idonline.com/currentissue.asp">I.D.</a> and throughout the 3D web world.  </p>

<p>Harrington's music has been performed around the world (from Siberia to St. Louis).<br />
