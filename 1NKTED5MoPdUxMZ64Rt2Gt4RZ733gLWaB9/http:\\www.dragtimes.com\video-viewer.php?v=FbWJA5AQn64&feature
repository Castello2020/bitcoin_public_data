Contact GATEBIL MAIN EVENT - Rudskogen 2011
This is some footage from Gatebil Main Event that was held at the new track on Rudskogen Motor center in July 2011. Some amazing cars on the track and a lot of new but familiar faces outside of the track.
People from Speedhunters and Tandem of Die came to see what Gatebil was all about. I don't think they was disappointed!
Hope you liked the video, and if you did remember to share and thumb up!

Superior Media - Gatebil Festival @ Mantorp Park 2011
The people that have visit a Gatebil Festival event will never forget it
and will never stop loving it. It's the most awesome thing you can
experience i terms of motorsport events here in Europe. To understand what
it is you have to be there and experience it yourself. It is a weekend with
lot's of action by crazy drivers, from Sweden, Norway and Finland. The
festival has through the years given us a lot of entertaining teams and
drivers, who sometimes go as far as to Formula Drift (Fredric Aasbo and
Kenneth Moen).
For those who couldn't be there we did our best to capture all the action
and the lifestyle around Gatebil Festival and make a killer video to share
to everyone.
This Gatebil Festival was held on June 17th-19th and as usual at the track
Mantorp Park in Sweden. Mantorp Park is a ideal place for this kind of
event, a big wide track and lot's of space around it for the aftertrack.
