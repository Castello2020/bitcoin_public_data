				<description>Jim Sinclair's webste jsmineset dot com explains that the gold market is rigged, and that gold going up is bad for the Fed.

So it makes sense that the Fed would rather have you dump your money into bitcoin or a gold etf than buy futures contracts on comex and request delivery of the bar.......getting a piece of paper that says warehouse receipt is okay with the fed, rather than you request delivery....

what is in saint louis anyway? an awful hockey team</description>

Exposing the Federal Reserve

The Fed guy is probably just a clueless serf. The irony that someone from an institution which is part of the greatest cancer upon humanity's freedom in modern history is talking about Bitcoin is absurd enough.

As a human you will never be truly free. our species is way too primitive. In the end it's all just consume or be consumed,,, slavery in one form or another (open or indirect) is a given. The only freedom you can hope to get is inside your own mind.
Bitcoin won't fundamentally change that, as nice as it would be. There will always be parasites

Happy motherfking April Fools Day</description>

				<description>What I think is interesting about bitcoin is how easily they can be moved. You don't even have to send them. The key below unlocks 5 mBTC (about $2.50) and anyone now can take this and sweep it into a blockchain.info or Coinbase wallet:

You can check if the funds have been taken yet here:

				<description>Waiiiitttttt a second. @AlphaDirected said Bitcoin is &quot;Overrrrrr!&quot; Dead. Gone. Whats this nonsense all about then? Oh that's right. He was wrong. For the 12th time. Rob - check the wording on this one: &quot;Andolfatto calls Bitcoin &quot;a stroke of genius&quot; and says the digital currency's technology ----&gt; is causing existing financial institutions will have to &quot;adapt or die.&quot;</description>

				<description>Bitcoin is the future, no one can create it out of thin air, one has to put some work to get some or buy in an open market. Central banks are not going to like it at all

I am buyer at around $200, it's going to be the new gold standard</description>

				<title>perfect currency for the coming 3D economy</title>

				<description>Bitcoin is actually the perfect currency for the coming 3D printing economy, which will allow digital exchanges of designs of all kinds of products, printable on demand, individually. It will be quite a peer-to-peer society on a global scale, where individuals can trade or provide services to each. other directly, cutting out and eliminating currently huge commercial, financial organizations.

When people can just electronically transfer, then locally custom manufacture stuff from shoes to weapons, the &quot;peer-to-peer Amazon&quot; won't need huge warehouses or army of workers, robots. The same goes for currency.</description>
