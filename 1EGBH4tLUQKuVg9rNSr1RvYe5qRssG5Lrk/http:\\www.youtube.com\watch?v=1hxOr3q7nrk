Support the cause if you like what I have to say:BTC: 1EGBH4tLUQKuVg9rNSr1RvYe5qRssG5LrkLTC: LcHS8HXDKYV4jwr8QQLqiBvQmW26YKgi5Nwww.VoteMD.infoBaltimoreHourly.comOn a warm day some kids are skating by the harbor. Instead of having a policeman on the corner of Linden and North in Reservoir Hill or some other drug ravaged corner the police have a man patrolling the harbor in a vehicle purchased for that purpose. He gets out of his vehicle and starts yelling at kids when he could be busting drug dealers in most any other part of Baltimore. The police will probably have his head for this but the real issue is why do we have cops going after kids at the Harbor while they could be out on corners busting the real bad guys. This story will probably make national news for all the wrong reasons. The sad thing is Baltimore is wasting tax dollars on far worse things than this. Mayor Dixon is now paying for homeless people stay in hotels in the county. In her state of the City address she implied that we are in for a budget crunch and we may not get our promised property tax relief. We need lower property taxes now! Stop voting in the people who refuse to cut our property taxes. There is so much waste in Baltimore City. We need to cut spending and insane services like housing homeless people in hotels in the county. Give the tax payers a break. We are TIRED of supporting ridiculous things like this. www.BaltimoreHourly.com is part of the answer. Spread the word.
