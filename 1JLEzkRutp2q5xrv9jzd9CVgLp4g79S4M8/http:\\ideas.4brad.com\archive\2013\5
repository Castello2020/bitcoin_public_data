</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Today the National Highway Transportation Safety Agency (NHTSA) released their <a href="http://www.dot.gov/briefing-room/us-department-transportation-releases-policy-automated-vehicle-development">plan on regulation of automated vehicles</a>, a 14 page document on various elements of the technology and how it might be regulated.</p>

<p>No regulations yet of course, but a message that they plan to look hard at the user interface, particularly on the handoff between a human driver and the system.  All reasonable stuff.   They define 4 levels of autonomy (similar to prior lists) and say they don&#8217;t expect full unmanned operation for some time, and discourage states from even making it legal to use level 3 (where the driver can do another task) by ordinary folks yet &#8212; only testing should be allowed.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s good that NHTSA is studying this, and they seem to understand that it&#8217;s too early to write regulations.  It&#8217;s pretty easy to make mistakes if you write regulations before the technologists have even figured out what they intend.  For example this document, as well as some Nevada law documents, suggested regulations that required the vehicle to hand over control if the driver used the wheel, brakes or accelerator.   Yet by another logic, if the driver kicks the gas pedal by mistake and does not have her hands on the wheel, would we want the law to demand that the system relinquish the wheel, causing the vehicle to leave the lane if the driver doesn&#8217;t get on it quickly?</p>

<p>At this point their goal is lots of research on what to do, and that&#8217;s reasonable.   Of course, the sooner the vehicles can get on the road safely, the sooner they can save lives, and NHTSA understands that.  I also hope that the laws will not push small players out of the market entirely, as long as they can test and demonstrate safety as well as the bigger players.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I have owned a laptop for decades, and I&#8217;ve always gone for the &#8220;small and light&#8221; laptop class because as a desktop user, my laptop is only for travel, and ease of carrying is thus very important.  Of course once I get there I have envied the larger screens and better keyboards and other features of the bigger laptops people carry, but generally been happy with the decision.</p>

<p>Others have gone for &#8220;desktop replacement&#8221; laptops which are powerful, big and heavy.  Those folks don&#8217;t have a desktop, at most they plug their laptop into an external monitor and other peripherals at home.  The laptop is a bitch to carry but of course all files come with it.</p>

<p>Today, the tablet is changing that equation.   I now find that when I am going into a situation where I want a minimal device that&#8217;s easy to carry, the tablet is the answer, and even better the tablet and bluetooth keyboard.  I even carry a keyboard that&#8217;s a fair bit larger than the tablet, but still very light compared to a laptop.    When I am in a meeting, or sitting attending an event, I am not going to do the things I need the laptop for.   Well, not as much, anyway.    On the airplane, the tablet is usually quite satisfactory &#8212; in fact better when in coach, though technically the keyboard is not allowed on a plane.  (My tablet can plug in a USB keyboard if needed.)</p>

<p></p>

<p>Planes are a particular problem.  It&#8217;s not safe to check LCD screens in your luggage, so any laptop screen has to come aboard with you, and this is a pain if the computer is heavy.</p>

<p>With the tablet dealing with the &#8220;I want small and light&#8221; situations, what is the right laptop answer?</p>

<p>One obvious solution are the &#8220;convertible tablet&#8221; computers being offered by various vendors.  These are laptops where the screen is a tablet and it can be removed.   These tend to be Windows devices, and somewhat expensive, but the approximate direction is correct.</p>

<p>Another option would be to break the laptop up into 3 or more components: <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/laptop-tablet-world">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

<ul>
<li>The tablet, running your favourite tablet OS</li>
<li>A keyboard, of your choice, which can be carried easily with the tablet for typing-based applications.  Able to hold the laptop and connect to it in a permitted way on the plane.  Touchpad or connection for mouse.</li>
<li>A &#8220;block,&#8221; whose form factor is now quite variable, with the other stuff.</li>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>It seems that <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2013/05/24/exclusive-better-place-to-file-for-bankruptcy/">Better place has gone to&#8230; a better place</a> to put it ironically.    I&#8217;m not greatly surprised, I <a href="/robocars-and-battery-swap">expressed my skepticism</a> last year.</p>

<p>But I do believe in the idea of the self-driving electric taxi as the best answer for our future urban transportation.   So how do you make it happen?</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a big problem with this vision.  Electric cars today have perhaps 100 to 150 miles of range, which means 3 to 6 hours of operation, depending on the speeds you go.   You can make more range (like a Telsa S) but only by adding a lot of weight and cost.   But an effective taxi is on shift all day, or at least all the waking hours, and could easily operate 8 to 10 hours per day.  While any taxi will have downtime during the day (particularly at off-peak hours) the recharge of the battery takes so long it&#8217;s hard to do during the day.     Ideally you want to charge at night, when power is cheap. So let&#8217;s consider the options.</p>

<h2>Large battery pack</h2>

<p>You could make a vehicle with enough battery for a full day&#8217;s work, and charge it at night.  This is very expensive today, and also takes a lot of room and weight in the vehicle, reducing its efficiency.  You also need taxis at night so either way you have to have some taxis that work at night and recharge in the day, but not as many.</p>

<h2>Battery swap</h2>

<p>While battery swap did not pan out for Better Place, it actually makes much more sense for a robotic taxi fleet.  You just need a few swap stations in the city.  It doesn&#8217;t bother the robots if they take a while for a swap (mainly it bothers you because you need more stations.)  And while humans would get very angry if they came to the swap station and saw they were 4th in line at 5 minutes/swap, robots would just schedule their swaps and get in and get out.</p>

<p><img class=blogpic src=/files/bplace.jpg>
That&#8217;s all good, and it solves a few other problems.  Taxis will be putting on lots of miles every day, and they will probably wear out their battery quickly.  If the rest of the vehicle has not worn out, swap becomes ideal &#8212; replace the vehicle&#8217;s components when you need to, including the most expensive part, the battery.   It also makes it easier to charge all batteries only at night, on cheap baseload power.</p>

<p>Swap also allows the batteries to be only used in the &#8220;easy&#8221; part of their duty cycle (from 80% to 20%) without much hassle.   You only get 60% of the range, but you don&#8217;t care a lot, other than in having to
buy more battery packs.  You just do the math on what&#8217;s cheaper.</p>

<h2>Superchargers</h2>

<p>A working supercharger that can recharge a vehicle in an hour solves the problem as well.  Robotic taxis can always find a spare hour without much loss of efficiency.  (Indeed with none as they will age by active mile or hour.)  The big problem is that supercharging generally is felt to stress the batteries and reduce the lifetime of the packs.   Certainly running a car on full cycle every day and supercharging it is not going to produce a happy battery.  </p>

<p>A robocar supercharging station could do a few extra things, though.  For example, you could hook the car up to a special cooling system to pump externally chilled coolant through the batteries, as heat is the big killer in the supercharge.   You might even find a way to put some pressure in to keep the cases from expanding that much, as this is a big stressor when charging.</p>

<p>Supercharging probably has to be done in the day, with more expensive power.  One charge for the morning peak and another for the evening.   Some speculate it&#8217;s worth using your inventory of old battery packs to store power during the night to release in the day.   Solar can also help during the day &#8212; on sunny days, at least.</p>

<p>While automated connection is good, you really would not have many supercharging centers, due to their high power needs, so they could have human staff to do the work.</p>

<p>Both the supercharging and battery swap stations do not need to be located all that conveniently for humans.  Instead, you can put them near power substations where megawatts can be purchased.</p>

<h2>More vehicles and ordinary L2 charging</h2>

<p>If the batteries are more expensive than the vehicles, then perhaps just having more vehicles to house all your battery packs is the answer.  Then you have vehicles spending their time idle, and charging at ordinary level 2 (6kw) rates.   Full level 2 can add about 20 miles of range to a car like a Leaf in an hour.  Depending on the usage patterns that might not be too bad.  Of course it&#8217;s daytime power again, which is expensive.  Urban taxis won&#8217;t go more than about 25mph on average if they are lucky, often less, particularly at rush hour.  Suburban will go a bit faster.   You need stations that allow a robot to recharge, which could mean inductive, or human-staffed, or eventual robotic plug-in systems.   Don&#8217;t laugh at the idea of human-staffed.   The robot will not be in a super rush, so stations near retail shops or existing gas stations would work fine as long as somebody can come out and tend to the robot on connect and disconnect within 5 minutes.</p>

<p>It may seem like more vehicles is more expensive, but that&#8217;s not necessarily true.  It depends on how and why the vehicles wear out.   Ideally you design the vehicle so battery and most major vehicle components all reach end-of-life at a similar time or that they can be replaced easily.  That may mean a battery that can be swapped &#8212; but in the shop, not at an automatic swap station.</p>

<h2>Plug in hybrids?</h2>

<p>Plug in hybrids of course solve the problem, and they can charge when they can to be mostly electric and only use that gas engine more rarely.   This actually creates a downside &#8212; it&#8217;s expensive to have a fossil fuel power train around to barely use it.   And it adds a fair bit to the maintenance cost.   This does allow for highway travel.   Otherwise, you send a liquid fuel car to anybody wanting to do a long highway trip - save the electrics for the urban travel.</p>

<h2>Very light vehicles</h2>

<p>Today&#8217;s electrics use about 250 to 300 watt-hours/mile.   OK, but not great.   Efficient designs can go below 100 watt/hours per mile.   That means doing 300 miles, which is enough for a full day in a city cab, needs only 30kwh (probably a 45kwh battery.)   That&#8217;s a $22K battery today, but it will be a $9K battery by the end of this decade according to predictions.  This might be quite reasonable.</p>

    <span class="taxonomy"><ul class="links inline"><li class="first last taxonomy_term_95"><a href="/topic/robocars" rel="tag" title="The future of computer-driven cars and deliverbots" class="taxonomy_term_95">Robocars</a></li>
</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Two interesting pieces today.</p>

<p>First is a report on the <a href="http://www.wired.com/autopia/2013/05/volkswagen-xl1-driven/">Volkswagen XL1</a> the car that gets 100km per litre, or 260mg.</p>

<p>As you read the description, you would be likely to ask, who would buy a car like this, which takes so long to get to highway speed and skimps on anything that would add weight?</p>

<p>The answer of course is that only a small minority are willing to buy lightweight, super-efficient cars with poor acceleration because they save a bunch of fuel.    The average American car owner spends less than $2,000 a year on fuel, and while dropping it to $200 would be very nice, it&#8217;s not something people are ready to compromise a ton of other important car features for when they buy a car.   It&#8217;s even harder to justify it to go from $800/year in a Prius to $200 in an ultralight, especially if the car costs more because of it.</p>

<p>This is the fact about robocars which changes the game.   Mobility on demand from self-delivering robocars <strong>rewrites all the economics of cars because it changes the question from &#8220;What car should I buy?&#8221; to &#8220;What car do I want to ride in for this trip?&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>If you buy such a car, you know you will do almost all your car travel in it.  You are saying to yourself, I will never go driving for fun.  I will never go on a trip in the mountains.  I&#8217;ll never put 4 friends in my car.  Never, or almost never.  People don&#8217;t want to say that to themselves.</p>

<p>All that goes away when asking the question about what to ride in for an upcoming trip.  If you&#8217;re going to be taxied across town, never even taking the wheel, you don&#8217;t care that the car can&#8217;t accelerate.  In fact, you would prefer a gentle trip with smooth accelerations.  You don&#8217;t care if the car can climb a mountain, or drive in snow, or even go on the highway if this trip doesn&#8217;t involve a highway.</p>

<p>Because you don&#8217;t care about those things, you will bump the priority of other things &#8212; is it comfortable?   Does it come quickly?  Is the price low?   The latter question will make you prefer the efficient car.</p>

<p>Some questions will remain the same.  You&#8217;ll always want safety.  But so many of the other factors change so much that all the economics of cars get rewritten.  So expect to see more cars like this, or the <a href="/oliver-kuttner-very-light-car">Very Light Car</a> or the half-width vehicles I have written about.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I am pleased to report that a documentary on the first software developers, <a href="http://eniacprogrammers.org">the 6 women who were hired to program the ENIAC</a> &#8212; the first electronic computer &#8212;  has after many years received a funding grant sufficient to produce it.</p>

<p><img src=http://eniacprogrammers.org/images/kk-eniac2-400-fw.jpg class=leftpic></p>

<p>Back in the 90s, my close friend Kathy Kleiman was researching computer history and came upon photos of the ENIAC and wondered who the unnamed women in the photos were.  At first, she was told they were models hired to decorate the computer, but further investigation revealed they were the ones programming it.</p>

<p>The six women were professional computers, which was a job title early in the century &#8212; people with math degrees hired to perform calculations, in particular ballistic firing tables for the war.   Because of the war, skilled women got these jobs, and the best of the team were asked to write software to get the machine to do the tables they were doing by hand.   They were given no instruction, just the wiring diagrams and other machine designs, and created the first software applications, including inventing things like the first sort routine and many other things fundamental to our profession.</p>

<p>Because nobody knew the history of these founders of our profession, Kathy sought them out, and was able to record video interviews with 4 of them.  These interviews have languished in the can for many years, and alas, all 6 of them are now deceased.   I&#8217;ve been trying to help for many years, but in a fortuitous lunch, I was able to make the introductions necessary to arrange funding through the efforts and support of my friends Megan Smith, Anne Wojcicki and Lucy Southworth.</p>

<p>Kathy got to make the announcement at Google I/O in a <a href="https://developers.google.com/events/io/sessions/364746894">special session about female techmakers</a> featuring an array of accomplished women in technology.  She showed a small section of the movie&#8217;s trailer.   Her section can be seen 9 minutes into the video, and the programmers at 11:30.   (Megan accidentally called me Brad Feldman, but I forgive her :-)</p>

<p>Software development is perhaps the most important new profession of the 20th century &#8212; and there were many &#8212; and the story of the six unsung founders of that profession will finally be presented to a large audience.   I&#8217;ll announce when the documentary is released.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>There are a growing number of apps designed to help people find parking, and even reserve and pay for parking in advance.  Some know the state of lots.   These apps are good for the user but also can produce a public good by reducing the number of people circling looking for parking.  Studies suggest in certain circumstances a large fraction of the cars on the road are doing that.</p>

<p>This weekend, I attended the Maker Faire.  I&#8217;ve been to almost every Make Faire, including the first, and now it&#8217;s grown to be far too successful &#8212; you can hardly walk down the aisles at the busy times.   They need more space and a way to put more of it outside so thin out the crowds.  Still, it is one of those places that makes you feel very clearly you are in the 21st century.</p>

<p>Early on Maker Faire realized it had a parking problem.  The lot at the fairgrounds fills up now even before the event opens, and they manage various satellite lots and run shuttle buses to them.</p>

<p>This year they tried something interesting, a <a href="https://twitter.com/fairetraffic">twitter feed with parking updates</a>.   They tweeted when lots filled up or re-opened, and suggested where to go.  They took some limited feedback about lack of shuttles.   I think that it by and large worked and reduced traffic around the event.</p>

<p>However, my judgment is that they were not entirely honest in their tweets.   This year, and in prior years, they strongly encouraged people to go to one of the most remote lots, regularly telling people it was the fastest route to the event.   This was not true.   I don&#8217;t want to ascribe any particular malice here, but there is a suspicion that there is a temptation to make reports in the interest of the event rather than the user.   This does have positives, in that cars diverted from near the event reduce traffic which makes the shuttle buses run much faster, but if you give wrong information (deliberately or by accident) this means people stop trusting it and you get the traffic back as more people ignore it.</p>

<p>For example, we stopped at a remote lot, and saw a very long shuttle line.  We drove on to a closer lot (also reported as having spaces, but not reported as clearly a better choice) to find lots of spaces, no shuttle line, frequent shuttles and also a walk that was only slightly longer than the shuttle trip. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/automating-big-event-parking">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

    <div class="content"><p>Studies have shown that if you leave USB sticks on the ground outside an office building, 60% of them will get picked up and plugged into a computer in the building.   If you put the company logo on the sticks, closer to 90% of them will get picked up and plugged in.</p>

<p>USB sticks, as you probably know, can pretend to be CD-ROMs and that means on many Windows systems, the computer will execute an &#8220;autorun&#8221; binary on the stick, giving it control of your machine.  (And many people run as administrator.)   While other systems may not do this, almost every system allows a USB stick to pretend to be a keyboard, and as a keyboard it also can easily take full control of your machine, waiting for the machine to be idle so you won&#8217;t see it if need be.   Plugging malicious sticks into computers is how Stuxnet took over Iranian centrifuges, and yet we all do this.</p>

<p>I wish we could trust unknown USB and bluetooth devices, but we can&#8217;t, not when they can be pointing devices and mice and drives we might run code from.</p>

<p>New OS generations have to create a trust framework for plug-in hardware, which includes USB and firewire and to a lesser degree even eSata.</p>

<p>When we plug in any device that might have power over the machine, the system should ask us if we wish to trust it, and how much.   By default, we would give minimum trust to drives, and no trust to pointing devices or keyboards and the like.   CD-Roms would not get the ability to autorun, though it could be granted by those willing to take this risk, poor a choice as it is.</p>

<p>Once we grant the trust, the devices should be able to store a provided key.  After that, the device can then use this key to authenticate itself and regain that trust when plugged in again.  Going forward all devices should do this.</p>

<p>The problem is they currently don&#8217;t, and people won&#8217;t accept obsoleting all their devices.  Fortunately devices that look like writable drives can just have a token placed on the drive.  This token would change every time, making it hard to clone.</p>

<p>Some devices can be given a unique identifier, or a semi-unique one.   For devices that have any form of serial number, this can be remembered and the trust level associated with it.   Most devices at least have a lot of identifiers related to the make and model of device.  Trusting this would mean that once you trusted a keyboard, any keyboard of the same make and model would also be trusted.   This is not super-secure but prevents generic attacks &#8212; attacks would have to be directly aimed at you.    To avoid a device trying to pretend to be every type of keyboard until one is accepted, the attempted connection of too many devices without a trust confirmation should lock out the port until a confirmation is given.</p>

<p>The protocol for verification should be simple so it can be placed on an inexpensive chip that can be mass produced.  In particular, the industry would mass produce small USB pass-through authentication devices that should cost no more than $1.   These devices could be stuck on the plugs of old devices to make it possible for them to authenticate.  They could look like hubs, or be truly pass-through.</p>

<p>All of this would make USB attacks harder.  In the other direction, I believe as I have <a href="/using-phone-its-own-mouse-and-trusting-keyboard">written before</a> that there is value in creating classes of untrusted or less trusted hardware.   For example, an untrusted USB drive might be marked so that executable code can&#8217;t be loaded from it, only classes of files and archives that are well understood by the OS.   And an untrusted keyboard would only be allowed to type in boxes that say they will accept input from an untrusted keyboard.  You could write the text of emails with the untrusted keyboard, but not enter URLs into the URL bar or passwords into password boxes.   (Browser forms would have to indicate that an untrusted keyboard could be used.)  In all cases, a mini text-editor would be available for use with the untrusted keyboard, from where one could cut and paste using a trusted device into other boxes.</p>

<p>A computer that as yet has no trusted devices of a given class would have to trust the first one plugged in.  Ie. if you have a new computer that&#8217;s never had a keyboard, it has to trust its first keyboard unless there is another way to confirm trust when that first keyboard is plugged in.  Fortunately mobile devices all have built in input hardware that can be trusted at manufacture, avoiding this issue.   If a computer has lost all its input devices and needs a new one, you could either trust implicitly, or provide a pairing code to type on the new keyboard (would not work for mouse) to show you are really there.  But this is only a risk on systems that normally have no input device at all.</p>

<p>For an even stronger level of trust, we might want to be able to encrypt the data going through.   This stops the insertion of malicious hubs or other MITM intercepts that might try to log keystrokes or other data.  Encryption may not be practical in low power devices that need to be drives and send data very fast, but it would be fine for all low speed devices.</p>

<p>Of course, we should not trust our networks, even our home networks.  Laptops and mobile devices constantly roam outside the home network where they are not protected, and then come back inside able to attack if trusted.   However, some security designers know this and design for this.</p>

<p>Yes, this adds some extra UI the first time you plug something in.  But that&#8217;s hopefully rare and this is a big gaping hole in the security of most of our devices, because people are always plugging in USB drives, dongles and more.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Hints from the release this week of the 2014 Mercedes S-Class suggest that it doesn&#8217;t have the promised traffic jam assist.   <strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/automobiles/a-benz-with-a-virtual-chauffeur.html?ref=global-home&amp;_r=1&amp;">Other reports</a> suggest it might still be present.</p>

<p><img src=/files/sclass.jpg class=leftpic></p>

<p>The S-class only gets major updates infrequently, though an intermediate update will come in 2017.
A story on <a href="http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/mercedes/s-class/63986/self-driving-mercedes-s-class-within-five-years">Auto Express</a> quotes Mercedes as saying &#8220;We can do it now, but there are rules in place that we have to accept&#8221; but that a fully autonomous car will come before the next full-revision of the S class due in 2021.</p>

<p>Instead, this car features a lanekeep + ACC mode that requires your hand be &#8220;touching&#8221; the wheel, and starts complaining if you take your hands off for a while.</p>

<p>This is a setback on what was to be the first commercially released car.   While the various state laws do not tend to cover cars that provide an autopilot that requires constant visual attention from the driver, Mercedes may have been afraid of the regulatory environment in the Europe.</p>

<p>In addition, there has always been a special risk to this approach.  Even if you insist to the driver that they must pay attention, they will surely ignore that warning once they get away with occasional inattention &#8212; after all, they will send text messages now with no auto-driving at all.   Car companies can build a lane-keeping car today, but to stop you from trusting it too much they end up with systems like &#8220;keep touching the wheel&#8221; or a gaze detector that makes sure you keep watching the road, and people don&#8217;t like these systems very much.</p>

<p>Will Volvo and Audi, who have also announced plans for lakekeep+ACC super-cruise cars also pull back?  Cadillac, which actually uses the name super-cruise, has pulled back from their 2015 date while at the same time talking to the press about their testing program.</p>

<h2>Senate Hearings</h2>

<p>In other news, the hearings in the Senate yesterday had most of their focus on these early technologies, and as expected, both David Strickland of NHTSA and the various industry folks were gung-ho on DSRC for V2V and very eager to recommend that the FCC not be allowed to convert the DSRC spectrum to unlicenced as it wishes to do.   Here is a <a href="http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/mercedes/s-class/63986/self-driving-mercedes-s-class-within-five-years">summary of the meeting</a> which was attended by only a few senators.    Both Johnson and Rockefeller surprised me with their skill in the questions.  While Johnson was not up on all the ADAS technologies, he was able to see through a number of the industry claims.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Some interesting robocar surveys are out.</p>

<p><img class=leftpic src=/files/ciscogr.png></p>

<p>Today, a <a href="http://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&amp;articleId=1184392">survey conducted by Cisco</a> showed very high numbers of people saying, &#8220;yes, they would ride in a robocar.&#8221;   57% said yes globally, with 60% in the USA and an incredible 95% in Brazil.  (Perhaps it is the trully horrible traffic in the big cities of Brazil which drives this number.)  A bit more surprising was the 28% number for Japan.</p>

<p>When they asked people if they would put their kids in a car, the answer was lower, but only slightly lower, which surprises me, as I felt it should take a bit more trust demonstration for people do do that.  The reality is that if 60% are saying yes right now, without having seen the technology at all, the real number is actually quite a bit higher.</p>

<p>The Japanese number is also curious, since our stereotype is that the Japanese are the people most accepting of robotics in the world.</p>

<p>An <a href="http://www.carsafetyrules.com/london-drivers-most-willing-to-commute-in-a-driver-less-google-car/0508/">British Survey</a> reported similar results, with highest desire in London &#8212; possibly also related to the amount of traffic.</p>

<p>Another survey from the UK asked the question &#8220;which company would you trust to improve car safety&#8221; with <a href="http://www.thecarconnection.com/news/1084134_who-can-do-more-for-auto-safety-apple-or-volvo?goback=.gde_4731574_member_240829345">astonishing results</a>.  The winner was Apple, which has no announced car safety plans, with Google in 2nd place.  What is shocking is that Volvo comes 3rd &#8212; really a close tie with Google, and Mercedes 4th.  Volvo&#8217;s entire brand is to be the car safety leader, and Mercedes has been trying to take that status away, but I would never have guessed that the silicon valley tech companies would win this.   </p>

<p>It&#8217;s even more surprising that Apple beats Google.  While Apple certainly has a quality brand, Google is the only one known to be working on cars and safety.  One has to wonder just how the questions were put to these new-car buyers.</p>

<p>Yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/radio-show-robocars-tuesday-14th-7pm-pdt">KALW radio show</a> went pretty well, the phone-in questions were pretty reasonable.  The MP3 is up on their site.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Here&#8217;s a roundup of various recent news items on robocars.   There are now a few locations, such as DriverlessCarHQ and the LinkedIn self-driving car group which feature very extensive listing of news items related to robocars.   Robocars are now getting popular enough that there are articles every day, but only a few of them contain actual real news for readers of this site or others up on the technology.</p>

<h2>Tesla</h2>

<p>An offhand remark from Elon Musk reveals he is interested in an &#8220;autopilot&#8221; some day for Tesla models, and has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-07/tesla-ceo-talking-with-google-about-autopilot-systems.html">spoken to Google about it</a>.  Google declined comment.   Musk says he wants a cheaper, camera based system, a surprising mistake for him.   (Cameras are indeed much cheaper but not yet up to the task.  LIDARs are super expensive but Musk&#8217;s mistake is in not remembering that electronics technology that&#8217;s expensive in early, small volume models does not stay expensive.)</p>

<p>The Tesla Model S is not a good car to make into a robocar though &#8212; it&#8217;s super fun to drive, and that&#8217;s part of why you pay so much money for it.  Nothing wrong with fun to drive cars, but you should automate the boring car and leave the fun car on manual, at least for now.</p>

<h2>Shuttles driven by maps</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://z6mag.com/featured/self-driving-shuttle-coming-to-a-location-near-you-robot-revolution-1617343.html">Cybergo</a> made by French company Induct is a low speed robotic shuttle for campus use.   Particularly interesting is that it drives using a laser and mapping for localization &#8212; a similar fashion to the Google car and other DARPA challenge cars.   It is able to mingle with pedestrians by virtue of just going slow enough to be able to stop in time and be safe.</p>

<h2>More Laws</h2>

<p>More states are debating robocar laws.   This <a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Automated_Driving:_Legislative_and_Regulatory_Action">wiki at Stanford</a> has a good summary of existing actions.  Notable is that <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/commuting/index.ssf/2013/04/oregon_driverless_car_bill_sta.html">Oregon pulled back on their law</a>, and New York has just drafter theirs.  Massachusetts is also working on one.</p>

<p>The Oregon pullback is notable because one of the cited reasons was the desire to study V2V.  While I have written <a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/v2v-and-connected-car-part-3-broadcast-data">recently on issues with V2V</a> this moves it out of the &#8220;mostly harmless&#8221; category.   V2V efforts will be useful for robocars, but not for decades, and I strongly believe it would be extreme folly to allow V2V issues to affect the progress of robocars.</p>

<p>Unlike Nevada&#8217;s law, many of the other state laws do not cover unmanned operation.   While the reasons for this are obvious, because it&#8217;s harder to understand unmanned operation in the context of existing law, we should not forget that unmanned operation is where most of the real benefits of robocars accrue &#8212; self-delivery, mobility on demand, parking, self-refueling, service to the elderly and disabled and much more.  Not that manned operation is a slouch, offering the reduced accidents and recovery of productive time as benefits.</p>

<p>California&#8217;s DMV recently held hearings in Sacramento as part of their process of writing the regulations required by the California bill, passed in 2012.  The regulations need to be done by 2015 but may be done sooner.  The US DOT also solicited comments last month.</p>

<h2>Google hits 500,000</h2>

<p>I noted earlier that Google announced it had hit 500,000 miles of autonomous operation on ordinary streets.  Even more notable was chief engineer Chris Urmson&#8217;s report of over 90,000 miles without a safety-critical incident.  (This is an incident where the safety drivers had to take over where the vehicle would have probably caused an accident.)  That&#8217;s not as good as a human yet &#8212; humans have an accident about ever 250,000 miles in the USA, but getting much closer.   500,000 miles, by the way, is more than the distance to the moon and back &#8212; Google [X] always talks about moonshots &#8212; and more than many people will drive in their lifetimes.</p>

<h2>Cadillac &amp; Car Companies</h2>

<p>Cadillac has pushed back the supposedly 2015 delivery for their &#8220;super cruise&#8221; product.   It now will come later in the decade.   Car maker conservatism is to be expected, but other makers are pushing their dates forward.  The Mercedes 2014 S Class is still on track to be first.</p>

<p>BMW has announced a partnership with Continental, the major auto parts supplier.  Continental has been pushing their cruising car for a while &#8212; I&#8217;ve ridden in it &#8212; but BMW has its own impressive effort in ConnectedDrive Connect.  Today, it is quite common for systems branded by a car maker to actually be made entirely by a supplier, who gives up the branding and limelight for money.  It will be interesting to see how this collaboration works.  They will be <a href="http://editorial.autos.msn.com/blogs/autosblogpost.aspx?post=4d474787-eb27-4e5b-b3e0-e00b20351b2b">testing on the autobahn</a>.</p>

<p>Car company date forecasts continue to be long term, with dates in the range of 2025 for full autonomy as cited by BMW.</p>

<p>Bosch, another top supplier, has been making its own announcements of advanced sensors and other tools.</p>

<h2>Princeton slide deck</h2>

<p>Many more papers and reports on robocars are being written.  This <a href="http://orfe.princeton.edu/~alaink/Presentations/ITE_SmartDrivingCars/TransAction2013_SmartDrivingCars_041113.pdf">slide deck from Princeton PAVE&#8217;s Kornhauser</a> is notable for providing a number of worthwhile statistics on road use and related issues.</p>

<h2>Fake Google Car in New York</h2>

<p>A crew created a fake Google car and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfICqoKrghw">drove it around NYC</a>.   What&#8217;s impressive is how many people thought they were seeing the real thing.</p>

<h2>Articles</h2>

<p>While there have been scores of articles, I will point to my friend Virginia Postrel&#8217;s Bloomberg article on <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-17/why-silicon-valley-is-winning-the-robocar-race.html">Silicon Valley and robocars</a> since I was her prime source &#8212; so it must be good. :-)</p>

<p>A nice trick from Daimler which I liked &#8212; a system to <a href="http://www.gizmag.com/daimler-future-car-technology/27054/pictures#5">be kind to pedestrians</a> as they walk down the street near parked robocars that sense them.   Their plan is to light the way for these pedestrians as a favour.</p>

<h2>Whole magazine issue</h2>

<p>The military magazine Mission Critical has devoted an <a href="http://issuu.com/auvsi/docs/mission_critical_may2013?mode=window">entire issue to civilian robocars</a> which includes an article on insurance by Guy Fraker (formerly of State Farm) and a few other items of interest.</p>

<p>More news to come.  I have also updated my <a href="http://robocars.com/teams.html">Robocar Teams</a> page with more details on teams around the world building robocars.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>You&#8217;ve probably noticed that with many of our portable devices, especially phones and tablets, a large fraction of the size and weight are the battery.   Battery technology keeps improving, and costs go down, and there are dreams of fancy new chemistries and even ultracapacitors, but this has become a dominant issue.</p>

<p>Every device seems to have a different battery.  Industrial designers work very hard on the design of their devices, and they don&#8217;t want to be constrained by having to standardize the battery space.  In many devices, they are even giving up the replaceable battery in the interests of good design.   The existing standard battery sizes, such as the AA, AAA and even the AAAA and other less common sizes are just not suitable for a lot of our devices, and while cylindrical form factors make the most sense for many cell designs they don&#8217;t fit well in the design of small devices.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s holding back a new generation of standardization in batteries?  Is it the factors named above, the fact that tech is changing rapidly, or something else?</p>

<p>I would propose a small, thin modular battery that I would call the EStick, for energy stick.   The smaller EStick sizes would be thin enough for cell phones.   The goal would be to have more than one b-stick, or at least more than one battery in a typical device.  Because of the packaging and connections, that would mean a modest reduction in battery capacity &#8212; normally a horrible idea &#8212; but some of the advantages might make it worth it.</p>

<h2>Quick swap</h2>

<p>There are several reasons to have multiple sticks or batteries in a device.  In particular, you want the ability to quickly and easily swap at least one stick while the device is still operating, though it might switch to a lower power mode during the swap.   The stick slot would have a spring loaded snap, as is common in many devices like cameras, though there may be desire for a door in addition.</p>

<p>Swapping presents the issue that not all the cells are at the same charge level and voltage.  This is generally a bad thing, but modern voltage control electronics has reached the level where this should be possible with smaller and smaller electronics.  It is possible with some devices to simply use one stick at a time, as long as that provides enough current.   This uses up the battery lifetime faster, and means less capacity, but is simpler.</p>

<p>The quick hot swap offers the potential for indefinite battery life.   In particular, it means that very small devices, such as wearable computers (watches, glasses and the like) could run a long time.  They might run only 3-4 hours on a single stick, but a user could keep a supply of sticks in a pocket or bag to get arbitrary lifetime.   Tiny devices that nobody would ever use because &#8220;that would only last 2 hours&#8221; could become practical.</p>

<p>While 2 or more sticks would be best for swap, a single stick and an internal battery or capacitor, combined with a sleep mode that can survive for 20-30 seconds without a battery could be OK. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/esticks-standardized-quick-swap-battery-proposal">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

    <div class="content"><p>I have prepared a large new Robocar article.  This one covers just what will happen when the first robocars are involved in accidents out on public streets, possibly injuring people.   While everybody is working to minimize this, perfection is neither possible nor the right goal, so it will eventually happen.  As such, when I see public discussion of robocars and press articles, people are always very curious about accidents, liability, insurance and to what extent these issues are blockers on the technology. </p>

<p>So please consider:</p>

  <p><a href="http://robocars.com/accident.html">Anatomy of a Robocar Accident</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This article comes in part from having attended the &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.law.stanford.edu/werobot/">We Robot</a>&#8221; conference in April at Stanford University.  While it was generally about robots and the law, robocars were probably the most popular topic.  Several of the papers in <a href="http://blogs.law.stanford.edu/werobot/agenda/">the proceedings</a> are well worth it for those interested in the law of robotics.  (The real law, not the silly Asimov laws.)</p>

<hr>

<p>In a curious coincidence, last week saw an unusual robocar accident in Brazil that caused minor injuries &#8212; on live TV no less.   On a Brazilian TV show, professor Alberto Ferreira do Souza from the Federal University of Espirito Santo has just shown TV Presenter Ana Maria Braga their robocar, which features the smaller 32-line Velodyne LIDAR on the roof and various other sensors.    After the successful demo, he reaches into the car to turn off the system and restore the car to manual.  Unfortunately, the car has stopped on an incline, and in doing so from outside the car, this releases the hold on the brakes that their drive-by-wire system had and the car starts rolling down the hill, and the open door whacks Braga hard, though fortunately with only minor injuries.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=N1pdGCLyr_M#!">Here is a video</a> and <a href="http://g1.globo.com/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2013/04/ana-maria-braga-passa-bem-apos-ser-atropelada-ao-vivo-durante-mais-voce.html">Here&#8217;s the story in Portuguese</a> with a different video clip.   I have no idea why a puppet parrot is commenting on the accident.</p>

<p><img class=blogpic src=/files/ticket.JPG>
As you can surmise, the self-driving software was not directly at fault here, but rather bad human judgement in turning it off.  Curiously, this is not the first time we&#8217;ve seen serious problems with humans not correctly handling turning systems on and off.   I routinely show a video of my friend Anthonly Levandowski, who built a motorcycle for the DARPA grand challenge and forgot to turn on an important system just before the race, causing his bike to tip over right out of the starting gate.   Volvo also had the &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6ZwS9izm4E">press demo from hell</a>&#8221; when their crash-prevention system did not operate.  It was reported that a battery had discharged by mistake, and that in recharging it they had disabled the collision system.</p>

<p>There have been several small robocar accidents.  Just about every team in the DARPA Grand Challenges had a car go awry during early development and testing, and a few even had accidents during the challenge, with one small car to car fender bender and a fairly hard hit on concrete barriers.  Google has also reported their car has been rear-ended while stopped at a light during testing &#8212; a situation where blame is always placed on the rear car.</p>
