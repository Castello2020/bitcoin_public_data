    <div class="content"><p>I don&#8217;t post most EFF news here, since the EFF has a news page and 2 blogs for that, but today I&#8217;m doing it
twice because congress is voting tomorrow on renewal of the PATRIOT act.  There was a lot of effort to
reduce the bad stuff in the bill, efforts that seemed to be getting somewhere but were ignored.</p>

<p>Ok, do I have to tell you why this erosion of so many fundamental rights is a bad idea?  At first,
I thought the PATRIOT only came about because in the weeks after Sept 11, the country was acting
in anger and shock.  It did things it wouldn&#8217;t do with time to be calm and reasoned about it.
And the PATRIOT act has resulted in huge waves of new surveillance as we&#8217;ve been seing in the past
few weeks.</p>

<p>So do what you can to stop it.    Our <a href="https://secure.eff.org/site/Advocacy?alertId=187&amp;pg=makeACall">Action Center</a> will help you contact your representatives to give them the message.   Plus you can read <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004166.php">the bill and
commentary on it</a> on the EFF web site.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been saying these things for so long you may be getting tired of it.  But every time we strip away
rights, make society a little bit more scared &#8212; each time we live in fear &#8212; I think that&#8217;s exactly
what terrorists want.  Like the name says, their goal is to sew fear and terror in hope of getting their
way.   Sure, people were angry when this law was first passed, but there is no excuse today.  Take action
yourself.   Donation to organizations like the EFF and others if you don&#8217;t have time to take all the action
you think you should, but do have the money.  It&#8217;s as simple as that.</p>

<p>So I propose: Divide up all the vitamins and minerals and supplements wanted in a daily regimen.  Make a chewable pill that contains all the ones that can go in a chewable pill (ie. don't taste bad, and will maintain proper cohesion.)   Then take the ones that can't go in that chewable, and bundle just them in a hopefully smaller, coated pill to swallow.</p>

Earlier I posted about my panoramas of Australia.  Now I have put up the large gallery of
regular spect photos from the trip.   We began with a short visit to Melbourne, then drove the Great Ocean Road , ending in Adelaide.   From there we flew to Darwin in the top end to visit Kakadu National Park and Litchfield National Park. </p>

<p>Then it was on to Cairns and the Great Barrier Reef, and finally ending in Syndey for the AUUG conference.  We took almost 3000 photos &#8212; the galleries contain the best 250 or so, along with captions and some stories.   It&#8217;s freshly up, and may need a bit of proofing and refinement, but feel free to enjoy.  Thanks again to my hosts and other great folks from Australia.</p>

    <span class="taxonomy"><ul class="links inline"><li class="first last taxonomy_term_37"><a href="/taxonomy/term/37" rel="tag" title="Internet governance issues" class="taxonomy_term_37">Governance</a></li>
</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>There&#8217;s talk that in the battle between the USA and Europe over control
of ICANN, which may come to a head at the upcoming World Summit on the
Information Society in Tunis, people will seriously consider &#8220;splitting
the root&#8221; of DNS.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve written a fair bit about <a href="http://www.templetons.com/brad/dns/howworks.html">how DNS
works</a> and how the
true power over how names get looked up actually resides with hundreds of
thousands of individual site administrators.  However, there is a natural
monopoly in the root.  All those site admins really have to all do the
same thing, or you get a lot of problems, which takes away most of
that power.</p>

<p>Still, this is an interesting power struggle.  If a large group of admins
decided
to switch to a new DNS root, different from ICANN, they could. The cooperation
of Microsoft, which includes the default root list for IIS, and Paul Vixie,
who puts that list in BIND, would play a large part in that as well.</p>

<p>In fact,
many times in the past people have split the root by creating alternate,
&#8220;superset&#8221;
roots which mirror the existing .com/.org/.net/etc. and add new top
level domains.   Some of these have been &#8220;innocent&#8221; efforts frustrated
at how slowly ICANN had created new TLDs, but in truth all of them have
also been landgrabs, hoping to get ownership of more generic terms,
furthering the mistake that was made with .com.  ICANN is also furthering
the mistake, just more slowly.  (The mistake is ignoring what trademark
law has known for centuries &#8212; you don&#8217;t grant ownership rights in ordinary
generic terms.)</p>

<p>All of these superset attempts have also failed.  I don&#8217;t think I have
ever seen anybody promote a URL using one of the alternate root TLDs,
or give me an email address from an alternate root TLD.  I consider
that failure.</p>

<p>This is, of course, what creates the natural monopoly.  Few people are
interested in setting it up so that two different people looking for a
domain get different results.    That applies to the fact that most
people get an error for www.drug.shop (in the new.net alternate TLDs)
and a few get the registrant&#8217;s site, but it applies even moreso to the
idea that
Americans would get one answer for foo.com and Europeans a different one.</p>

<p>Because of this, Larry Lessig <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=3306
">recently suggested</a> he wasn&#8217;t worried
about a root split because there would be such strong pressure to keep
them consistent.</p>

<p>The difficulty is, what&#8217;s the point of creating your own root if you
can&#8217;t actually make it any different from the original?  The whole
point of wanting control is to have your way when there is a dispute,
and to have your way does not mean just doing it the same as everybody
else lest we get inconsistent results.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s possible that a group of nations might try to wrest control in
order to do nothing at first, but eventually create a superset of TLDs
which would, for the first time, be a success.   That might work, since
if all the nations of the world except the USA were to go to a new
root set, it would be hard for the private individuals in the USA who
control name servers not to follow.   But then the new group would
no doubt attempt at some point to issue policies for the existing
top-level-domains and country code domains. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/node/292">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I was amused to hear folks on PRI&#8217;s Marketplace radio program say that 99 cents for a rerun on the video iPod was a good price.   Turns out that 99 cents includes commercials in that rerun, because people polled said
they would rather pay 99 cents with commercials intead of $1.50 without them.</p>

<p>As I have written before, the public sure is misjuding this.  TV CPMs are about $10, or 1 cent per ad shown to a viewer.   So in a half hour program, with about 15 ads, the network and everybody below them would have made about 15 cents to show it to you.   30 cents for an hour long show.  At full resolution too, and the ability to record it without DRM to watch later.   Yes, Apple gets a cut, is it that huge?</p>

<p>So 99 cents is no deal, though they are actually sacrificing more to cut the price 50 cents and include ads, unless they can target the ads better and thus get more revenue from them.  Will you be able to fast forward on the downloaded shows?</p>

<p>My main lament has been about what a bad deal TV advertising is.  You get $1.20 worth of programming to watch a full hour of pure advertising.  Way below minimum wage.</p>

<p>I want to see TV available for download, but I think instead of this system should give us shows at a similar cost to the advertising based one (plus a retail markup) at better resolution to boot.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Everybody is annoyed at how long it takes computers to boot.  Some use hibernate mode to save a copy of the system in a booted state, which is one approach.  Booting procedures have also gotten better about running stuff in parallel.</p>
<p>How about watching a system as it boots, and noting what disk blocks are read to boot it.   Then save that map for the disk defragmenter or other disk organizer and have it try to rearrange the files needed at boot so they are all contiguous<br />
and close together.    This should reduce the role of I/O as a boot bottleneck.   Many disks today can read 50 megabytes in a second, and most OSs only need to access a few 100MB in order to boot, and they have the ram to only need to read files once.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>After we picked up our rental car in Darwin in the Northern Territory of Australia, the blasting heat told us we would like a cooler full of drinks on our 3 day road trip through the outback.  So we stopped at a Woolworths and picked up one of those terrible foam coolers, ice and some drinks.  There was no bar code on the cooler so we wasted what seemed like 10 minutes in the checkout because the clerk wasn't authorized to ring up an item as general merchandise.  (Hint to stores: I know you're scared of your cashiers stealing from you but this is ridiculous.)</p>
<p>It seemed to me that with a sizeable number of the renters in Darwin going off on outback road trips, who among them wouldn't want a cooler.  So the rental company should offer a cooler pre-loaded with ice, and even perhaps some drinks.   They would of course overprice this, but as long as it's not more than buying a decent cooler, people would go for it over those cheap ones, that can't keep ice long and run a risk of leaking into the nice rental cars in any event.   There's other stuff that could go into the road-trip kit, ranging from walkie-talkies to umbrellas to snacks, too.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>You may have heard of the idea of pollution credit trading.  I&#8217;ve been pointed to two firms that are selling CO2 credits on the retail level for individuals, to offset the output from driving a car, heating a house etc.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll get into the details on how it works a bit below, but if you have a car like mine that is putting out 5  metric tons of CO2 each year, you can for a low price (about $50, which includes a whopping markup) pay a factory somewhere to cut their own output by 5 tons, meaning that net, you are causing zero emissions.   Which means you are reducing total emissions by a lot more than you would by switching to a Prius, and you are doing it at a vastly lower cost.  (This doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t drive a Prius, it just means this is a lot more effective.)</p>

<p>Normally pollution credits are traded only by the big boys, trading contracts with hundreds or thousands of tonnes of emissions.  The retail firms are letting small players get in the game.</p>

<p>This is a fabulous idea, in theory at least, and also a great, if sneaky gift idea.  After all, if you buy the gift of not polluting for your loved one all they get is a bumper sticker and a good feeling.  At least it&#8217;s better than giving to The Human Fund in their name.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the catch.  I went and priced the credits, and while <a href="http://www.certifiedcleancar.com">www.certifiedcleancar.com</a> wanted $50 to credit my car, the actual price of credits on the Chicago Climate Exchange is about $2.16 per tonne of CO2, or about $8 for my actual output as they calculated it.    One expects some markup, of course, and even some profit for the company selling the retail credits, but this is nuts.  I called the other company, <a href="http://www.terrapass.com">Terrapass</a> and got reasonably frank answers.  First of all, they claim they invest more in wind power and other truly non-polluting forms of energy more than they just buy carbon credits.   Secondly, this is still a small volume thing, and most of the costs are not the credits, but the $20,000 or so to become a member of the exchange, or so I was told.  And of course, in small volumes, administrative costs can swamp the real costs.</p>

<p>Another outfit I found is <a href="http://www.carbonfund.org">carbonfund.org</a> which is non-profit and cheaper.  In some sense since people buy these out of guilt rather than compulsion (they were meant to be forced on polluters to give money to non polluters and make a market) non-profit might make sense, but they are also supposed to be a real market.</p>

<p>Still, if I pay $50, I would love for my $50 to mostly go to reducing pollution, not mostly to administration.  Usually when exchanges are expensive there are members who will trade for you at much more modest markups.  The folks at Terrapass said they were not yet profitable at the current prices.</p>

<p>And it is such a good idea.   Read below for more on pollution credits. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/retail-carbon-credits-car-driver">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

    <div class="content"><p>Yesterday I visited <a href="http://tagcamp.org">Tag Camp</a> an impromptu weekend conference on tagging in the spirit of Foo Camp and the <a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/node/262">Bar Camp</a> I wrote about earlier.   User-applied tagging has become all the rage on sites like fickr and del.icio.us.   I was pleased when one person at the conference saw my name and said, &#8220;hey you started all this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well I didn&#8217;t really.  Tagging is of course an ancient concept, espcially for personal use.  And it&#8217;s been done formally by professionals like librarians in card catalogs and online databases.</p>

<p>However, back in 1983, in one of my many forays into fixing USENET&#8217;s newsgroup system, I drafted an RFC of sorts around the idea of a tag (or keyword) based USENET.  I called it K News, or Keyword based News, and posted the <a href="http://www.templetons.com/brad/knews.txt">KNews URFC</a></p>

<p>As today, people were of mixed opinions about tagging.  You can see some of the discussion via Google Groups.  It never went very far, but a standard &#8220;Keywords&#8221; header was added to the the USENET standard.  Some used it but there was no critical mass.  I wrote the <a href="http://www.templetons.com/newsclip.html">newsclip</a> filtering language which was able to filter on the tags.  And for 18 years we have been tagging posts in rec.humor.funny with tags ranging from how funny the joke is, to whom it might be offensive to and so on.  I don&#8217;t know how many people really use the tags to filter the group (it&#8217;s low volume) but I used them to build the web site for the newsgroup (which is of course <a href="http://www.netfunny.com/rhf/">netfunny.com</a>.</p>

<p>Now, as noted tagging is the hot topic in online community and publishing.  I lost faith in the concept, deciding users could not self-tag well enough.   However, today the net is so big that even though users indeed do not self-tag well, you get enough people who do tag in ways you like to get useful stuff.</p>

<p>Of course, many of the people excited about tagging are in that state because they see it as a means to find even more cool stuff on the web.  I&#8217;ve been moving to the camp that wants to find <em>less</em> stuff, higher quality stuff.  There&#8217;s already too much good stuff to read, too much good stuff I have to discard.  I can&#8217;t even read the blogs of my friends let alone all the truly interesting folks I don&#8217;t know.  I hope that tags might help us along that path somehow, though it&#8217;s not the area of research right now.</p>

<p>But I thought a pointer to the history might be of use.</p>

        <h2 class="title"><a href="/node/285">Free incoming vs. pools of cellular minutes</a></h2>    <span class="submitted">Submitted by <a href="/user/brad" title="View user profile." rel="nofollow">brad</a> on Thu, 2005-10-27 01:53.</span>
    <span class="taxonomy"><ul class="links inline"><li class="first last taxonomy_term_17"><a href="/archives/cat_telecom.html" rel="tag" title="" class="taxonomy_term_17">Telecom</a></li>
</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>As noted, in Australia, I picked up a SIM at the airport for my unlocked phone.  Australia, like Europe and most other places outside North America, uses a system where incoming calls to cell phones are paid by the caller, and are free to the  mobile owner.  As you may know, in North America and a small number of other countries, the mobile owner pays for airtime on incoming calls, and they look like ordinary landline calls to the caller.</p>

<p>In fact, in North America, there&#8217;s no easy way for an ordinary consumer to even know a number is a mobile, since you can port landline numbers to cell phones.  In Australia, cell phones have their own state-code, so you know when you are calling them, and with a bit of memorizing, you also know which mobile company they belong to, which turns out to be important &#8212; because many mobile companies offer cheap or free calling between two phones on the same carrier (in both systems.)  Some mobile companies have cross deals and offer cheap/free calling to any other mobile phone.</p>

<p>The cost to call these caller-pays phones is quite high, anywhere from 20 to 30 cents per minute.  In fact, today, these caller-pays cell phones are the most expensive phones in the developed world to call.  From here in California, using VoIP, I can call Australian land lines for 2 cents/minute, while it&#8217;s 22 cents/minute to call a mobile.</p>

<p>So which is better?  Europeans argued that because incoming calls are free, people were less afraid to give out mobile numbers, and that spurred the faster deployment of cellular.  But in the USA and Canada, people buy giant bundles of minutes that have gotten so cheap they tend to not care that much about the cost of the incoming calls or outgoing ones.
When you do care, however (especially with some of the high per minute costs) the free-incoming argument is that you should not have to pay for a call you didn&#8217;t necessarily choose to have happen.</p>

<p>Since I was just there for a few weeks, I did not buy a plan with tons of minutes.  So I definitely noticed my own sense about calling out vs. receiving.  Most people don&#8217;t seem too bothered by calling a mobile.  It depends on how much you notice phone costs.   It is useful to know that you are calling a mobile, not simply for cost, but because you want to know if you&#8217;re interrupting somebody.  However, that stands in the way of highly useful number portability.</p>

<p>(In my expected future where the phone number goes away, number portability becomes less important.  Each person&#8217;s name/number might have a standard suffix for home, mobile, work, pager, fax etc.)</p>

<p>The arguments are present for both sides, but the big issue I see is that there is no competition in the cost of calls to mobiles.   Even though the carriers are happily selling mobile to mobile minutes for near-free, the ability to bill the caller for incoming calls is a cash cow they have no incentive to reduce.   As I indicated earlier, there were carriers advertising they would rebate customers some of the money paid in these heavy charges to landline callers.  One could imagine a phone that is free, as long as you get enough incoming minutes to pay for your outgoing ones.  Hardly fair.</p>

<p>Carriers might, in a more complex regime, be able to charge less to landline callers calling mobiles, but it&#8217;s hard to say if this would be a big competitive advantage, so has anybody done it?  So what can bring the price down as the cost dwindles the way it has?</p>

<p>If you can&#8217;t tell that you&#8217;re calling a mobile (as in the USA) then the US model is really the only choice.  You don&#8217;t want to see yourself dinged high fees for what you thought was a local call.  The US model was that since I decided to have an expensive cell phone, the airtime was my problem.   This model has lead to lots of competition on pricing for airtime in general.  Now monthly plans with less than 300 minutes are rare, and they&#8217;re under 10 cents &#8212; well under in the larger plans, and often unlimited in off-peak periods.</p>

<p>Which system do you like better?</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Of course, if you don't answer your cell phone it goes to voice mail and plays your pre-recorded message.</p>
<p>But what we need are phones which can answer and play a pre-recorded message for a short time.  In particular a message of the form, "Hold on, I'm in a meeting and must keep silent.  However, I'm walking out of the meeting right now while you hear this recording, and in a few seconds I'll be able to talk to you.  Hold on...  Still walking..."</p>
<p>This could be a special answer button on a phone (with the carrier doing nothing) or you could just press a number button (DTMF) or other button right after answer and the cell carrier could receive that and start playing the audio to the caller until you press another button or simply start speaking at full volume into the mic.   This latter system would work with any phone, and you could choose from several options to play, including "Hold on, I'm actively driving" and so on.</p>
<p>At a recent conference they asked people not just to put phones on vibrate, but to turn them off unless you're a doctor-on-call.  They declared that people getting up (and often briefly talking) was becoming too much of a disruption in meetings.   A feature like this could be some of a stopgap.</p>
<p>It could also be implemented in a headset, particularly a bluetooth one, so you could use it with multiple phones.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>When I visit a foreign place, it&#8217;s interesting to note what everyday things are done differently there, what&#8217;s caught on and what hasn&#8217;t.  (P.S. I now have my <a href="/node/289">panoramas</a> up.)</p>

<p>In Australia, almost every toilet has two flush buttons, one for a &#8220;half flush&#8221; (often really a 2/3) for #1 and a full flush for #2.  This is presumably mandated by law, and one hopes it saves a lot of water.  I&#8217;ve often thought that homes should install cheaper urinals to save water as well.   In public toilets, all lower-end gent&#8217;s rooms have a stainless steel &#8220;wall&#8221; urinal which feels less private to people used to independent units.  More disquieting are the ones with a grate in front of the wall that you stand on, so your &#8220;wee&#8221; flows under you.  I&#8217;ve seen these wall urinals in many other places of course, not just Australia.</p>

<p>Almost every Aussie motel room has a toaster in it.  No bread, just a toaster.  The toast marketing board has done their job well in Australia, though some Aussies insisted it was for British tourists.  And of course, always milk, meaning they often provide a fridge even in cheaper rooms.  The minibar milk is free, too.  Of course at 240v, the kettles are super-fast for that morning cuppa.</p>

<p>Urban hotels have that annoying &#8220;insert your room key&#8221; slot to turn on power and heating/AC in the room.  I&#8217;ve seen that around Asia and other places as well.  In some hotels one plug is still on with the card out so you can charge your computer.  In others no plug is online, however everybody knows you can stick any plastic card in the slot, so you leave a card in to recharge your devices.</p>

<p>In Victoria and South Australia, there was a massive campaign on the highways against sleepy driving, with signs literally every few miles asking sleepy drivers to pull over, and free coffee for drivers at most roadside stops.</p>

<p>In the Northern Territory, you will often see &#8220;Road Trains&#8221; which are trucks trailing 3 trailers at once.  Sounds hard to turn around&#8230;  With a new railway in place from Darwin to Alice, this has probably cut back on these.   Are they not legal in the USA for safety reasons?  Seems more efficient.   (Pictures to come.)</p>

<p>There seems to be less free wireless in urban Australia, though I didn&#8217;t actually wardrive much.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll write more about this later, but I noticed that mobile phone packages there are all sold with a &#8220;cap&#8221; system.  The mobile calling rate is very high &#8212; 40 to 80 cents/minute for local calls to landlines &#8212; but you typically end up buying $50 of airtime or more and getting $230 more &#8220;free&#8221;, at least that was the plan on Vodaphone, the SIM I bought.  So if you only wanted a little airtime you paid through the nose, but if you used a lot, the price worked out OK.   Like Europe, the caller pays for your airtime when they phone you, incoming calls to your cell are free.  Some carriers are rebating some of the money paid by the caller back to the recipient.  That will have interesting consequences.</p>

<p>Australia uses 240v (highest in the world) and all plugs must have a tiny switch on the socket (called a powerpoint, probably to the dismay of Microsoft) to disable it to avoid sparks when plugging things in and out.  Other high-voltage countries also have the mini-switch.     Their 2-prong plug, though now rarely used, is inherently polarized and different from everywhere else in the world except NZ.  However, their new standards for grounded plugs with shielding against touching the live conductor produce giant bulky plugs and power cords.  We could all use a smart power system like the universal DC (&amp;AC) system I have propsed elsewhere in the blog.  Australian switches are to us, upside-down, just like Australians.</p>

<p>And of course, Australia has the Timtam.   However, the pleasure of that is countered by the their yukky favourite spread, Kraft Vegemite.</p>

<p><strong>Updated Notes</strong>: A commenter asked about tipping.  Indeed, at first you get &#8220;sticker shock&#8221; in Aussie restaurants.  There you might easily see a main course at $30, but that&#8217;s really $22.50 and then the tax and tip are included so you can more properly treat it as $18 in California.  Australians differed to me on whether you don&#8217;t tip at all, tip only with superb service, tip only in cheaper places or tip 5% on capable service.  Cabs you don&#8217;t tip but round up to the nearest dollar.  Australia wisely got rid of the penny several years ago.</p>

<p>As to which method is better?  Well, optional tipping does give you the ability to control how much you pay for service, and do it after you&#8217;ve been able to judge it.  On the surface that sounds good for the customer, but we also seem to like seeing the real price in advance.  For example, I feel that visible taxes are better (as in Canada and USA) but the GST is always included in Australia now, by law, so you pay the price cited.  The latter is more convenient, the former makes it more clear what&#8217;s going on.</p>

<p>Note that while I found Aussie servers and clerks to be exceptionally friendly, at several meals, including at very expensive places, I got decidedly slow service that would have rated a punative tip.  Too anecdotal to come to a conclusion though.</p>

<p>More notes:  Fish and chips are the Australian national meal, but they don&#8217;t serve them with vinegar as in the UK and Canada.  No worries, mate,  (The Australian national catchphrase) they&#8217;ll bring some.</p>

<p>They usually mistake a Canadian for an American.  (Horror of horrors.)  Can&#8217;t blame them, my own accent sounds like neither, but you can tell I&#8217;m from North America so it&#8217;s not an inappropriate guess.</p>

<p>Australian airport security was a breath of fresh air after so much travel in North America.  &#8220;No worries, mate.&#8221;
Check in with luggage recently increased to 30 minutes before takeoff.  Keep your shoes on.   One hour in advance for a flight from Cairns to Sydney which used the international terminal.  (It&#8217;s a plane from Japan that continues on and the pax clear custons in Sydney so the domestic customers join an international flight with a special sticker which lets them bypass customs.  Turns out to be a giant security hole &#8212; a foreign tourist could carry on or check a bag of contraband and the domestic passenger could take it through customs.  I presume they have random checks to deter this.)</p>

<p>On the other hand domestic flights on Qantas allow only one checked bag (32kg) and one 7kg carry-on.  A mess for the international traveller who came in possibly with 2 checked bags due to the 22kg limit of most airlines and a heavy
carry-on.  Fortuantely they only enforced the carry-on rule on me once and just let me split it into two bags.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, they got rid of the penny years ago.   Very nice.  Took me quite a while to notice I wasn&#8217;t getting any pennies in change.</p>

<p>More to come on Australia.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Recently I purchased an external battery for my Thinkpad.  The internal batteries were getting weaker, and I also needed something for the 14 hour overseas flights.  I picked up a generic one on eBay, a 17 volt battery with about 110 watt-hours, for about $120.  It's very small, and only about 1.5 lbs.   Very impressive for the money.  (When these things first came out they had half the capacity and cost more like $300.)</p>
<p>There are downsides to an external: The laptop doesn't know how much charge is in the battery and doesn't  charge it.  You need an external charger.  My battery came with its own very tiny charger which is quite slow (it takes almost a day to recharge from a full discharge.)  The battery has its own basic guage built in, however.   An external is not as efficient as an internal (you convert the 17v to the laptop's internal voltage and you also do wasteful charging of the laptop's internal if it is not full, though you can remove the internal at the risk of a sudden cutoff should you get to the end of the external's life.)</p>
<p>However, the plus is around 9 to 10 hours of life in a small, cheap package, plus the life of your laptop's internal battery.  About all you need for any flight or long day's work.</p>
<p>It's so nice that in fact I think it's a meaningful alternative to the power jacks found on some airlines, usually only in business class.  I bought an airline adapter a few years ago for a similar price to this battery, and even when I have flown in business class, half the time the power jack has not been working properly.  Some airlines have power in coach but it's rare.  And it costs a lot of money for the airlines to fit these 80 watt jacks in lots of seat, especially with all the safety regs on airlines.</p>
<p>I think it might make more sense for airlines to just offer these sorts of batteries, either free or for a cheap rental fee.  Cheaper for them and for passengers than the power jacks.  (Admittedly the airline adapter I bought has seen much more use as a car and RV adapter.)  Of course they do need to offer a few different voltages (most laptops can take a range) but passengers could reserve a battery with their flight reservation to be sure they get the right one.</p>
<p>It would be even cheaper for airlines to offer sealed lead-acid batteries.   You can buy (not rent) an SLA with over 200 watt-hours (more than you need for any flight) for under $20!  The downside is they are very heavy (17lbs) but if you only have to carry it onto the plane from the gate this may not be a giant barrier.</p>
<p>Of course, what would be great would be a standard power plug on laptops for external batteries, where the laptop could use the power directly, and measure and charge the external.  Right now the battery is the first part to fail in a laptop, and as such you want to replace batteries at different times from laptops.  This new external should last me into my next laptop if it is a similar voltage.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>One of the more interesting results in human sexuality was the <a href="http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/2002/20020120-aroma.html">study</a> that revealed that women prefer the smell of men whose immune systems are the most different from their own.  In the study, women were given a variety of men&#8217;s T-shirts (used) and asked which ones smelled the most appealing.   It was found they liked the most men who had different genetic immunities from their own. (I&#8217;m not sure just how they determined this immune system mapping.)  This makes sense, we want to breed children with combined immunities &#8212; opposites should attract in this case.</p>

<p>If the mapping is not too expensive, this seems like a good basis for a dating service.  Of course do the other things dating services are doing, matching interests etc.  But also add &#8220;chemistry&#8221; of which smell is an important though not complete part.   Many people complain that computer dating matches them up with interesting friends but there is often no spark.  A dating service that could offer chemistry as well as compatibility could do very well&#8230;</p>

<p>(Of course if the immune map is too expensive to build, one could do it the old fashioned way, with a gallery of T-shirts at the office.  First find the partners you are compatible with in other ways, then pull out the shirts and see who passes the smell test.)</p>

<p>Note: I&#8217;m now back from Australia and at Foresight&#8217;s Nanotech conference.   Later I will be writing a lot about my observations in Australia, and later still putting up a large array of photos.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I&#8217;ve arrived this morning in Melbourne, a very pleasant city in which I haven&#8217;t allocated enough time, as per usual.  Lots of interesting food, seems very livable with great transit, pleasant spaces and parks and architecture.  And also surveillance cameras, everywhere.  And warnings about stopping terrorism even though there hasn&#8217;t really been much here.</p>

<p>Once again I wish there were simple agencies to rent you all your tourist things so you didn&#8217;t have to pack them or worry about them.  As I wished for before, there was a Vodaphone store in the airport arrivals lounge that sold me a SIM card for $30, though to get a really good deal you have to buy another $50 (AUS, 37.5 USD) of airtime.</p>

<p>My tour will take me now to Adelaide briefly, then up to Darwin to stay in Kakadu national park, then to Cairns (reef, of course) and finally ending in Sydney on the 17th, including speaking at the AUUG open source and unix conference on the 19th.  Should be a great trip, and I&#8217;ll try to blog other observations about Australia.</p>

<p>Some immediate ones:  Most people have told me they felt australians were great friendly people.  My cab driver (black) said he loved Australia except the people were the most unfriendly in the world&#8230;   Race may have something to do with this, I fear.  I&#8217;m told my (barely) Canadian accent will sound sexy here.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Recently I attended a panel that covered, among other things the universal service fund.   This fund, which you usually see as an add-on on your phone bill, taxes urban phone users (through their interstate carriers) to subsidize local phone service for the poor, the rural, schools and health care.   Sounds noble, but it collected over 5 billion dollars in 2002, and now the question has come about how to apply it to the internet now that people are making phone calls over the internet.</p>

<p>The panel was asked to explain the purpose of the fund, and they cited the various reasons above.  There are people who live very far from cities to whom it would not be economical to run phone wires to at their real cost, etc.   I suggested the purpose of the USF was to transfer money to the states of senators who support it from the states of senators who don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Established telcos, who pay into the USF (though often also get paid out of it) are pushing to apply it to VoIP telcos.  They want barriers to entry against the upstart competitors.</p>

<p>Why the cynical view?  As I noted previously in the blog, friends and I decided last month to bring internet and phone service to Burning Man, in the Black Rock desert, which is about as rural and remote as it gets in the lower 48 states.   We did it just for a lark, on the budget of just a few private individuals &#8212; admittedly richer than average individuals, but nowhere near corporate budgets.</p>

<p>We were able to do that through the use of the tons of revolutionary low cost technologies that have appeared due to the deregulation of unlicenced spectrum and VoIP.   And the cost of that is just getting lower every day.</p>

<p>The truth is, today you can provide phone service to the poor, and schools, and hospitals, and a great deal of the rural, for a lower price than the urban people were getting &#8220;cheap&#8221; phone service when it was decided to tax it.  And that trend is going to continue, especially if more spectrum is opened up to unlicenced use or cognitive radio use.</p>

<p>I conceive of a relatively cheap solar powered box with motorized directional antennas which could be dropped by helicopter on ridgetops for about $3,000 (and falling.)  Somebody on the ground would aim the antennas to build a redundant mesh, and data/phone could reach just about anywhere cheaply, except the most remote corners of Alaska and a few other places.   This is just one plan.  The reality is that the exponential progress of bandwidth and radio technologies will provide others.  Instead of taxing the new technologies and those deploying them, free them to get real results.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>IPTV is the new buzzword for video over IP, in particular as it relates to DSL/phone companies wanting to compete with cable companies and give you TV using your DSL.   (The cable companies are hard at work at giving you phone service over your cable modem.)</p>

<p>I saw a demo of Microsoft&#8217;s IPTV product recently.   They talked about how they had this slick interface that could show you live thumbnails of what was on several other channels while a bigger box showed your current channel.  They said how doing it all at the central server (which could get access to all the live streams independently, unlike a typical tuner card or cable box) allowed this fancy multiplexing.</p>

<p>But then I asked them, &#8220;So, do you still watch live TV?&#8221;   They admitted that, like everbody else who gets a Tivo, MythTV, Ultimate TV or other PVR that they almost never watch live TV.  So why demo something that&#8217;s the wave of the past?   Mostly because it looks cool.</p>

<p>The dream of video on demand has been with us for decades and it&#8217;s a cool dream but a silly one.  Sure, it would be nice to be able to pull up anything from a giant catalog and watch it, but it turns out that watching delayed, even much delayed is fine.  &#8220;Netflix is video on demand with a very high latency,&#8221; I explained.</p>

<p>So why don&#8217;t the cable companies get it?  They are going all out to bring us 30 megabit aDSL to deliver this, and that&#8217;s great for a lot of other apps, but it turns out that with a PVR, a more modest 3 megabit (or even 1 megabit) can give you TV just fine, with some latency.  They should focus there instead of trying to put it all in the central server, where it will surely die.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Recently, I discovered something that others have known for a while but many don&#8217;t know.  Namely that effectively all modern cars that say they should use Premium (high-octane) gasoline run perfectly fine on regular.   Since the early 90s, cars have had more advanced carb/fuel-injector systems which adjust to the octane of the gas and don&#8217;t knock.   Like an idiot, I&#8217;ve been filling my car with premium.  The engineers at all the major car vendors have confirmed this.</p>

<p>I worked out that since the USA uses 370 million gallons of gas a day, or 135 billion per year, at 12% premium sales, that&#8217;s 16 billion gallons of premium sold, almost none of it needed.   Call it 15B gallons.   At a surcharge of 20 to 30 cents/gallon that&#8217;s over 3 billion extra dollars charged to no purpose in the USA, and presumably another 3 billion outside (though perhaps they buy less hi-test outside.)  The USA uses about 44% of world gasoline.</p>

<p>So why do many cars come with a line in the owner&#8217;s manual saying to use premium gasoline?  Turns out the marketing departments believe customers of higher-end cars are ethralled by horsepower.  They want to advertise the highest peak horsepower number they can.   And you can deliver a slightly higher peak horsepower on higher octane.   Nothing so big that you would notice it outside of extreme driving conditions or pro racing, but you can publish a higher number.  So long as you spec the car as using premium.</p>

<p>So to satisfy these marketing numbers, the world is spending about 6 billion extra bucks each year on high octane fuel.  And I&#8217;m not even considering all the extra infrastructure required (fancier pumps and blending systems, more tanks with risk to leak into the ground etc.)</p>

<p>Many people think high-octane gasoline is &#8220;more powerful.&#8221;  In fact, oddly, the octane rating measures how non-explosive the fuel is.  The higher the octane, the less likely it will explode under pressure.   People think of high-octane fuel as more powerful because with high octane fuel, you can design a higher performance car that works at higher compression, safe in the knowledge you won&#8217;t get explosions from anything but the spark plug, ie. knocking.  The fuel is not higher power, it&#8217;s the engine, which is why putting premium into a regular car is a waste unless it&#8217;s knocking.  Lead cheaply reduces knocking at low pressure which is why they used to add it until they realized, &#8220;holy crap, we&#8217;re filling our fuel with toxic lead!&#8221;</p>

<p>There is still controversy over whether high-compression engines get better mileage than when they run at lower compression with regular.</p>

<p>What a scam.  Spread the word.</p>
