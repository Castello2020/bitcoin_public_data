    <div class="content"><p>By now, you&#8217;ve probably heard of the <a href="http://you-really-clicked-on-this.com?">proposal from the White House</a> to abolish April Fool&#8217;s Day as a national holiday starting in 2015.   Some in the comedy community are upset at the end of an old tradition and a day devoted to what we love.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s time to face facts.  It&#8217;s just not working any more.   When I was a kid, April 1st was mostly a day of physical pranks or very short gags.   You would replace the sugar with salt or put a white powder in an envelope.   But the internet changed it and made every gag global.</p>

<p>The key to a good gag was the person believing in the gag and then suddenly remembering what day it was.   If you were lucky they didn&#8217;t clue in and you could exclaim &#8220;April Fool&#8221; for much hilarity.</p>

<p>It was common in days past for people to forget what day it was.  One of my best pranks came decades ago, when I posted in Science Fiction forums on April 1 that Fred Saberhagen&#8217;s  &#8220;<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserker_(Saberhagen)>Berserker</a>&#8221; novels were a rip-off of the fine original Battlestar Galactica series.   Over 70 different people posted rants about how stupid I was, and a serious fraction of them pointed out that the Saberhagen books long predated Galactica, and said things like &#8220;why don&#8217;t you check the dates on what you read?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, nobody is surprised.   Google has 13 different gags up today, including one on the front page.  Every major web site has a gag, many have long traditions.   Perhaps somebody is briefly surprised by the first one, but generally everybody knows what day it is and nobody is fooled.</p>

<p>Some have proposed that the national Fool&#8217;s day be moved to a random day each year, with not much promotion done about what the date is.   People who were funny (or thought they were funny) would make sure they knew the date.  I am not sure that&#8217;s enough &#8212; it would help make the first gag a surprise but soon the tolerance would build up.</p>

<p>A bit better is the proposal from then National Comedy &amp; Gag Association to have a different day in each state, as proclaimed by the Governor, or even every city.  This would allow surprise because when you read jokes from other geographic regions, you might see only half a dozen on any given day.  You would then have to research the location of the joke and check to see if that location is having its local Fool&#8217;s day that day.</p>

<p>Can anything restore the sanctity of this holiday?   It may be that this is one thing the internet has destroyed.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Spokesmen for the MPAA, RIAA and several other content industry companies recently issued a statement of support for the new &#8220;Stop Airline Piracy Act&#8221; or SAPA, now before congress.</p>

<p>SAPA seeks to address the massive tide of copyright infringing material flowing into the USA on commercial airlines and delivery services.  Today in China and many other countries, bootleg DVDs, CDs and software disks are being manufactured in bulk, and sold to visitors on the streets of these cities in illicit malls.  Then, these visitors fly back to the USA with the pirate disks in their suitcases, taking them into the USA.   Other Americans are ordering these pirate DVDs and having them shipped via both airlines and other shippers directly to their homes.</p>

<p>SAPA addresses this problem by giving content owners tools to cut down this pirate flow.  A content owner, once they learn of an airline or shipping service which is regularly and repeatedly bringing pirated material into the country, can file claims alleging the presence of this infringement.   The bill allows them to shut off the flow of money, traffic and customers to the airlines, by getting US companies to stop directing people to the airlines, and stopping payment services from transferring money to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Last month, we worked with customs and border patrol to inspect planes coming into LAX from overseas,&#8221; said Pearl Alley, a spokesperson for the MPAA.   &#8220;We found that every single plane of an unnamed airline had pirated material in passenger bags or in the hold.  Not just a few planes, every single plane.  Most planes had multiple pirated products, including DVDs and CDs, and files on laptops and music players.&#8221;   Customs is able to seize any laptop or music player coming into the country for any reason and copy its drive to see what&#8217;s on it, according to CBP officials.</p>

<p>&#8220;These airlines and shippers are enabling and facilitating infringement.  This has got to be stopped, and SAPA will stop it,&#8221; said Alley.</p>

<p>Under SAPA, an airline alleged to have been regularly carrying in pirated material can be blacklisted.  Travel agents will be forbidden from booking passengers on the airline.  Travel web sites can be ordered not to list flights or even the existence of the airline.  Phone book and Yellow page companies can be ordered to remove any listings for the airline, and in some cases, phone switches can be ordered to not complete calls directed at airline phone numbers.  Travel review books and sites can be ordered edited to delete mention of the airline or recommendations to fly on it.</p>

<p>To shut off the money flow, an accusation of alleged infringement under SAPA can result in an order to Visa, Mastercard, Paypal and other financial processors to not accept payments for the airline or shipping company.  &#8220;They may be overseas, but we can stop them from destroying American jobs with tools we have at home,&#8221; said Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), co-sponsor of the senate version of the bill.</p>

<p>Airports can also be prohibited from allowing the planes to land.  However, planes in the air can file a counter-notice within 5 days of a claim, providing they subject themselves to US jurisdiction and agree to be liable if they are found to have copyright material in their holds.    Aircraft which can&#8217;t file a counter notice are free to turn around on approach to LAX and return over the Pacific, but may not land at any airport in a country which has signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement with the USA.</p>

<p>&#8220;Legitimate Airlines, ones that are not carrying in pirated material every day, will not be harmed by this act, because of the counter-notice provision.  In addition, if a rightsholder files a false claim, and there are no copyright violations on board the plane, the airline has a right to sue for damages over misuse of the act &#8212; so it&#8217;s all safe and does not block legitimate trade,&#8221; said Alley.</p>

<p>Several airlines, travel agencies and travel sites have, not surprisingly, filed opposition to this bill, but it is supported by a broad coalition of US job creators in Hollywood and Redmond, as well as domain name site GoDaddy.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Yesterday, Don Henley (of the Eagles) penned an <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/2011-08-21-counterfeit-copyright-protect-ip-act_n.htm">editorial in USA Today</a> supporting the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/05/plus-ca-change-protect-ip-domain-name-system-and">Protect IP Act</a> (PIPA) which has serious free speech implications and turns web sites into copyright police.   Don called out both the EFF (of which I am a Director) and Google (which is a consulting client of mine) so I have this whimsical response for him:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Take it Easy</em>, Don.   <em>There&#8217;s a New Kid in Town</em>, and it&#8217;s called the
  Internet.  <em>Get Over It</em>.  <em>I Can&#8217;t Tell you Why</em>, but in <em>The Long Run</em>,
  there isn&#8217;t going to be <em>a Heartache Tonight</em>.  <em>One of these Nights</em> I hope
  you&#8217;ll understand that for search engines to <em>Take it To the Limit</em>,
  they can&#8217;t be forced to police every search result. </p>
  
  <p>Internet companies
  only grow when living <em>Life in the Fast Lane</em>, able to operate, innovate
  and design products without needing to check for permission from the
  music industry.  If every time you wrote a song you had to worry about
  what every user who plays it and every store that sells it might do with
  it, you would lose your <em>Peaceful, Easy Feeling</em> quickly. Big companies
  might run filters, but if the small ones had needed to they would be
  <em>Already Gone</em>.</p>
  
  <p><em>The Best of My Love</em>,</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Brad Templeton, EFF</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>PS: Henley really is a great musician, and I do understand his frustration with people who don&#8217;t pay him for his work.  But click <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/05/plus-ca-change-protect-ip-domain-name-system-and">the link</a> above for EFF&#8217;s explanation of why this sort of approach isn&#8217;t really going to help musicians and will do real damage to the way people use computers and the internet.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I discovered this year that something I&#8217;ve seen a zillion times, the standard map of Canada, features a giant, brain-eating zombie.   I&#8217;m naming the zombie &#8220;Hudson&#8221; because that&#8217;s the Bay that makes up most of him.  He&#8217;s a plump undead with stubby legs, a big blank eye (Price Charles Island,) and a slack jaw, and it looks like Newfoundland is in trouble.</p>

<p><img class=fullpic  src=/files/canada-zombie.jpg></p>

<p>The way the human mind likes to find figures and faces in natural patterns is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pareidolia" title="reference on pareidolia" target="_blank">pareidolia</a> but what surprises me is that in spite of seeing this map so often, I never saw Hudson until recently, and based on web searches, neither has anybody else.</p>

<p>But now I find it difficult to look at the regular map, without highlights, and not see the zombie.</p>

<p><img class=fullpic src=/files/canada.jpg></p>

<p>He is so big he may be a cosmological zombie.  They eat &#8220;branes, branes.&#8221;</p>

    <div class="content"><p><strong>New Update, April 2010</strong>:  Yes, even this parody video has been taken down though the YouTube Content-ID takedown system &#8212; just as my version of Hitler says he is going to do at the end.   I filed a dispute, and it seems that now you can watch it again on  YouTube, at least until Constantin responds as well as on Vimeo.   <strong>I have a <a href="/studio-does-content-id-takedown-my-hitler-video-about-takedowns">new post about the takedown with more details</a></strong>.  In addition, YouTube issued an official statement to which <a href="/youtube-makes-statement-content-id-takedowns">I responded</a>.</p>

<p>Unless you&#8217;ve been under a rock, you have probably seen a parody clip that puts new subtitles on a scene of Hitler ranting and raving from the 2004 German movie <em>Downfall</em> (<em>Der Untergang</em>).  Some of these videos have gathered millions of views, with Hitler complaining about how he&#8217;s been banned from X-box live, or nobody wants to go to Burning Man, or his new camera sucks.   The phenomenon even rated a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/26/magazine/26wwln-medium-t.html">New York Times article</a>.</p>

<p>It eventually spawned meta-parodies, where Hitler would rant about how many Hitler videos were out on the internet, or how they sucked.  I&#8217;ve seen at least 4 of these.  Remarkably, one of them, called <a href="http://www.sean-o.com/blog/index.php/2008/10/25/hitler-is-a-meme-2/">Hitler is a Meme</a> was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6CsG4pPCMA">pulled from YouTube by the studio</a>, presumably using a DMCA takedown.  A few others have also been pulled, though many remain intact.  (More on that later.)</p>

<p>Of course, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzUoWkbNLe8">I had to do my own</a>.  I hope, even if you&#8217;ve seen a score of these, that this one will still give you some laughs.  If you are familiar with the issues of DRM, DMCA takedowns, and copyright wars, I can assure you based on the reviews of others that you will enjoy this quite a bit.   Of course, as it criticises YouTube as well as the studio, I have put it on YouTube.  But somehow I don&#8217;t think they would be willing to try a takedown &#8212; not on so obvious a fair use as this one, not on the chairman of the most noted legal foundation in the field.  But it&#8217;s fun to dare them.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>The strike by screenwriters in the Porn Writers Guild of America is wreaking
a less public havoc on the pornography industry.  Porn writers, concerned
about declining revenue from broadcast TV, also seek a greater share of
revenue from the future growth areas of DVD and online sales.</p>

<p>&#8220;Online sales and DVD may one day be the prime sources of revenue in
our industry,&#8221; stated union spokesman Seymour Beaver.   We want to be
sure we get our fair share of that for providing the writing that makes
this industry tick.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting terrible,&#8221; reported one porn consumer who refused to
give his name.  &#8220;I just saw Horny Nurses 14 and I have to tell you
it was just a reshash of the plots from Horny Nurses 9 and 11.  It&#8217;s
like they didn&#8217;t even have a writer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fans are not going to put up with movies lacking in plot, character
and dialogue, and that&#8217;s what they&#8217;ll get if they don&#8217;t meet our
terms,&#8221; said Beaver.   Beaver, who claims to have a copyright on
the line, &#8220;Oh yes, baby, do it just like that, oh yeah&#8221; says he
will not allow use of his lines without proper payment of residuals.</p>

<p>Some writers also fear that the move to online will result in
customers simply downloading individual scenes rather than
seeking movies with a cohesive story thread that makes you
care about the characters.   &#8220;I saw one movie with 5 scenes,
and no character was in 2 of them,&#8221; complained one writer.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do people want?  Movies where the actors just walk into
a room, strip and just go at it?   Where they always start with
oral sex, then doggy, and then a money shot?   Fans will walk
if that&#8217;s all they get,&#8221; according to PWGA member Dick Member.
&#8220;And don&#8217;t think about doing the lonely housewife and the pool-boy
again.  I own that.&#8221;</p>

<p>An industry spokesman said they had not yet seen any decline
in revenues due to the strike, as they have about 2 million
already-written scripts on the shelves.  In addition, Hot
Online Corporation spokesman Ivana Doit claimed their company
is experimenting with a computer program that creates scripts
through a secret algorithm.   Scripts penned by the computer have
already brought in a million in sales, claims Doit, but she would
not indicate which films this applied to.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>It was an interesting experience watching our team argue before the U.S. District Court of Appeals that the EFF&#8217;s lawsuit against AT&amp;T for helping the NSA spy on conversations without warrants should be dismissed because it impinges on state secrets.   While the judges probed both sides, I read some signs from their grilling of the U.S. Government&#8217;s lawyer that they really have some concern over the important issues.  They appear to realize that we can&#8217;t leave such programs completely without judicial oversight just because an NSA official declares them to be state secrets.</p>

<p>As one judge said, &#8220;are we supposed to bow down&#8221; before such declarations?</p>

<p>Anyway, this inspired me to make up a new list of all the different classifications for secret information:</p>

<ol>
<li>Unclassified (Ordinary documents)</li>
<li>Sensitive (to delay FOIA)</li>
<li>Double Super Secret (For Time Magazine Only)</li>
<li>Treated as Top Secret (Non-secret document from Vice President&#8217;s Office)</li>
<li>Leakable (Identity of covert agents married to those causing political trouble)</li>
<li>Secret</li>
<li>Top Secret</li>
<li>SCI (Sensitive Compartmented Information)</li>
<li>Embarrassing (Highest possible classification)</li>

    <div class="content"><p>Something light hearted.  I purchased, some time ago, a small Li-Ion battery for external power for my laptop and other devices.  These batteries are great, getting down near $100, weighing very little and, with 110 watt-hours, able to keep a laptop going all day at a conference or over most of a transoceanic flight.</p>

<p>This particular battery, made in China, contains one of the more amusing bad-english warnings on the label, though, particularly item #3.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Steve Jobs of Apple Computer warned today that a rumoured cheap Chinese iPhone knockoff making its way toward America is an inferior product which lacks many of the important features of the iPhone.  &#8220;It may look a bit like an iPhone, but when consumers discover all the great iPhone features that are missing from it, we think they&#8217;ll still line up at Apple Stores for the genuine article,&#8221; said Jobs in a released statement.   Designed by software nerds, the knockoff, dubbed the &#8220;myPhone&#8221; by fans, has not yet been confirmed.</p>

<p><img class=blogpic src=http://pic.templetons.com/images/iphone2.jpg></p>

<p>Apple released a list of features reported to be missing from the &#8220;myPhone.&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li>The iPhone has special software that assures you will always use the trusted AT&amp;T cellular network.  Lacking this software, the myPhone accepts any SIM card from any random network.  Users may find themselves connected to a network that doesn&#8217;t have the reputation for service, trust and protecting the privacy of customers that AT&amp;T has.  Or its data speed which is almost double what we&#8217;re used to with dialup.</li>
<li>With the myPhone, users may be stuck without 2 years of guaranteed AT&amp;T service and won&#8217;t get their price locked in for 2 years.  AT&amp;T&#8217;s EDGE network is so good &#8220;you won&#8217;t find yourself able to quit.&#8221;</li>
<li>The iPhone is configured to assure you the latest iTunes experience.  The myPhone might function before you have installed the latest iTunes and registered your phone with it.  Indeed, the myPhone lacks the protections that block it from  being used without registering it with or reporting back to anybody, depriving the user of customer service and upsell opportunities.</li>
<li>The iPhone has special software that assures all applications run on the iPhone have been approved by Apple, which protects the user from viruses and tools that may make the user violate their licence agreements.  The myPhone will run any application, from any developer, opening up the user to all sorts of risks.</li>
<li>The iPhone protects users from dangerous Flash and Java applications which may compromise their device and confuse the user experience.</li>
<li>myPhones don&#8217;t forbid VoIP software that may cause the user to accidentally make calls over wireless internet connections instead of the AT&amp;T network.  Quality on the internet is unpredictable, as is the price, which can range down to zero, causing great pricing uncertainty.  With the iPhone, you always know what calls cost when in the USA.</li>
<li>The iPhone saves the user from receiving distracting instant messages over popular IM services, adding calm to your day.</li>
<li>Music and videos in the iPhone are protected by Apple <em>FairPlay</em> brand DRM.  On the myPhone, which lacks the important DRM functionality, music can be freely copied to other devices the user owns, putting the user at risk of infringing copyrights.</li>
<li>The iPhone assures users will only play media files in approved formats, and not risky open source formats.</li>
<li>The iPhone protects the user from setting a song in their device as a ringtone, saving those around him from annoyance and protecting the user from violating music copyrights and performance rights.</li>
<li>The iPhone bluetooth functions have careful security management.  Users are protected from using bluetooth to exchange files with other users (such files are risky) or accidentally printing or communicating with your computer.   Bluetooth is only used for headsets and headphones as was intended.   The myPhone lacks these important protections.</li>
<li>The iPhone only uses its internal flash drive.   The user is protected against hard drives, which have moving parts and can put data at risk.</li>
<li>The myPhone battery has a removable door over it, which can get lost, or allow the battery to fall out or be stolen.  The iPhone&#8217;s battery is solidly protected.  Users are also assured they will use only Apple certified batteries and not subject to the risk of aftermarket batteries, which may explode, killing the user.</li>
<li>The iPhone is for sale only in the USA and primarily for use there.  This encourages users to stay home in America which is good for the economy and their own peace of mind.</li>
<li>The iPhone, unlike the myPhone and all other cell phones, sells at a very solid markup for Apple, assuring Apple executives and stockholders will be happy, and the company will be around to support the iPhone for years to come.   The myPhone, it is rumoured, will be purchasable in a wide variety of stores, confusing the buyer with too much choice, price wars and depriving them of the special experience of an Apple or AT&amp;T store.</li>
<li>As a result, the myPhone lacks the Apple brand &#8220;coolness&#8221; which is built into the iPhone and every other Apple product.   &#8220;Nobody&#8217;s going to have to spend days in line for a myPhone,&#8221; said Jobs.  &#8220;You won&#8217;t have people thrusting them in your face all week to show you how cool they are.&#8221;  Many iPhone users report their experience waiting in line was great fun, and that they met all sorts of new people.</li>
</ul>

<p>MyPhones are predicted to sell for $350 without contract, $150 with a 2 year contract to the provider of your choice. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/jobs-warns-knockoff-iphone-lacks-many-key-features">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

    <div class="content"><p>Today, Congress passed 410-15 the Delete Telephony Online Predators act, or DTOPA.  This act requires all schools and libraries to by default block access to the social networking system called the &#8220;telephone.&#8221;    All libraries receiving federal funding, and schools receiving E-rate funding must immediately bar access to this network.   Blocks can be turned off, on request, for adults, and when students are under the supervision of an adult.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is not the end-all bill,&#8221; Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) said.
&#8220;But, we know sexual predators should not have the avenue of our 
schools and libraries to pursue their evil deeds.&#8221;   The &#8220;telephone&#8221; social network
allows voice conversation between a student and virtually any sexual predator
in the world.   Once a predator gets a child&#8217;s &#8220;number&#8221; or gives his number
to the child, they can speak at any time, no matter where the predator is in
the world. </p>

<p>Many children have taken to carrying small pocket &#8220;telephones&#8221; which can be signalled
by predators at any time.  Use of these will be prohibited.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>We all know that racecar drivers wear jumpsuits plastered with the logos of the companies that have sponsored them.</p>

<p>Why not have the same system for members of the legislature?  When they vote on bills, they would need to wear a suit with patches from Halliburton, Exxon, AT&amp;T or any other companies that have given them major contributions.  Larger contribution, larger patch.</p>

<p>Ok, not going to happen, but perhaps it&#8217;s less wild to suggest that as an alternative to having to register to donate money (which many people still feel is a violation of freedom of speech), we have politicians publish a list of all their donors, and the amount, for any given bill whom they feel have a special interest in the bill.  They would have to say the top entries while voting, and publish a complete written list.</p>

<p>They would need to be liberal in listing contributors, because if a relationship were revealed later it would look bad, and possibly criminal.  Ideally we would have a Caesar&#8217;s Wife approach, there they make sure to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>April 1, 2006, San Francisco, CA:  In a surprise move, Department of Justice (DoJ) attorneys filed a subpoena yesterday in federal court against the National Security Agency, requesting one million sample Google searches.  They plan to use the searches as evidence in their defence of the constitutionality of the Child Online Protection Act.</p>

<p>The DoJ had previously requested a subpoena against Google, Inc. itself for the records, but Google mounted a serious defence, resulting in much more limited data flow.   According to DoJ spokesperson Charles Miller, &#8220;Google was just putting up too much of a fight.  The other sites and ISPs mostly caved in quickly and handed over web traffic and search records without a fuss, but Google made it expensive for us.   We knew the NSA had all the records, so it seemed much simpler to just get them by going within the federal government.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yahoo, of course, gave in rather easily.  If they hadn&#8217;t, we could have just asked our friends in the Chinese government to demand the records.  Yahoo does whatever they say.&#8221;</p>

<p>The White House revealed in December that the NSA has been performing warrentless searches on international phone, e-mail and internet traffic after the New York Times broke the story.   Common speculation suggests they have been tapping other things, to data mine the vast sea of internet traffic, looking for patterns that might point to enemy activity.</p>

<p>&#8220;The NSA has the wires into all the hubs already, it&#8217;s just a lot faster for them to get this data.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can neither confirm nor deny we have these search records,&#8221; said an un-named NSA spokesperson.  &#8220;In fact, even asking if we have them makes you suspect.&#8221;</p>

<p>But what&#8217;s hilarious is to look at the adwords ads on the right side of the page, at least here in the bay area, some of them clearly aimed at Google employees!</p>

<p>Another stupid google trick:  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=http">Google for &#8220;http&#8221;</a> and you&#8217;ll find the most linked to sites on the web.  This doesn&#8217;t work as well as it used to.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Major retail chains Target, Wal-Mart and others announced today they will end the so-called war on white people that had resulted in most stores posting signs welcoming &#8220;shoppers&#8221; or &#8220;customers&#8221; instead of &#8220;white patrons&#8221;, even though white people represented a considerable majority of their business.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m white, and I&#8217;m here shopping for gifts for my white friends, and I&#8217;m offended that the store has been pressured into making some generic greeting that doesn&#8217;t reflect me.&#8221; said William O&#8217; Reilly, a concerned caucasian shopper.  &#8220;If they&#8217;re not going to welcome me and my race, I am going to take my business somewhere else.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s complaint, echoed by dozens, perhaps scores of other shoppers, has led the chains to alter their policies.   Signs declaring &#8220;Look good with today&#8217;s colors&#8221; will be replaced next year with &#8220;Look good in colors designed for white skin.&#8221;     The &#8220;Happy holidays&#8221; sign, recently changed to &#8220;Merry Christmas&#8221; will be further changed to &#8220;Merry Christmas for White America&#8221; to reflect the ethnicity and religion of 80% of the shoppers in the stores.</p>
