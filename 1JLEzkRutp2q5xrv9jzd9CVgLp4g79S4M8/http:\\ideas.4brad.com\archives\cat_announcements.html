    <div class="content"><p>The Robocars world tour continues.  Monday I will speak on robocars at the UAE Government conference in Dubai, where I just landed.  Then it&#8217;s off to talk about them at a private event in Singapore, but I&#8217;ll also visit teams there.  If I have time, I will check out Masdar &#8212; what was originally going to be the first all-robocar city &#8212; while in the UAE.</p>

<p>When I get back I will have more on some new announcements, particularly the vehicle-to-vehicle communications plan announcement, and new teams forming up.   Though for my views on the V2V issue, you can read the three part series wrote last year, <a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/v2v-vs-paths-successful-networked-technology-part-1">V2V and how to build a networked technology</a>.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I always feel strange when I see blog and social network posts about the death of a pet or even a relative.   I know the author but didn&#8217;t know anything about the pet other than that the author cared.</p>

<p>So as I report the end for our kitty, Bijou, I will make it interesting by relaying a fun surveillance related story of how she arrived at our house.  She had been rescued as a stray by a distant relative.  When that relative died there was nobody else to take the cats, so we took two of them, even though the two would have nothing to do with each-other.   Upon arrival at our house, both cats discovered that the garage was a good place to hide, but the hiding was quite extreme, and after about 4 days we still could not figure where Bijou was hiding.   Somebody was coming to eat the food, but we could not tell from where.</p>

<p><img class=blogpic src=/files/x10camera.jpg>
I had a small wireless camera with an RF transmitter on it.   So I set it up near the food bowl, and we went into the TV room to watch.   As expected, a few minutes later, the cat emerged &#8212; from inside the bottom of the washing machine through a rather small hole.   After emerging she headed directly and deliberately to the camera and as she filled the screen, suddenly the view turned to distortion and static.   It was the classic scene of any spy movie, as shot from the view of the surveillance camera.  The intruder comes in and quickly disables the camera.</p>

<p>What really happened is that the transmitter is not very powerful and you must aim the antenna.  When a cat sees something new in her environment, her first instinct is to come up to it and smell it, then rub her cheek on it to scent-mark it.  And so this is what she did, bumping the antenna to lose the signal, though it certainly looked like she was the ideal cat for somebody at the EFF.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also a good thing we didn&#8217;t run the washing machine.  But I really wish I had been recording the video.  Worthy of Kittywood studios.</p>

<p>She had happy years in her new home (as well as some visits to her old one before it was sold) and many a sunbeam was lazily exploited and evil bright red dot creature never captured, but it could not be forever.</p>

<p>RIP Bijou T. Cat, 199? - 2013</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I will be a guest on Monday the 13th (<strong>correction &#8212; I originaly said the 14th</strong>) on a the &#8220;City Visions&#8221; program, produced by one of San Francisco&#8217;s NPR affiliates, KALW.   The show runs at 7pm, and you can listen live and phone in (415-841-4134), or listen to the podcast later.   Details are on the <a href="http://kalw.org/post/next-city-visions-driverless-cars-california">page about the show</a>.</p>

<p>Other guests include Bryant Walker Smith of Stanford, Martin Sierhuis of the Nissan robocar lab and Bernard Soriano from the California DMV.  Should be a good panel.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Two upcoming talks:</p>

<p>Tomorrow (April 4) I will give a very short talk at the meeting of the <a href="http://personalcloud3.eventbrite.com/#">personal clouds interest group</a>.   As far as I know, I was among the first to propose the concept of the personal cloud in my essages on the <a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/tags/data-deposit-box">Data Deposit Box</a> back in 2007, and while my essays are not the reason for it, the idea is gaining some traction now as more and more people think about the consequences of moving everything into the corporate clouds.</p>

<p>My lighting talk will cover what I see as the challenges to get the public to accept a system where the computing resources are responsible to them rather than to various web sites.</p>

<p>On April 22, I will be at the <a href="http://content.asce.org/conferences/apm2013/index.html">14th International Conference on Automated People Movers and Automated Transit</a> speaking in the opening plenary.   The APM industry is a large, multi-billion dollar one, and it&#8217;s in for a shakeup thanks to robocars, which will allow automated people moving on plain concrete, with no need for dedicated right-of-way or guideways.   APMs have traditionally been very high-end projects, costing hundreds of millions of dollars per mile.</p>

<p>The best place to find me otherwise is at Singularity University Events.   While schedules are being worked on, with luck you see me this year in Denmark, Hungary and a few other places overseas, in addition to here in Silicon Valley of course.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I&#8217;m on the board of the Foresight Institute, which at over 25 years old has been promoting nanotech since long before people knew the word.   This January, we will be holding our <a href="http://www.foresight.org/conference/">technical conference on nanotechnology</a> and related fields.   Foresight&#8217;s focus is on the potential for molecular manufacturing &#8212; doing things at the atomic level &#8212; and not simply on fine structure materials.</p>

<p><img src=https://www.foresight.org/conference/wp-content/images/2012/08/atomic150.jpg class=blogpic></p>

<p>It may surprise you just how much research is going on in the field of atomically precise manufacturing, and the positive results that are coming from it.   Today people (including me) are excited by 3-D printers that can reproduce macroscopic shapes with good precision, but the holy grail is to build structures at the atomic level, as it has the potential to produce anything that can be formed, cheaply and in small volumes.</p>

<p>Foresight hosts two conferences &#8212; the other is a more general futurist conference on the implications of these technologies, while this one offers the results of in-depth research.   Check out the <a href="https://www.foresight.org/conference/sessions/">program page</a> for a list of speakers including Fraser Stoddart, George Church, John Randall, William Goddard and many others.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I haven&#8217;t bothered quickly reporting on the robocar story every other media outlet covered, the <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/cars/ci_21630490/googles-sergey-brin-joins-california-gov-jerry-brown">signing by Jerry Brown of California&#8217;s law to enable robocars</a>.   For those with the keenest interest, the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNhyt107c88&amp;feature=related">video of the signing ceremony</a> has a short talk by Sergey Brin on some of his visions for the car where he declares that the tech will be available for ordinary people within 5 years.</p>

<p>The bill itself was news earlier on, and the regulations enabled by the bill have yet to be written, so the signing marks a milestone but there is far to go.</p>

<p>In other news you can read an article today in the Atlantic <a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/commute/2012/09/driverless-cars-would-reshape-automobiles-and-transit-system/3432/">about some of my predictions for self-delivering cars</a>.</p>

<p>Tonight I will be on a panel at the Palo Alto International Film Festival at 5pm.   Not on robocars, but on the role of science fiction in movies in changing the world.  (In a past life, I <a href="http://www.netfunny.com/rhf/hugo.html">published science fiction</a> and am on this panel by virtue of my faculty position at Singularity University.)</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>It&#8217;s St. Paddy&#8217;s day but I can celebrate a little harder this time.  Two days ago, I got my notice of entry into Ireland&#8217;s Foreign Birth Registry, declaring me an Irish citizen.    I&#8217;m able to do that because I have 3 Irish grandparents (2 born in Ireland.)  Irish law declares that anybody born to somebody born in Ireland is automatically Irish.  That made my father, whose parents were both born there, an Irish citizen even though he never got a passport.    Because my father was an Irish citizen (not born on the Island) that also gives me the right to claim it, though I had to do the paperwork, it is not automatic.   If I had children after this, they could also claim it, but if I had any before this registration, they would not.</p>

<p>I decided to do this for a few reasons.  First, it will allow me to live, work and travel freely in Ireland or anywhere else in the E.U.  The passport control lines for Canadians are not usually that long, but it&#8217;s nicer to not be quizzed.    But in the last few years, I have encountered several situations where it would have been very useful to have a 2nd passport:</p>

<ul>
<li>On a trip to Russia, I discovered there was a visa war between Canada and Russia, and Russia was making Canadians wait 21 days for a Visa while the rest of the world waited 6 or less.  I had to change a flight over that and barely made my conference.  It would have been handy to use an Irish passport then.  (Update: Possibly not.  Russia and others require you to use the passport which allows residence, and you must apply where you live.  So my Irish documents are no good at the San Francisco consulate as I don&#8217;t live there using the Irish passport.)</li>
<li>Getting stamps in your passport for Israel or its border stations means some other countries won&#8217;t let you in.  Israelis will stamp a piece of paper for you but resent it, and you can lose it.  A 2nd passport is a nice solution.  (For frequent visitors, I believe Canada and the USA both offer a 2nd passport valid only for travel to Israel.)</li>
<li>Described earlier, last year I <a href="/losing-your-passport">lost my passport in Berlin</a>.   While I got tremendous service in passport replacement, this was only because my mother was in hospital.  Otherwise I would have been stuck, unable to travel.  With 2 passports, you can keep them in two places, carry one and leave one in the hotel safe etc.  While Canada does have an emergency temporary passport, some countries only offer you a travel document to get you home, and you must cancel any other travel on your trip.</li>
<li>On entry to Zimbabwe, I found they charged Canadians $75 per entry, while most other nations paid $30 for 1 and $45 for two.  Canada is charging Zimbabweans $75 so they reciprocate.  Stupid External Affairs, I bet far more Canadians go to Zimbabwe than the other way around</li>
<li>On entry to Zambia, it was $50 to transit for most countries but free/no-visa for the Irish.  I got my passport 1 week after this, sigh.  Ireland has a visa abolition deal.</li>
<li>Argentina charges a $150 &#8220;reciprocity fee&#8221; to US and Canadian passports, good for 10 years.  Free for Irish, though.  Yay!</li>
</ul>

<p>All great reasons to have two passports.   I don&#8217;t have that yet, though.  (Update: I got it in June) Even though I presume that the vast majority of those who do the Irish foreign birth registry immediately want a passport, it doesn&#8217;t work that way.  After a 21 month wait, I have my FBR certificate, which I now must mail back to the same consulate that sent it, along with several of the same documents I used in getting the FBR like my original birth certificate.   While it makes huge sense to do them together, it doesn&#8217;t work that way. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/erin-go-brad-registering-irish-citizenship">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

    <div class="content"><p>As readers of this blog surely know, for several years I have been designing, writing and forecasting about the technology of self-driving &#8220;robocars&#8221; in the coming years.   I&#8217;m pleased to announce that I have recently become a consultant to the robot car team working at Google.</p>

<p>Of course all that work will be done under NDA, and so until such time as Google makes more public announcements, I won&#8217;t be writing about what they or I are doing.   I am very impressed by the team and their accomplishments, and to learn more I will point you to my <a href="/google-robocar-breakthrough">blog post about their announcement</a> and the <a href="http://robocars.com/google.html">article I added to my web site</a> shortly after that announcement.   It also means I probably won&#8217;t blog in any detail about certain areas of technology, in some cases not commenting on the work of other teams because of conflict of interest.  However, as much as I enjoy writing and reporting on this technology, I would rather be building it.</p>

<p>My philosophical message about Robocars I have been saying for years, but it should be clear that I am simply consulting on the project, not setting its policies or acting as a spokesman.</p>

<p>My primary interest at Google is robocars, but many of you also know my long history in online civil rights and privacy, an area in which Google is often involved in both positive and negative ways.   Indeed, while I was chairman of the EFF I felt there could be a conflict in working for a company which the EFF frequently has to either praise or criticise.   I will be recusing myself from any EFF board decisions about Google, naturally. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/working-robocars-google">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

    <div class="content"><p>In early 2000, after a tumultuous period in the EFF&#8217;s history, and
the staff down to just a handful, I was elected chair of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
I had been on the board for just a few years, but had been close to the
organization since it was founded, including participating with it as
a plaintiff in the landmark supreme court case which struck down the
Communications Decency Act in 1996.</p>

<p>Having now served 10 years as chairman, it is time to rotate out, and I
am happy to report the election of John Buckman, founder of Magnatune
and Bookmooch (among other ventures) as our new chair.   As a part-time
resident of Europe, John will, like me, offer an international perspective
to the EFF&#8217;s efforts.   Pam Samuelson, a law professor of stunning
reputation and credentials, is the vice-chair for the coming
5-year term, replacing John Perry Barlow.</p>

<p>I would love to claim credit for the EFF&#8217;s tremendous growth and success
during my tenure, but the truth is that our active and star-studded board
is a board of equals.  We all take an active role in setting policy
and attempting to guide the organization in its mission to protect
important freedoms in the online world.   While it would shock most of
my previous employees, my board management has been very laissez-faire.
I and the other board members try to let our great team do their stuff.</p>

<p>After I became chairman, one of the best things we on the board
did was to re-recruit Shari Steele, our former legal director,
to become the new executive director.  Shari had been with the EFF for
many years but had left to work on a new venture.  We brought her back
and it&#8217;s been positive ever since.    We also recruited Cindy Cohn
to be our legal director.  Cindy had a long history of friendship with
the organization, having worked tirelessly with our help on the fight
to stop export controls on encryption.  WIth these two appointments, I
and my fellow board members started the course for an incredible decade.
In spite of a chaotic global economy, during this period, our fundraising,
budget and staff size have more than tripled.   (That may seem minor
for a dot-com but it&#8217;s great news for a non-profit.)   We&#8217;ve boosted
membership and membership dontations, increased funding from foundations,
and created an endowment to assure the EFF&#8217;s future.</p>

<p>The EFF is now 20, so I&#8217;ve been privileged to chair it for half of
its lifetime.  In that period we&#8217;ve seen dramatic victories for free
speech, privacy and freedom to program.   We&#8217;ve stopped e-voting abuse
and rootkits in your music CDs.  We&#8217;ve protected bloggers as journalists
and preserved anonymous speech online.  We&#8217;ve stopped encryption software
from being controlled like a munition and had so many other triumphs, big
and small.  We&#8217;ve also seen an expanded technical and activism program,
as our technologists have led the way in unveiling things like secret
dots generated by colour laser printers that track your printouts back
to you and network interference with filesharing by cable ISPs.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve also had our failures, but even those have spoken loudly about the
quality of our team.  When we took Grokster/Streamcast to the supreme
court, our client lost, but the court laid down a fairly narrow standard
that allows software developers building new generations of publishing
products to know how to stay clear of liability.   Our cases against the
White House&#8217;s warrantless wiretapping program have hit major hurdles,
one of which was an act of congress created specifically to nullify our
attempts to have a court examine this program &#8212; granting a retroactive
immunity to the phone companies that did it.    Bad as that was, I figure
if they have to get an act of congress to stop you, you know you&#8217;ve hit
a nerve.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve also hit many nerves with our great FOIA team that has uncovered
all sorts of attacks on your rights, and continues to do so, and our
team of activists and our new international team are working hard to
promote our doctrine of free speech and freedom to develop technology
around the world.   With all our team does, many are shocked to find it is
only around 30 people.   Still, we could do much more and your donations
are still what makes it all happen.  I hope that if you believe in the
duty to protect fundamental freedoms online, you will work towards that end directly,
or consider outsourcing that work with a donation to us.</p>

<p>I am not leaving the EFF &#8212; far from it.  I will continue to be
an active boardmember.   In addition, I will begin to re-explore
commercial ventures, seek new opportunities, and continue on my quest
to become a leading evangelist for one of the world&#8217;s most exciting
new technologies &#8212; robotic transportation.  At <a href="http://robocars.net">my robocars site</a> you
can see my beginnings of a book on the subject, and why it may have the
largest positive effect on the world that computer technology delivers
in the medium term.  Of course with my EFF hat on you will find growing
sections on the freedom and privacy issues of the technology.</p>

<p>During my tenure, I have served with a tremendous group of
fellow board members, as you can see from the biographies at
<a href="http://www.eff.org/about/board">the EFF board page</a>.    I will continue to work with them to
protect your rights as the world becomes digital, and I hope you will all
join with me in supporting the EFF with your thoughts and your dollars.</p>

<p><hr>
We&#8217;ll mark the transition tonight, Feb 10 at the special <a href="http://www.eff.org/calendar/2010/02/10/effs-20th-birthday-with-adam-savage">EFF 20th birthday bash</a> at DNA lounge.    This fundraiser can be attended
with a requested $30 donation, and there is also a special VIP event earlier where you can mingle more
intimately with the special guests, such as Mythbuster Adam Savage.  We have quite a program planned.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>This weekend is the <a href="http://www.foresight.org/conf2010/">Foresight Institute conference on molecular nanotechnology and AI</a>.  I am on the board of Foresight Institute and will be speaking on the latest developments in robocars at the conference, along with a raft of great speakers.  If you are interested in futurist issues around AI, nanotech and other accelerating technologies, this is the longest running conference in the field and the place to be.   The whole conference is just $175 and you can <a href="http://foresight2010.eventbee.com/discount?pid=10880">register for it here</a>.</p>

<p>I will also be doing my general Robocar talk on Wednesday, February 24th at the &#8220;<a href="http://www.hbrobotics.org/">Homebrew Robotics Club</a>&#8221; of Silicon Valley.   This is a great group of people who hack robotics as a hobby, and it meets at the CMU building at NASA Ames Research Center.  This event is free and open to the public.</p>

<p>Finally, in 2 weeks I will be attending the DLD 10 conference in Munich Germany, and may try to make my way into some parties at the World Economic Forum in Davos while doing a little Alpine road trip after DLD.</p>

<p>Note for those who can&#8217;t attend the Foresight conference, you can <a href="http://www.techzulu.com/live.html">watch it stream live</a></p>

    <div class="content"><p>I&#8217;ve been feeling we in the secular, atheist world should still have an official event at the end of the year, since with the Christians and the Jews making merry, it&#8217;s a good time to do it.   We have New Year&#8217;s Eve of course, but so does everybody.</p>

<p>This new holiday, to mark the changing of the Seasons might be called &#8220;Seasons.&#8221;  Of course that is in part so that all the people saying &#8220;Seasons Greetings&#8221; (without the apostrophe, oddly enough) will now be making our greeting.  Another name for it could be &#8220;Holidays&#8221; but that does have religious roots.</p>

<p>Now the real changing of the seasons is around Dec 21, but it makes far more sense to celebrate a gift holiday on Dec 28-29.  That way you can buy gifts for everybody at half price.   And we seculars are smart and thrifty.</p>

<p>So Happy Seasons to all.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>First: I will be speaking on robocars tomorrow, Tuesday Nov 9, at 6:30 pm for the meeting of the <a href="http://jhtc.org/">Jewish High Tech Community</a> in Silicon Valley.  The talk is at 6:30pm at the conference center of Fenwick and West at Castro &amp; California in Mountain View.   The public is welcome to attend, there is a $10 fee for non-members.   This will be similar to my talk at Stanford 2 weeks ago, and a bit more extensive than the one in New York early in October, which <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/10/12/transhumanists-machines-technology-breakthroughs-singularity-summit.html">Forbes said was the audience favorite at the event</a>.</p>

<p>Volvo has built a brand around safe cars, and last year committed that nobody would die in a newer Volvo by 2020.   They plan to do much of this with better passenger safety systems, akin to the work they have done on airbags and crumple zones.  However, they also intend to use a lot of computerized technologies to make it happen.   Other teams are pushing to expand the goal inside Volvo to also stop people from being killed by Volvos.    To that end, next year&#8217;s Volvo S60 will come with a &#8220;Pedestrian Avoidance System&#8221; which uses a camera and machine vision to identify pedestrians and calculate if the vehicle is about to hit one.  If it sees a potential pedestrian collision it will beep and alert the driver.  If the driver does nothing, the car will brake.</p>

<p>Here is a video of the S60 in action:</p>

<p><object width="660" height="525"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/XU43SjMIzW8&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/XU43SjMIzW8&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="660" height="525"></embed></object></p>

<p>It&#8217;s impressive, though pure machine vision suffers problems as lighting changes, which is one reason most work recently has been on LIDAR.  It&#8217;s also interesting to see if they will be able to avoid making it too conservative.  If the warning goes off all the time, even for a pedestrian who will (to the human eye) clearly slide by the side of the car at places like a crosswalk, drivers may learn to ignore the alarm, or get very annoyed and shut the whole system off it it brakes for them when they know an impact is not imminent.   I&#8217;m hoping to learn more about Volvo&#8217;s efforts in the future.  No other company has put as much effort into building a brand around safety, so we can expect Volvo, which has slipped in this status of late, to work very hard to maintain it and adapt robocar technologies to safer human driving and fully autonomous driving
as well.</p>

<h2>Dense triple parking</h2>

<p>I have written of a simple algorithm to allow dense Valet style parking of robocars, such as triple parking on the roadsides.  In this algorithm, one gap is left in the outer lanes, and the Robocars are able to move together, as an entire row segment, to &#8220;move the gap&#8221; as quickly as a single car can move.  That way, if a car needs to get out from an inner lane, it can signal, and if the gap is currently ahead of it, for example, all the cars from the one next to it to the gap can move forward one space (at the same time) to put the gap next to the vehicle that needs to leave.  This can happen in all the other rows and is easy, quiet and efficient for electric cars.    It does not even need radio communication, as robocars will sense a car moving behind them or ahead of them, and immediately move in reaction.  This request will move up the chain of cars to the gap.  Of course, if one car does not move, the car behind it will only move a very short distance before refusing to go further, which would stop the whole effort (or in the case of an error, cause a very slow impact if the car behind keeps coming) and signal a need for human attention.</p>

<p>It seems like this should be possible even without many gaps, as long as there is enough spare space to allow a vehicle to wiggle out of its space.   If there is just one gap, and a bit of wiggle room in the other rows, any car can still get out, just a bit more slowly.   This is probably better done with a protocol for communication to assure it works quickly.</p>

<p>In this case, a gap on the outside lane (where there must be at least one) can be temporarily moved to the inside, and then back out.  Consider 3 lanes of cars, with a gap in the outer late (lane #3) and a car in lane #1 (the curb lane) wanting out.   First the lane #3 cars would adjust to move the gap to the right place, a bit forward of our target car.   Next, a car from lane #2 would move into this gap, leaving a gap in lane #2 into which our target car can move.   This leaves a gap in lane #3 which can be filled by a car from lane #2 which is willing to move in, ideally right next to our target car.  Likewise a car from lane #3 can now move into that gap, and the resulting gap in the outer lane #3 can be moved to allow exit by our target car.   </p>

<p>This requires a great deal more car moving, though again with electric cars this may not be too expensive.   If the cars can turn all their wheels, they can move horizontally as some concept cars can already do.  Even without that, a robotic car can wiggle out without much room, and of course the gap would not be placed exactly in place with the target car, but probably slightly forward to allow transfer with fewer wiggles.  The result is a whole valet lot with just one blank space needed to get any car reasonably quickly.   Of course, this would only be done when the lot needed to be totally full.  For any partially full lot, gaps would be left to minimize the car moves needed to get any car out.  However, if space is at a premium &#8212; so much so as to justify the extra moving &#8212; it can be done.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Twenty years ago (Monday) on June 8th, 1989, I did the public launch of ClariNet.com, my electronic newspaper business, which would
be delivered using USENET protocols (there was no HTTP yet) over the internet.</p>

<p>ClariNet was the first company created to use the internet as its platform for business, and as such this event has a claim at being the birth of the &#8220;dot-com&#8221; concept which so affected the world in the two intervening decades.   There are other definitions and other contenders which I discuss in the article below.</p>

<p><img class=blogpic src=http://www.templetons.com/brad/clarinet/clarinet_logo.gif>
In those days, the internet consisted of regional networks, who were mostly non-profit cooperatives, and the government funded &#8220;NSFNet&#8221; backbone which linked them up.    That backbone had a no-commercial-use policy, but I found a way around it.  In addition, a nascent commercial internet was arising with companies like UUNet and PSINet, and the seeds of internet-based business were growing.   There was no web, of course.  The internet&#8217;s community lived in e-Mail and USENET.  Those, and FTP file transfer were the means of publishing.  When Tim Berners-Lee would coin the term &#8220;the web&#8221; a few years later, he would call all these the web, and HTML/HTTP a new addition and glue connecting them.</p>

<p>I decided I should write a history of those early days, where the seeds of the company came from and what it was like before most of the world had even heard of the internet.   It is a story of the origins and early perils and successes, and not so much of the boom times that came in the mid-90s.    It also contains a few standalone anecdotes, such as the story of how I accidentally implemented a system so reliable, <a href="http://www.templetons.com/brad/clarinet-history.html#m5">even those authorized to do so failed to shut it down</a> (which I call &#8220;M5 reliability&#8221; after the Star Trek computer), stories of too-early eBook publishing and more.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also a little bit about some of the other early internet and e-publishing businesses such as BBN, UUNet, Stargate, public access unix, Netcom, Comtex and the first Internet World trade show.</p>

<p>Extra, extra, read all about it: <a href="http://www.templetons.com/brad/clarinet-history.html">The history of ClariNet.com and the dawn of the dot-coms</a>.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I&#8217;m on the shores of Kinneret (Sea of Galilee to Christians) for Israel&#8217;s version of FOO Camp.  A great time so far, after visiting Haifa and the area.  To Tel Aviv on Sunday to speak at the Marker&#8217;s internet conference for those of you who are in the area.</p>

<p>The title reflects what I was told is sort of a national catchphrase.  This is indeed a complex country.  The first thing you can&#8217;t avoid seeing is the massive amount of security.  Going into ordinary buildings, even a shopping mall can be like going to the airport in many places.   Like fish in water, however, many Israelis no longer notice it the way a visitor does.   Scores of times a day you will see groups of IDF with submachineguns slung on their backs, as well as solo soldiers, as all Israelis do a tour in the army.   And at the same time all I have seen has been tranquil and very friendly.</p>

<p>More observations upon my return, bit of  blogging break until then.</p>
