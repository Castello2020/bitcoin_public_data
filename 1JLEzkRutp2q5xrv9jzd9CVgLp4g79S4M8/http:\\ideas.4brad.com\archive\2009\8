    <div class="content"><p>RVs all have a fresh water tank.  When you rent one, they will often tell you not to drink that water.  That&#8217;s because the tanks are being filled up in all sorts of random places, out of the control of the rental company, and while it&#8217;s probably safe, they don&#8217;t want to promise it, nor disinfect the tank every rental.</p>

<p>I recently got a small &#8220;pen&#8221; which you put in a cup of water and it shines a UV light for 30 seconds to kill any nasties in the water.  While I have not tried to test it on infected water, I presume that it works.</p>

<p>So it seems it makes sense to me to install this sort of UV tube in the fresh water tank of RVs.  Run it from time to time, and particularly after a fill, and be sure the water is clean.   Indeed, with an appropriate filter, and a 2nd pump, such an RV could happily fill its water tank from clear lakes and streams, allowing longer dry camping which should have a market.  Though of course the gray/black water tanks still will get full, but outside showers and drinking do not fill those tanks.
A urination-only toilet could also be done if near a stream or lake.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>The Worldcon (World Science Fiction Convention) in Montreal was enjoyable.   Like all worldcons, which are run by fans rather than professional convention staff, it had its issues, but nothing too drastic.   Our worst experience actually came from the Delta hotel, which I&#8217;ll describe below.</p>

<p>For the past few decades, Worldcons have been held in convention centers.  They attract from 4,000 to 7,000 people and are generally felt to not fit in any ordinary hotel outside Las Vegas.  (They don&#8217;t go to Las Vegas both because there is no large fan base there to run it, and the Las Vegas Hotels, unlike those in most towns, have no incentive to offer a cut-rate deal on a summer weekend.)</p>

<p>Because they are always held where deals are to be had on hotels and convention space, it is not uncommon for them to get the entire convention center or a large portion of it.   This turns out to be a temptation which most cons succumb to, but should not.   The Montreal convention was huge and cavernous.  It had little of the intimacy a mostly social event should have.    Use of the entire convention center meant long walks and robbed the convention of a social center &#8212; a single place through which you could expect people to flow, so you would see your friends, join up for hallway conversations and gather people to go for meals.</p>

<p>This is one of those cases where less can be more.  You should not take more space than you need.  The convention should be as initimate as it can be without becoming crowded.   That may mean deliberately not taking function space.</p>

<p>A social center is vital to a good convention.  Unfortunately when there are hotels in multiple directions from the convention center so that people use different exits, it is hard for the crowd to figure one out.  At the Montreal convention (Anticipation) the closest thing to such a center was near the registration desk, but it never really worked.  At other conventions, anywhere on the path to the primary entrance works.  Sometimes it is the lobby and bar of the HQ hotel, but this was not the case here.</p>

<p>When the social center will not be obvious, the convention should try to find the best one, and put up a sign saying it is the congregation point.   In some convention centers, meeting rooms will be on a different floor from other function space, and so it may be necessary to have two meeting points, one for in-between sessions, and the other for general time.</p>

<p>The social center/meeting point is the one thing it can make sense to use some space on.  Expect a good fraction of the con to congregate there in break times.  Let them form groups of conversation (there should be sound absorbing walls) but still be able to see and find other people in the space.</p>

<p>A good thing to make a meeting point work is to put up the schedule there, ideally in a dynamic way.  This can be computer screens showing the titles of the upcoming sessions, or even human changed cards saying this.  Anticipation used a giant schedule on the wall, which is also OK.   The other methods allow descriptions to go up with the names.   Anticipation did a roundly disliked &#8220;pocket&#8221; program printed on tabloid sized paper, with two pages usually needed to cover a whole day.  Nobody had a pocket it could fit in.  In addition, there were many changes to the schedule and the online version was not updated.  Again, this is a volunteer effort, so I expect some glitches like this to happen, they are par for the course. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/worldcon-and-convention-design">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

    <div class="content"><p>Today, fewer and fewer photos are printed.  We usually see them on screen.  And more and more commonly, we see them on a widescreen monitor.   16:9 screens are quite common as are 16:10.   You can hardly find a 4:3 screen any more, though that is the aspect ratio of most P&amp;S cameras.   Most SLRs are 3:2, which still doesn&#8217;t fit on the widescreen monitor.</p>

<p>So there should be a standard tag to put in photos saying, &#8220;It&#8217;s OK to crop this photo to fill aspect ratio X:Y.&#8221;   Then display programs could know to do this, instead of putting black bars at the center.  Since all photos exceed the resolution of the screen by a large margin these days, there is no loss of detail to do this, in fact there is probably a gain.</p>

<p>One could apply this tag (or perhaps its converse, one saying, &#8220;please display the entirety of this photo without crop&#8221;) in a photo organizer program of course.   It could also be applied by cameras.    To do this, the camera might display a dim outline of a widescreen aspect ratio, so you can compose the shot to fit in that.    Many people might decide to do this as the default, and push a button when they need the whole field of view and want to set a &#8220;don&#8217;t crop&#8221; flag.   Of course you can fix this after the fact.</p>

<p>Should sensors just go widescreen?  Probably not.  The lens produces a circular image, so more square aspect ratios make sense.   A widescreen sensor would be too narrow in portrait mode.   In fact, there&#8217;s an argument that as sensors get cheaper, they should go <em>circular</em> and then the user can decide after the fact if they want landscape, portrait or some particular aspect ratio in either.</p>

<p>The simplest way to start this plan would be to add a &#8220;crop top/bottom to fit width&#8221; option to photo viewers.  And to add a &#8220;flag this picture to not do that&#8221; command to the photo viewer.  A quick run through the slideshow, tagging the few photos that can&#8217;t be expanded to fill the screen, would prepare the slideshow for showing to others, or it could be done right during the show.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>On Saturday I attended the Battlestar Galactica Postmortem panel at the World Science Fiction convention in Montreal.   The &#8220;worldcon&#8221; is the top convention for serious fans of SF, with typically 4,000 to 6,000 attendees from around the world.   There are larger (much larger) &#8220;media&#8221; conventions like ComicCon an DragonCon, but the Worlcon is considered &#8220;it&#8221; for written SF.   It gives out the Hugo award.   While the fans at a worldcon do put an emphasis on written SF, they also are voracious consumers of media SF, and so there are many panels on it, and two Hugo awards for it.</p>

<p>Two things surprised me a bit about the Worldcon panel.   First of all, it was much more lightly attended than I would have expected considering the large fandom BSG built, and how its high quality had particularly appealed to these sorts of fans.   Secondly, it was more negative and bitter about the ending that I would have expecting &#8212; and I was expecting quite a lot.</p>

<p>In fact, a few times audience members and panelists felt it necessary to encourage the crowd to stop just ranting about the ending and to talk about the good things.  In spite of being <a href="/battlestar/battlestars-daybreak-worst-ending-history-screen-science-fiction">so negative on the ending myself</a> I found myself being one of those also trying to talk about the good stuff.</p>

<p>What was surprising was that while I still stand behind my own analysis, I know that in many online communities opinion on the ending is more positive.  There are many who hate it but many who love it, and at least initially, more who loved it in some communities.</p>

<p>The answer may be is that it is the serious SF fan, the fan who looks to books as the source of the greatest SF, the BSG ending was the largest betrayal.  Here we were hoping for a show that would bring some of the quality we seek in written SF to the screen, and here it fell down.   Fans with a primary focus on movie and TV SF were much more tolerant of the ending, since as I noted, TV SF endings are almost never good anyway, and the show itself was a major cut above typical TV SF.</p>

<p>The small audience surprised me.  I have seen other shows such as Buffy (which is not even SF), Babylon 5 and various forms of Star Trek still fill a room for discussion of the show.   It is my contention that had BSG ended better, it would have joined this pantheon of great shows that maintains a strong fandom for decades.</p>

<p>The episode &#8220;Revelations&#8221; where the ruined Earth is discovered was nominated for the Hugo for best short dramatic program.   It came in 4th &#8212; the winner was the highly unusual &#8220;Dr. Horrible&#8217;s sing-along-blog&#8221; which was a web production from fan favourite Joss Whedon of Buffy and Firefly.   BSG won a Hugo for the first episode &#8220;33&#8221; and has been nominated each year since then but has failed to win each time, with a Doctor Who episode the winner in each case.</p>

<p>At the panel, the greatest source of frustration was the out-of-nowhere decision to abandon all technology, with Starbuck&#8217;s odd fate a #2.  This matches the most common complaints I have seen online.</p>

<p>On another note, while normally Worldcon Hugo voters tend to go for grand SF books, this time the best Novel award went to Neil Gaiman&#8217;s &#8220;The Graveyard Book.&#8221;   Gaiman himself, in his acceptance speech, did the odd thing of declaring that he thought Anathem (which was also my choice) should have won.  Anathem came 2nd or 3rd, depending on how you like to read STV ballot counting.   Gaiman however, was guest of honour at the convention, and it attracted a huge number of Gaiman fans because of this, which may have altered the voting.  (Voting is done by convention members.  Typically about 1,000 people will vote on best novel.)</p>

Great crowd of people here.     Then it&#8217;s back to Burning Man preparation.  Due to an error we got terrible placement in the city this year but I&#8217;m working on it.</p>

<p>Shortly I will post new thoughts on the nature of consciousness I had after talking to Peter Watts.  Watts is the author of the novel <em>Blindsight</em> which I highly recommend.</p>
