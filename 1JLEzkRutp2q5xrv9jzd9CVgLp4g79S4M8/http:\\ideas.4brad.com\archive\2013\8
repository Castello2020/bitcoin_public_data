    <span class="taxonomy"><ul class="links inline"><li class="first last taxonomy_term_95"><a href="/topic/robocars" rel="tag" title="The future of computer-driven cars and deliverbots" class="taxonomy_term_95">Robocars</a></li>
</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Probably the most expensive add-on that people get in their cars today is the stereo.   Long ago, cars often came without stereos and there was a major aftermarket.  The aftermarket is still here but most people elect for factory stereos which fit in seamlessly with the car and often cost a huge amount of money.</p>

<p>The car&#8217;s not a great place to listen to music &#8212; it&#8217;s noisy and you are distracted and you often stop and have to get out in the middle of a song.  But because people find they listen to more music in their cars than at home, they often pay huge bucks for a fancy car stereo.   (Not counting the people who deliberately buy a system so loud it&#8217;s meant for other people outside the car to hear.)</p>

<p>While you could put a nice stereo system in a robocar, and some people will, another way they can save money is they don&#8217;t need to have much audio at all, not once they can do full-auto operation.   The prohibition on headphones by the driver should go away, and it could become popular to just use nice headphones &#8212; possibly noise cancelling headphones or in-ear noise-blocking phones.    A better audio experience with much less noise, and a lot cheaper too.   And there is the option for each person in the car to have their own headphones and tune their own audio stream.</p>

<p>People will like to share, so the car might contain a simple audio distribution system to feed audio streams to people who are sharing, though the source of the music should still be somebody&#8217;s phone or device, not something built into the car.    In addition, there could be a system to mix in some of the in-cabin audio, so you can still hear the other people when they talk.   Microphones on each person&#8217;s headphones could pick up their voices and actually provide a clearer read of their voices.  Headphones with position sensors could allow simulation of stereo on the other people.   Alternately a microphone array could exist around the car, particularly at each seat.</p>

<p>There are some downsides to push things into the traditional way:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wearing headphones is uncomfortable on long trips</li>
<li>They are a pain to remember to put on.  You want to avoid cords, so they would be wireless, but then you must be sure to put them in their charging dock.</li>
<li>On small aircraft, there is so much noise that everybody does it this way, but they tend to be bulky (due to the high noise) and unpopular for that reason</li>
</ul>

<p>So people might elect to still have decent speakers and listen to music without headphones.  But there is less need to buy a really expensive sound system, since if you want the top quality you probably want to go for the headphones.  This may also apply to decisions to do expensive sound elimination in the car.  For some, nothing may change, but that&#8217;s OK.  What&#8217;s interesting is the option to do car sound in ways never done before.</p>

    <span class="taxonomy"><ul class="links inline"><li class="first last taxonomy_term_95"><a href="/topic/robocars" rel="tag" title="The future of computer-driven cars and deliverbots" class="taxonomy_term_95">Robocars</a></li>
</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Frequently, in reporting on robocars, it is often cited that one of their key benefits will be the way they enable car sharing, greatly reducing the number of cars that need to exist to serve the population.  It is sometimes predicted that we&#8217;ll need to make fewer cars, which is good for the environment.  </p>

<p>It is indeed true &#8212; robotaxi service, with cars that deliver themselves and drop you off, does greatly enable car sharing.   But from the standpoint of modern car sharing, it may enable it too well, and we may end up having to manufacture more cars, not fewer.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s car sharing companies <a href="http://carsharingus.blogspot.com/2011/07/how-many-vehicles-does-carsharing.html">report statistics</a> that they replace around 13 privately owned cars for every car in the carsharing fleet.  Some suggest it&#8217;s even as high as 20.</p>

<p>This number is impossible for average drivers, however.  The average car is driven 12,000 miles/year.  To replace 13 average cars would require a vehicle that was actively driving, not just signed out, 11 hours/day and each vehicle would wear out in 1-2 years.</p>

<p>Three things are happening.</p>

<ul>
<li>Carsharing is replacing the more marginal, less used vehicles.   A household replaces a 2nd or 3rd car.  Carsharing is almost always used by people who do not commute by car.</li>
<li>Carsharing is often considerably less convenient than a private car.  It discourages driving, pushing its users into other modes of transport, or selecting for customers who can do that.</li>
<li>Related to that, carsharing shows the true cost of car ownership and makes it incremental.  That cost is around $20/hour, and people rethink trips when they see the full cost laid out per mile or per hour.   With private cars, they ignore most of the cost and focus only on the gasoline, if that.</li>
</ul>

<p>The &#8220;problem&#8221; with robocars is that they&#8217;re not going to be worse than having a private car.  In many ways they will be better.    So they will do very little of the discouragement of car use caused by present day carshare models.  The &#8220;dark secret&#8221; of carsharing is that it succeeds so well at replacing cars because of its <em>flaws</em>, not just its virtues.</p>

<p>Robotic taxis can be priced incrementally, with per-mile or per-hour costs, and these costs will initially be similar to the <em>mostly unperceived</em> per-mile or per-hour costs of private car ownership, though they will get cheaper in the future.   This revelation of the price will discourage some driving, though robotaxi companies, hoping to encourage more business, will likely create pricing models which match the way people pay for cars (such as monthly lease fees with only gasoline costs during use) to get people to use more of the product.</p>

<p>There is an even stronger factor when it comes to robotaxis.   A hard-working robotaxi will indeed serve many people, and as such it will put on a lot of miles every year.   It will thus wear out much faster, and be taken out of service within 4-5 years.  This is the case with today&#8217;s human driven taxicabs, which travel about 60,000 miles/year in places like New York.</p>

<p><em>The lifetime of a robotaxi will be measured almost exclusively in miles or engine-hours, not years</em>.     The more miles people travel, the more vehicles will need to be built.  It doesn&#8217;t matter how much people are sharing them.</p>

<p>The core formula is simple.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cars made = Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) / Car lifetime in miles</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The amount of sharing of vehicles is not a factor in this equation, other than when it affects VMT.</p>

<p>Today the average car lasts 200,000 miles in California.  To be clear, if you have 8,000 customers and they will travel two billion miles in 20 years (that&#8217;s the average) then they are going to need 8,000 cars over those years.  It <em>almost</em> doesn&#8217;t matter if you serve them with their own private car, and it lasts all 20 years, or if you get 2,000 cars and they serve 4 people each on average and wear out after 5 years. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/no-car-sharing-aspect-robocars-isnt-exciting-people-hope">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a little skeptical of many augmented reality apps I&#8217;ve seen, feeling they were mostly gimmick and not actually useful.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m impressed by this <a href="http://www.wired.com/autopia/2013/08/audi-ekurzinfo/">new one from Audi</a> where you point your phone (iPhone only, unfortunately) at a feature on your car, and you get documentation on it.  An interesting answer to car user manuals that are as thick as the glove compartment and the complex UIs they describe.</p>

<p><img src=/files/audi-app.jpg class=leftpic></p>

<p>Like so many apps, however, this one will suffer the general problem of the amount of time it takes to fumble for your phone, unlock it, invoke an app, and then let the app do its magic.  Of course fumbling for the manual and looking up a button in the index takes time too.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve advocated for a while that phones become more aware of their location, not just in the GPS sense, but in the sense of &#8220;I&#8217;m in my car&#8221; and know what apps to make very easy to access, and even streamline their use.  This can include allowing these apps to be right on the lock screen &#8212; there&#8217;s no reason to need to unlock the phone to use an app like this one.   In fact, all the apps you use frequently in your car that don&#8217;t reveal personal info should be on the lock screen when you get near the car, and some others just behind it.   The device can know it is in the car via the bluetooth in the car.    (That bluetooth can even tell you if you&#8217;re in another car of a different make, if you have a database mapping MAC addresses to car models.)</p>

<p>Bluetooth transmitters are so cheap and with BT Low Energy they can last a year on a watch battery, so one of the more compelling &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; applications &#8212; that&#8217;s also often a gimmick term &#8212; is to scatter these devices around the world to give our phones this accurate sense of place.</p>

<p>Some of this philosophy is expressed in <em>Google Now</em>, a product that goes the right way on many of these issues.  Indeed, the Google Now cards are one of the more useful aspects of Glass, which otherwise is inherently limited in its user interface making it harder for you to ask Glass things than it is to ask a phone or desktop.</p>

<p>The car app has some wrinkles of course.   Since you don&#8217;t always have an iPhone (or may not have your phone even if you own an iPhone) you still need the thick manual, though perhaps it can be in the trunk.  And I will wager that some situations, like odd lighting, may make it not as fast as in the video.</p>

<p>By and large, pointing your phone at QR codes to learn more has not caught on super well, in part again because it takes time to get most phones to the point where they are scanning the code.    Gesture interfaces can help there but you can only remember and parse a limited number of gestures, so many applications call out for being the special one.  Still a special shake which means &#8220;Look around you in all ways you can to figure out if there is something in this location, time or camera view that I might want you to process.&#8221;  Constant looking eats batteries which is why you need such a shake.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve proposed that even though phones have slowly been losing all their physical buttons, I would put this back as a physical button I call the &#8220;context&#8221; button.  &#8220;Figure out the local context, and offer me the things that might be particularly important in this context.&#8221;    This would offer many things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Standing in front of a restaurant or shop, the reviews, web site or app of the shop</li>
<li>In the car, all the things you like in the car, such as maps/nav, the manual etc.</li>
<li>In front of a meeting room, the schedule for that room and ability to book it</li>
<li>At a tourist attraction, info on it.</li>
<li>In a hotel, either the ability to book a room, or if you have a room, hotel services</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many contexts, but you can usually sort them so that the most local and the most rare come first.  So if you are in a big place you are frequently, such as the office complex you work at, the general functions for your company would not be high on the list unless you manually bumped them.</p>

<p>Of course, one goal is that car UIs will become simpler and self-documenting, as cars get screens.   Buttons will still do the main functions you do all the time &#8212; and which people already understand &#8212; but screens will do the more obscure things you might need to look up in the manual, and document it as they go.  You obviously can&#8217;t ever do something you need to look up in the manual while driving.</p>

<p>There is probably a trend that the devices in our lives with lots of buttons and complex controls and modes, like home electronics, cars and some appliances, will move to having screens in their UIs and thus not need the augmented reality.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Our technology is having trouble with settling on a name.   That&#8217;s OK before it&#8217;s mainstream but will eventually present a problem.   When people in the field are polled on what name they like, there is no clear winner.   Let&#8217;s look at some of the commonly used candidates:</p>

<h2>Driverless Cars</h2>

<p>Recently, this has become the most common term used in the press.  There is a &#8220;Driverless Car Summit&#8221; and the Wikipedia page has used that name for some time.</p>

<p>In spite of this popularity, the term is very rarely used by people actually building the vehicles.  Attendees at the &#8220;Driverless Car Summit&#8221; when polled all said they dislike it.    Until recently, the most common news story about a driverless car would say, &#8220;then the <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/126554-10-Year-Old-Credits-Mario-Kart-After-Stopping-Driverless-Car">driverless car</a> rolled down the hill and careened into the other lane, hitting a tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>My personal view is that this term is like &#8220;horseless carriage.&#8221;  Long ago the most remarkable thing about the automobile was that it had no horse.  Here it&#8217;s the lack of driver (or at least lack of action by the driver.)  Of course, these cars have something driving them, but it&#8217;s a computer system.    While this term is most popular, I am confident it will fade away and seem quaint, like horseless carriage did.</p>

<h2>Self-driving cars</h2>

<p>This term is popular among developers of the cars.   Its main problem is that it&#8217;s too long to be a popular term.  The acronym SDC is a reasonable one.   In web hits, this is tied with Driverless Cars, but falls behind that name in searches and news mentions.</p>

<h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>

<p>This term was most popular in the early years, though it is most commonly found in research environments and in the military sphere.   In the military they also use &#8220;unmanned ground vehicle&#8221; &#8212; another term too unwieldy for the public &#8212;though they usually refer to remote controlled vehicles, not self-driving ones.</p>

<p>Annoyingly, the acronym &#8220;AV&#8221; has another popular meaning today.   Most of the terms here are too long to become common use terms, and so will be turned into acronyms or shortened, but this one has an acronym problem.</p>

<h3>Automated Road Vehicle</h3>

<p>This term has minor traction, almost entirely due to the efforts of Steve Shladover of UC Berkeley.  In his view, the word autonomous is entirely misused here and the correct term is automated.   Roboticists tend to differ &#8212; they have been using &#8220;autonomous&#8221; to mean &#8220;not remote controlled&#8221; for many years.  There are two meanings of autonomous in common use.   One is to be independent of direct control (which these cars are) and the other one, &#8220;self-governing&#8221; is the one Steve has the issue with.   As a member of the program committee for TRB&#8217;s conference on the area, he has pushed the &#8220;automated&#8221; name and given it some traction.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, to roboticists, &#8220;automated&#8221; is how you describe a dishwasher or a pick-and-place robot; it&#8217;s a lower level of capability.   I don&#8217;t expect this terminology to gain traction among them.</p>

<h2>Robocars</h2>

<p>I selected this term for these pages for a variety of reasons.  It was already in modest use thanks to a Science Channel documentary on the DARPA challenge called &#8220;robocars.&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li>Talking to teams, they usually just called their vehicle &#8220;the robot&#8221; or &#8220;the car.&#8221;</li>
<li>It is short, easy to say, and clear about what it means</li>
<li>It is distinct and thus can easily be found in online searches</li>
<li>It had some amount of existing use, notably as the title of a documentary on the Science Channel about the DARPA challenges</li>
</ul>

<p>However, it is doing poorly in popularity and only has about 21,000 web pages using it, so I may need to switch away from it as well if a better term appears.   Today it reminds people too much of robotics, and the trend is to move away from that association.</p>

<p>On the other hand, no other term satisfies the criteria above, which I think are very good criteria. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/self-driving-cars-autonomous-vehicles-driverless-cars-and-robocars">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

    <div class="content"><p>I&#8217;m often asked whether robocars will keep themselves to the speed limit and refuse to go faster, unlike cruise controls which let the driver set the automated speed.  In many countries, the majority of human drivers routinely exceed the limit which could present issues.   On the other hand, vendors may fear liability over programming their cars to do this, or even programming them to allow their human overlord to demand it.</p>

<p>While the right answer is a speed-limit doctrine like the French Autoroute, where the limit is 130 kph/80 mph and few disobey it, until we can come to that answer, the math suggests that travel might be overall safer if the robocars are allowed to speed in the same way humans do, at the request of humans.   And indeed, that is how prototype implementations have been built.</p>

<p>I felt this subject (and related subjects about how cars should deal with laws that are routinely broken by human drivers) deserved a special article.  Read about it at:</p>
