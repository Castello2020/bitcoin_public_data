    <div class="content"><p>Nissan has announced a new version of their Pivo concept car.   The Pivo 3 <a href="http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/SOCIALCONTRIBUTION/MOTORSHOW/2011/TOKYO/PIVO3/">here&#8217;s a story with a video</a> offers 4 wheel steering and automatic parking, including a claimed functionality for automated valet parking.  In the AVP case, the car requires a special parking lot, though it is not said what changes are needed.   A few years ago the Stanford team demonstrated Junior 3 which could valet park in a lot to which it had a map, and which had no civilian pedestrians.</p>

<p><img class=blogpic src=http://www.nissan-global.com/COMMON/IMAGES/MOTORSHOW/2011/PIVO3/car_main01.jpg></p>

<p>The Pivo 3, it is reported, &#8220;will come and pick you up when you summon it.&#8221;  Presumably this involves both the parking lot and the path to the door where you summon it containing the special infrastructure it needs, but this is not described.   What&#8217;s also described is something fairly important &#8212; automatic charging, where the car takes itself to a charging station and hooks up.</p>

<p>They say they have no commercial plans for the car, but that they do expect to put such functionality into other cars around &#8220;2016 to 2017.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the Tokyo motor show about to start, expect new announcements from Japan in the days to come &#8212; for example Toyota has promised a self-driving Prius at the show, in a similar parking lot mode to the Pivo.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>In contrast to the optimism I usually present here, and <a href="/2013-mercedes-s-class-feature-autopilot-stop-and-go">last week&#8217;s article about a self-driving Mercedes just a year away</a> it&#8217;s worth noting this <a href="http://smh.drive.com.au/motor-news/bmws-new-driverless-car-still-a-decade-away-20111123-1nuci.html">interview with   various BMW folks</a> where they provide a much more cautious timeline of at least a decade.   Part of their concern comes from the use of computer vision systems.  These are much cheaper than laser scanners but do not provide the reliability needed; it&#8217;s no accident that all the successful teams in the Darpa urban challenge relied very heavily on laser scanning.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m enough of an optimist that I am ready to bring forward the question &#8220;<strong>When will a child be born that never drives because of robocars?</strong>&#8221;  Of course there are many people in the developed world who never get a licence for a variety of reasons, particularly people who live their lives in Manhattan and other transit-heavy cities.  But for most of us, getting a licence and getting on the road is a rite of passage.    Yet <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/23/AR2010012301339.html">studies are showing that teens are now waiting longer to get a licence</a> with various reasons speculated.</p>

<p><img src=/files/rattray.jpg class=blogpic>
Nonetheless eventually we will see somebody who would normally have been jumping at the chance to get a licence and get out on the road who never gets one because they have a robocar.   It won&#8217;t be easy of course, since even those who have robocars will still need to travel to places that don&#8217;t have them and rent cars, but many people who don&#8217;t have licences today just make use of taxis and transit in those situations.</p>

<p>I will put forward the proposal that this child may already have been born.  When I see a baby today, I wonder, &#8220;will this child ever learn to drive?&#8221;  While 16 years is aggressive for the ubiquitous fully autonomous operation needed for this, I do think we&#8217;re on the cusp, and if that child has not yet been born, it&#8217;s not too far away.</p>

<p>One reason for this is all the forces that are already reducing teen driving.  A teen debating whether to take the effort to learn to drive might easily be swayed not to because mom has bought him a robocar.  Once a successful safety record for robocars is demonstrated, parents will buy them for teens &#8212; instead of buying them driving lessons &#8212;  and pressure the teens to not take the risk of driving themselves.</p>

<p>In other news, here&#8217;s a pointer to <a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/Autonomo-2030-Autonomous-Mobility/2422404">work by designer Charles Rattray</a> on the look of future robocars.  His designs match with my position that many robocars should be half the width of today&#8217;s cars, carrying only 1-2 people, since the vast majority of cars today only carry 1-2 people.   Today&#8217;s car buyers insist on 5 passenger sedans (or larger) but when you have mobility-on-demand you can use the right vehicle for the trip on every trip, and that&#8217;s going to mostly be one person vehicles.  This in turn, is the real key to efficient transportation, because while you can do great things with more efficient or electric power trains and more aerodynamic cars, nothing compares to making the car smaller, lighter and narrower in a major way.  He has many design sketches and a video of how he sees the cars in action.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>For the first time, a car company has put a date on shipment of a car with self-driving ability.</p>

<p>According to British site Auto Express, Mercedes has <a href="http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/autoexpressnews/274699/new_sclass_to_drive_itself.html">revealed that their 2013 S-class will feature self-driving</a>.   Not clear if there is an official company press release, though the company has been talking about such features, as have many other companies.    Realize that the 2013 model year is just a year away.</p>

<p>The car will feature radar based automatic cruise control, combined with lane-marker following, and the automatic driving will only operate below 40kph.  In other words, this is designed to let you take your hands off the wheel in stop-and-go traffic jams, not to drive you at actual open driving speeds.   You&#8217;ll need to pay attention to the road, not read a book, but at that low speed you&#8217;ll have decent warning if something goes wrong and the car starts drifting, so I suspect that in spite of warnings not to do so, people will get away with minor tasks like reading a few e-mails or even sending some.</p>

<p>While a very basic level introduction, this is still a milestone and will pave the way (love those road metaphors) for other companies.  While the focus of the DARPA grand challenges and most visions of the robocar future has been on cars that can drive completely on their own, there are now strong signals that the technology will arrive in the form of driving assist, and human drivers will be called upon to still do much of the driving, in particular the tricky bits the systems aren&#8217;t safe to handle.    In my article a few years ago <a href="http://robocars.com/roadmap.html">the roadmap to robocars</a> I suspected we might see a few specialized applications first, such as robot valet parking and even autonomous vehicles for military delivery applications, but now the autopilot is on track for showing up commercially first.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I shoot with the Canon 5d Mark II.   While officially not a pro camera, the reality is that a large fraction of professional photographers use this camera rather than the Eos-1D cameras which are faster but much bulkier and in some ways even inferior to the 5D.   But it&#8217;s been out a long time now, and everybody is wondering when its successor will come and what features it will have.</p>

<p>Each increment in the DSLR world has been quite dramatic over the last decade.  There&#8217;s always been a big increase in resolution with the new generation, but now at 22 megapixels there&#8217;s less call for that.   While there are lenses that deliver more than 22 megapixels sharply, they are usually quite expensive, and while nobody would turn down 50mp for free,  there just wouldn&#8217;t be nearly as much benefit from it than the last doubling.   Here&#8217;s a look at features that might come, or at least be wished for.</p>

<h2>Better Pixels</h2>

<p>More pixels may not be important, but everybody wants better pixels.</p>

<ul>
<li>Low noise / higher ISO:  The 5D2 astounded us with ISO 3200 shots that aren&#8217;t very noisy.  Unlike megapixels, there is almost no limit to how high we would like ISO to go at low noise levels.    Let&#8217;s hope we see 12,500 or more at low noise, plus even 50,000 noisy.   Due to physics, smaller pixels have higher noise, so this is another reason not to increase the megapixel count.</li>
<li>3 colour: The value of full 3-colour samples at every pixel has been overstated in the past.   The reason is that Bayer interpolation is actually quite good, and almost every photographer would rather have 18 million bayer pixels over 6 million full RGB pixels.  It&#8217;s not even a contest.   As we start maxing out our megapixels to match our lenses, this is one way to get more out of a picture.  But if it means smaller pixels, it causes noise.   The Foveon approach which stacked the 3 pixels would be OK here &#8212; finally.  But I don&#8217;t expect this to be very likely.</li>
<li>Higher dynamic range: How about 16 bits per pixel, or even 24?   HDR photography is cool but difficult.  But nobody doesn&#8217;t want more range, if only for the ability to change exposure decisions after the fact and bring out those shadows or highlights.   Automatic HDR in the camera would be nice but it&#8217;s no substitute for try high-range pixels.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Video &amp; Audio</h2>

<p>Due to the high quality video in the 5D2, many professional videographers now use it.  Last week Canon announced new high-end video cameras aimed at that market, so they may not focus on improvements in this area.   If they do, people might like to see things like 60 frame video, ability to focus while shooting, higher ISO, and 4K video. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/what-do-i-want-5d-mark-3-next-generation-digital-slr">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

    <div class="content"><p>Last week, new studies came back on the California High Speed Rail project.   They have raised the estimated cost to $99 billion, and dropped the ridership estimate to 36.8 million and $5.5 billion in annual revenue.  Note that only around 20 million people currently fly the SF to LA corridor &#8212; they expect to not just capture most of those but large numbers of central valley trips.</p>

<p>Even at the earlier estimates the project was an obvious mistake, and there&#8217;s no way to financially justify spending $99 billion to pull in $5.3 billion/year even subbing zero in for the large operating cost.  But for various political reasons involving getting federal money, some are still pushing for this project, and we may well build a short train to nowhere in the central valley just to get the federal bucks.</p>

<p>They&#8217;re planning there because the various cities in the populated areas have been fighting legal battles to block the train there, not wanting its disruption.  Because the train can only stop if a very few places at the speed it wants to go, a lot of towns would end up having construction and noise and street blockage and not get a lot of use from the train.</p>

<p>The local opposition is a tough barrier, because the train ends up really only being useful where the people are.   While I have doubts about how many people would ride the long haul, since few want to go from downtown SF to downtown LA, lots of people would ride a fast train in the urban areas.   In particular, what nobody talks about is running the HSR primarily to the airport, and streamlining both security clearance and the connection with new technology.    The only reason HSR is pushed as possibly competing with flights is because of the nightmare we have made of flying, where people have to get to airports 45 minutes ahead of even short-haul flights and take a fair bit of time to get out of airports on the other end and make it through traffic to their destinations.     A fast train from a downtown to the airport where you clear security (and check bags) right on the train, and the train drops you right at the central gate areas post security would create an unbeatable trip from downtown anywhere to downtown anywhere.</p>

<p>For fast trains, the San Francisco to San Jose route is so short that a 250mph HSR could do the 48 mile trip between the towns in 12 minutes without stopping, call it 15 with the start and stop at each end.    This opens up an interesting cost saving &#8212; you could build a single track, and have a train zip back and forth on it, and still provide service every 30 minutes.    You could put a double-track section in the middle and have service every 15 minutes, with lots of safety interlocks of course.  A single track requires less land, less of everything and could probably be built along easier routes, even highway medians in some cases.   You could avoid turnaround time by having double track at the endpoints, so one train is leaving for opposite route the moment the other train arrives, giving each train quite a long turnaround &#8212; with double rolling stock.</p>

<p>Of course, having no stops is not that valuable because only a few people want to go from SJ to SF.  People would want a stop at the airport as I have indicated, and at least one in Mountain View or Palo Alto.   Each stop costs a bunch of time, and eventually the trip gets long enough that the single-track trick becomes less useful.  For a while I&#8217;ve wondered if you could make trains that could dock, so that the main train runs non-stop and is able to shed cars which stop at local stops (not that hard) and to dock with cars coming from local stops (harder.)  I <a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/archives/000086.html">proposed this 7 years ago</a> near the start of this blog, and there are serious rail designers <a href="http://www.priestmangoode.com/transport/">thinking along the same lines</a> &#8212; see the video in that link.</p>

<p>In the Priestman Goode proposal, they have trains docking side to side.  That seems much more challenging though it offers fast transfer.   If you combine the two ideas, you would have two tracks &#8212; one for the nonstop trains and one for the docking shuttles which serve all the local stops.   Indeed, if you could do this you could get rid of the old regular speed rail service running on existing track pairs because this would be superior in all ways except cost.   My own proposals attempted to dock on a single track, which seems easier to me.</p>

<p>Robocars play a role in all this too.  Even the HSR authority realizes they have a big problem, in that once people get quickly to an HSR station, they still have to get to their real destination.   Using local transit may mean spending more time on a local bus than on the HSR.   The mobility on demand of robocars is a great answer, and I&#8217;m pretty sure that with a 2030 forecast completion date (if they&#8217;re lucky) we&#8217;ll have robocars long before then.   And the one thing cars can&#8217;t readily do is go very fast efficiently between cities.</p>

<p>The docking approach, should it work, has another advantage.  The main train can take the best route (cheapest or shortest) without too much regard for where the stations are.  People like stations in urban centers, but bringing the high speed train right through such areas (like Palo Alto) is hard and has caused the lawsuits.   If the train goes through the industrial space along the Bay, and a spur goes into downtown for the shuttle that docks with it, you get a win all around.</p>

<p>Another approach that doesn&#8217;t require dock/undock works when you have a solid terminus like SF.    You have 3 trains leave SF at the same time.  The first one goes express to San Jose.  The second goes express to Palo Alto and Mountain View and then switches to low speed tracks to go to Sunnyvale and Santa Clara.   The third goes to SFO airport.   Because SFO airport is also an origination point, it sends a train to SJ just before or after the one from SF, and another train to Mountain View right after that one.   Mountain View to SJ service might be able to fit in or have to be local service.      These sub-trains are just a few cars.  This is not as energy efficient, though it can be if the trains are able to get close to one another and draft, sort of a virtual coupling without physical contact.   You need perfect sync, and special long-spring collision bumpers in case the sync fails and they bump.   The risk of higher-speed bumping must be prevented by failsafes that don&#8217;t even let the trains get on the same track until speed is matched close enough.  This requires more than just a single track of course.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Congestion on the roads has a variety of sources.   These include accidents of course, reductions in road capacity, irrational human driving behaviours and others, but most of all you get congestion when more cars are trying to use a road than it has capacity for.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why the two main success stories in congestion today are metering lights and downtown congestion charging.   Metering lights limit how fast cars can enter the highway, so that you don&#8217;t overload it and traffic flows smoothly.    By waiting a bit at the metering light you get a fast ride once on the highway.   Sometimes though, especially when the other factors like accidents come into play, things still gum up.</p>

<p>Now that more and more cars are connected (by virtue just of the smartphone the driver carries if nothing else) the potential will open up for something else in congestion &#8212; finding ways to encourage drivers to leave a congested road. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/paying-drivers-leave-road">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

    <div class="content"><p>A little self-plug.  I have an article on an introduction to panoramic photographic technique the <a href="http://www.phototechmag.com/index.php/novemberdecember-2011">November issue of Photo Technique</a> with a few panos in it.   This is old world journalism, folks &#8212; you have to read it on paper at least for now.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;m working on upcoming galleries of photos from Botswana, Eastern Europe and Burning Man for you.   I have already placed two of my Botswana photos into my <a href="http://pic.templetons.com/brad/pano/bestof.html">gallery of favourite panoramas</a>.   This includes a lovely <a href="http://pic.templetons.com/cgi-bin/imget?f=brad/pano/africa/harv-best.jpg&amp;fw=26174">group of elephants</a> in Savuti and a <a href="http://pic.templetons.com/cgi-bin/imget?f=brad/pano/africa/treeweb-275.jpg&amp;fw=27185">sunset on the Okavango delta</a> that is one of my new favourites.</p>

<p><a href=http://pic.templetons.com/cgi-bin/imget?f=brad/pano/africa/harv-best.jpg&amp;fw=26174><img class=coverpic width=96% src=http://pic.templetons.com/brad/pano/africa/thumb/harv-best.jpg></a></p>

<p>We decided to go to Harvey&#8217;s pan in Savuti one afternoon and lucked upon a large breeding group of elephant just on their way there.  I caught them in one of my first long lens panoramas.   Long lens panos are fairly difficult due to the limited depth of field, but they get great detail on the baby elephant.</p>

<p>Much more to come!</p>
