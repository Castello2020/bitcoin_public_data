    <div class="content"><p>Right now the push in displays is all for computer and TV displays, with fast response time, and ideally in a flat form-factor.  But these are expensive, really expensive if you want more than 2 megapixels.</p>

<p>What if we bring back an old technology &#8212; long persistence phosphors &#8212; and use them to make displays intended for still images, such as photography and art, at high resolution.  They are cheap and bright.  And if you don&#8217;t need to do 60 frames/second, you can also get away with cheap electronics are more resolution per persisting frame.</p>

<p>It would be easy to start with black and white.  B&amp;W displays require just a screen of phosphor and a way to excite it.  The resolution can be extremely high.  Colour requires a shadow mask style technology, or projection such as CRT projection.   A portal in the wall for say 10 to 20 megapixel B&amp;W photographs and art might be a desireable product for the home.  But there&#8217;s hardly any limit for B&amp;W.</p>

<p>There is a limit for CRTs, it get expensive to make a tube that big.  New technologies are allowing the electron gun to not be far at the back so it need not be as deep as it is wide, but these are also heavy and fragile.  CRT projection (mounted in the roof) might be a good answer.</p>

<p>There are however lots of ultraviolet phosphors which could be triggered by a UV laser or other such source, for rooftop projection or rear projection.  If the persistence is long enough so you only have to do a few frames per second you can get in lots of resolution I would think.   What would you pay for a 30 megapixel portal in your wall, one as sharp as  a window (but not moving and only in 2D of course) showing scenes of the world, and great photography and art?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Well, the Supreme Court ruled today that expropriation for private development can still be legal if the town council seems to think there&#8217;s a public benefit.  It&#8217;s a terrible decision, with strange logic, and strange votes from the judges, but you will probably read many other articles about that today.   What I want to figure is, given this ruling, what can we do to make it better?</p>

<p>What we will see happening is a land developer coming to the city with a plan to demolish a redevelop a block in a way that they claim will be good for the city &#8212; perhaps bringing in tourists, jobs, business, whatever.  Of course the deal is very good for the land developer, or they would not be drafting it.</p>

<p>I suggest we make it less sweet for the developer in such cases and give some of that sweetness to the expropriation victims.  Today they get a &#8220;fair market value&#8221; for their property (that part of the 5th amendment wasn&#8217;t shredded) but I say, if the expropriation is for private use, let&#8217;s give them more.</p>

<p>First, start by paying them this fair market value at the date of expropriation, as we do now.</p>

<p>Then, after the deal is complete (with some time limits and other good constraints) we want to determine just how much &#8220;value&#8221; came from aggregating the properties.  Right now this value goes to the developer.  We&#8217;re going to give most or all of it to the expropriated folks.   So we come up with a value for the amalgamated property.  (More below on how to do that.)    This pre-opening profit would go, all or most of it, to the landowners.  The developer keeps any further appreciation of the property as they operate it &#8212; they need an upside too, of course.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Corporate servers have used network storage, ranging from fileservers, to SAN for several years.  Now, with USB IDE external drive cases selling for as little as $20, people are using external drives on their PC, and get pretty good response with 400 mbit USB 2 or with 1394/firewire.   You can get most of the capacity of a 7200 rpm drive over USB 2.</p>

<p>So I want to call for the production of a cheap home external storage box.  This box would have slots for 4 or 5 drives and cooling for them, ideally as big a fan as possible to keep the rpms and noise low in the desk model, and an even more powerful fan in the basement model.
The desk model might have sound insulation though that&#8217;s hard to combine with good cooling.</p>

<p>While this box could and probably should have USB or 1394, even better would be gigabit ethernet, which is fast enough for most people&#8217;s storage needs, especially if there is a dedicated gigabit ethernet card in the PC just for talking to the storage.</p>

<p>This could allow for a radical redesign of PC cases of all types, with no need for the space and heat of drives.  And of course these diskless PCs would be much quieter.  You could put your disk cube under your desk (and thus have it be a bit quieter) but ideally you would like the basement model, to which you string cat5e cable and get a mostly silent PC.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>When I switched to drupal, I lost the &#8220;type in my first name&#8221; code to stop comment spam that I had written for Movable Type.  I used drupal&#8217;s systems for spam spotting and comment moderation, but in fact those are not very good yet, so I re-coded the system so that anonymous commenters can comment directly if they answer a simple question on the comment form.  The question, in this case the trivial one of entering my first name, is easy to answer and can be handled by the blind (which is not true of captchas.)  If spammers should write programs to fill in that field, I can quickly change the question or make it more complex as needed.  If spammers start to automate answering trivial questions faster than we can think them up, then perhaps we can consider captchas and other more advanced turing tests.</p>

<p>Note that you won&#8217;t see the question if you are a registered user of this site (you can also log in with your idea from most other drupal sites too) so registration is encouraged but not required.</p>

<p>Comment spam is a nasty scourage.  I think Movable Type as the most popular software gets the most but all systems that get popular will get hit.  In addition I modified drupal to use the rel=nofollow tag on homepage links &#8212; it already does it on other links in comments &#8212; so spammers gain no search engine credit for their spam.  Sorry, that also applies to honest commenters.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In much of the animal kingdom, mating involves the males putting on a display, and the females choosing the male they like, and the male pretty much always going off with the female who chooses him, certainly for a short interlude but also for a child-raising length of time.</p>
<p>In our closest relatives, the chimp and bonobo, there is extreme female promiscuity, with various theories as to why.  In chimps, there is an alpha male but females will mate secretly with lessers.  Bonobos do it with any other bonobo, any time, any place.</p>
<p>Humans have developed a system where more often the female worries most about display, though males certainly also do it.  In most cultures, the male then selects the female he finds most attractive.  The female then also decides if she wants that male or will wait for a better one.</p>
<p>The most dramatic example of the common animal mode is the peacock, who is all about display, and chosen by the rather plain peahen.  The peacock is sexually selected for so much display his tail is actually a survival disadvantage.</p>
<p>So I am curious as to what would happen if an online dating service were built on the peafowl model.  Which is to say only men would put up ads (display), possibly for free, and women would browse and contact the men they like (possibly having to pay to do so.)  They could also include a reputation system for women to rate the men after dropping them, which some dating services are already playing with.</p>
<p>My question is, would this be a spectacular failure, or a surprising success, or just midling?  It is common in dating systems to have the women pay less or nothing, and have the men bear the price.  This is partly due to social norms and expectation about financial ability based in tradition.  And in business, you do want to go where the money is.  Men are also less protective of their identity in online dating, so they would just put their real contact info in the free part of their profile, not wanting the woman's non-payment to be a barrier. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/node/227">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

    <div class="content"><p>I&#8217;ve <a href="/archives/000195.html">written a few times about Peerflix</a> the P2P DVD trading system similar to some of my own ideas.  After trying it for a few months, I have to report trouble.</p>

<p>As I feared, as a DVD drops in popularity, it means somebody will be stuck with it.  I feel it should be the original contributor but in Peerflix, it&#8217;s whoever happens to have traded for it most recently.   Back in April, I got in 4 DVD trades for high quality movies 1-2 years in age.  In particular for <em>Momento</em>, <em>Mystic River</em>, <em>School of Rock</em> and <em>A Mighty Wind</em>.  I have been slow to getting to watch these, so I&#8217;ve gotten to see just how many chances there have been to return them.</p>

<p>In 2 months, we&#8217;ve seen just a couple of requests for Momento and Mystic River.  In all those cases, if I didn&#8217;t respond to the request within a short time, a few hours at most, somebody else would send off their copy of the disk and I would remain stuck with it.  Of course since I have not yet watched Mystic River, I may have just not been motivated enough to say yes.   Today I got my first request to send off <em>A Mighty Wind</em> and did not agree in time.  I have <em>not ever</em> gotten a chance to send off <em>School of Rock</em>.</p>

<p>Now for &#8220;new releases&#8221; this is not the case.  The DVDs I contributed that were recent and in high demand did get requested quite quickly.  But the lesson quickly learned is that if you want to watch a slightly older DVD, you truly are buying it rather than borrowing it.  If rapid watching is your goal, trading off a recent DVD for an older one will leave you in the lurch.</p>

<p>Now it&#8217;s true that at video stores, they say that only new releases really draw the volume, so this perhaps is no surprise.  But it&#8217;s also not a very workable system.  I was debating recommending my family in Canada join up, but with the smaller membership group there, I fear it could be even worse.  The cheaper plans from Netflix or other competitors make more sense.</p>

<p>Update: I don&#8217;t watch DVDs very often due to my MythTV always having good HD shows in it (once you have HD it&#8217;s hard to go back to regular TV or even DVD) so I&#8217;ve seen frightening patterns.  Peerflix put out a recommendation for Memento on their blog, so I now get requests for it moderately often.   However, in the past  8 months, I have barely seen any requests for Mystic River, School of Rock or A Mighty Wind, all top-rated films if a few years old.  And none of the couple of requests I have seen for these films have come when I was around &#8212; and I&#8217;ve only been away perhaps 15% of the time at most.</p>

<p>Update2: School of Rock was finally requested in December, I got the Pianist in exchange.   Probably another long-term camper.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Sunday, I was invited, along with a crowd of other local friends and bloggers, to a preview screening of the new art film <a href="http://www.yesthemovie.com">&#8220;Yes&#8221; by Sally Potter</a>.   I&#8217;ll review Yes, but what was interesting was the idea of Sony Pictures doing free screenings of movies for the &#8220;blogger&#8221; demographic.   As I noted earlier, I&#8217;m also in this group called the &#8220;Silicon Valley 100&#8221; where they send us free stuff in the hopes we&#8217;ll generate buzz and useful feedback.  (The last few products they sent have not been exciting enough to inspire me to write about them, though.)</p>

<p>It makes some sense.  Advance screenings to create buzz have been around for a while, and now that you can have an audience of writers whose influence goes beyond their circle of friends, they are a good target to place.   Though I also went in part because it was a social event, seeing a movie with a group of folks including friends.  It was arranged by Mark Pincus, who loved the movie when he saw it at Telluride and suggested the screening to Sony.  Equally important was going out to a bar after the movie.</p>

<p>As for &#8220;Yes&#8221;, I did find it quite good.  It was, however the most &#8220;arthouse&#8221; style movie I have seen in years, so I doubt it will get great commercial success.  Yes is done in verse, a la Shakespeare, but with modern phrasing and perhaps a touch too much rhyme.  Though the Bard never had a Scottish dishwasher apply metre as he repeated the word &#8220;motherfucker.&#8221;  But it&#8217;s also a good story, with good performances and good music.  It has Bergmanesque stylings, and includes a lot of &#8220;inner thoughts&#8221; voice overs, which normally turns me right off, but at least in a few places, the voice-overs work.  Notably when a dying woman gets to tell her story through her thoughts even though she can&#8217;t speak them.</p>

<p>Of course, they have picked a terrible title for a movie if they want people to be able to find writing about it on the web.  (Drupal doesn&#8217;t have explicit tagging yet, and Mark went so far as to push people to use the pre-chosen tag &#8220;yes movie&#8221; if they wrote about the film.)  However, the title makes artistic sense for the film so I can&#8217;t fault it for that.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Here&#8217;s an entry in my new &#8220;solve this&#8221; cateogry, which asks for reader input on solving problems.</p>

<p>When flying on a very full flight yesterday, we had an example of what my <a href="/archives/000054.html">approach for faster airplane loading</a> would have helped with.  But until we get that, are there other solutions?</p>

<p>On the full flight, passengers would stand in the aisle trying to store their bags.  With the compartments full they took a long time doing it, sometimes found themselves unable to.  This blocked the loading and even though we started boarding 30 minutes before the flight, we were not finished by departure time.  The flight attendants were on the PA every few minutes telling people not to stand in the aisle, to instead step into the row and let people pass, but very few paid attention to it.   We don&#8217;t seem inclined to do this, and not just because we are desperate for storage space.  (I&#8217;m one of the desperate, I carry on fragiles like camera gear that I refuse to let them throw around.)  We just don&#8217;t believe that our own efforts will slow things much, and we also believe it will take &#8220;just a few more seconds&#8221; to get the bag in right.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I am told an interview I did a few months ago on USENET and elements of its history will air today on the American Public Media show &#8220;Marketplace.&#8221;  The audio can be played from the <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2005/06/10/PM200506102.html">Marketplace web site</a> in realplayer format.  It airs on most NPR stations at times ranging from early afternoon to about 6:30pm.</p>

<p>I did my interview mostly on history, but the story ended up mostly being about Google with just a few quotes from me (with other quotes from friends of mine like Marissa Meyer and Lauren Weinstein, who got to play the privacy advocate though it&#8217;s normally my job.)</p>

<p>When I did this interview, I did it by phone but put on a headset mic and recorded my audio locally.  Then I uploaded an MP3 of my end to Marketplace.  I also did this with an All Things Considered interview in 2003.  Worked out pretty well.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re curious about what the original interview (about USENET) sounded like before being turned into quotes for a Google story, you can hear my side (but not the questions, but you don&#8217;t need them) by downloading it from this 5 megabyte <a href="http://www.templetons.com/brad/tmark.spx">Speex File</a>.  You will need a <a href="http://www.speex.org/projects.html">Speex decoder</a> (it is a free codec meant just for good quality speech, you&#8217;re getting 5 minutes of audio per megabyte!)  If you can&#8217;t do Speex, try the <a href="http://www.templetons.com/brad/tmark.mp3">15MB mp3</a></p>

<p>So here&#8217;s a service I want.  A kiosk in the airport to sell, or ideally rent me a GSM SIM card for a prepaid account, right in the airport.  The kiosk would also sell me unlocking service for my phone, and of course prepaid cards.

    <div class="content"><p>ICANN is pleased to announce that the independent evaluation process, which began last year, has resulted in a further sponsored Top Level Domain (sTLD) application moving to the next stage.</p>

<p>As the process for selecting new sponsored Top Level Domain (sTLDs) continues from a pool of ten applications, ICANN has now entered into commercial and technical negotiations with an additional candidate registry, ICM Registry, Inc, (.POLINC).</p>

<p>The .POLINC top level domain will be a voluntary arena for sites that wish to express ideas that are politically incorrect or inflammatory.   Sites that promote ideas including racism, homosexual advocacy, embryonic stem cell harvesting, creationism, evolutionism, opposition to the war in Iraq, defence of the liberation of Iraq and other topics that are inflammatory can voluntarily register in the .POLINC domain to make it clear what sort of material can be found on the site.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not trying to suprise anybody with the fact that our sites have unpopular an inflammatory opinions on them,&#8221; said Brad Templeton, Chairman of the  www.eff.org web site notorious for its opposition to the surveillance tools the Justice Dept. says are needed for the War on Domestic Terror.  Templeton also operates the www.netfunny.com site, which contains jokes, some of which lampoon stereotypes of all manners.  &#8220;By giving us our own domain, people will know exactly what they are getting.  Our views are for adults.  We&#8217;re not trying to push them on kids.&#8221;</p>

<p>Operators of .POLINC domains believe that by using this domain, they will have an answer to any user who complains about finding their material on the internet, in particular parents who don&#8217;t want their children exposed to highly radical views.  Internet filtering software, commonly sold to parents, schools and libraries, will be able to easily and reliably block access to .POLINC sites by children and library patrons.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I have <a href="/archives/000048.html">written before</a> about what a terrible idea it is to generate top level domains that are generic, and have a meaning, because they create artificial monopolies over real words and generic terms, something even trademark law figured out was stupid centuries ago.</p>

<p>Now ICANN has gone one worse and <a href="http://icann.org/announcements/announcement-01jun05.htm">annouced that a .XXX domain is underway</a>.  It is also talking about TLDs for jobs, and travel as well as .CAT, .POST and .MOBI.</p>

<p>The .XXX domain is a terrible idea, not just because of the monopoly it gives.  It is almost certainly the first step towards putting greater liability on people who provide adult content and don&#8217;t brand it with a .XXX domain.   There is justifiable fear of laws that punish adult content outside of .XXX and don&#8217;t punish it inside.  But at the same time filters will take the simple step of blocking all of .XXX from companies, schools, libraries and kids &#8220;just to be safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Which creates a &#8220;damned if you do, damned if you don&#8217;t&#8221; situation for anybody who is borderline adult, not necessarily hard core porn, but viewed <em>by some</em> as not appropriate for children.  Including possibly many of the dirty jokes on my own RHF web site.</p>

<p>I wish there were some way to stop this.</p>

<p>Addendum:  While the Daily Show (best show on TV) did a great segment on how incredibly silly it was for TV shows to sit there and read out blogs aloud on TV, MSNBC has just such a segment called &#8220;Tony&#8217;s Tabs&#8221;, part of &#8220;Connected Coast to Coast with Ron Reagan and Monica Crowley&#8221;, and in my most unusual trackback ever, this posting was featured on it&#8230;</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I&#8217;m writing a larger essay on this topic, but I recently posted the following to Interesting People and it was requested to put it here.  It relates to the theme of &#8220;light&#8221; DRM.</p>

<p>I used to wonder if you made a DRM system that was so well designed that
only a serious pirate would notice it was there, if this might be
a workable system.</p>

<p>But now I have come to realize that there&#8217;s one very important community
which a DRM system can&#8217;t avoid harming, and that&#8217;s the open source<br />
community, who as a largely philanthropic effort build linux, the bsds and
much of the software that runs the internet and is thus used by everybody.</p>

<p>One of the pillars of the open source community, written into several
of its most common licences, is that the end user must be able to
modify the software, both for their own use and to give away to others.
Of course, most end-users don&#8217;t recompile their tools, but a sizeable
number do, and they provide innovations, fixes and improvements that
get used by all the users.</p>

<p>There is a fundamental incompatability between this ability to modify
and any DRM that has a software element to its enforcement.  You
simply can&#8217;t have them both.</p>

<p>That leaves DRM where all the enforcement (ie. decryption and
display/presentation) takes place within physically secured devices.
This is not easy to do, and even if done, it bars the open source
software from any useful features that might be thought up which require
access to the media &#8212; only what the hardware permits can be done.</p>

<p>The end result is to largely shut open source software out of the
media playing arena, and thus, if you believe in the convergence of
media playing devices and computing devices, out of the general
purpose home computer arena.</p>

<p>To those who use the open source software, the trouble with this is
obvious.  But in fact, all must be concerned, as the open source
software, aside from being one of the few competitors to forces like
Microsoft, is also becoming a source of significant innovation.  That
old style, garage-based innovation, where a loner or small team
develop something new on the cheap which changes the world.   DRM
systems can be architected to allow a Tivo, but they bar the &#8220;next Tivo&#8221;
which is a loss to all.</p>

<p>So the conclusion is that, as suggested, you can&#8217;t pull off the
&#8220;make everybody happy&#8221; DRM.   Instead, you get DRM which mostly sits
as a barrier not to pirates or users, but to the small innovators of
the world, and what a tragedy that would be.  </p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>When our society got rich, we started living much more sterile lives, and a whole bunch of diseases cropped up which are autoimmune disorders.  These range from allergies to <a href="http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/crohns/">Chrohn&#8217;s Disease</a>, which destroys the bowel.  Many of these syndromes did not exist in the pre-sterile world.  (Not all autoimmune disorders are this way, of course.)</p>

<p>So some parents have become aware that you need to let your kids play in the muck, and with animals, and get exposed to diseases and parasites so your immune system grows up as you grow up.  Otherwise, with nothing to do, it can attack you.</p>

<p>But parents are protective.  They are not going to deliberately expose their children to parasites.  But there are treatments that have been developed for sufferers of these diseases that give them safe alternatives that their immune system can fight.  For example, the spores of parisites that infect other animals, but not humans.</p>

<p>So we need to develop a regime of &#8220;vaccines&#8221; against autoimmune disorders.  A regimen of safe infectious agents that will put the immune system through the paces it expects to go through in the natural world, but which won&#8217;t cause damage.  And we need to expose children, and possibly even adults, to them through their lives.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I&#8217;ve switched the blog from Movable Type to <a href="http://drupal.org">drupal</a>.  Drupal is a PHP based, open source blog and community system that will allow me in the future to support all sorts of fancy things, such as discussion forums, polls, multi-user blogging and a lot of other stuff.  Drupal is entirely another class of application beyond MT, though I won&#8217;t be using all of what it has at first.</p>

<p>For now, you will of course see a different look for the blog.  Categories can be expanded from the navigation menu and you can do more things with them.  You can also create a userid and password to log in.  If you do this, comments appear under your name and they appear immediately without need for me to approve them.  You also can configure how the site looks for you and turn on other features.  I can even give users a blog in the future if you like, when the permission system improves.   If you have a login at many other drupal sites you can use it here, by using the userid username@thedrupalsite.  (Or use userid@ideas.4brad.com on other drupal sites.)</p>

<p>Let me know if there are any problems.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>There&#8217;s a lot of talk about the coming threat of Avian H5N1 flu, how it might kill many millions, far beyond the 1918 flu and others, because of how much people travel in the modern world. Others worry about bioterrorism.</p>

<p>Plans are underway to deal with it, but are they truly thinking about some of the tools the modern world has that it didn&#8217;t have in 1918 which might make up for our added risks?   We have the internet, and a lot of dot-coms, both living and dead, created all sorts of interesting tools for living in the world without having to leave your house.</p>

<p>In the event of an outbreak, we&#8217;ll have limited vaccine available, if there&#8217;s much at all. Everybody will want it, and society will have to prioritize who gets what. While some choices are obvious &#8212; medical staff and other emergency crews &#8212; there may be other ideas worth considering.</p>

<p>Today, a significant fraction of the population can work from home, with phone, computer and internet. The economy need not shut down just because people must avoid congregating. Plans should be made, even at companies that prefer not to allow telecommuting, to be able to switch to it in an emergency.</p>

<p>Schools might have to close but education need not stop. We can easily devote TV channels in each area to basic curriculum for each grade. Individual schools can modify that for students who have internet access or even just a DVD player or VCR. For example, teachers could teach their class to a camera, and computers can quickly burn DVDs for distribution. Students can watch the DVDs, pause them and phone questions to the teacher. (However, ideally most students are able to make use of the live lectures on TV, and can phone their particular teacher, or chat online, to ask questions.) Parents, stuck at home would also help their children more.</p>

<p>Delivery people (USPS, UPS etc.) would be high in line for vaccination to keep goods flowing to people in their homes. You can of course buy almost anything online already. Systems like Webvan, for efficient grocery ordering and delivery could be brought back up, with extra vaccinated delivery drivers making rounds of every street.</p>

<p>Of course not everybody has a computer, but that need not be a problem. With so many people at home, volunteers would come forward who did have broadband. They would take calls from those who do not have computers and do their computer tasks for them, making sure they got in their orders for food and other supplies. Of course all food handlers would need to be vaccinated and use more sterile procedures. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/archives/000214.html">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

    <div class="content"><p>I recently read the story of the <a href="http://wifinetnews.com/archives/005325.html" rel="nofollow">coffee shop that's shutting down their free wifi on weekends</a> because it mostly gets them moochers who, far worse than simply not buying anything, sit and stare at computers and don't talk to anybody.   They found that when they shut down the free network, they not only got people to buy more coffee, the place was also more social.</p>
<p>So while there are a variety of solutions to sell or control access to a network, such as printing tokens that give a period of access on every receipt, or selling the access as they do at Starbucks, here's another idea -- intermittent access.</p>
<p>In such a system the access point lets you on for a modest amount of time.  Enough for a quick web search or two, a checking of your e-mail or even a modest phone call.   Then it denies you access.  It doesn't have to deny it for long, perhaps just 5 minutes before you can get on again.   No authentication, though during the period of denied access, it may redirect all web requests to a page that explains the situation, and optionally offers continuous access for money.</p>
<p>Though that's not the main goal.  The main goal is to create an atmosphere where you're coming to the shop to do other than stare at your computer, but in which you can use it on occasion to get your fix.</p>
<p>Who knows, if the sale option for continuous access was popular, it might even make more money than an always charging system.  Of course, fancy users could change their MAC address to get around it -- but if they're going to go that far, let them.  Most won't. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/archives/000213.html">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

    <div class="content"><p>Fast food outlets all have drive-throughs, and they are popular though sometimes it's hard to figure out why, since you get a slow simulation of being stuck in traffic.  "Oooh, are we going to move!   Yes, he's released his brakelights!"  You may also have heard that McDonalds is outsourcing the order-taking part at some restaurants to teleworkers in the midwest, where wages are lower.  (Not India, yet.)  They reason that there is no reason the order-taker, who just punches the order into a computer, need be at the actual location, and in fact, when things are at their most busy, it makes sense to put everybody onto filling orders, not taking them.</p>
<p>You go to a board with a menu and a bad intercom to place your order.  Why do this?  Cell phone penetration is very high now, so why not phone it in?  Either a direct number for that restaurant, or an 800 number where you can say which branch you are at or going to.  You can't see the menu but you probably know it, and the order taker has the time to help you through it.  They might be at the restaurant if they have spare capacity, or might be in a call center entering it on the computer.  They can tell you pretty accurately when your order will be up.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just re-invented phone-in takeout, but this time based on the drive-through concept.   Worst case you call it in while already at the restaurant, which is where you order today.  But if you think about it, you're phoning it in on the way there.  And they might tell you, "You know, it will be 15 minutes here, and just 3 minutes at the branch down the road" to load balance.</p>
<p>Now when you get to the restaurant, you probably should just park in the lot and go inside for your order.  But they could also have a parking area with an LED display with the order numbers (or even sufficiently unique suffixes of phone numbers) displayed to say who can now enter the drive-through lane for instant pickup. </p>
<p>And of course, if you want to pay on credit card, and they know you, you can even pick up the food without  the timewasting cash-handover.</p>
<p>This makes more sense at make-to-order places than at McDonalds of course.   And it can apply to more than fast-food, though usually only fast food places have computerized order management.  Perhaps people might order better food if it were more convenient?</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>When I was a teenager, my father lived in a downtown appartment tower with a cinema in the basement.  Due to his press credentials he had an unlimited free movie pass.  Star Wars played there for over a year, and when we would visit him, if we were ever sitting around wondering what to do, somebody would suggest, "Why don't we go downstairs and see Star Wars?"   Today everybody does this but then the VCR was just dawning, so this was something really cool.</p>
<p>So of course that movie held a special place in my heart, and it was indeed groundbreaking, particularly in effects, grand story and perhaps most of all, good editing.  "The circle is now complete" as Lord Vader would say.</p>
<p>So I'll repeat what everybody else has said, Revenge of the Sith is far better than episodes 1 and 2 of the modern trilogy, better perhaps than the Ewok-burdened Return of the Jedi.  It's an astounding triumph of visuals as well, with a much more moving and interesting story.  Yes, the acting is sub par, the dialogue well sub par and the romantic scenes are non-credible, but the good parts more than make up for this.</p>
<p>At the same time I am left with a disappointment, because it could have been so much more.  Lucas is cursed because the bar was so high.  He built an empire on that first movie but only delivered some of what he could.   I'll get into spoilers in the after-the-break part of this posting, and here I'll speak more generally.</p>
<p>The entire new trilogy is the story of the fall of Darth Vader.  This movie contains its climax, as he changes from troubled Jedi to evil lord.  Powerful as it is, it's still not credible.  Lucas had 8 hours of film all leading up to that one moment, so there's no reason it had to be that way.</p>
<p>Tied in with the moral fall of Vader is the more literal fall of the Jedi.  As we know, they are betrayed, but that story too could have been much richer.</p>
<p>In addition, the biggest thing missing from trilogy 2 is the humour.  Yoda, the imp who stole Empire barely cracks a smile in all the other movies.  Almost nobody does.  And the movies suffer for it.</p>

        <h2 class="title"><a href="/archives/000210.html">Getting the top spammers</a></h2>    <span class="submitted">Submitted by <a href="/user/brad" title="View user profile." rel="nofollow">brad</a> on Sat, 2005-05-21 08:54.</span>
    <span class="taxonomy"><ul class="links inline"><li class="first last taxonomy_term_15"><a href="/archives/cat_spam.html" rel="tag" title="" class="taxonomy_term_15">Spam</a></li>
</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>A recent item posted on politech and Farber&#8217;s IP mailing lists caused some controversy, so I thought I should expand on it here.</p>

<p>The spam law debate has been going on for close to a decade.  There are people with many views, and we&#8217;ve all heard the other side&#8217;s views many times as well.  The differences lie in more fundamental values that are hard to change through argument.</p>

<p>Because of that there are giant spam law battles among people who are generally all on the same side &#8212; getting rid of spam.  Each spam law proposal has people who feel it does too much and chills legitimate speech on one side, and those who feel it does too little and legitimizes some spam on the other.  (With many other subtleties as well.)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s commonly reported that most spam is sent by a relatively small group of hardcore, heavy volume spammers.  In theory much from a group of 20, and the bulk from a group of around 200.  I have never known if this is true or not, but a recent conversation with a leading antispam activist gave evidence that it was.  Antispammers have tracked down a lot of spam, seen billions of spams come into spam-traps and even infiltrated spammer &#8220;bulker&#8221; message boards to learn who&#8217;s who and how they operate.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s assume for the moment that it&#8217;s true that most spam comes from this core group.  Let&#8217;s focus spam law efforts on a law designed just to get them.  A law so narrowly targetted that nobody need fear a chilling effect on legitimate speech, that everybody can get behind.   (A law that also makes it clear that it&#8217;s not precluding other laws or giving blessing to lesser spammers.)</p>

<p>I would see such a law demanding many criteria.  It would require the spammer send millions of spams.   It would require the spammer do this with wilful disregard for the consequences &#8212; ie. a malicious intent.  It could require the spammer have made $10,000 from their spamming.   It would also provide funding and direction for law enforcement to actually go after these spammers.
It would fine them into bankruptcy (all they ever made from spamming plus punative fines) and possibly jail them, particularly if other criminal actions like fraud, sale of illegal products and computer breakins were involved.</p>

<p>This wouldn&#8217;t stop all spammers, but it might well put a real dent in the volume of spam, and scare off many from entering the upper echelons of spamming.  This is a great deal more than any other spam law has managed to do. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/archives/000210.html">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>
