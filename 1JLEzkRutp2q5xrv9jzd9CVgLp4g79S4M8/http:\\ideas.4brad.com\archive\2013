    <div class="content"><p>This year, we stayed with Kathryn&#8217;s family for the holidays, so I attended dinner in my own mother&#8217;s home via Skype.   Once again, the technology was frustrating.  And it need not be.</p>

<p>There were many things that can be better.   For those of us who Skype regularly, we don&#8217;t understand that there is still hassle for those not used to it.   Setting up a good videoconferencing setup is still work.   As I have found is always the case in a group-to-solos videoconference, the group folks do not care nearly as much about the conference as the remote solos, so a fundamental rule of design here is that if the remotes can do something, they should be the ones doing it, since they care the most.  If there is to be UI, leave the UI to the remotes (who are sitting at computers and care) and not to the meeting room locals.   Many systems get this exactly backwards &#8212; they imagine the meeting room is the &#8220;master&#8221; and thus has the complex UI.</p>

<p><img class=blogpic src=http://www.logitech.com/assets/43112/oa-glamor-images.png></p>

<p>In this family setting, however, the clearest problem for me is that no camera can show the whole room.  It&#8217;s like sitting at the table unable to move your head, with blinders on.   You can&#8217;t really be part of the group.   You also have to be away from the table so everybody there can see you, since screens are only visible over a limited viewing angle.</p>

<p>One clear answer to this is the pan/tilt camera, which is to say a webcam with servo motors that allow it to look around.  This technology is very cheap &#8212; you&#8217;ll find pan/tilt IP security cameras online for $30 or less, and there are even some low priced Chinese made pan/tilt webcams out there &#8212; I just picked another up for $20.     I also have the Logitech Orbit AF.   This was once a top of the line HD webcam, and still is very good, but Logitech no longer makes it.     Logitech also makes the BCC950 &#8212; a $200 conference room pan/tilt webcam which has extremely good HD quality and a built-in hardware compressor for 1080p video that is superb with Skype.    We have one of these, and it advertises &#8220;remote control&#8221; but in fact all that means is there is an infrared remote the people in the room can use to steer the camera.   In our meetings, nobody ever uses this remote for the reason I specify above &#8212; the people in the room aren&#8217;t the motivated ones.</p>

<p>This is compounded by the fact that the old method &#8212; audio conference speakerphones &#8212; have a reasonably well understood UI.  Dial the conference bridge, enter a code, and let the remotes handle their own calling in.   Anything more complex than that gets pushback &#8212; no matter how much better it is. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/failure-pan-tilt-camera-video-calls">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

        <h2 class="title"><a href="/gift-guide-update-virtual-goods-and-world-billionaires">Gift guide update -- virtual goods and the world of billionaires</a></h2>    <span class="submitted">Submitted by <a href="/user/brad" title="View user profile." rel="nofollow">brad</a> on Tue, 2013-12-24 18:50.</span>
    <span class="taxonomy"></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I&#8217;ve made some updates to my <a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/gift-guide-being-better-give-receive">Better to Give than Receive Gift Guide</a> for Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>In particular, to help understand the philosophy of the guide (which forbids cash and gift cards, among other things) I propose you imagine the world where you, and all those who you would give gifts to are billionaires.   The reality is the money amount of gifts between adults is normally a blip in the annual budget, so reality is not too far from this hypothetical.</p>

<p>In this world of billionaires it&#8217;s immediately clear why you would not give cash, or gift cards, or easily ordered generic gifts, as the gift guide advises.  They contain nothing of you, just your money.  In a world where the money is unimportant, nothing is left.</p>

<p>The second new topic to discuss is virtual gifts, which can&#8217;t be given in the physical world.  This includes coupons for services, and the growing market of codes for electronic goods like music, apps, e-books, software and the like.</p>

<p>The temptation to give these is strong.  Frankly, if you felt moved to give me a book, I would not want you to give me the physical book.  My shelves are overflowing.   Nor a physical CD, in spite of the ability to personally give it.</p>

<p>This pulls us in two directions.   One would be to say that these goods have now become not much more than gift cards, and as such they should be highly discouraged as gifts.   Find something else.</p>

<p>Alternately, among the &#8220;manufactured&#8221; goods, books, music and their ilk can be a good way to express yourself in a gift, so long as you are giving them a book you recommend rather than a book you think they&#8217;ll like.   As such, it&#8217;s important that what you give be a specific code only for that particular item.  Not anything like an iTunes gift card.  You&#8217;re not giving them money, you&#8217;re giving your care and consideration in picking something that signifies your relationship.</p>

<p>The makers of virtual goods perhaps should work hard at making them easier to give in a meaningful way.  Some do provide a nice page with graphics and a custom message to be printed and given.  For remote recipients, it&#8217;s much less practical to be physical like this.   It would be nice if there were easy mechanisms to give virtual items directly to the accounts and devices of people without entering a long code.  For security reasons you want them to confirm acceptance, and you want to have some actual token of exchange, but otherwise the ideal experience would be to give them a card that says, &#8220;I put this book on your e-reader&#8221; and a quick photo of the card (perhaps with QR code) imports it.  A code which works with all readers, ideally &#8212; though they don&#8217;t all have cameras.</p>

    <span class="taxonomy"><ul class="links inline"><li class="first last taxonomy_term_40"><a href="/taxonomy/term/40" rel="tag" title="Internet economics, technology and issues" class="taxonomy_term_40">Internet</a></li>
</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Here in Canada, a hot political issue (other than disgust with Rob Ford) is the recent plan by Canada Post to stop home delivery in cities.   My initial reaction was, &#8220;Wow, I wish we could get that in the USA!&#8221; but it turns out all they are doing is making people go to neighbourhood mailboxes to get their mail.    For many years, people in new developments have had to do this &#8212; they install a big giant mailbox out on the street, and you get a key to get your mail.  You normally don&#8217;t walk further than the end of your block.   However, this will save a lot of work &#8212; and eliminate a lot of jobs, which also has people upset.</p>

<p>But let me go back to my original reaction &#8212; I want to see home letter delivery abolished.</p>

<p>Why?   All I, and most other people get by mail are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Junk mail (the vast bulk of the mail.)</li>
<li>One or two magazines</li>
<li>Bills and communications from companies that refuse to switch to all-electronic communication</li>
<li>Official notices (from governments who refuse to switch to all-electronic communication)</li>
<li>Cheques from companies who refuse to do direct deposit (see note below.)</li>
<li>Parcels (lots of these, though many more from UPS/Fedex/etc.)</li>
<li>A tiny and dwindling number of personal cards and letters.  Perhaps 2-3 personal xmas cards.</li>
</ul>

<p>The abolition of general mail delivery would force all those parties who refuse to do electronic communication to switch to it.  The concept of an official e-mail address would arise.   We would also need to see a better e-cheque service, something priced like a cheque (ie. not paypal which takes 2% or more) and as easy to use (ACH is not there yet.)  This would force it into existing if you could not mail a cheque.</p>

<p>A replacement for registered mail would need to arise &#8212; that is what is needed for legal service.  Putting that into e-mail is doable though challenging, as it requires adding money to e-mail, because you want people to have to pay to use it so that you don&#8217;t get it all the time.</p>

<p>And of course, parcel service would continue.  And people who <em>really</em> want to send a letter could send it via parcel service, but not for sub-dollar first class mail prices.</p>

<p>Magazines would have to go all-electronic.  Some may not see the world ready for that, but I think the time is very near.   Today, one can make cheap large tablets in the 14 to 17 inch size that would be great for magazines.  They would be too heavy to handhold (though possibly if they had no batteries and used a small cord they could be light enough for that) but they could easily be held on laps and tables and replace the magazine.</p>

<p>Few would mourn the death of junk mail, though it might lead to more spam in e-mail boxes until that&#8217;s under control.  Senders of junk mail (notably politicians) might mourn it.</p>

<p>So the only sad thing would be the loss of the dwindling supply of personal letters.   People getting married could use the parcel companies or go electronic.  Thank-you notes would go electronic, making Miss Manners spin in her grave, but spin she eventually will.  Truth is, the parcel companies would probably start up a basic letter service priced higher than 1st class mail but less than their most basic parcel.  The more addresses you can share the cost of a truck on, the better &#8212; until the deliverbots arrive, at least.  This is not easy, though.  The postal service got to use the economies of delivering several letters a day to your house, and this could pay for a person to walk the street with a bag full, while the parcel companies use trucks.</p>

<p>We all know this day is coming.  The question is, can we do better if we force it, and shut down letter delivery sooner rather than later?</p>

        <h2 class="title"><a href="/death-wifi-login-page">Death to the Wifi login page (part 1)</a></h2>    <span class="submitted">Submitted by <a href="/user/brad" title="View user profile." rel="nofollow">brad</a> on Mon, 2013-12-09 16:46.</span>
    <span class="taxonomy"><ul class="links inline"><li class="first last taxonomy_term_40"><a href="/taxonomy/term/40" rel="tag" title="Internet economics, technology and issues" class="taxonomy_term_40">Internet</a></li>
</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>It&#8217;s the bane of the wanderer.   A large fraction of open Wifi access points don&#8217;t connect you to the internet, but instead want you to login somehow.  They do this by redirecting (hijacking) any attempt to fetch a web page to a login or terms page, where you either have to enter credentials, or just click to say you agree to the terms of service.   A few make you watch an ad.  It&#8217;s sometimes called a captive portal.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to contend that these <strong>hijack screens are breaking a lot of things, and probably not doing anybody &#8212; including portal owners &#8212; any good</strong>.</p>

<p>The terms of service generally get you to declare you will be a good actor.  You won&#8217;t spam or do anything illegal.  You won&#8217;t download pirated content or join  torrents of such content.   You waive rights to sue the portal.  Sometimes you have to pay money or show you are a hotel guest or have an access card.</p>

<p>These screens are a huge inconvenience, and often worse than that.   All sorts of things go wrong when they are in place:</p>

<ul>
<li>Until you do the login with the browser, your other apps, like e-Mail, don&#8217;t work though it looks like internet is there.</li>
<li>With devices that don&#8217;t have keyboards, like Google Glass, you can&#8217;t use the network at all!</li>
<li>Some redirect you from the link you wanted, and don&#8217;t pass you on to that link when you are logged in, you have to type it in again.</li>
<li>If you go to a secure URL (https) some of them attempt an insecure redirect and cause browser security warnings.  They look like a hijack because they are a hijack!  This trains people to be more tolerant of browser security warnings, and breaks tools that try to improve your security and stop more malicious hijacks properly.</li>
<li>Some for &#8220;security&#8221; block the remembering of credentials, making it hard to login every time.</li>
<li>Really bad ones time-out quickly, and make you repeat the login process every time you suspend your laptop, and worse, every time you turn off and turn on your phone &#8212; making the network almost unusable.     Almost all require re-login one or two times a day &#8212; still very annoying.</li>
<li>Every so often the login systems are broken on mobile browsers, locking out those devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of headaches.  And one can perhaps understand the need for this when you must pay for the network or only authorized users are allowed in, though WPA passwords are much better for that because they need only one-time setup and also offer security on the wireless connection.</p>

<p>With all this pain, the question the world needs to answer is, &#8220;<strong>is it worth it?</strong>&#8221;  What is the value of this hijack and &#8220;I agree&#8221; terms page?   Nobody reads the terms, and people who connect, and would ignore the terms to spam or do other bad things, will happily agree to them and ignore them, and they will do so anonymously leaving no way to punish them for violating the terms.    This is not to say that certain entities have not desired to actually find users of open Wifi networks and try to enforce terms on them, but this is extremely rare and almost certainly not desirable to most access point operators.   </p>

<p>There are thus just a few remaining purposes for the hijack screen.</p>

<h2>Charging money</h2>

<p>If you want to charge money, you might need a login screen.  I don&#8217;t deny the right of a provider to ask for money, but there are different ways to do it.  There are a variety of aggregator networks (Such as Boingo and FON) which will handle billing.  They have already installed an app on the user&#8217;s device which allows it to authenticate and handle billing (mostly) seamlessly for the user.  The very common skype application is one of these, and people pay from their skype credit accounts.   Of course, you may not like Skype&#8217;s rates or the cut it takes, so this may not be enough.</p>

<p>You might also want to consider why you are charging the money.  If bandwidth is very expensive, I can see it, but it&#8217;s not been uncommon to find some sites like cafes saying they charge &#8212; I kid you not &#8212; because the whole system including the charging gateway &#8212; is expensive to run.   A cheap free gateway would have been much more affordable.  Many operators decide that it&#8217;s worth it to offer it free, since it draws people in to restaurants, cafes and hotels.   Cheap hotels usually give free Wifi &#8212; only expensive hotels put on fat charges.</p>

<p>It could be that your real goal is just to get attention&#8230;</p>

<h2>Letting them know who provided the Wifi</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen a number of gateways that primarily seem to exist just to let you know who provided the gateway.  Very rarely (I&#8217;ve mostly seen this at airports) they will make you watch a short ad to get your free access.   They break a lot of stuff to do this.   The SSID name is another way to tell them, though of course it&#8217;s not nearly as satisfactory.</p>

<h2>Reducing the amount of usage</h2>

<p>There is a risk that fully open networks will get overused by guests, and often thanklessly, too.  You may be afraid your neighbours will realize they don&#8217;t need to buy internet at all, and can just use your open network.   Here, making it hard to use and broken is a feature, not a bug.   If you have to go through the hijack every so often it&#8217;s a minor burden to cafe patrons but a bigger annoyance to overusing neighbours.   Those neighbours can play tricks, like using programs that do automatic processing of hijack gateways, but not too many do.  They can also change their MAC addresses to get past restrictions based on that.   You can do MAC limiting without a hijack screen, and it&#8217;s a great way to do it, possibly saving the hijack for after they reach the limit, not using it at the start.   Clever abusers can change their MACs, though again most people don&#8217;t.</p>

<h2>Covering your ass</h2>

<p>The large number of complex terms of service suggest that people believe, or have been told, that it is essential they keep themselves covered in case a user of open Wifi does something bad, such as spamming or violating copyrights or even nastier stuff.   They figure that if they made them agree to a terms-of-service that forbade this, this absolves them of any responsibility for the bad actions, and even, just maybe, offers a way to go after the unwanted guest.</p>

<p>Turns out that there is much less need to cover your ass in this situation, at least in the USA.   You aren&#8217;t liable for coypright infringement by your guests if you did not encourage it.  Thanks to the DMCA and CDA rules, you are probably not liable for a lot of other stuff these unwanted guests might do.</p>

<p><strong>I am interested to hear reports from anybody of how they used the fact that Wifi guests had to agree to terms of service to protect themselves in an actual legal action</strong>.  I have not heard of any, and I suspect there are few.  It would be a great shame to confirm that everybody is breaking their networks in hope of a protection that&#8217;s actually meaningless.</p>

<p>It is true that you can get in real world trouble for what your unwanted guests do.  If they violate copyrights, you might be the one getting the nasty letter from the copyright holder.  The fact that you are not actually liable may not be much comfort when you are faced with taking the time and cost to point that out.   Often these lawsuits come with offers to settle for less than the cost of consulting a lawyer on the matter.    Naturally, those interested in violating copyrights are unlikely to be all that worried that they clicked on a contract that promised they wouldn&#8217;t.   This is just a risk of an open network.</p>

<p>Likewise, if they send spam over your network, you may find yourself on spam-blocking blacklists who don&#8217;t care that it wasn&#8217;t you who did the spamming.  Those vigilante groups run by their own rules.   Again, the contract isn&#8217;t much protection.   You may instead want to look to technical measures, including throttling the use of certain ports or bandwidth limits on guests.   (It is better if you can throttle rather than cut off, since your guests probably do need to send e-Mail, just not thousands of them.)</p>

<h1>Towards a protocol of open guest WIFI</h1>

<p>How could we do this better?  In <a href="having-secure-open-wifi-death-wifi-login-part-2">part two</a> I talk about how to have a secure open WIFI and the problems in doing that.  Part three will talk about how to make it easy to connect to any of these networks automatically.</p>

        <h2 class="title"><a href="/wind-or-solar-filter-pool">Wind or solar to filter the pool</a></h2>    <span class="submitted">Submitted by <a href="/user/brad" title="View user profile." rel="nofollow">brad</a> on Sat, 2013-12-07 12:05.</span>
    <span class="taxonomy"><ul class="links inline"><li class="first last taxonomy_term_44"><a href="/taxonomy/term/44" rel="tag" title="Environmental issues" class="taxonomy_term_44">Going Green</a></li>
</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>One of the biggest issues with wind and solar is that they are intermittent, and so either need storage or grid-tie to work.   There really is no good storage, and generally storage-based systems are highly wasteful, throwing away most of the power you generate because you want to keep the storage near full.   Grid-tie is the only green choice, but it&#8217;s expensive and requires expensive inverters and permits and more.</p>

<p>One solution to this to find work for your renewable energy source to do that fits well with its intermittent nature.  Something that will take all the power you generate, but not mind if it comes and goes.   Such loads are hard to find.  One potential example is pumping water to filter a swimming pool.  Its recommended to flow twice the volume of your pool every day in summer, which means around 10kwh of electricity with typical systems.   Most people filter their pool using the same pump they use for vacuuming and pool maintenance, which is actually way more powerful than you need for filtering.   They offer variable speed pumps, which use a low-power efficient speed for filtering and a high-power speed for vacuum and manual operations, and claim they save a lot.</p>

<p>For those who have a pool, the pump is using as much electricity as all their other appliances in some cases, and so it&#8217;s a win to make that greener.   Unlike those appliances, the pool water can be filtered any time, as electricity is available, though you can&#8217;t let the pool go unfiltered for days, so it&#8217;s not perfect.   For people who have time-of-use metering, they are wise if they only filter at night, and many do that.</p>

<p>The trick to perfect use of solar for pool pumping would be a smart, multi-speed pump able to run on both the DC from solar panels and the grid power.   It would need to do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>When there is power from the solar panel, run as fast as you can on that power, filtering.</li>
<li>When you need high flow, switch to (or combine with) grid power for full power.</li>
<li>Track the amount of water filtered, as well as temperature, and when the sun did not provide enough power, run the pump at night off grid power to make up the difference.</li>
<li>For extra credit, have a sensor that detects how clear the water is, and adjust grid usage based on that, rather than just weather.</li>
</ul>

<p>This system would make use of all the power from the panels.  As a plus, you need more filtering in summer than you do in winter, which matches what panels do.   However, you must not oversize your panels.  They can&#8217;t be bigger than you need to do all your winter filtering on a series of sunny winter&#8217;s days, or you will be wasting their power then.</p>

<p>Key to this plan is that it&#8217;s easy to install.  Put in the new pump and wire it up to panels.  No inverters or electricians and perhaps not even any permits.  It doesn&#8217;t feed power back to the grid or the house.    This is key because panels are now getting very cheap (less than a dollar per watt) and as such installs and permits and other gear are more expensive than the panels.   </p>

<p>There are some pool pumps with brushless DC motors sold for solar use.  They are expensive and don&#8217;t do the smart tricks above, in particular using the grid to take up the slack.  They depend instead on overprovisioned solar, or solar systems powering more than a
pump.</p>

<p>For $700 you can also buy a floating solar pool filter.  This is a nice trick because it&#8217;s self-contained, though it&#8217;s a rather large thing to float in your pool.   It can&#8217;t handle the whole filtering load &#8212;in fact it only handles about 25% of the load of a typical pool and uses cartridge filters.   As such, you still run the regular pump and filter on some schedule, you just run it a bit less.</p>

<p>I noted above that you can get variable speed pumps, and that these, it is claimed, us as little as 1/5th the energy of the full speed pumps for filtering.   They cost 2-3x as much as basic one speed pumps, and as a result are not very common.    This bodes poorly for the solar proposal here, because if customers aren&#8217;t willing to do the up-front investment to save energy for these pumps, few would do the added task of putting up a solar panel and plugging it into such a pump.  Comparatively few, that is &#8212; solar nerds would love to do it.</p>

<p>As always, the best place to deploy panels to do this would be the sunny, coal-oriented regions like Arizona and New Mexico, where it turns out pools are pretty popular.   Once again, the math says that if your goal is to use your money and time to make the world greener, it would be far better to get people in those places to install a system like this on their pools than for you to put panels on your house in California for anything.  Putting panels up in California is something you do to feel good.</p>

<h2>Wind</h2>

<p>Another interesting alternative is wind.   Pumping water with wind is perhaps the oldest wind technology out there.  In this case, you might even be able to be like an old windmill, and be mechanical, by having the turbine drive a flexible shaft down to the ground to run the pump.  Presumably some clever transmission would be needed to maintain filter pressure properly at all windspeeds.   You could also do traditional electrical generation from the wind and power a pump like the one above.</p>

<p>Wind has its positives and negatives.   Unlike solar, it does not have the natural higher capacity in the summer.  It can be much more intermittent.  Solar panels still do around 30% to 50% of their rated power on ordinary cloudy days (though this is quite variable based on the panels and local weather patterns) so there is pumping every day.   Wind in most places comes and goes.  At my house, the winds are high today but it would not generally be suitable as we go weeks without much wind.   Wind also prefers a tower near the pool, which has many issues.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>The past few weeks have been rife with governments deciding to throw support behind robocars.</p>

<p>I wrote earlier about the plan for pods in Milton Keynes, NW of London.   The UK has also <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25230483">endowed a a £10m prize fund</a> to build vehicles and for a town to adapt to them.   This will be managed in part by the Oxford team which has built a self-driving Wildcat and Nissan LEAF.</p>

<p>In Michigan, they have been working on a new robocar law that may be the next one, and the University of Michigan has a plan <a href="http://www.mlive.com/business/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2013/12/u-m_transportation_center_aims.html#!">to put a fleet of cars out by 2021</a>.  Ann Arbor is the site of the ITS V2V testbed, which will probably slow this effort down, but Michigan is keen on not having the auto industry taken away from it.</p>

<p>Volvo, while now a Chinese company, has had many efforts, including their Sartre convoy experiments.  Now they have declared that they will have <a href="https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/136182/volvo-car-group-initiates-world-unique-swedish-pilot-project-with-self-driving-cars-on-public-roads">100 cars on the road in Gothenberg</a> in 2017.  They will also build parking systems.</p>

<p>In spite of all this, Toyota recently declared it is only building vehicles for research purposes, and has <a href="http://www.motoring.com.au/news/2013/toyota/toyota-rejects-autonomous-vehicles-40259">no desire to market such cars</a>.  Toyota had been a leader among the Japanese companies (until Nissan took over that role by building a research lab in silicon valley) but it&#8217;s surprising to see them drop out.  Of course I predict they will regret that.</p>

<h2>Amazon drone delivery</h2>

<p>The big news this weekend was the announcement that Amazon.com wants to do drone delivery, accompanied with a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98BIu9dpwHU">concept video</a>.   This got everybody buzzing.  I was interviewed for stories by the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/12/02/amazon-drones-are-a-fun-gimmick-but-ground-vehicles-are-the-future-of-retail/">Washington Post</a> and <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2013/12/02/amazons-drones-will-change-more-than-delivery/?KEYWORDS=rachael+king">Wall Street Journal (paywall)</a> as well as the <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/disruptions-at-your-door-in-minutes-delivered-by-robot/?hpw&amp;rref=technology&amp;_r=0">New York Times</a> because of my prior writings on <a href="http://robocars.com/deliverbots.html]">deliverbots</a>.</p>

<p>Some of you may remember I post I did early last year on <a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/drone-tele-doctor-and-defibrillator-100-seconds">drone defibrillator delivery</a> and the efforts of our students at Singularity University to build <a href="http://singularityu.org/companies/matternet/">Matternet</a> for drone delivery in the developing world.</p>

<p>Drone delivery is interesting, though its big value will be in lightweight, urgent items like medicines.  Ground vehicles will still win for cost and efficiency for most items.  However, the drones can be much faster, and have options like delivering to places ground vehicles can&#8217;t reach &#8212; like your roof or your backyard.   Deliverbots must get safe and legal on busy streets, drones have to figure out how to not hit one another (or people on the ground) in crowded airspace.   The LIDARS that make ground vehicles practical have enough range for ground travel but poor range as flying sensors.  Radar is good in the air but can have interference problems.</p>

<p>Getting a drone to land at any given address is a <em>hard</em> problem.  There are trees, overhead wires, wind gusts and strange geometries.  I suspect drone delivery will work best if the drop location has already been scanned and mapped.   However, if there is a decent clearing, I could see it working by having the recipient put down a special marker (like a QR code) on the ground.   GPS is not accurate enough to fly with but camera could pull out special markers.</p>

<p>One great marker would be your cell phone.   Either with its &#8220;flash&#8221; LED pointed up and pulsing, or its screen, if the screen is bright enough.   Go outside, put your phone down, have it guide the drone partway in with radio and GPS, and then have the drone&#8217;s camera follow the flashing light.   If phones had better raw GPS access (they don&#8217;t &#8212; not yet) they could also provide differential GPS information to a drone to guide it in.</p>

<p>This works because with robot delivery, you never need to deliver to an address &#8212; you deliver to a person.  Wherever that person is, or at least never when the person isn&#8217;t there, unless you want to.    A robot delivery service will wait for a signal that you are home or one the way before delivering to your home, but might also deliver to you in whatever parking lot you are in, or your office.   The robot won&#8217;t release the cargo unless it gets the ACK from your phone as you &#8220;sign&#8221; for it.</p>

<p>Multi-copter drones today don&#8217;t have a lot of capacity and range, but it&#8217;s improving.  Liquid fuels for larger drones might help boost that.  Fixed wing drones have much more capacity, but they need runways (or a skilled launcher) to take off.  Some fixed-wing drones can land vertically if they have motors powerful enough to lower them down tail first though they tend to need something suitable to land on in such cases.</p>

<p>Robot delivery should make existing retailers, even big box ones like WalMart, scared of online retailers like Amazon.   While a drone won&#8217;t replace WalMart on a trip where you plan to fill your shopping cart, it might well be very suitable for the things you buy from <em>Walgreens</em>.  </p>

        <h2 class="title"><a href="/international-roaming-t-mobile-and-local-sims">International roaming, T-mobile and local SIMs</a></h2>    <span class="submitted">Submitted by <a href="/user/brad" title="View user profile." rel="nofollow">brad</a> on Fri, 2013-11-29 12:52.</span>
    <span class="taxonomy"><ul class="links inline"><li class="first last taxonomy_term_17"><a href="/archives/cat_telecom.html" rel="tag" title="" class="taxonomy_term_17">Telecom</a></li>
</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Back from 5 weeks of international travel, I continue to seek the best solution in my quest for reasonably priced data service when outside the USA.</p>

<p>Data has become a must for me when on the road.  In spite of the fact that we all lived without it a decade ago, I find it very frustrating if it&#8217;s not available (or priced at $15,000 per gigabyte, which is the typical default roaming rate.)  It&#8217;s how I find directions, food, tourist info and keep in touch with others.</p>

<p>For a while my normal practice, if in a country for more than a few days, has been to purchase a local SIM card, and of course to have an unlocked GSM phone.  Usually local SIMs are now available with 500mb to 1gb of data for $10 to $20.  There are various web sites that list the local data providers to help you choose.  The best prices tend to come from the MVNOs &#8212; not the main incumbent carriers &#8212; but even the big carriers tend to have decent prepaid deals.   These usually come with some voice minutes and texting.  This is useful though I don&#8217;t do a lot of voice minutes when overseas due to time zones.  I use them to reach local friends, book hotels, check restaurants, and with my companion.
<img class=blogpic src=/files/flduomo.jpg>
Annoyingly, though I have bought many of these SIMs, even for data, it&#8217;s not nearly as nice and easy as it should be.   A large fraction of the time, something goes wrong.    <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/international-roaming-t-mobile-and-local-sims">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

<h2>The hassles of local SIMs</h2>

<ul>
<li>It can often be a pain to research and pick the right carrier, and then to find one of their stores, and get the purchase done.  This was particularly true in the past, when selling a SIM to a random foreigner was not a common event at many stores.  You have to go out of your way, and deal with people who don&#8217;t speak your language.   Some providers put a store in the arrival area of the airport, which is great, though they tend to be the more expensive cards.</li>
<li>Until you get the new SIM, you are faced with very expensive roaming.</li>
<li>Research does matter.  In England (where language is not a problem) some carriers give you your data bundle free when you put 10 pounds on the card, others charge you those 10 pounds, leaving you with no voice minutes.</li>
<li>Once you get the card, you often have to deal with web sites, menus and voice prompts not in your language.   Setting up the voicemail is already a pain, and is far worse if you can&#8217;t understand the prompts.</li>
<li>Fixing odd problems is difficult in an unfamiliar system.  My Orange card had a package of 500mb in it for 10 Euros, (great) but kept draining the money I put on it, leaving it unusable for making calls and texts, and though I can read and speak modest French, I was unable to find the cause.</li>
<li>There are always issues of prepaid cards for short use.   If you put too much in the card, it&#8217;s wasted unless you are coming back soon.  If you don&#8217;t put enough in, you have to run around buying and adding refills &#8212; again with prompts not in your language.   Carriers would do well to let you add a lot to the card, and then refund it to you on request.  This would make me put more in the card, and use the phone more, so it&#8217;s a win for them.</li>
<li>As noted, balances usually expire quickly, and cards often expire after 6 months or a year if not used.  Though some cards are lasting longer.</li>
<li>In some countries, they won&#8217;t let you refill from a credit card, which means you must buy cards at local shops with cash, and always have a card handy &#8212; then throw away the spare cards when you leave, wasted.</li>
<li>You need to learn and give a new phone number to people.  You may be able to forward your old number, but often that comes at a high cost.    As a plus, you make it much cheaper for locals to call and text you, while making it more expensive for people back home to reach you (unless you forward and eat many times that cost.)   You do get the &#8220;advantage&#8221; that incoming calls and texts are free.</li>
<li>Text messages generally do not forward, so you will not see those unless you keep 2 phones &#8212; and pay roaming.</li>
<li>Calls back home may or may not be quite expensive, but usually are much less than roaming rates on your home SIM.</li>
<li>If you move to a different country, you usually have to do it all over again &#8212; shop again, and have a new number.   In Europe, where it is common to hop from country to country this becomes a real issue.  Some prepaid plans allow tolerable voice roaming in other countries, though data roaming tends to still be expensive on prepaid, in spite of a European order to reduce it.</li>
<li>You are going to pay $10 to $20 plus your time for all this, and if all you want is to do a few voice minutes and some texts and keep your data usage to wifi, you might not come out ahead on a short trip.</li>
</ul>

<li>More interest from government officials.  <a href="http://transportation.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=357149">Hearings in DC today</a>, more progress towards passing a law in Michigan to enable Robocar testing, and a ride by the Japanese PM in several vehicles at the Toyko Motor Show.  I also met with top Hungarian officials in Budapest, where a large fraction of their GDP comes from car manufacture.  They need to bring the R&amp;D to Hungary to exploit this technology, though.   French President Hollande has also called for an initiative there.   The jurisdictional competition I wondered about many years ago is getting ready to start humming.</li>

<p>While I&#8217;ve been away, a few news items.</p>

<h2>UK Grants and plan for Milton Keynes</h2>

<p>In the UK, they want to push for advanced transportation.  This includes a <a href="http://news.bis.gov.uk/Press-Releases/-75m-to-build-cars-of-the-future-695a6.aspx#!">75 million pound grant program</a>, and some money for a robocar taxi system in the town of Milton Keynes, NW of London.  Milton Keynes is one of those those &#8220;cities of the future of the past&#8221; &#8212; a planned community with an unusual geometry, and the planned pods may fit right in.   At first, they are planning a PRT-like service with private ROW for the pods, and the people involved include companies from the PRT field like ARUP.   (It was reported in some news reports that ULTra, which makes the PRT for the Heathrow Airport &#8212; I rode it last month &#8212; would be involved but they do not appear to be.)   The big news is that the plan is for the pods in MK to eventually leave their private ROW and become self-driving taxis operating in the town.</p>

<p>(With any luck I may be on public radio tomorrow talking about this.)</p>

<p>Eventually a billion pound investment is planned in advanced transportation tech.</p>

<p>A town taxi is a worthwhile project, especially because the town can clear the roadblocks.  I am less optimistic about what &#8220;big infrastructure&#8221; project companies like ARUP will do, because they have a different mindset.  The great thing though is that even if these cars begin caged, the precedent will let them become truly useful by going door to door.   MK was a town designed to be polycentric, with services in every block.  Such towns are harder to serve with transit as trips go from anywhere to anywhere.  Transit usually goes hand in hand with centralized towns where the vast majority of trips are to and from the city centre.</p>

<h2>More studies</h2>

<p>The Eno Transportation center released <a href="https://www.enotrans.org/store/research-papers/preparing-a-nation-for-autonomous-vehicles-opportunities-barriers-and-policy-recommendations">a report on the economics of robocars</a>.  This report outlines the cost savings with different levels of deployment, and predicts huge financial benefits even with modest deployment &#8212; something readers of this blog will not be surprised to hear reported.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.carinsurance.com/press/driverless-cars-survey-results.aspx">Other studies released</a> include a survey that suggest that 90% of people would use a robocar if it reduced their insurance rates.   What&#8217;s interesting about this study is the huge number of positives.   Prior studies have all seen much smaller numbers of people willing to use a robocar 20-35%.  Those studies have been couched in the idea that it&#8217;s a new, expensive thing, not a money saver.</p>

<p>At first, robocars will be more expensive, as all new technologies are.  But they will save people money in the long run, and the insurance savings will actually be only a small part of that equation.  My own forecasts suggest that the price of driving can be cut by at least a third, perhaps by half, through the use of smaller, more efficient vehicles.   While the costs of fuel and accidents (insurance) are high, the cost of depreciation is still the biggest cost in operating a car.</p>

<h2>Measuring safety</h2>

<p>In another nice tidbit, Chris Urmson, the head of the Google car project, gave a talk at RoboBusiness where he outlined some <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/520746/data-shows-googles-robot-cars-are-smoother-safer-drivers-than-you-or-i/">safety metrics being tracked</a>.   One of the big problems with robocars is that since humans have accidents only ever 250,000 miles and fatal accidents every 80 million miles, you can&#8217;t just drive every new software revision hundreds of millions of miles to compare it to humans.   So Google is tracking how often the car does &#8220;risky&#8221; behaviours that are often found before accidents, like weaving out of lanes or other unsafe moves.  And the results, he reports, are very good at present.</p>

<h2>Cliff Nass</h2>

<p>There has been lots of news coverage in the last month in various media &#8212; it is becoming so regular I don&#8217;t report it here.  But one sad item sent to me involved the <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/november/cliff-nass-obit-110413.html">sudden death of Clifford Nass</a> of Stanford&#8217;s REVS center.    Cliff was an HCI expert who was moving his expertise towards cars and other related technologies and was a fixture at local events, always willing to be contrarian with facts to back it up &#8212; my kind of guy.  It&#8217;s a tragedy.</p>

<p>Another survey had serious numbers of people saying that once they got a robocar &#8220;they would never drive again.&#8221;   All these surveys do have an issue as they just propose a hypothetical and let the respondent figure out what it means.  The real answers will come when more people get a real chance to try one out.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>More and more often in mainstream articles about robocars, I am seeing an expression of variations of the classic 1960s &#8220;Trolley Problem.&#8221;   The latest is <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/the-ethics-of-autonomous-cars/280360/">this article on the Atlantic website</a>.   In the classical Trolley problem, you see a train hurtling down the track about to run over 5 people, and you can switch the train to another track where it will kill one person.  There are a number of variations, meant to examine our views on the morality and ethics of letting people die vs. actively participating in their deaths, even deliberately killing them to save others.</p>

<p>Often this is mapped into the robocar world by considering a car which is forced to run over somebody, and has to choose who to run over.  Choices suggested include deciding between:</p>

<ul>
<li>One person and two</li>
<li>A child and an adult</li>
<li>A person and a dog</li>
<li>A person without right-of-way vs others who have it</li>
<li>A deer vs. adding risk by swerving around it into the oncoming lane</li>
<li>The occupant or owner of the car vs. a bystander on the street</li>
<li>The destruction of an empty car vs. injury to a person who should not be on the road, but is.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to pretend that this isn&#8217;t an morbidly fascinating moral area, and it will indeed affect the law, liability and public perception.   And at some point, programmers will evaluate these scenarios in their efforts.    What I reject is the suggestion that this is anywhere high on the list of important issues and questions.  I think it&#8217;s high on the list of questions that are interesting for philosophical class debate, but that&#8217;s not the same as reality.</p>

<p>In reality, such choices are extremely rare.  How often have you had to make such a decision, or heard of somebody making one?   Ideal handling of such situations is difficult to decide, but there are many other issues to decide as well.</p>

<p>Secondly, in the rare situations where a human encounters such a moral dilemma, that person does not sit there and have an inner philosophical dialogue on which is the most moral choice.   Rather, they will go with a quick gut reaction, which is based on their character and their past thinking on such situations.  Or it may not be that well based on them &#8212; it must be done quickly.    A robot may be incapable of having a deep internal philosophical debate, and as such the robots will also make decisions based on their &#8220;gut,&#8221; which is to say the way they were programmed, well in advance of the event.</p>

<p>Focus on the trolley problem creates, to some irony, a meta-trolley problem.   If people (especially lawyers advising companies or lawmakers) start expressing the view that &#8220;we can&#8217;t deploy this technology until we have a satisfactory answer to this quandry&#8221; then they face the reality that if the technology is indeed life-saving, then people will die through their advised inaction who could have been saved, in order to be sure to save the <em>right</em> people in the complex situations.   Of course, the problem itself speaks mostly about the difference between failure to save and overt action to harm.</p>

<p>I suspect companies will take very conservative decisions here, as advised by their lawyers, and they will mostly base things on the rules of the road.   If there is a scenario where the car would hit somebody who actually has the right-of-way, the teams will look for a solution to that.  They won&#8217;t go around a blind corner so fast they could hit a slow car or cyclist.   (Humans go around blind corners too fast all the time, and usually get away with it.)   They won&#8217;t swerve into oncoming lanes, even ones that appear to be empty, because society will heavily punish a car deliberately leaving its right-of-way if it ends up hurting somebody.  If society wants a different result here, it will need to clarify the rules.    The hard fact of the liability system is that a car facing 5 jaywalking pedestrians that swerves into the oncoming lane and hits a solo driver who was properly in her lane will face a huge liability for having left their lane, while if it hits the surprise jaywalkers, the liability is likely to be much less, or even zero, due to their personal responsibility.    The programmers normally won&#8217;t be making that decision, the law already makes it.  When they find cases where the law and precedent don&#8217;t offer any guidance, they will probably take the conservative decision, and also push for it to give that guidance.  The situations will be so rare, however, that a reasonable judgement will be to not wait on getting an answer.</p>

<p>Real human driving does include a lot of breaking the law.   There is <a href="http://robocars.com/speed-limit.html">speeding</a> of course.  There&#8217;s aggressively getting your share in merges, 4-way stops and 3-point turns.  And a whole lot more.  Over time, the law should evolve to deal with these questions, and make it possible for the cars to compete on an equivalent level with the humans.</p>

<p>Swerving is particularly troublesome as an answer, because the cars are not designed to drive on the sidewalk, shoulder or in the oncoming lane.  Oh, they will have <em>some</em> effort put into that, but these &#8220;you should not be doing this&#8221; situations will not get anywhere near the care and testing that ordinary driving in your proper right-of-way will get.  As such, while the vehicles will have very good confidence it detecting obstacles in the places they should go, they will not be nearly as sure about their perceptions of obstacles where they can&#8217;t legally go.  A car won&#8217;t be as good at identifying pedestrians on the sidewalk because it should never, or almost never drive on the sidewalk.  It will instead be very good at identifying pedestrians in crosswalks or on the road.   Faced with the option to avoid something by swerving onto the sidewalk, programmers will have to consider that the car can&#8217;t be quite as confident it is safe to do this illegal move, even if the sidewalk is in fact perfectly clear to the human eye.  (Humans are general purpose perception systems and can identify things on the sidewalk as readily as they can spot them on the road.)</p>

<p>We also have to understand that humans have so many accidents, that as a society we&#8217;ve come to just accept them as a fact of driving, and built a giant insurance system to arrange financial compensation for the huge volume of torts created.   If we tried to resolve every car accident in the courts instead of by insurance, we would vastly increase the cost of accidents.   In some places, governments have moved to no-fault claim laws because they realize that battling over something that happens so often is counterproductive, especially when from the standpoint of the insurers, it changes nothing to tweak which insurance company will pay on a case by case basis.  In New Zealand, they went so far as to just eliminate liability in accidents, since in all cases the government health or auto insurance always paid every bill, funded by taxes.   (This does not stop people having to fight the Accident Compensation Crown Corporation to get their claims approved, however.)</p>

<p>While the insurance industry total size will dwindle if robocars reduce accident rates, there are still lots of insurance programs out there that handle much smaller risks just fine, so I don&#8217;t believe insurance is going away as a solution to this problem, even if it gets smaller.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>One day I noticed my nice 7 month old Nexus 4 had a think crack on the screen.  Not sure where it came from, but my old Nexus One had had a similar crack and when it was on you barely saw it and the phone worked fine, so I wasn&#8217;t scared &#8212; until I saw that the crack stopped the digitizer from recognizing my finger in a band in the middle of the screen.   A band which included dots from my &#8220;unlock&#8221; code.</p>

<p><img class=leftpic src=https://lh6.ggpht.com/TWF21RygkFpkU-vKhdAxub1mF6L9xxoqc7aD1F6tD8ElCQFES4Ljn3yuUqcM1iZxC5A>
And so, while the phone worked fine, you could not unlock it.   That was bad news because with 4.3, the Android team had done a lot of work to make sure unlocked phones are secure if people randomly pick them up.   As I&#8217;ll explain in more detail, you really can&#8217;t unlock it.   And while it&#8217;s locked, it won&#8217;t respond to USB commands either.  I had enabled debugging some time ago, but either that doesn&#8217;t work unlocked or that state had been reset in a system update.</p>

<p>No unlocking meant no backing up the things that Google doesn&#8217;t back up for you.  It backs up a lot, these days, but there&#8217;s still dozens of settings, lots of app data, logs of calls and texts, your app screen layout and much more that&#8217;s lost.</p>

<p>I could repair the phone &#8212; but when LG designed this phone they merged the digitizer and screen, so the repair is $180, and the parts take weeks to come in at most shops.   Problem is, you can now buy a new Nexus 4 for just $199 (which is a truly great price for an unlocked phone) or the larger model I have for $249.   Since the phone still has some uses, it makes much more sense to get a new one than to repair, other than to get that lost data.   But more to the point, it&#8217;s been 7 months and there are newer, hotter phones out there!   So I eventually got a new phone.</p>

<p>But first I did restore functionality on the N4 by doing a factory wipe.  That&#8217;s possible without the screen, and the wiped phone has no lock code.  It&#8217;s actually possible to use quite a bit of the phone.  Typing is a pain since a few letters on the right don&#8217;t register but you can get them by rotating.   You would not want to use this long term, but many apps are quite usable, such as maps and in particular eBook reading &#8212; for cheap I have a nice small eBook reader.   And you can make and receive calls.  (Even on the locked phone I could receive a call somebody made to me &#8212; it was the only thing it could do.)   In addition, by connecting a bluetooth mouse and keyboard, I could use the phone fully &#8212; this was essential for setting the phone up again, where the lack of that region on the touchpad would have made it impossible.</p>

<p>One of my security maxims is &#8220;<strong>Every security system ends up blocking legitimate users, often more than it blocks out the bad guys.</strong>&#8221;   I got bitten by that. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/locking-devices-down-too-hard-and-other-tales-broken-phones">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

    <span class="taxonomy"><ul class="links inline"><li class="first last taxonomy_term_95"><a href="/topic/robocars" rel="tag" title="The future of computer-driven cars and deliverbots" class="taxonomy_term_95">Robocars</a></li>
</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I&#8217;ve written about the issues relating to robocars and walking before.  On one hand, some people may find themselves hardly ever walking with convenient door-to-door robocar transportation.   Others may find the robocars may enable walking by allowing one-way waking trips, or enabling trips that that allow drive-walk-drive (eliminating short driving trips done just to save the trouble of walking back to get the car.)</p>

<p>Some similar factors apply to cycling.   In a lot of the world, people bike because it&#8217;s much cheaper and they can&#8217;t afford a car.  In the richer countries, most people can afford cars, but people bike because they enjoy it, or seek the exercise.   They may also wish to avoid traffic, take routes only bikes can take, or avoid burning gasoline.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s consider something possible with robocars: on-demand bicycle delivery.    This could either be small delivery robots which can hold bicycles, or the &#8220;bikebot&#8221; &#8212; a small robot that clamps onto a bicycle and uses the bike&#8217;s wheels in concert with the robot&#8217;s.   The bikebot could be a very efficient way to delivery a bicycle &#8212; certainly using less energy per mile than a human being does, or that producing the human&#8217;s food does.  (A future bike could be designed so that a bikebot module can be clamped to it easily.)</p>

<p><img src=http://www.templetons.com/brad/robocars/aerorider.jpg class=leftpic>
Bicycles on demand offer the chance to cycle just when you want to.  This could increase by quite a bit the times when you actually would cycle.  </p>

<p>This gets combined with the robocar&#8217;s one-way taxi ability for humans.  The robocar can bring the humans, and/or the bicycles to the places they want to bike.   (More efficiently, too, since bikes on bike racks are not very aerodynamic.)</p>

<p>Just like it does for walking, the multi-mode, multi-leg trip becomes enabled.   For example, I often find I drive to Google, and then to Nasa which is 2.5 miles away, and then back home.   The 2.5 mile leg is ideal for cycling &#8212; there&#8217;s even a bike trail for much of it &#8212; but I can&#8217;t do this.   First I would have to always bring my bike. (While Google does provide bikes, they are tiny single-gear bikes not meant to leave campus.)  I could do the round-trip to come back and get my car, but that&#8217;s less convenient and can hit some nasty traffic patterns &#8212; traffic in and out of Google at rush hour is very bad.    This is a personal example, but I am sure you can all think of examples from your own life where you take an intermediary trip today (in your car) of a few miles that might be very nice for biking.</p>

<p>Weather is another impediment to biking.   When I used to bike commute, I would drive instead if the forecast called for rain in the afternoon, even if it was nice in the morning.  With robocars I could bike in, and ride back.</p>

<p>Bike delivery means choice of bike.  Recumbents are hard to carry in cars, but no challenge for a custom bike delivery robot.  They are more comfortable to ride and faster on flats and downhill.  You could even climb a hill in a diamond bike and descend in a recumbent.   Or, let&#8217;s face it, you could also have the cheater&#8217;s option of climbing the hard hills in a car, or with power assist, and riding alone when going down or traversing flatter terrain.  That might be a cheater&#8217;s option, but it would get more people cycling.  Your gear could shadow you in a small cargo robot.</p>

<p>The robocar also offers easy transportation for you, and your bikes, to the places where it&#8217;s fun to bike.  Get driven to the coast, then bike it, then get driven back from your endpoint.   Or bike the &#8220;interesting parts&#8221; and drive the boring (or difficult) ones.</p>

<p>The main issue?  At least at first, a human will need to be there to put a bike into a bike-delivery robot or clamp a bikebot on the bike.  That means you must declare your destination in advance, with enough time to get that robot to that spot so you can hand over the bike.   Perhaps in the future, there will be robots that can pick up a waiting bike without a human to help.   Quick one-way trips will probably not be with your personal bike, but rather a rental.  While there are those who insist on their personally chosen bike for long rides, most people can tolerate a quality rental bike for a quick urban leg.    Trikes, which are super easy to ride, can also be offered, and even bikes and trikes with motor assist when you want the non-exercise advantages of a bicycle could be provided.</p>

<p>Cycling could also be great for commute times.  Many commuters might be happy to get a ride (perhaps even in groups) to the outskirts of the CBD, but as they enter the congested zone, have their car drop them off next to a bike for a quick ride to work.  Long enough to get some exercise but not long enough to need a shower.   This does present a problem when it rains and everybody wants to ride all the way in, though.</p>

<p>In the less developed world, where the bicycle is the transportation of choice due to cost, the robocar will take away some riders as it offers lower-cost transportation, protected from the weather, without up-front investment.  However, eventually the above factors from the developed world will bring people back to the bicycle even though they can afford the car.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I recently read a complaint by an EV driver that the charging station at De Anza College cost 55 cents/kwh.   The national average price for electricity is around 10 cents, and at that price a typical electric car costs under 3 cents/mile for electricity.   Gasoline costs about 8 cents/mile in a Prius, about 13 cents in a decent non-hybrid and 18 cents/mile in the average car which gets 22mpg.    (At least here in California.)   But the college&#8217;s charger&#8217;s electricity is almost 15 cents/mile in most electric sedans today, which is more than the gasoline in any gasoline car an eco-conscious person is likely to buy.   (California Tier III electricity is 30 cents/kwh and thus almost as much.)</p>

<p>The price of charging stations varies wildly.   A lot of them are free still, financed by other motivations.   Tesla&#8217;s superchargers are free &#8212; effectively part of the cost of the car.   It&#8217;s not uncommon for parking lots to offer free charging if you pay for parking, since parking tends to cost a fair bit more.  After all, you won&#8217;t put more than 20kwh in a Leaf (and probably a lot less) and that costs just $2 at the average grid price.</p>

<p><img class=blogpic src=/files/bplace.jpg>
This got me thinking of how the economics of charging will work in the future when electric cars and charging stations are modestly plentiful.   While the national grid average is 10 cents, in many places heavy users can pay a lot more, though there are currently special deals to promote electric cars.  Often the daytime cost for commercial customers is quite a bit higher, while the night is much lower.   Charging stations at offices and shops will do mostly day charging; ones in homes and hotels will do night charging.</p>

<p>Unlike gasoline pumping, which takes 5 minutes, charging also involves parking.   This is not just because charging takes several hours, but because that is enough time that customers won&#8217;t want to come and move their car once full, and so they will take the space for their full parking duration, which may be 8 or more hours.  </p>

<p>Charging stations are all very different in utility.   While every gasoline station near your route is pretty much equivalent to you, your charging station is your parking spot, and as such only the ones very close to your destination are suitable.   While a cheap gas station 2 miles off your route would have a line around the block, a <em>free</em> charging stations 2 miles away from your destination is not that attractive!   More to the point, the charging point close to your destination is able to command a serious premium.  That have a sort of monopoly (until charging stations become super common) on charging at the only location of value to you.   </p>

<p>Put another way, <strong>when buying gasoline, I can choose from all the stations in town.  When picking an EV charge, I can only choose from stations with an available spot a short walk from my destination</strong>.  Such a monopoly will lead to high prices in a market where the stations are charging (in dollars :-) what the market will bear.</p>

<p>The market will bear a lot.  While the electricity may be available cheap, EV owners might be easily talked into paying as much for electricity as gasoline buyers do, on a per-mile basis.    The EV owners will be forgetting the economics of the electric car &#8212; you pay the vast bulk of your costs up front for the battery, and the electrical costs are intended to be minor.   If the electricity cost rivals that of gasoline, the battery cost is now completely extra.</p>

<p>Naturally, EV owners will do at least half their charging at home, where they negotiate the best rate.  But this could be worse, as they might well be talked into looking at the average.   They could pay 80 cents/kwh in the parking lot and 10 cents/kwh at home, and figure they are getting away with 45 cents and &#8220;still beating gasoline.&#8221;  They would be fooling themselves, but the more people willing to fool themselves, the higher prices will go.</p>

<p>There is another lack of choice here.   For many EV drivers, charging is not optional.  Unless they have easy range to get back home or to another charging place they will spend lots of time, you <em>must</em> charge if you are low and the time opportunity presents itself.  To not do so is either impossible (you won&#8217;t get home) or very foolish (you constrain what your EV can do.)    When you face a situation where you must charge, and you must charge in a particular place, the potential for price gouging becomes serious. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/will-ev-recharging-soar-very-high-costs">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>It began with reports on a job ad at Tesla for an ADAS engineer to work on self-driving systems, and now there is a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/18/us-tesla-selfdriving-idUSBRE98H01720130918">declaration from Elon Musk of a desire for a semi-automated car in three years</a>.   Musk says he expect the car to be &#8220;90% automated&#8221; which I will interpret as meaning it does highway driving.    It is not said if this is the same sort of highway driving found in products like Cadillac&#8217;s &#8220;super cruise&#8221; or similar offerings from BMW, Mercedes, Volvo and others &#8212; which requires the driver be alert and watching, or a much harder full cruise ability that allows the driver to do other things, like read.    I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s not a car that can run unmanned &#8212; Musk correctly feels that is a whole lot extra.</p>

<p>My reaction to this is mixed, in that there are things that make sense and don&#8217;t make sense.</p>

<p>On the plus side:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tesla is a great car company, and as a brand new one, perhaps the one most capable of not thinking like a car company.  This is a big advantage.   There is already a great culture of car innovation there.</li>
<li>Tesla has a focus on great and novel car experiences, regardless of price, and this fits in well with that.  Their customers will not be bothered by the initial high cost of the hardware.</li>
<li>Their cars are already pretty much drive-by-wire and easy to adapt.</li>
<li>If Tesla does decide to work with Google (the articles say they will not) there is already a strong friendship between the two CEOs</li>
<li>Even in the best car, there are certainly lots of roads where you would rather not do the driving.</li>
<li>With inductive charging (or some fancy plugging-in robot) it&#8217;s possible the car could do some self-parking and more importantly, self-recharging.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the negative:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tesla&#8217;s cars are hugely fun to drive.  While I believe for every car there value in having it drive itself on many roads, I would have to say the Teslas are the cars for which this is the least true!   So it&#8217;s not that one would not appreciate self-driving in one&#8217;s Tesla, but it&#8217;s just that you would appreciate it even more in almost all other cars.</li>
<li>Electric cars are not currently suitable as taxis that drive all-day, though Tesla has talked about battery swap, which would solve that issue.  I doubt they mean to sell them for that market, as they would not be self-delivering in any event.</li>
<li>Teslas are unjustifiably expensive.  Well, unjustifiable to other than early adopters or those who just want the best at almost any price.  That may change as batteries drop in price, though.</li>
<li>If this is just super-cruise where you must pay attention, it&#8217;s nice, but not a revolution.  Not yet, anyway.</li>

    <div class="content"><p>Over the years, particularly after Burning Man, I&#8217;ve written posts about how RVs can be improved.  This year I did not use an regular RV but rather a pop-up camping trailer.   However, I thought it was a good time to summarize a variety of the features I think should be in every RV of the future.</p>

<h2>Smart Power</h2>

<p>We keep talking about smart power and smart grids but power is expensive and complex when camping, and RVs are a great place for new technologies to develop.</p>

<p>To begin with, an RV power system should integrate the deep cycle house batteries, a special generator/inverter system, smart appliances and even the main truck engine where possible.</p>

<p>Today the best small generators are inverter based.  Rather than generating AC directly from an 1800rpm motor and alternator, they have a variable speed engine and produce the AC via an inverter.   These are smaller, more efficient, lighter and quieter than older generators, and produce cleaner power.  Today they are more expensive, but not more expensive than most RV generators.    RV generators are usually sized at 3,600 to 4,000 watts in ordinary RVs &#8212; that size dictated by the spike of starting up the air conditioner compressor when something else, like the microwave is running.</p>

<p>An inverter based generator combined with the RV&#8217;s battery bank doesn&#8217;t have to be that large.  It can draw power for the surge of starting a motor from the battery.   The ability to sustain 2,000 watts is probably enough, with a few other tricks.   Indeed, it can provide a lot of power even with the generator off, though the generator should auto-start if the AC is to be used, or the microwave will be used for a long time.</p>

<p>By adding a data network, one can be much more efficient with power.   For example, the microwave could just turn off briefly when the thermostat wants to start the AC&#8217;s compressor, or even the fans.   The microwave could also know if it&#8217;s been told to cook for 30 seconds (no need to run generator) or 10 minutes (might want to start it.)   It could also start the generator in advance of cooling need.</p>

<p>If the master computer has access to weather data, it could even decide what future power needs for heating fans and air conditioning will be, and run the generator appropriately.  With a GPS database, it could even know the quiet times of the campsite it&#8217;s in and respect them.</p>

<p>A modern RV should have all-LED lighting.   Power use is so low on those that the lights become a blip in power planning.  Only the microwave, AC and furnace fan would make a difference.   Likewise today&#8217;s TVs, laptops and media players which all draw very few watts.</p>

<p>A smart power system could even help plugging into shore power, particularly a standard 15a circuit.  Such circuits are not enough to start many ACs, or to run the AC with anything else.  With surge backup from the battery, an RV could plug into an ordinary plug and act almost like it had a high power connection.</p>

<p>To go further, for group camping, RVs should have the ability to <a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/rv-daisy-chain-power-grid">form an ad-hoc power grid</a>.  This same ability is already desired in the off-grid world, so it need not be developed just for RVs.  RVs able to take all sorts of input power could also eventually get smart power from RV campsites.   After negotiation, a campsite might offer 500v DC at 12 amps instead of 115v AC, allowing the largest dual-AC RVs to plug into small wires. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/rv-future">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

    <span class="taxonomy"><ul class="links inline"><li class="first last taxonomy_term_95"><a href="/topic/robocars" rel="tag" title="The future of computer-driven cars and deliverbots" class="taxonomy_term_95">Robocars</a></li>
</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Videos have been released on some real-world tests of robocars.    The most notable is from Mercedes.</p>

<iframe width="640" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/TDCtIh55oYI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>As a nice reflection on the past, Mercedes drove the 100km route done by Bertha Benz in the first automotive road trip 125 years ago.  You will also find that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKqJccK_EkM">this alternate video</a> is much better at talking about the technical details of the vehicle.</p>

<p>The Vislab team from Parma also released <a href="http://vislab.it/proud-en/">video of their drive around town</a>.  As the name suggests, Vislab&#8217;s research has a focus on computer vision, though this test vehicle also has 3 small LIDARs.</p>

<p>The Mercedes video has a lot of statements from MB engineer Ralf Herrtwich about their goals in doing this using existing sensors (cameras and radar primarily) and not (though he does not name it) LIDAR which he says is years or decades away.   While I don&#8217;t want to criticise the accomplishments of his team, nor in any way deny that everybody would love to be able to make a safe driving system using the most cost-effective sensors, his philosophy seems backwards to me.</p>

<p>First, those of us used to Moore&#8217;s law think that planning to use hardware that is expensive today but which will come down greatly in price by the time things are commercialized is the obviously right strategy.   It seems backwards to limit yourself to the technologies of today in planning a product for the future just because they are cheaper today.  To use the metaphor of a great Canadian athlete, you skate to where the puck is <em>going</em> to be.</p>

<p>This is magnified by the fact that the problems of robocars are safety problems, not problems of cost or ones of appearance.    With safety as the dominant goal, it seems very odd to me to imagine that one would, in the first vehicles to be made,  avoid using a sensor that could improve safety and performance markedly just because of cost or appearance.   If the cost difference were forecast to be ridiculous, one could consider it, but it makes no sense if the cost is within the noise to early adopters.  That&#8217;s why Tesla is able to succeed with such an expensive car &#8212; the early adopters are more interested in a cool, high-performance electric car than they are in the cost.   The other argument that is made &#8212; that the established sensors are more tested and robust &#8212; has some merit but is surely a short term optimization.</p>

<p>It could be argued that attempting to build a vehicle without LIDAR is skating to where the puck is going to be in the next game.  After all, there is optimism that vision and radar will be enough for safe driving some day.   As we all know, humans can drive with simple vision &#8212; even with one eye closed &#8212; and no radar or other sensors aside from hearing.   So some day, cameras and a lot of processing probably can safely drive a car, and do it with low cost hardware.   But the first production robocar?  Deliberately not having lasers when it&#8217;s such a challenge to meet the safety goals? It seems very unlikely.</p>

<p>The notes on appearance are also odd to me. (It is commonly noted that research sensors like the Velodyne are big and make the car look unusual and not like a car.)  We even see the <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/artificial-intelligence/cmu-autonomous-car-doesnt-looks-like-a-robot?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+IeeeSpectrum+(IEEE+Spectrum">IEEE Spectrum keen on how the new CMU car does not look like a robot</a>) unlike BOSS from the urban challenge.    While the research vehicles like BOSS were over-the-top on top, I think the reaction of early adopters is going to be quite the opposite.  They will want their shiny new robocar to look distinctive and clearly different from regular cars.   Prius owners reacted the same way, and there was not even much need for the Prius to have such a distinctive shape, though being more like a raindrop never hurts.</p>

<p>I suspect this approach is in part inspired by a marketing goal.  The auto companies, not wanting to appear to be trailing Google on robocar research, are making extra effort to appear to be on a different course, and in fact ahead of Google and the rest on that path.   &#8220;We&#8217;re doing what the competition is doing, but we&#8217;re not as far along&#8221; is not a very good press release.   That&#8217;s OK if it were just for appearances &#8212; and I&#8217;m in favour of there being many competing approaches because any paradigm, including mine, can turn out to be wrong &#8212; but I hope that these teams really expect their approach is the best and fastest path to a safe and capable vehicle.</p>

<p>Here, by the way, are more details of the <a href="hhttp://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2013/september/sept4_selfdrivingcar.html">33 mile trip by the GM/CMU collaboration</a>.  This vehicle has an &#8220;automotive grade&#8221; LIDAR &#8212; meaning one of the smaller ones that is one to four planes, not the giant 64 plane Velodyne used by CMU&#8217;s BOSS, Google and many others.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Recent news has been big.   First, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/27/us-autos-nissan-autonomous-idUSBRE97Q0VI20130827">Nissan announced it would sell robocars by 2020</a> and now today <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/08/us-autoshow-frankfurt-daimler-selfdrive-idUSBRE98709A20130908">Daimler has announced the same</a>.   (Note that the 2014 S-class is the first car with a self-driving feature, a &#8220;you must still pay attention&#8221; traffic jam autopilot.)</p>

<p>In addition, sources have claimed that Google is either <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/08/us-autoshow-frankfurt-daimler-selfdrive-idUSBRE98709A20130908">about to announce a collaboration with Conti on Sept 12</a> or is <a href="http://jessicalessin.com/2013/08/23/exclusive-google-designing-its-own-self-driving-car-considers-robo-taxi-2/">making plans to produce its own car</a> and taxi service.  (I was quoted, though not about Google, in <a href="http://jessicalessin.com/2013/08/23/the-promise-and-perils-of-self-driving-cars/">one of the artciles</a> in the series.</p>

<p>While I don&#8217;t comment on Google&#8217;s plans, I do believe it has one big advantage in this race.   It doesn&#8217;t know what the rules of the car industry are, and has no desire to follow them.   The car companies have huge resources, and better expertise on cars, but their internal rules and practices, honed over a century, are sure to hobble them.  They won&#8217;t take the risks that non-car companies will take, won&#8217;t want to damage existing business lines, and will face attacks within the companies from the &#8220;company immune system&#8221; which seeks to attack disruptive ideas within big companies.</p>

<p>Google&#8217;s main impediment is that it is also a big company, though an unusual one.  But this business is so hard to enter that we have yet to see a start-up make a play.</p>

<p>The statements from all these parties will do lots of good, lighting fires under the other players, including the unannounced ones.   I believe that in the 2020s, <strong>the software and sensor system which drives the car will be the most important part of the car, more important than even the engine.</strong>   While the world will be better off if there are multiple competing suppliers of this part, whoever dominates this will dominate the car industry.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I&#8217;m back from Burning Man, and this year, for the first time in a while, we didn&#8217;t get internet up in our camp, so I only did occasional email checks while wandering other places.   And thus, of course, there are many hundred  messages backed up in my box to get to.  I will look at the most important but some will just be ignored or discarded.</p>

<p>We all know it&#8217;s getting harder and harder to deal with email backlog after travel, even connected travel.  If you don&#8217;t check in it gets even worse.  Vacation autoreplies can help a little, but I think they are no longer enough.</p>

<p>Some years ago a friend tried something radical.  He had is autoreply say that he was away for 2 months, and could not possibly handle the email upon his return.  He said that thus the email you had sent had been discarded.  You were told that if it was still important when he returned that you should send it again then.   His correspondents were completely furious at the temerity of this action, though it has a lot of attractions.  They had taken the time to write an email, and to have it discarded and left in their hands to resend seemed rude.  (I believe the reply included a copy of the email at least.)</p>

<p>Worse, because we are always connected, vacation replies sometimes lie.  People are scanning their email, responding to the most important ones if they can, even though a vacation autoreply was sent.   And so we always hope for that.</p>

<p>I think the time has come for an extra internet protocol as a companion to mail.  When you type an E-mail address into your mail client, it should be able to query a server that handles information for that domain &#8212; something like an MX record &#8212; and query it about the email that is about to be written, including the sender address and recipient address, and possibly a priority.    If the recipient is in a vacation mode or other do not disturb mode, the sender would be told immediately, before writing the e-mail.   They would have the option of not writing it, writing it for delivery at the designated date in the future, or writing it with various tags about its urgency in case the recipient is doing some checking of mail.  </p>

<p>This could be an LDAP derived protocol or something else.  Indeed it could be combined, when trusted, with directory lookup and autocomplete directory services.  It&#8217;s not easy because often (with things like MX) the server that handles mail for a user may not have a strong link to the user in order to serve this data.  In the old e-mail regime of store and forward, live connections were not expected.  Still, I think it can be done, and it would not be a mandatory thing.</p>

<p>There are some security and privacy implications here that are challenging:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spammers will try to use this information to confirm addresses or hunt for them</li>
<li>This lets the recipient know if somebody just typed in their name to send mail, and when they did so, and thus how long they took to write a mail, or if they aborted one.  To avoid this, the directory servers could be trusted 3rd parties.</li>
<li>This provides a reliable IP address for the sender&#8217;s client, or at least a proxy acting for the sender.</li>
<li>It could be misused to build a general database of many people&#8217;s vacation status, invading their privacy, unless there are tools to prevent broad spidering of this sort.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mail servers would remember who queried, and in fact it might be encouraged to include a header in the email that came from the query, to officially tie them together.  This would allow clients to know who queried and who did not, giving priority to messages which came from people who queried and acted upon the result (for example waiting to send) over those who just sent mail without checking.   Users could get codes that would allow them to declare the message higher (or lower) priority that would not be available to those who just did plain SMTP.</p>

<p>Mailing lists might also make use of this data, and the response could tell mailing lists what the user wants to do, including temporarily unsubscribing until a given date, or asking for a digest of threads to be sent upon return, or other useful stuff.   Responsible corporate bulk mailers could also accept that you don&#8217;t want customer satisfaction surveys or useful coupon offers during your vacation and just not send them.   Ok, I&#8217;m dreaming on that one, perhaps.</p>

<p>For security, it could be that only past correspondents could do this query, or only users with some amount of authentication.  Anonymous email and mail from strangers would still be possible, but not with a pre-query.   The response could also be sent back via a special email that servers know to intercept, so it can&#8217;t be used to gain information that would not be gained by mailing a person today.  (You could get a report of people who queried you and never mailed you when not on vacation.)</p>

<p>We might see some features in mailers, like a pop-up in your mailers that says, &#8220;Brad just started writing you a message&#8221; the way instant messaging programs do.  I am not sure this is a good idea, but it would happen.   Readers: what other consequences do you see happening?</p>

        <h2 class="title"><a href="/new-car-stereo-noise-cancelling-headphone">The new car stereo is -- the noise cancelling headphone</a></h2>    <span class="submitted">Submitted by <a href="/user/brad" title="View user profile." rel="nofollow">brad</a> on Mon, 2013-08-19 16:59.</span>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Probably the most expensive add-on that people get in their cars today is the stereo.   Long ago, cars often came without stereos and there was a major aftermarket.  The aftermarket is still here but most people elect for factory stereos which fit in seamlessly with the car and often cost a huge amount of money.</p>

<p>The car&#8217;s not a great place to listen to music &#8212; it&#8217;s noisy and you are distracted and you often stop and have to get out in the middle of a song.  But because people find they listen to more music in their cars than at home, they often pay huge bucks for a fancy car stereo.   (Not counting the people who deliberately buy a system so loud it&#8217;s meant for other people outside the car to hear.)</p>

<p>While you could put a nice stereo system in a robocar, and some people will, another way they can save money is they don&#8217;t need to have much audio at all, not once they can do full-auto operation.   The prohibition on headphones by the driver should go away, and it could become popular to just use nice headphones &#8212; possibly noise cancelling headphones or in-ear noise-blocking phones.    A better audio experience with much less noise, and a lot cheaper too.   And there is the option for each person in the car to have their own headphones and tune their own audio stream.</p>

<p>People will like to share, so the car might contain a simple audio distribution system to feed audio streams to people who are sharing, though the source of the music should still be somebody&#8217;s phone or device, not something built into the car.    In addition, there could be a system to mix in some of the in-cabin audio, so you can still hear the other people when they talk.   Microphones on each person&#8217;s headphones could pick up their voices and actually provide a clearer read of their voices.  Headphones with position sensors could allow simulation of stereo on the other people.   Alternately a microphone array could exist around the car, particularly at each seat.</p>

<p>There are some downsides to push things into the traditional way:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wearing headphones is uncomfortable on long trips</li>
<li>They are a pain to remember to put on.  You want to avoid cords, so they would be wireless, but then you must be sure to put them in their charging dock.</li>
<li>On small aircraft, there is so much noise that everybody does it this way, but they tend to be bulky (due to the high noise) and unpopular for that reason</li>
</ul>

<p>So people might elect to still have decent speakers and listen to music without headphones.  But there is less need to buy a really expensive sound system, since if you want the top quality you probably want to go for the headphones.  This may also apply to decisions to do expensive sound elimination in the car.  For some, nothing may change, but that&#8217;s OK.  What&#8217;s interesting is the option to do car sound in ways never done before.</p>
