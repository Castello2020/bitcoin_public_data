</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Bitcoin is hot-hot-hot, but today I want to talk about how it ends.    <a href="/satoshi-now-time-consider-donating-lots-bitcoin-charity">Earlier</a>, I predicted a variety of possible fates for Bitcoin ranging from taking over the entire M1 money supply to complete collapse, but the most probable one, in my view, is that Bitcoin is eventually supplanted by one or more successor digital currencies which win in the marketplace.    I think that successor will also itself be supplanted, and that this might continue for some time.    I want to talk about not just why that might happen, but also how it may take place.</p>

<p>Nobody thinks Bitcoin is perfect, and no digital currency (DigiC) is likely to satisfy everybody.  Some of the flaws are seen as flaws by most people, but many of its facets are seen as features by some, and flaws by others.   The anonymity of addresses, the public nature of the transactions, the irrevocable transactions, the fixed supply, the mining system, the resistance to control by governments &#8212; there are parties that love these and hate these.</p>

<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s most remarkable achievement, so far, is the demonstration that a digital currency with no intrinsic value or backer/market maker can work and get a serious valuation.    Bitcoin argues &#8212; and for now demonstrates &#8212; that you can have a money that people will accept only because they know they can get others to accept it with no reliance on a government&#8217;s credit or the useful physical properties of a metal.   The price of a bitcoin today is pretty clearly the result of speculative bubble investment, but that it sustains a price at all is a revelation.  </p>

<p>Bitcoins have their value because they are scarce.  That scarcity is written into the code &#8212; in the regulated speed of mining, and in the fixed limit on coins.   There will only be so many bitcoins, and this gives you confidence in their value, unlike say, Zimbabwe 100 trillion dollar notes.   This fixed limit is often criticised because it will be strongly <em>deflationary</em> over time, and some more traditional economic theory feels there are serious problems with a deflationary currency.  People resist spending it because holding it is better than spending it, among other things.</p>

<h2>Altcoins</h2>

<p><img src=/files/100trillion.jpg class=blogpic>
<strong>While bitcoins have this scarcity, digital currencies as a group do not.  You can always create another digital currency</strong>.  And many people have.  While Bitcoin is the largest, there are many &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/altcoin" title="reference on altcoin" target="_blank">altcoin</a>s,&#8221; a few of which (such as Ripple, Litecoin and even the satirical currency Dogecoin) have serious total market capitalizations of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars(1).   Some of these altcoins are simply Bitcoin or minor modifications of the Bitcoin protocol with a different blockchain or group of participants, others have more serious differences, such as alternate forms of mining.  Ripple is considerably different.   New Altcoins will emerge from time to time, presumably forever.</p>

<p>What makes one digital coin better than another?  Obviously a crucial element is who will accept the coin in exchange for goods, services or other types of currency.   The leading coin (Bitcoin) is accepted at more stores which gives it a competitive advantage.</p>

<p>If one is using digital currency simply as a medium &#8212; changing dollars to bitcoins to immediately buy something with bitcoins at a store, then it doesn&#8217;t matter a great deal which DigiC you use, or what its price is, as long as it is not extremely volatile.  (You may be interested in other attributes, like speed of transaction and revocation, along with security, ease of use and other factors.)   If you wish to hold the DigC you care about appreciation, inflation and deflation, as well as the risk of collapse.    These factors are affected as well by the &#8220;cost&#8221; of the DigiC.</p>

<h2>The cost of a digital currency</h2>

<p>I will advance that every currency has a cost which affects its value.  For fiat currency like dollars, all new dollars go to the government, and every newly printed dollar devalues all the other dollars, and overprinting creates clear inflation. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/endgame-bitcoin">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>One sign of how interest is building is the large reaction to some recent concept prototypes for robocars, two of which were shown in physical form at the Geneva auto show.</p>

<p>The most attention came to the Swiss auto research company Ringspeed&#8217;s <a href="http://www.rinspeed.eu/aktuelles.php?aid=15">XchangE concept</a> which they based on a Tesla.   They including a steering wheel which could move from side to side (and more to the point, go to the middle, where it could be out of the way of the two front seats,) along with seats that could recline to sleeping positions or for watching a big-screen TV, and which could reverse for face-to-face seating.</p>

<p><img src=/files/rinspeed.jpg class=leftpic></p>

<p>Also attracting attention was the <a href="http://research.akka.eu/innovation/linkandgo.php">Link and Go</a>, an electric shuttle.  In <a href="http://gizmodo.com/is-this-ride-sharing-smart-minivan-the-future-of-self-d-1542547679">this article</a> it is shown on the floor with the face to face configuration.</p>

<p><img src=/files/zoox_boz_02.jpg class=blogpic>
This followed on buzz late last year over the announcement of <a href="http://zoox.co">Zoox</a> and their Boz concept, which features a car that has no steering wheel, and is symmetrical front to back (so of course seating is face to face.)  The Zoox model takes this down to the low level, with 4 independent wheel motors.   I&#8217;ve met a few times with Zoox&#8217;s leader, Tim Kentley-Klay of Melbourne, and the graphics skills of he and his team, along with some dynamic vision, also generated great buzz.</p>

<p>All this buzz came even though none of these companies had anything to say about the self-driving technology itself, which remains 99% of the problem.    And there have been a number of designers who have put out graphic concepts like these for many years, and many writers (your unhumble blogger included) who have written about them for years.
<img src=/files/zoox_boz_08.jpg class=blogpic></p>

<p>The Zoox design is fairly radical &#8212; a vehicle with no windshield and no steering wheel &#8212; it can never be manually driven and a full robocar.   Depending on future technologies like cheap carbon fibre and cost-effective 3-D printing for medium volumes, it&#8217;s a more expensive vehicle that you could make, but there may be a certain logic to that.   Tesla has shown us that there are many people who will happily pay a lot more to get a car that is unlike any other, and clearly the best.  They will pay more than can be rationally justified.</p>

<p>Speaking of Tesla, a lot of the excitement around the Rinspeed concept was that it was based on a Tesla.  That appears to have been a wise choice for Rinspeed as people got more excited about it than any other concept I&#8217;ve seen.   The image of people reclining, watching a movie, brought home an image that has been said many times in print but not shown physically to the world in the same way.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy for me (and perhaps for many readers of this blog) to feel that these concepts are so obvious that everybody just gets them, but it&#8217;s clearly not true.  This revolution is going to take many people by surprise.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Tuesday, the California DMV held a workshop on how they will write regulations for the operation of robocars in California.   They already have done meetings on testing, but the real meat of things will be in the operation.  It was in Sacramento, so I decided to just watch the video feed.   (Sadly, remote participants got almost no opportunity to provide feedback to the workshop, so it looks like it&#8217;s 5 hours of driving if you want to really be heard, at least in this context.)</p>

<p>The event was led by Brian Soublet, assistant chief counsel, and next to him was Bernard Soriano, the deputy director.   I think Mr. Soublet did a very good job of understanding many of the issues and leading the discussion.  I am also impressed at the efforts Mr. Soriano has made to engage the online community to participate.   Because Sacramento is a trek for most interested parties, it means the room will be dominated by those paid to go, and online engagement is a good way to broaden the input received.</p>

<p>As I wrote in my article on <a href="http://robocars.com/government.html">advice to governments</a> I believe the best course is to have a light hand today while the technology is still in flux.  While it isn&#8217;t easy to write regulations, it&#8217;s harder to undo them.   There are many problems to be solved, but we really should see first whether the engineers who are working day-in and day-out to solve them can do that job before asking policymakers to force a solution.  It&#8217;s not the role of the government to forbid theoretical risks in advance, but rather to correct demonstrated harms and demonstrated unacceptable risks once it&#8217;s clear they can&#8217;t be solved on the ground.</p>

<p><img src=/files/dmv.jpg class=leftpic>
With that in mind, here&#8217;s some commentary on matters that came up during the session.</p>

<h2>How do the police pull over a car?</h2>

<p>Well, the law already requires that vehicles pull over when told to by police, as well as pull to the right when any emergency vehicle is passing.   With no further action, all car developers will work out ways to notice this &#8212; microphones which know the sound of the sirens, cameras which can see the flashing lights.    </p>

<p>Developers might ask for a way to make this problem easier.  Perhaps a special sound the police car could make (by holding a smartphone up to their PA microphone for example.)  Perhaps the police just reading the licence plate to dispatch and dispatch using an interface provided by the car vendor.   Perhaps a radio protocol that can be loaded into an officer&#8217;s phone.   Or something else &#8212; this is not yet the time to solve it.</p>

<p>It should be noted that this should be an <em>extremely unlikely</em> event.  The officer is not going to pull over the car to have a chat.  Rather, they would only want the car to stop because it is driving in an unsafe manner and putting people at risk.  This is not impossible, but teams will work so hard on testing their cars  that the probability that a police officer would be the first to discover a bug which makes the car drive illegally is very, very low.  In fact, not to diminish the police or represent the developers as perfect, but the odds are much greater that the officer is in error.   Still, the ability should be there. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/commentary-californias-robocar-regulations-workshop">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

    <div class="content"><p>Yesterday, I was <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/take-note-web-not-internet">interviewed for the public radio program Marketplace</a> and as is normal, 30 minutes come down to 30 seconds.   So I wanted to add some commentary to that story.</p>

<p>As you are no doubt hearing today, it was 25 years ago that Tim Berners-Lee first developed his draft proposal for an internet based hypertext system to tie together all the internet&#8217;s protocols: E-mail, USENET, FTP, Gopher, Telnet and a potential new protocol (HTTP) to serve up those hypertext pages.   He didn&#8217;t call it the web then, and the first web tools were not written for a while, and wouldn&#8217;t make it to the outside world until 1991, but this was the germ of a system that changed the internet and the world.   The first wave of public attention came when the UIUC&#8217;s supercomputing center released a graphical browser called Mosaic in 1993 and CERN declared the web protocols non-proprietary.  Mosaic&#8217;s main author went on to start Mozilla/Netscape, which turned into the Firefox browser you may be reading this with.</p>

<p>As the radio piece explains, many people are confused as to what the difference is between the internet and the web.  (They also are unsure what a browser is, or how the web is distinct even from Google sometimes.)   To most, the internet was an overnight success &#8212; an overnight success that had been developing for over 20 years.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to diminish the importance of the web, or TimBL&#8217;s contribution to it.  He writes a <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/03/on-25th-anniversary-of-web-lets-keep-it.html">guest editorial on the Google blog today</a> where he lays out a similar message.   The web integrated many concepts from deeper internet history.</p>

<p>Prior to the web, several systems emerged to let you use the internet&#8217;s resources.    Mailing lists were the first seat of community on the internet, starting with Dave Farber&#8217;s MSGGROUP in the 70s.   In the early 80s, that seat of community moved to USENET.   USENET was serial, rather than browsed, but it taught lessons about having a giant network with nobody owning it or being in control.</p>

<p>The large collection of FTP servers were indexed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_search_engine" title="reference on Archie search engine" target="_blank">Archie search engine</a>, the first internet search engine from McGill University.   Greater excitement came from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_protocol" title="reference on Gopher protocol" target="_blank">Gopher protocol</a> from the U. of Minnesota, which allowed you to browse a tree of menus, moving from site to site, being taken to pages, files, local search resources and more all over the internet.</p>

<p>The web was not based on menus, though.  It took the concept of hypertext; the ability to put links into documents that point at other documents.    Hypertext concepts go back all the way to Vannevar Bush&#8217;s famous &#8220;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">Memex</a>&#8221; but the man most known for popularizing it was Ted Nelson, who wrote the popular book Comptuer Lib.   Ted tried hard for decades to commercialize hypertext and saw his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu" title="reference on Project Xanadu" target="_blank">Project Xanadu</a> system as the vision for the future computerized world.  In Xanadu, links were to specific points in other documents, were bi-directional and also allowed for copyright ownership and billing &#8212; I could  link in text from your document and you got paid when people paid to read my document.   Hypertext was the base of Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Hypercard&#8221; and a few other non-networked systems.</p>

<p>So did TimBL just combine hypertext with internet protocols to make a revolution?   One important difference with the web was that the links were one-way and the system was non-proprietary.   Anybody could join the system, anybody could link to anybody, and no permission or money were needed.   Embracing the internet&#8217;s philosophy of open protocols, while others had built more closed systems, this was a tool that everybody could jump aboard.</p>

<p>Another key difference, which allowed WWW to quickly supplant gopher, was counter-intuitive.   Gopher used menus and thus was structured.  Structure enables several useful things, but it&#8217;s hard to maintain and limits other things you can do.  Hypertext is unstructured and produces a giant morass, what we math nerds would call a big directed graph.   This &#8220;<a href="/archives/000112.html">writer friendly</a>&#8221; approach was easy to add to, in spite of the lack of plan and the many broken links.</p>

<p>The Web was a superset of Gopher, but by being less structured it was more powerful.   This lesson would be taught several times in the future, as Yahoo&#8217;s structure menus, which made billions for its founders, were supplanted by unstructured text search from Lycos, Alta Vista and eventually Google.    Wikipedia&#8217;s anybody-can-contribute approach devoured the old world of encyclopedias.</p>

<p>For the real explosion into the public consciousness, though, the role of Mosaic is quite important.   TimBL did envision the inclusion of graphics &#8212; I remember him excitedly showing me an early version of Mosaic in 1992 he was playing with &#8212; but at the time most of us used USENET, gopher and the very early Web using text browsers, and more to the point, we liked it that way.   The inclusion of graphics into web pages was mostly superfluous and slowed things down, making it harder, not easier to get to the meat of what we wanted.  The broader public doesn&#8217;t see it that way, and found Mosaic to be their gateway into the internet.   In addition, many companies and content producers would not be satisfied with publishing online until they could make it look the way they wanted it to look.   Graphical browsers allowed for that, but at the time, people were much more interested in the new PDF format which let you publish a document to look just like paper than in the HTML format where you didn&#8217;t control the margins, fonts or stylistic elements.</p>

<p>(The HTML specification&#8217;s history is one of a war between those who believe you should specify the meaning of the structural elements in your documents and let the browser figure out the best way to present those, and those who want tight control to produce a specific vision.   CSS has settled some of that war, but it continues to this day.)</p>

<p>Nobody owned the web, and while Tim is not poor, it was others like Marc Andreesen, Jerry Yang &amp; Dave Filo who would become the early billionaires from it.    The web was the internet&#8217;s inflection point, when so many powerful trends came together and reached a form that allowed the world to embrace it.   (In addition, it was necessary that the Moore&#8217;s law curves governing the price of computing and networking were also reaching the level needed to give these technologies to the public.)</p>

<p>25 years ago, I was busy working on the code for <a href="http://www.templetons.com/brad/clarinet-history.html">ClariNet</a>, which would become the first business founded on the internet when I announced it in June &#8212; I will post an update on that 25th anniversary later this year.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Last year, the NHTSA released a document defining &#8220;levels&#8221; from 0 to 4 for self-driving technology.   People are eager for taxonomy that lets them talk about the technology, so it&#8217;s no surprise that use of the levels has caught on.</p>

<p>The problem is that they are misleading and probably won&#8217;t match the actual progress of technology.  That would be tolerable if it weren&#8217;t for the fact that NHTSA itself made recommendations to states about how the levels should be treated in law, and states and others are already using the vocabulary in discussing regulations.   Most disturbingly, NHTSA recommendations suggested states hold off on &#8220;level 4&#8221; in writing regulations for robocars &#8212; effectively banning them until the long process of un-banning them can be done.   There is a great danger the levels will turn into an official roadmap.</p>

<p>Because of this, it&#8217;s worth understanding how the levels are already incorrect in the light of current and soon-to-be-released technology, and how they&#8217;re likely to be a bad roadmap for the future.  </p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>The latest Bitcoin bombshell &#8212; distracting us even from the Mt.Gox failure &#8212; was the <a href="http://mag.newsweek.com/2014/03/14/bitcoin-satoshi-nakamoto.html">Newsweek cover story</a> &#8212; their first printed issue since 2012 &#8212; declaring they had found the mythical creator of Bitcoin, known under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto, and he was a guy from near L.A. in his 60s whose real birth name was actually Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>

<p>Now known as Dorian S. Nakamoto, I&#8217;ll refer to him as DSN to distinguish him from BCSN &#8212; the Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, though of course the question is whether DSN == BCSN.  DSN denies he is BCSN and says his quotes suggesting that were answers to other questions, at least in his mind.</p>

<p>The second surprise was a web posting from BCSN, the first in years, simply saying he is not DSN.  This posting is confusing, because a little thought shows it reveals no information on that subject.   If DSN is BCSN, then of course both are denying it.   More to the point, BCSN is clearly somebody well versed in game theory and trust calculus, and knows very well that the denial does not add reliable information on this.</p>

<p>BCSN&#8217;s post does tell us one big thing though &#8212; that BCSN is still alive, around, and even willing to comment if the issue is as big as this one.  Many speculated that his silence meant he was gone, and also that he had lost his estimated million bitcoins.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin community was quite skeptical of the Newsweek claim.  One very justified reason for this skepticism is that aside from the two key disputed quotes, the article&#8217;s arguments that it has found BCSN read like nonsense to the average nerd.</p>

<p>DSN might be BCSN, the article reasons, because he is a nerdy engineer with good technical skills, a background working at various tech companies and government projects, is aloof from his family and neighbours, and enjoys a technical hobby such as collecting model trains, even machining his own parts.  &#8220;Smart, intelligent, mathematics, engineering, computers.  You name it, he can do it,&#8221; says DSN&#8217;s brother.  He&#8217;s a little bit libertarian, looks scruffy and is reportedly a bit of an asshole.    </p>

<p><em>Aha</em>, links Leah McGrath Goodman of Newsweek &#8212; this &#8220;suggested I was on the right track.&#8221;</p>

<p>What she doesn&#8217;t realize perhaps is that I literally <strong>know hundreds people who fit that description</strong>.  It&#8217;s a profile that is actually more likely to be true than not among wide swaths of the nerd community.</p>

<p>Goodman&#8217;s logic reads to us like somebody saying, &#8220;I was on the track of the Zodiac killer, whom we know to be from San Francisco.  I identified a suspect named John Zodiac who is a quiet loner, and is known to like the San Francisco Giants and burritos in the Mission district.  I&#8217;m on the right track!&#8221;</p>

<p>There is only one thing in the Newsweek article that was worthy of attention.   With police he summoned ready to usher Goodman away from his house, he tells her</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it. It&#8217;s been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the context of Bitcoin, that&#8217;s indeed proof enough. The police officers present have confirmed he did say something like this. DSN insists he felt he was being asked about his past classified work on government projects.   He says he had not even heard about Bitcoin until this matter came up.</p>

<p>Various online forces have come up with other arguments against the match.  DSN&#8217;s known writings seem fairly different from the writings of BCSN, though Goodman finds a few commonalities, including hints that BCSN is perhaps older (like DSN.)</p>

<p>But most of all, BCSN is known as a scrupulous protector of his or her or their own identity.   BCSN made meticulous use of online identity hiding techniques to avoid being tracked, and has never spent any of the huge cache of bitcoins mined in the early days, possibly to avoid the risk of detection.   This is so completely at odds with the idea of doing it all under his real name that after a perfunctory search in the early days, most people who fancied themselves Satoshi-finding detectives rarely bothered to look at people whose real name was Satoshi Nakamoto.  Common wisdom, in fact, was that he/she probably wasn&#8217;t even Japanese.   Certainly not somebody with no history in the cryptography or digital money communities.</p>

<h2>But what if it is him?</h2>

<p>While currently the tide seems to be to discredit the Newsweek story, a second question has been raised &#8212; is it good or bad if BCSN is unmasked, and if it is this guy? <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/real-bitcoin-satoshi-nakamoto">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

        <h2 class="title"><a href="/would-we-ever-ban-human-driving">Would we ever ban human driving?</a></h2>    <span class="submitted">Submitted by <a href="/user/brad" title="View user profile." rel="nofollow">brad</a> on Thu, 2014-03-06 14:41.</span>
    <span class="taxonomy"><ul class="links inline"><li class="first last taxonomy_term_95"><a href="/topic/robocars" rel="tag" title="The future of computer-driven cars and deliverbots" class="taxonomy_term_95">Robocars</a></li>
</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I often see the suggestion that as Robocars get better, eventually humans will be forbidden from driving, or strongly discouraged through taxes or high insurance charges.  Many people think that might happen fairly soon.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to see why, as human drivers kill 1.2 million people around the world every year, and injure many millions more.  If we get a technology that does much better, would we not want to forbid the crazy risk of driving?  It is one of the most dangerous things we commonly do, perhaps only second to smoking.</p>

<p>Even if this is going to happen, it won&#8217;t happen soon.   While my own personal prediction is that robocars will gain market share very quickly &#8212; more like the iPhone than like traditional automotive technologies &#8212; there will still be lots of old-style cars around for many decades to come, and lots of old-style people.   History shows we&#8217;re very reluctant to forbid old technologies.   Instead we grandfather in the old technologies.   You can still drive the cars of long ago, if you have one, even though they are horribly unsafe death traps by today&#8217;s standards, and gross polluters as well.   Society is comfortable that as market forces cause the numbers of old vehicles to dwindle, this is sufficient to attain the social goals.</p>

<p>There are occasional exceptions, though usually only if they are easy to do.  You do have to install seatbelts in a classic car that doesn&#8217;t have them, as well as turn signals and the other trappings of being street legal.</p>

<p>While I often talk about the horrible death toll, and how bad human drivers are, the reality is that this is an aggregation over a lot of people.   A very large number of people will never have an accident in their lives, let alone one with major injuries or death.  That&#8217;s a good thing!    The average person probably drives around 600,000 miles in a lifetime in the USA.   There is an accident for every 250,000 miles, but these are not evenly distributed.  Some people have 4 or 5 accidents, and many have none.</p>

<p>As such, forbidding driving would be a presumption of guilt where most are innocent, and tough call from a political standpoint.</p>

<p><img src=/files/me-gcar.jpg class=leftpic>
That doesn&#8217;t mean other factors won&#8217;t strongly discourage driving.   You&#8217;ll still need a licence after all, and that licence might get harder and harder to get.  The USA is one of the most lax places in the world.  Many other countries have much more stringent driving tests.   The ready availability of robotaxis will mean that many people just never go through the hassle of getting a licence, seeing no great need.   Old people, who currently fight efforts to take away their licences, will not have the need to fight so hard.</p>

<h2>Insurance goes down, not up</h2>

<p>You will also need insurance.   Today we pay about 6 cents/mile on average for insurance.   Those riding in safe robocars might find that cost down to a penny/mile, which would be a huge win.   But the cost for those who insist to drive is not going to go <em>up</em> because of robocars, unless you believe the highly unlikely proposition that the dwindling number of humans will cause more or deadlier accidents per person in the future.  People tolerate that 6 cent/mile cost today, and they&#8217;ll tolerate it in the future if they want to.   The cost will probably even drop a bit, because human driven cars will have robocar technologies and better passive safety (crumple zones) that make them much safer, even with a human at the wheel.   Indeed, we may see many cars which are human driven but &#8220;very hard&#8221; to crash by mistake.</p>

<p>The <em>relative</em> cost of insurance will be higher, which may dissuade some folks.  If you are told, &#8220;This trip will cost $6 if you ride, and $8 if you insist on driving&#8221; you might decide not to drive because 33% more cost seems ridiculous &#8212; even though today you are paying more for that cost on an absolute scale.</p>

<p>Highly congested cities will take steps against car ownership, and possibly driving.  In Singapore, for example, you can&#8217;t have a car unless you buy a very expensive certificate at auction &#8212; these certificates cost as much as $100,000 for ten years.   You have to <em>really</em> want a private car in Singapore, but still many people do.</p>

<p>Governments won&#8217;t have a great incentive to forbid driving but they might see it as a way to reduce congestion.  Once robocars are packing themselves more tightly on the roads, they will want to give the human driven cars a wider berth, because they are less predictable.  As such, the human driver takes up more road space.  They also do more irrational things (like slow down to look at an accident.)   One can imagine charges placed on human drivers for the extra road congestion they cause, and that might take people out of the driver&#8217;s seat.</p>

<h2>The all-robocar lane tricks</h2>

<p>There are certain functions which only work or only work well if all cars are robocars.  They will be attractive, to be sure, but will they surpass the pressure from the human lobby?</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s possible to build dynamic intersections without traffic lights or bridges if all cars are trusted robocars.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s possible to build low-use roads that are just two strips of concrete (like rails) if only robocars go on them, which is much cheaper.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s possible to safety redirect individual lanes on roads, without need for barriers, if all cars in the boundary lanes are robocars.  Humans can still drive in the non-boundary lanes pretty safely.</li>
<li>We can probably cut congestion a lot in the all-robocar world, but we still cut it plenty as penetration increases over time.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are nice, but really only a few really good things depend on the all-robocar world.  Which is a good thing, because we would never get the cars if the benefits required universal adoption.</p>

<h2>But don&#8217;t have an accident&#8230;</h2>

<p>All of this is for ordinary drivers who are free of accidents and tickets.  This might all change if you have an accident or get lots of tickets.  Just as you can lose you licence to a DUI, I can foresee a system where people lose their licence on their first accident, or certainly on their second.   Or their first DUI or certain major tickets.   In that world, people will actually drive with much more caution, having their licence at stake for any serious mistake.  A teen who causes an accident may find they have to wait several years to re-try getting a licence.   It&#8217;s also possible that governments would raise the driving age to 18 or 21 to get people past the reckless part of their lives, but that this would not be a burden in a robocar world, with teens who are not even really aware of what they are missing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve driven over 35 years and had no accidents.  I&#8217;ve gotten 2 minor speeding tickets, back in the 80s &#8212; though I actually speed quite commonly, like everybody else.  It seems unlikely there would be cause to forbid me to drive, even in a mostly robocar world.   Should I wish it.   I don&#8217;t actually wish it, not on city streets.   I still will enjoy driving on certain roads I would consider &#8220;fun to drive&#8221; in the mountains or by the coast.   It&#8217;s also fun to go to a track and go beyond even today&#8217;s street rules.   I don&#8217;t see that going away.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Yesterday, I wrote about <a href="/what-if-somebody-steals-bitcoin">stolen bitcoins and the issues around a database of stolen coins</a>.  The issue is very complex, so today I will add some follow-up issues.</p>

<p>When stolen property changes hands (innocently) the law says that nobody in the chain had authority to transfer title to that property.   Let&#8217;s assume that the law accepts bitcoins as property, and bitcoin transactions as denoting transfer of title, (as well as possession/control) to it.    So with a stolen bitcoin, the final recipient is required on the law to return possession of the coin to its rightful owner, the victim of the theft.   However, that recipient is also now entitled to demand back whatever they paid for the bitcoin, and so on down the line, all the way to the thief.   With anonymous transactions, that&#8217;s a tall order, though most real world transactions are not that anonymous.</p>

<p>This is complicated by the fact that almost all Bitcoin transactions mix coins together.   A Bitcoin &#8220;wallet&#8221; doesn&#8217;t hold bitcoins, rather it holds addresses which were the outputs of earlier transactions, and those outputs were amounts of bitcoin.    When you want to do a new transaction, you do two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>You gather together enough addresses in your wallet which hold outputs of prior transactions, which together add up to as much as you plan to spend, and almost always a bit more.</li>
<li>You write a transaction that lists all those old outputs as &#8220;inputs&#8221; and then has a series of outputs, which are the addresses of the recipients of the transaction.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are typically 3 (or more) outputs on a transaction:</p>

<ol>
<li>The person you&#8217;re paying.  The output is set to be the amount you&#8217;re paying</li>
<li>Yourself.  The output is the &#8220;change&#8221; from the transaction since the inputs probably didn&#8217;t add up exactly to the amount you&#8217;re paying.</li>
<li>Any amount left over &#8212; normally small and sometimes zero &#8212; which does not have a specific output, but is given as a transaction fee to the miner who put your transaction into the Bitcoin ledger (blockchain.)</li>
</ol>

<p><img src=/files/send-coins.png class=blogpic></p>

<p>They can be more complex, but the vast majority work like this.  While normally you pay the &#8220;change&#8221; back to yourself, the address for the change can be any new random address, and nothing in the ledger connects it to you.</p>

<p>So as you can see, a transaction might combine a ton of inputs, some of which are clean, untainted coins, some of which are tainted, and some of which are mixed.  After coins have been through a lot of transactions, the mix can be very complex.  Not so complex as the computers can&#8217;t deal with it and calculate a precise fraction of the total coin that was tainted, but much too complex for humans to wish to worry about.</p>

<p>A thief will want to mix up their coins as quickly as possible, and there are a variety of ways to do that.</p>

<p>Right now, the people who bought coins at Mt.Gox (or those who sent them there to buy other currency) are the main victims of this heist.   They thought they had a balance there, and its gone.   Many of them bought these coins at lower prices, and so their loss is not nearly as high as the total suggests, but they are deservedly upset.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if the law does right by them and recovers their stolen property, it is likely that might come from the whole Bitcoin owning and using community, because of the fact that everybody in the chain is liable.   Of particular concern are the merchants who are taking bitcoin on their web sites.    Let&#8217;s speculate on the typical path of a stolen coin that&#8217;s been around for a while:</p>

<ul>
<li>It left Mt.Gox for cash, sold by the thief, and a speculator simply held onto the coins.  That&#8217;s the &#8220;easy&#8221; one, the person who now has stolen coins has to find the thief and get their money back.  Not too likely, but legally clear.</li>
<li>It left Mt.Gox and was used in a series of transactions, ending up with one where somebody bought an item from a web store using bitcoin.</li>
<li>With almost all stores, the merchant system takes all bitcoin received and sells it for dollars that day.  Somebody else &#8212; usually a bitcoin speculator &#8212; paid dollars for that bitcoin that day, and the chain continues.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is the potential here for a lot of hassle.  The store learns they sold partially tainted bitcoins.  The speculator wants and is entitled to getting a portion of her money back, and the store is an easy target to go after.   The store now has to go after their customer for the missing money.  The store also probably knows who their customer is.   The customer may have less knowledge of where her bitcoins came from.</p>

<p>This is a huge hassle for the store, and might very well lead to stores reversing their decisions to accept bitcoin.  If 6% of all bitcoins are stolen, as the Mt.Gox heist alleges, most transactions are tainted.  6% is an amount worth recovering for many, and it&#8217;s probably all the profit at a typical web store.   Worse, <strong>the number of stolen coins may be closer to 15% of all the circulating bitcoins</strong>, certainly something worth recovering on many transactions.</p>

<h1>The &#8220;sinking taint&#8221; approach</h1>

<p>Previously, I suggested a rule.  The rule was that if a transaction merges various inputs which are variously reported as stolen (tainted) and not, then the total percentage be calculated, and the first outputs receive all the tainting, and the latter outputs (including the transaction fee, last of all) be marked clear.   One of the outputs would remain partial unless the transaction was designed to avoid this.     There is no inherent rule that the &#8220;change&#8221; comes last, it is just a custom, and it would probably be reversed, so that as much of the tainted fraction remains in the change as possible, and the paid amount is as clean as possible.   Recipients would want to insist on that.</p>

<p>This allows the creation of a special transaction that people could do with themselves on discovering they have coin that is reported stolen.   The transaction would split the coin precisely into one or more purely tainted outputs, and one or more fully clean outputs.   Recipients would likely refuse bitcoin with any taint on it at all, and so holders of bitcoin would be forced to do these dividing transactions.   (They might have to do them again if new theft reports come on coin that they own.)  People would end up doing various combinations of these transactions to protect their privacy and not publicly correlate all their coin.</p>

<h2>Tainted transaction fees?</h2>

<p>The above system makes the transaction fee clean if any of the coin in the transaction is clean.  If this is not done, miners might not accept such transactions.   On the other hand, there is an argument that it would be good if miners refused even partially tainted transactions, other than the ones above used to divide the stolen coins from the clean.  There would need to be a rule that allows a transaction to be declared a splitting transaction which pays its fees from the clean part.   In this case, as soon as coins had any taint at all, they would become unspendable in the legit markets and it would be necessary to split them.  They would still be spendable with people who did not accept this system, or in some underground markets, but they would probably convert to other currencies at a discount.</p>

<p>This works better if there is agreement on the database of tainted coins, but that&#8217;s unlikely.  As such, miners would decide what databases to use.  Anything in the database used by a significant portion of the miners would make those coins difficult to spend and thus prime for splitting.   However, if they are clean in the view of a significant fraction of the miners, they will enter the blockchain eventually.</p>

<p>This is a lot of complexity, much more than anybody in the Bitcoin community wants.   The issue is that if the law gets involved, there is a world of pain in store for the system, and merchants, if a large fraction of all circulating coins are reported as stolen in a police report, even a Japanese police report.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Bitcoin has seen a lot of chaos in the last few months, including being banned in several countries, the fall of the Silk Road, and biggest of all, the collapse of Mt. Gox, which was for much of Bitcoin&#8217;s early history, the largest (and only major) exchange between regular currencies and bitcoins.  Most early &#8220;investors&#8221; in bitcoin bought there, and if they didn&#8217;t move their coins out, they now greatly regret it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been quite impressed by the ability of the bitcoin system to withstand these problems.  Each has caused major &#8220;sell&#8221; days but it has bounced back each time.  This is impressive because nothing underlies bitcoins other than the expectation that you will be able to use them into the future and that others will take them.</p>

<p>It is claimed (though doubted by some) that most of Mt.Gox&#8217;s bitcoins &#8212; 750,000 of them or over $400M &#8212; were stolen in some way, either through thieves exploiting a bug or some other means.  If true, this is <strong>one of the largest heists in history</strong>. There are several other stories of theft out there as well.  Because bitcoin transactions can&#8217;t be reversed, and there is no central organization to complain to, theft is a real issue for bitcoin.  If you leave your bitcoin keys on your networked devices, and people get in, they can transfer all your coins away, and there is no recourse.</p>

<p>Or is there?</p>

<p><img class=blogpic src=/files/send-coins.png>
If you sell something and are paid in stolen money, there is bad news for you, the recipient of the money.  If this is discovered, the original owner gets the money back.  You are out of luck for having received stolen property.  You might even be suspected of being involved, but even if you are entirely innocent, you still lose.</p>

<p>All bitcoin transactions are public, but the identities of the parties are obscured.  If your bitcoins are stolen, you can stand up and declare they were stolen.  More than that, unless the thief wiped all your backups, you can 99.9% prove that you were, at least in the past, the owner of the allegedly stolen coins.  Should society accept bitcoins as money or property, you would be able to file a police report on the theft, and identify the exact coin fragments stolen, and prove they were yours, once.   We would even know &#8220;where&#8221; they are today, or see every time they are spent and know who they went to, or rather, know the random number address that owns them now in the bitcoin system.   You still own them, under the law, but in the system they are at some other address.</p>

<p>That random address is not inherently linked to this un-owner, but as the coins are spent and re-spent, they will probably find their way to a non-anonymous party, like a retailer, from whom you could claim them back.   Retailers, exchanges and other legitimate parties would not want this, they don&#8217;t want to take stolen coins and lose their money.  (Clever recipients generate a new address for every transaction, but others use publicly known addresses.)</p>

<h2>Tainted coin database?</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s possible, not even that difficult, to create a database of &#8220;tainted&#8221; coins.  If such a database existed, people accepting coins could check if the source transaction coins are in that database.   If there, they might reject the coins or even report the sender.  I say &#8220;reject&#8221; because you normally don&#8217;t know what coins you are getting until the transaction is published, and if the other party publishes it, the coins are now yours.    You can refuse to do your end of the transaction (ie. not hand over the purchased goods) or even publish a transaction &#8220;refunding&#8221; the coins back to the sender.   It&#8217;s also possible to imagine that the miners could refuse to enter a transaction involving tainted coins into the blockchain.  (For one thing, if the coins are stolen, they won&#8217;t get their transaction fees.)   However, as long as some miner comes along willing to enter it, it will be recorded, though other miners could refuse to accept that block as legit. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/what-if-somebody-steals-bitcoin">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

    <div class="content"><p>In my recent travels, I have often been asked what various government entities can and should do related to the regulation of robocars.   Some of them want to consider how to protect public safety.  Most of them, however, want to know what they can do to prepare their region for the arrival of these cars, and ideally to become one of the leading centres in the development of the vehicles.   The car industry is about to be disrupted, and most of the old players may not make it through to the new world.   The ground transportation industry is so huge (I estimate around $7 trillion globally) that many regions depend on it as a large component of their economy.   For some places it&#8217;s vital.</p>

<p>But there are many more questions than that, so I&#8217;ve prepared an essay covering a wide variety of ways in which policymakers and robocars will interact.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>It was revealed earlier this month that <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov/About+NHTSA/Press+Releases/2014/USDOT+to+Move+Forward+with+Vehicle-to-Vehicle+Communication+Technology+for+Light+Vehicles">NHTSA wishes to mandate vehicle to vehicle radios in all cars</a>.   I have <a href="/tags/v2v">written extensively on the issues around this</a> and regular readers will know I am a skeptic of this plan.  This is not to say that I don&#8217;t think that V2V would not be useful for robocars and regular cars.   Rather, I believe that its benefits are marginal when it comes to the real problems, and for the amount of money that must be spent, there are better ways to spend it.   In addition, I think that similar technology can and will evolve organically, without a government mandate, or with a very minimal one.  Indeed, I think that technology produced without a mandate or pre-set standards will actually be superior, cheaper and be deployed far more quickly than the proposed approach.</p>

<p>The new radio protocol, known as DSRC, is a point-to-point wifi style radio protocol for cars and roadside equipment.   There are many applications.   Some are &#8220;V2V&#8221; which means cars report what they are doing to other cars.  This includes reporting one&#8217;s position tracklog and speed, as well as events like hitting the brakes or flashing a turn signal.  Cars can use this to track where other cars are, and warn of potential collisions, even with cars you can&#8217;t see directly.   Infrastructure can use it to measure traffic.</p>

<p><img class=blogpic src=/files/v2v.jpg>
The second class of applications are &#8220;V2I&#8221; which means a car talks to the road.  This can be used to know traffic light states and timings, get warnings of construction zones and hazards, implement tolling and congestion charging, and measure traffic.</p>

<p>This will be accomplished by installing a V2V module in every new car which includes the radio, a connection to car information and GPS data.  This needs to be tamper-proof, sealed equipment and must have digital certificates to prove to other cars it is authentic and generated only by authorized equipment.</p>

<p>Robocars will of course use it.  Any extra data is good, and the cost of integrating this into a robocar is comparatively small.  The questions revolve around its use in ordinary cars.  Robocars, however, can never rely on it.  They must be be fully safe enough based on just their sensors, since you can&#8217;t expect every car, child or deer to have a transponder, ever.</p>

<p>One issue of concern is the timeline for this technology, which will look something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>If they&#8217;re lucky, NHTSA will get this mandate in 2015, and stop the FCC from reclaiming the currently allocated spectrum.</li>
<li>Car designers will start designing the tech into new models, however they will not ship until the 2019 or 2020 model years.</li>
<li>By 2022, the 2015 designed technology will be seriously obsolete, and new standards will be written, which will ship in 2027.</li>
<li>New cars will come equipped with the technology.  About 12 million new cars are sold per year. </li>
<li>By 2030, about half of all cars have the technology, and so it works in 25% of accidents.  3/4 of those will have the obsolete 2015 technology or need a field-upgrade.  The rest will have soon to be obsolete 2022 technology.  Most cars also have forward collision warning by this point, so V2V is only providing extra information in a tiny fraction of the 25% of accidents.</li>
<li>By 2040 almost all cars have the technology, though most will have older versions.  Still, 5-10% of cars do not have the technology unless a mandate demands retrofit.  Some cars have the equipment but it is broken.</li>
</ol>

<p>Because of the quadratic network effect, in 2030 when half of cars have the technology, only 25% of car interactions will be make use of it, since both cars must have it.  (The number is, to be fair, somewhat higher as new cars drive more than old cars.) <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/us-push-mandate-v2v-radios-it-good-choice">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

    <div class="content"><p>Very long-time readers of this blog will remember a <a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/archives/000074.html">proposal I made 10 years ago that cruise ship inside cabins use HDTVs with the outside view</a>.     Now a cruise ship is launching with such a system, though bigger than I proposed.</p>

<p><img class=leftpic src=http://www.royalcaribbeanblog.com/sites/default/files/400x301xquantum-of-the-seas-virtual-balcony_2_0.jpg.pagespeed.ic.uRlrdntuoy.jpg>
The Royal Caribbean vessel will feature an <a href="http://www.wired.com/autopia/2014/02/virtual-balcony-royal-caribbean">artificial balcony using an 80 inch screen</a> including a fake railing.   While the cameras used are 4K, I suspect the screens will only be HDTV, since 4K 80 inch screens are hugely expensive right now, though very shortly they will be quite affordable for this.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see if the virtual balcony approach does much better than just using something meant to look like a window, which frankly would be a bunch easier though not get that 3D effect from the railing.  (The fact that the image and railing are at the same focus distance may actually complicate things.)
I think an interesting approach would be instead to use a screen with infinity optics, which make the screen focus as though it is at infinity.  This requires space outside the room, which you could get by having two adjoining cabins each take a box out of the other cabin for the mirror and lenses.  (Though doing really good collimated light takes a lot of space which is at too much of a premium in a cruise ship, though perhaps not as much in interior cabins.</p>

<p>The sample photo shows a rather large stateroom &#8212; usually interior rooms are small and for those who can&#8217;t afford a window, but this might change.   One reason people tolerate interior rooms is they plan to spend very little time in the room not sleeping, but the reality is that even doing that, it is disconcerting not to have the subtle cues of real exposure to day and night, waking up and not knowing what time it is.   It generates a greater feeling of being closed in to be in a small enclosed and windowless space, compared to large interior spaces.   As I pointed out before, having a view of the real horizon helps a lot with seasickness.</p>

<p>If this is a success, it could lead to several things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ability to sell many more interior rooms, making better use of space in the middle of the very wide ships desired today.</li>
<li>Low, central cabins have the least sway, but in the past were not popular with the seasick because that&#8217;s much worse without a window.</li>
<li>People might actually choose a larger, interior cabin at the same price as a much smaller, exterior cabin.  Even if you plan to spend only modest time awake in your cabin, life in a larger cabin is more pleasant.</li>
<li>Virtual walls could be put on multiple sides of the cabin, so you get the illusion of an owner&#8217;s suite, with views in all directions.</li>
</ul>

<p>To really get a super effect, you could even have people wear 3D glasses in the cabin &#8212; polarized ones that double as sunglasses if you can make the screens bright enough.   These allow you to do a special trick if there is only one person in the room, which make the screens simulate parallax, so that as you move your head, the background moves as though you are really looking through a window.  Most ocean scenes are not very 3D themselves.   It is debatable if this would be good enough for people to find it worth wearing the glasses, and of course there is the issue of dealing with only one person in the room.   You can handle 2 people in the room if you have shutter glasses, very bright screens, and 240hz or faster displays.   Handling 2 is probably enough &#8212; turn the effect off the very rare times you have guests.</p>

<p>Finally, I would even wonder if it made sense to pipe in outside air on demand.</p>

<p>4K displays can get close to eye resolution depending on the viewing distance.    Interior cabins on cruise ships are dismal places, and so if this can make them more palatable, it can be financially worthwhile.</p>

<p>Disney has also been doing this since 2010, I have learned, with a virtual porthole.  They also add animations to the video (of Disney Characters peeking in the window) which presumably the kids like.   Reports are this has caused a major boost in their inside cabin sales.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>A lot of sites, most notably search engines like Google, like to rewrite all the links on their pages.   So search for this page and instead of http://ideas.4brad.com, the link Google gives you is http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=short-string&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fideas.4brad.com%2F&amp;ei=med-string&amp;usg=huge-string&amp;bvm=short-string or similar.  (I have redacted the actual codes.)</p>

<p>What&#8217;s happening is that when you click on the link, you really go to Google.  Google records what you clicked on and other parameters related to the search so they can study just how people use their search engine, what they click on and when.   It&#8217;s a reasonable thing for them to want to study, though a potential privacy invasion.</p>

<p>Because each click goes through Google, your clicks are slowed down.  Because Google has such huge resources, and is almost never down, you usually don&#8217;t notice it, though even with Google you will see the delay on slow links, like mobile GPRS and Edge connections.  It also means you can&#8217;t easily cut and paste links from search results.</p>

<p>Other sites are not as good.  They sometimes noticeably slow own your click.   Worse, they sometimes break it.   For example, on my phone, when I click on links in LinkedIn messages, as well as Facebook ones, which are also redirected, it doesn&#8217;t work if I&#8217;m not currently logged in to those sites.   Due to some bad code, it also wants to send the link to the mobile apps of these sites, which is not what I want.  (The one for LinkedIn is particularly broken, as it doesn&#8217;t seem to know where the app is, and sends me to the Play store to install it even though it is already installed.)</p>

<p>In other words, these links break the web from time to time.  They can also interfere with spiders.  On the plus side, they can be set to protect your privacy by hiding data in the REFERER field from the target web site.   For sites that have been identified ad malicious, they can provide a warning.</p>

<p>To fix this, sites can change all their links to be javascript.  The link can be a real target, and associated onClick javascript can also send a web hit back to the server with the logging info.    </p>

<p>A better solution would be to push use of the &#8220;ping&#8221; attribute in the HTML spec, and allow links to have both an href to the target, and another URL which gets invoked when the link is clicked.  In the background, this would not slow down your click, or break it.   Browsers could also elect to block it, which the sites might not like but is good for users.
Links to malicious sites could be treated differently if that&#8217;s part of the service.    There would also be no need to fake the status window when moving the mouse over the link, as must be done with redirects.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say no to all these redirects.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I don&#8217;t know who the person or people are who, under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, created the Bitcoin system.  The creator(s) want to keep their privacy, and given the ideology behind Bitcoin, that&#8217;s not too surprising.</p>

<p>There can only be 21 million bitcoins.  It is commonly speculated that Satoshi did much of the early mining, and owns between 1 million and 1.5 million unspent bitcoins.  Today, thanks in part to a speculative bubble, bitcoins are selling for $800, and have been north of $1,000.   In other words, Satoshi has near a billion dollars worth of bitcoin.  Many feel that this is not an unreasonable thing, that a great reward should go to Satoshi for creating such a useful system.</p>

<p>For Satoshi, the problem is that it&#8217;s very difficult to spend more than a small portion of this block, possibly ever.   Bitcoin addresses are generally anonymous, but all transactions are public.   Things are a bit different for the first million bitcoins, which went only to the earliest adopters.  People know those addresses, and the ones that remain unspent are commonly believed to be Satoshi&#8217;s.    If Satoshi starts spending them in any serious volume, it will be noticed and will be news.</p>

<h2>The fate of Bitcoin</h2>

<p>Whether Bitcoin becomes a stable currency in the future or not, today few would deny it is not stable, and undergoing speculative bubbles.  Some think that because nothing backs the value of bitcoins, it will never become stable, but others are optimistic.   Regardless of that, today the value of a bitcoin is <em>fragile</em>.   The news that &#8220;Satoshi is selling his bitcoins!&#8221; would trigger panic selling, and that&#8217;s bad news in any bubble.</p>

<p><img src=/files/bitcoin.png align=right>
If Satoshi could sell, it is hard to work out exactly when the time to sell would be.  Bitcoin has several possible long term fates:</p>

<ol>
<li>It could become the world&#8217;s dominant form of money.  If it replaced all of the &#8220;M1&#8221; money supply in the world (cash and very liquid deposits) a bitcoin could be worth $1 million each!</li>
<li>It could compete with other currencies (digital and fiat) for that role.  If it captured 1% of world money supply, it might be $10,000 a coin.  While there is a limit on the number of bitcoins, the limit on the number of cryptocurrencies is unknown, and as bitcoin prices and fees increase, competition is to be expected.</li>
<li>It could be replaced by one or more successors of superior design, with some ability to exchange during a modest window, and then drifting down to minimal value</li>
<li>It could collapse entirely and quickly in the face of government opposition, competition and other factors during its bubble phase.</li>
</ol>

<p>My personal prediction is #3 &#8212; that several successor currencies will arise which fix issues with Bitcoin, with exchange possible for a while.  However, just as bitcoins had their sudden rushes and bubbles, so will this exchange rate, and as momentum moves into this currency it could move very fast.  Unlike exchanges that trade bitcoins for dollars, inter-cryptocurrency exchanges will be fast (though the settlement times of the currencies will slow things down.)   It could be even worse if the word got out that &#8220;Satoshi is trading his coins for [Foo]Coin&#8221; as that could cause complete collapse of Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Perhaps he could move some coins through randomizing services that scramble the identity association, but moving the early coins to such a system would be seen as selling them. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/satoshi-now-time-consider-donating-lots-bitcoin-charity">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

    <div class="content"><p>Recently I learned from health.net, the insurer which did my individual plan, that they were canceling it.  I&#8217;m one of those who lost his health plan with the switch to the ACA (Obamacare) plans, so I need to shop in the healthcare marketplace and will likely end up paying more.</p>

<p>What surprised me when I went to the marketplace was the math of the plans.  For those who don&#8217;t know, there are 4 main classes of plans (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) which are roughly the same for all insurers.  There is also a 5th, &#8220;Catastrophic&#8221; plan available to under-30s and hardship cases, which is cheaper and covers even less than Bronze.    Low income people get a great subsidized price in the marketplace, but people with decent incomes get no subsidy.</p>

<p>The 4 plans are designed so that for the average patient, they will end up paying 60% (Bronze), 70% (Silver), 80% (Gold) or 90% (Platinum) of health care costs, with the patient, on average, bearing the rest.   All plans come with a &#8220;Maximum out of pocket&#8221; (MOOP) that is at most $6,350 for all plans but $4,000 (or less) for the Platinum.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s some analysis based on California prices and plans.  The other states can vary a fair bit.  Insurance is much cheaper in some regions, and there are plans that use moderately different formulae.    In every state the MOOP is no more than $6,350 and the actuarial percentages are the same.</p>

<p>As you might expect, the Platinum costs a lot more than the Bronze.   But at my age, in my early 50s, I was surprised how much more.  I decided to plug in numbers for Blue Cross, which is actually slightly cheaper than many of the other plans.   I actually have little information with which to compare the companies.  This is quite odd &#8212; my health insurance is going to be by biggest annual expenditure after my mortgage.  More than my car &#8212; but there&#8217;s tons of information to help you choose a car.  (Consumer Reports does have a comparison article on the major insurance companies before the ACA for their subscribers.)</p>

<p>The Platinum plan costs $350/month extra over Bronze, $4200/year.  Almost as much as the MOOP.  So I decided to build a spreadsheet that would show me what I would end up paying on each plan in total &#8212; premiums plus my personal outlays.   Here is the sheet for me in my early 50s:</p>

<p><img src=/files/health-53.png></p>

<p>The X axis is how much your health care actually cost, ie. what your providers were paid.   The Y axis is how much you had to pay.  The green line is unity, with your payout equal to the cost, as might happen in theory if you were uninsured.  In <em>theory</em>, because in reality uninsured people pay a &#8220;list price&#8221; that is several times the cost that insurance companies negotiate.  Also in theory because those uninsured must pay a tax penalty.</p>

<p>All the plans go up at one rate until they first hit your deductibles (Bronze/Silver) and then at a slower rate until you hit your MOOP.  After the MOOP they are a flat line almost no matter what your health spending does.   The Silver plan is the most complex.  It has a $250 drug deductible and a $2000 general deductible and the usual $6,350 MOOP.  In reality, these slopes will not be smooth lines.   For example, on the silver plan if you are mostly doing doctor visits and labs, you do copays, not the deductible.  If you hit something else, like MRI scans or hospitalization, you pay out the full cost until you hit the deductible.  So each person&#8217;s slope will be different, but these slopes are meant to represent an estimate for average patients.</p>

<p>The surprising thing about this chart is that <strong>the Bronze plan is pretty clearly superior</strong>.  Only for a small region of costs does your outlay exceed the other plans, and never by much.   However, in the most likely region for most people (modest health care) or the danger zone (lots of health care) it is quite a bit cheaper.  The catastrophic plan, if you can get your hands on it over 30, is even better.  It almost never does worse than the other plans.</p>

<p>I will note that the zone where Bronze is not the winner is around the $8,400 average cost of health care in the USA.  However, what I really want to learn is the <strong>median</strong> cost, a statistic that is not readily available, or even better the median cost or distribution of costs at each age cohort.  The actuaries obviously know this, and I would like pointers to a source.</p>

<p>Premiums are tax deductible for the self-employed, as are large medical expenses for all, but the outlays above premiums can also come from a Health Savings Account (HSA) which is a special IRA-like instrument.  You put in up to around $3K each year tax-free, and can pay the costs above from it.  (You also don&#8217;t pay tax on appreciation of the account, and can draw out the money post-retirement at a decent rate.)</p>

<p>The chart suggests the Bronze plan is the clear winner unless you know you will be in the $6K to $10K zone where it&#8217;s a modest loser.  It seems to beat the Platinum all the time (at least in this simplified model) but might have minor competition from the Silver.   The Gold is essentially always worse than the Silver.</p>

<p>If we move to age 60, now the win for Bronze is very clear.  At age 60, the $5500 extra premium for Platinum almost exceeds the MOOP on the Bronze &#8212; the Bronze will always be cheaper.  This makes no sense, and seems to be a result of the fact that the MOOP remains the same no matter how old you are (and is also the same for B/S/G/Cat.)  Perhaps varying deductibles and the MOOP over time would have made more variety.</p>

<p><img src=/files/health-60.png></p>

<p>Here the Gold is clearly a loser to the Silver if you were thinking about it.  <strong>Nobody in this age group should buy the Gold plan</strong> but I doubt the sites will say that.  Platinum is almost as clearly a loss.</p>

<h2>Thinking about money every time you use health care</h2>

<p>With the choice for the older person so obvious, this opens up another question, namely one of psychology.   The rational thing to do is to buy the Bronze plan.  But with its $5,000 deductible, you will find yourself paying out of pocket for almost all your health care except in years you need major treatments and hospitalizations. <span class='read-more'><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/surprising-math-obamacare-levels-go-bronze">&nbsp;read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></span></p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I&#8217;m working on a new long article about advice to governments on how they should react to and encourage the development of robocars.</p>

<p>An interesting plan announced today has something I had not thought of:  Michigan is funding the development of <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20140114/BUSINESS06/301140133/UM-Snyder-MDOT-autos">a fake downtown to act as a test track</a> for robocar development.   The 32 acre site will be at the University of Michigan, and is expected to open soon &#8212; in time for the September ITS World Congress.</p>

<p>Part of the problem with my advice to governments is that my main recommendation is to get out of the way.  To not try too hard both to help and to regulate, because even those of us trying to build the vehicles don&#8217;t have a certain handle on the eventual form of the technology.</p>

<p>A test track is a great idea, though.  Test tracks are hugely expensive to make, entirely outside of the means of small entrepreneurs.   They immediately resolve most safety concerns for people just starting out &#8212; every team has had small runaway issues at the very start.  Once past that, they can be shared, in fact having multiple vehicles running the track can be a bonus rather than a problem.</p>

<p>Big car companies all have their own test tracks, but these are mostly real tracks, not urban streets.  Several companies have built pre-programmed robotic cars which drive in specific patterns to test ADAS systems and robocars.    The DARPA Urban Challenge was run on an fake set of urban streets on an old military base, so this idea goes back to the dawn of the modern field.   (Old military bases are popular for this &#8212; Mythbusters used a California one for their test of blind and drunk driving.)</p>

<p>This track will probably bring teams to Michigan, which is what they want.   Detroit is in trouble, and it knows it.  Robocars are going to upend the car industry.  Incumbent players are going to fall, and new players are going to rise, and that could be very bad news for Detroit.</p>

<p>My home province of Ontario is facing the same  problem, to a lesser degree.  A lot of the Ontario economy is in cars as well, and so they&#8217;ve started a <a href="http://www.ontariocanada.com/registry/showAttachment.do?postingId=14802&amp;attachmentId=22912">plan to introduce testing legislation</a>.   I don&#8217;t think this is the right plan &#8212; testing is already legal with a good supervising driver in most jurisdictions, though I have not yet examined the Ontario code.   Ontario has one big advantage over Michigan, though, in that it is also a high-tech centre.   Right now the car companies in Detroit are finding it very difficult to convince high-tech stars to come move to Detroit, in spite of being able to offer high pay and the fact that you can literally get a mansion for the price of the downpayment on a nice San Francisco condo.  Toronto doesn&#8217;t have the same problem &#8212; in fact it&#8217;s one of the most desired places to live for Canadians, and for people from all over the world.   Ontario&#8217;s combination of high-tech and big automotive might end up doing well.</p>

<p>At least in Ontario, everybody will be motivated to solve the snow problem sooner than the California companies are.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>The Olympics are coming up, and I have a request for you, NBC Sports.  It&#8217;s the 21st century, and media technologies have changed a lot.  It&#8217;s not just the old TV of the 1900s.</p>

<p><img src=/files/sochi.jpg class=leftpic></p>

<p>Every year, you broadcast the opening ceremony, which is always huge, expensive and spectacular.   But your judgment is that we need running commentary, even when music is playing or especially poignant moments are playing out.   OK, I get that, perhaps a majority of the audience wants and needs that commentary.   Another part of the audience would rather see the ceremony as is, with minimal commentary.</p>

<p>This being the 21st century, <strong>you don&#8217;t have to choose only one</strong>.   Almost every TV out there now supports both multiple audio channels &#8212; either via the SAP channel (where it still exists) or more likely through the multiple audio channels of digital TV.   In addition, they all support multiple channels of captions, too.</p>

<p>So please give us the audio without your announcers on one of the alternate audio channels.   Give us their commentary on a caption channel, so if we want to read it without interfering with the music, we can read it.</p>

<p>If you like, do a channel where the commentary is only on the left channel.  Clever viewers can then mix the commentary at whatever volume they like using the balance control.  Sure, you lose stereo, but this is much more valuable.</p>

<p>I know you might take this as an insult.  You work hard on your coverage and hire good people to do it.  And so do it &#8212; but give your viewers the choice when the live audio track is an important part of the event, as it is for the opening and closing ceremonies, medal ceremonies and a few other events.</p>

<p>Do you agree with me?  Possibly share your opinion with <a href="mailto:nbcolympicsfeedback@nbcuni.com">nbcolympicsfeedback@nbcuni.com</a>.</p>

Not small ones, but perhaps the Tesla</a></h2>    <span class="submitted">Submitted by <a href="/user/brad" title="View user profile." rel="nofollow">brad</a> on Sun, 2014-01-12 14:09.</span>
    <span class="taxonomy"><ul class="links inline"><li class="first last taxonomy_term_44"><a href="/taxonomy/term/44" rel="tag" title="Environmental issues" class="taxonomy_term_44">Going Green</a></li>
</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>An article in the LA Times suggests an idea I&#8217;ve seen frequently &#8212; <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/dec/29/business/la-fi-electric-cars-20131229">use electric car batteries to meet peak power demand on the grid</a>.  After all, you have a car, and it&#8217;s plugged in, and it has a big battery, so instead of just charging it, have it send juice back to the grid when it most needs it.</p>

<p>The reason this is attractive is that a large part of the cost of the grid is building it to handle the peak load.  Most of the capital cost is for that, and fuel costs are based on the real, variable load.   Softening the peak is very valuable to the power company &#8212; to the point that power companies give rebates and credits to people who do things that will soften that peak. </p>

<p>This is also one of the virtues of solar.  It tends to provide power during the day, which is always when the peak is.  However, solar peaks at noon, while the demand peak is the hottest part of the day, which tends to be later in the afternoon.  The big peak tends to be around 4-6pm when it&#8217;s hot, and people have started turning on things in their houses to get ready for dinner.  On the spot markets power costs the most then.</p>

<p>Contrast that with the night. Because nuclear plants and some big coal plants aren&#8217;t easy to dial back, then sometimes even produce more power than is being used, and they end up discarding the power into giant resistors.  That makes power at night cheap.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never seen it done, but there could even be merit in the idea of mounting fixed solar panels pointing west, so that they catch less power in the morning but do better in the later afternoon when the price of electricity is highest.  I presume this doesn&#8217;t happen because net metering home owners don&#8217;t get access to the &#8220;true&#8221; spot power price which would justify this.  If they are lucky they do get time-of-day metering so they sell power at a high price in the day and buy it cheap in the evening, but some don&#8217;t even get that.   The harsh reality is that most grids were not built to have a lot of generation at the edges, and power companies are pushing back on net metering and grid-ties that feed back too much power.   Indeed, for cost reasons here in California, people should size their solar systems to not quite meet needs, and buy the rest at the cheap &#8220;tier 1&#8221; price, rather than try to sell back.</p>

<p>Most solar panels are erected facing due south, tilted to the latitude which maximizes total kwh, but peaks at noon.   Actually, most are mounted on a section of the roof that is closest to south.  If you have to choose between SE and SW, it might be that SW is best, at least for the grid.
(Sadly, a number of solar panels are mounted on the front of houses, even if that points north!  People are more keen on looking good than doing good.  I hope that&#8217;s rarer than I&#8217;ve been told.)</p>

<h2>Anyway, back to the cars</h2>

<p>There are a few issues with using the batteries in the car for the peak load.</p>

<ol>
<li>The peak time is unfortunately a very popular time for driving.   People either want to drive in the late afternoon &#8212; it is called the rush hour for a reason &#8212; or they plan to drive soon and want their car&#8217;s battery to be full to meet their driving needs.   They don&#8217;t want to find their car half-empty at 6pm because it sold power to the grid.   A <a href="http://environmentalresearchweb.org/cws/article/news/51175">study of car usage patterns</a> detailed the numbers.</li>
<li>The batteries in cars are expensive.  Charging and discharging the battery uses up its lifetime.   We don&#8217;t know how long car batteries are going to last but a typical estimate is around 150,000 miles, or about 40,000 lifetime kwh.   If it&#8217;s the 22kwh pack in the LEAF (which costs $12K or so today) that&#8217;s 27 cents/kwh lifetime.  Plus the cost of the electricity that went in to be resold.   The peak price ranges from 25-30 cents/kwh in the west but hits as much as 48 cents in New York.  So it could be profitable in New York, but barely so.   Big, heavy lead batteries are more cost effective.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are some factors, though, which could change this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Battery packs will get cheaper, and their lifetimes will increase.  That will drop the cost of putting a kwh into and out of a battery.</li>
<li>Cars like the Tesla model S have huge batteries, far more than they actually need.  This, it turns out <a href="/perils-long-range-electric-car">is quite wasteful</a>, since you buy a lot of battery and rarely use it.   If you know you don&#8217;t plan a 200 mile trip, you might be tolerant that your long-range car is half-empty at 6pm, and happy to sell that excess capacity.  You already paid for the capacity, after all to give you that long-trip freedom.   You will still shorten the battery life, but you&#8217;ll be paid for that.</li>
<li>Weather forecasts are getting quite accurate, so demand can be predicted and this managed better.</li>
<li>The car can also be a backup in the event of grid power outages.   There, the 35 cent/kwh price (and loss of driving ability) are minor compared to the burden of having no power in your home.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Calling all cars!</h2>

<p>Now, as you might expect on this blog, robocars are also game changers here.  The inverters and equipment to feed power back to the grid are expensive, so most people won&#8217;t have them.  But if the robocars have a means to plug in, they can bring the power to where it&#8217;s needed.   A power company, seeing a brownout coming, could send out an alert on the net.  &#8220;Calling all cars&#8221; &#8212; if you have spare capacity, we&#8217;ll buy it at the following rate.  Please drive to the nearest two-way intertie and plug in soon.    While ideally some sort of automatic connection would be possible, this could even be a charging lot with human staff who plug in the cars as they arrive and unplug them when they have to leave.</p>

<p>Such charging lots might well exist for cars that need charges at night or other non-peak times.  Due to cost, cars will strongly wish to avoid charging at peak cost times.   This puts them to use then.    Inductive charging also works (at a loss of about 10%) and robotic plug-in is actually quite doable &#8212; there are already robotic gasoline filling stations out there.   A robocar charging lot could be dense-pack, valet style, so not take a lot of land.  But it would take megawatts &#8212; but that&#8217;s OK.  The robots don&#8217;t care how convenient it is, so put it next to the transformer station.</p>

<p>As the Navia shows, you can be safe if you&#8217;re slow.   And several car company &#8220;traffic jam assist&#8221; products say the same thing.   On the other end, we see demos taking place at highway speeds.   But what about the middle range &#8212; decent speeds on urban streets?</p>

<p>Turns out that&#8217;s one of the harder problems, and so there is a &#8220;valley&#8221; in the chart which makes safe operation harder in that zone.</p>
