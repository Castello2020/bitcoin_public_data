    <div class="content"><p>I have written a few times before about <a href="/tags/memory">versed, the memory drug</a> and the ethical and metaphysical questions that surround it.  I was pointed today to a <a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1671492,00.html">story from Time about propofol</a>, which like the Men in Black neuralizer pen, can erase the last few minutes of your memory from before you are injected with it.   This is different from Versed, which stops you from recording memories <em>after</em> you take it.</p>

<p>Both raise interesting questions about unethical use.  Propofol knocks you out, so it&#8217;s perhaps of only limited use in interrogation, but I wonder whether more specific drugs might exist in secret (or come along with time) to just zap the memory.  (I would have to learn more about how it acts to consider if that&#8217;s possible.)</p>

<p>Both bring up thoughts of the difference between our firmware and our RAM.   Our real-time thoughts and very short term memories seem to exist in a very ephemeral form, perhaps even as electrical signals.  Similar to RAM &#8212; turn off the computer and the RAM is erased, but the hard disk is fine.    People who flatline or go through serious trauma often wake up with no memory of the accident itself, because they lost this RAM.   They were &#8220;rebooted&#8221; from more permanent encodings of their mind and personality &#8212; wirings of neurons or glia etc.  How often does this reboot occur?  We typically don&#8217;t recall the act of falling asleep, or even events or words from just before falling asleep, though the amnesia isn&#8217;t nearly so long as that of people who flatline.</p>

<p>These drugs most trigger something similar to this reboot.  While under Versed, I had conversations.   I have no recollection of after the drug was injected, however.  It is as if there was a version of me which became a &#8220;fork.&#8221;  What he did and said was destined to vanish, my brain rebooting to the state before the drug.    Had this other me been aware of it,   I might have thought that this instance of me was doomed to a sort of death.   How would you feel if you knew that what you did today would be erased, and tomorrow your body &#8212; not the you of the moment &#8212; would wake up with the same memories and personality as you woke up with earlier today?   Of course many SF writers have considered this as well as some philosophers.   It&#8217;s just interesting to see drugs making the question more real than it has been before.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>This week I participated in <a href="http://www.quicktopic.com/38/H/dN5wx26Mw87">this thread</a> on <a href="http://members.aol.com/kiekeben/newcomb.html">Newcomb&#8217;s Paraodox</a> which was noted on BoingBoing.</p>

<p>The paradox:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A highly superior being from another part of the galaxy presents you with two boxes, one open and one closed. In the open box there is a thousand-dollar bill. In the closed box there is either one million dollars or there is nothing. You are to choose between taking both boxes or taking the closed box only. But there&#8217;s a catch.</p>
  
  <p>The being claims that he is able to predict what any human being will decide to do. If he predicted you would take only the closed box, then he placed a million dollars in it. But if he predicted you would take both boxes, he left the closed box empty. Furthermore, he has run this experiment with 999 people before, and has been right every time.</p>
  
  <p>What do you do? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A short version of my answer:  The parodox confuses people because it stipulates you are a highly predictable being to the alien, then asks you to make a choice.  But in fact you don&#8217;t make a choice, you are a choice.  Your choice derives from who you are, not the logic you go through before the alien.  The alien&#8217;s power dictates you already either are or aren&#8217;t the sort of person who picks one box or two, and in fact the alien is the one who made the choice based on that &#8212; you just imagine you could do differently than predicted.</p>

<p>Those who argue that since the money is already in the boxes, you should always take both miss the point of the paradox.  That view is logically correct, but those who hold that view will not become millionaires, and this was set by the fact they hold the view.  It isn&#8217;t that there&#8217;s no way the contents of the boxes can change because of your choice, it&#8217;s that there isn&#8217;t a million there if you&#8217;re going to think that way.</p>

<p>Of course people don&#8217;t like that premise of predictability and thus, as you will see in the thread, get very involved in the problem.</p>

<p>In thinking about this, it came to me that the alien is not so hypothetical.  As you may know from reading this blog, I was once administered Versed, a sedative that also blocks your ability to form long term memories.  I remember the injection, but not the things I said and did afterwards.</p>

<p>In my experiment we recruit subjects to test the paradox.  They come in and an IV drip is installed, though they are not told about Versed.   (Some people are not completely affected by Versed but assume our subjects are.)  We ask subjects to give a deliberated answer, not to just try to be random, flip a coin or whatever.</p>

<p>So we administer the drug and present the problem, and see what you do.  The boxes are both empty &#8212; you won&#8217;t remember that we cheated you.   We do it a few times if necessary to see how consistent you are.  I expect that most people would be highly consistent, but I think it would be a very interesting thing to research!  If a few are not consistent, I suspect they may be deliberately being random, but again it would be interesting to find out why.</p>

<p>We videotape the final session, where there is money in the boxes.  (Probably not a million, we can&#8217;t quite afford that.)   Hypothetically, it would be even better to find another drug that has the same sedative effects of Versed so you can&#8217;t tell it apart and don&#8217;t reason differently under it, but which allows you to remember the final session &#8212; the one where, I suspect, we almost invariably get it right.</p>

<p>Each time you do it, however, you think you&#8217;re doing it for the first time.   However, at first you probably (and correctly) won&#8217;t want to believe in our amazing predictive powers.  There is no such alien, after all.  That&#8217;s where it becomes important to videotape the last session or even better, have a way to let you remember it.  Then we can have auditors you trust completely audit the experimenter&#8217;s remarkable accuracy (on the final round.)  We don&#8217;t really have to lie to the auditors, they can know how we do it.  We just need a way for them to swear truthfully that on the final round, we are very, very accurate, without conveying to the subject that there are early, unremembered rounds where we are not accurate.   Alas, we can&#8217;t do that for the initial subjects &#8212; another reason we can&#8217;t put a million in.</p>

<p>Still, I suspect that most people would be fairly predictable and that many would find this extremely disturbing.  We don&#8217;t like determinism in any form.   Certainly there are many choices that we imagine as choices but which are very predictable.  Unless you are bi, you might imagine you are choosing the sex of your sexual partners &#8212; that you could, if it were important, choose differently &#8212;  but in fact you always choose the same.</p>

<p>What I think is that having your choices be inherent in your makeup is not necessarily a contradiction to the concept of free will.   You have a will, and you are free to exercise it, but in many cases that will is more a statement about who you are than what you&#8217;re thinking at the time.  The will was exercised in the past, in making you the sort of mind you are.  It&#8217;s still your will, your choices.   In the same way I think that entirely deterministic computers can also make choices and have free will.  Yes, their choices are entirely the result of their makeup.  But if they rate being an &#8220;actor&#8221; then the choices are theirs, even if the makeup&#8217;s initial conditions came from a creator.   We are created by our parents and environment (and some think by a deity) but that&#8217;s just the initial conditions.  Quickly we become something unto ourselves, even if there is only one way we could have done that.  We are not un-free, we just are what we are.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I&#8217;ve been away because I had to have my gall bladder removed, thanks to a gallstone the size of a small moon.  Unfortunately they had to do it &#8220;old school&#8221; rather than laproscopically, which means the recovery is so much more fun.</p>

<p>The immersion into the hospitalization system (first time in the US) will generate some blog posts, but today let me add thoughts on one element that surprised me.    Almost exactly a year ago, I wrote <a href="/archives/000100.html">speculating on the use of Versed for torture</a>.  I still wonder about that, and now I have a direct experience.  Though I was not told about it, the anesthesiologist included one of the amnesia-inducing drugs into the pre-op &#8220;calm you down&#8221; sedation coctail.  I remember him doing that injection, and getting a bit flushed from that, but it&#8217;s blank after that.  No memory of any discussion after, of being wheeled to the operating room and receiving the actual injection to make me unconscious for the procedure.   Those events never laid down.</p>

<p>(When I asked the surgeon about not being told I would receive this drug, she at least had a sense of humour and said, &#8220;How do you know you weren&#8217;t told?&#8221;   Indeed, I don&#8217;t know that.   And to pile on the irony, I brought the movie &#8220;Momento&#8221; to the hospital, and watched it during my recovery.)</p>

<p>It is disturbing to have a memory deliberately erased.  We&#8217;ve all lost memories, found periods in which we can&#8217;t recollect anything about particular event or stretch, but this is different.</p>

<p>Still, it got me wondering about bizarre uses to which this might be put.  I already speculated on torture and sinister uses.  And we know about the use for date-rape which is highly disturbing.   I wondered about its application to deep dark secrets.</p>

<p>The scenario is this.  You have a couple.   One or both of them volunteer for an amnesia inducing drug.   Then, you pour out  your heart, with all the deep dark secrets you&#8217;ve been hiding, kinky fantasies you&#8217;ve been begging for, and wait for the reaction.    If your own memory is not going to store, you make notes on the reactions.    When you&#8217;re done, you know what secrets you can tell, and which would be relationship-destroying or particularly hurtful.    Of course, the tested party needs to cooperate, and not say, &#8220;Oh, I had better pretend to not be bothered by that so that this horrible thing does not become lost to me&#8221; and and better not be a good actor.   Or couples who are in the &#8220;both want to break up but are not admitting it for the sake of the other one&#8221; state could discover it and talk it out &#8212; though one could also make a computer program to solve that problem.</p>

<p>To be tricky, my companion in the pre-op room could have decided to tell me things there without my being aware I had received the drug &#8212; it is quite common now in sedation coctails &#8212; in which case I would not have thought to fake my reactions.     Technically, though I trust her, I can not be sure via my own memory that she did not.</p>

<p>These drugs are currently Schedule IV, so they don&#8217;t see such non-medical use, but one can imagine other bizarre uses.  For example, confidential job interviews.   Consider applying for a job to work on a confidential project at a company.  They might give you an NDA, or they might give you Versed and tell you the whole deal, knowing you won&#8217;t be talking about it.  Or truly &#8220;embargoed&#8221; releases to the media, or trials of secret products before a focus group.   And these aren&#8217;t as scary as the suggestions of use in torture or policework I already made.    Certainly when it comes to any official use, we need a law requiring that any administration of such drugs be paired with complete videotaping of the entire episode and secure storage and authentication of the videotape &#8212; if we allow such use at all.   (Unfortunately we are probably going to see use whether we permit it or not.)</p>

<p>There could be medical uses.  For example, say you have the cliche&#8217;d incurable, non-communicable fatal disease and some number of months to live.  You could be told, and given the choice about when you should be told in a way you&#8217;ll remember it.   It&#8217;s like creating test versions of yourself to try new and dangerous ideas and report back if the real you should absorb them.</p>

<p>Now I should note that there are barriers to the ideas I worry about above.  The drugs are not 100%.  You can&#8217;t be sure they will block the long term storage of memory.   And they also sedate you, put you in a calmer, non-natural mental state so they might not really be too useful in job interviews and other circumstances.   (Even for torture, they might make you more able to tolerate the non-damaging torture they would want to do to you, just as they help you tolerate surgical squicks.)</p>

<p>But the drugs are going to get better, if they haven&#8217;t already in secret labs.  There are documents of experimentation with amnesiac drugs in intelligence contexts back to Viet Nam.  Who knows what the black labs have discovered?   We are going to have to get used to a world where memory is more fungible, and we call can be temporarily the character from Momento.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Here&#8217;s my most disturbing idea yet.  There are drugs which erase memory (or rather block the formation of memories while they are used.)  It seems disturbingly probable to me that these might be being used for torture.  Espcially considering the light of new memos giving the US the green light for torture.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t know of this class of drugs, you may have heard of &#8220;<a href=http://earthops.org/rohypnol.html>Roofies</a>&#8221; the &#8220;date rape&#8221; drug which have been used to both make a victim pliable and also to make her forget the rape.  There are stronger drugs, such as Versed, which are used in surgery.</p>

<p>The surgical use is quite disturbing.  They want to perform a procedure on you while you will be somewhat conscious, but it is painful and upsetting and will leave mental scars &#8212; so they put you through the pain but block you from remembering it.</p>

<p>However, it must be obvious to those wishing to do torture that this could be applied here too.  Apply the drug, then apply torture which leaves few permanent marks.  The victim would awaken unaware they had been tortured or what they had confessed to.  They could not testify later about their torture, they would not even know to.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard not to think that this would be a more &#8220;humane&#8221; form of torture, in the same way the surgical use of the drugs is humane.  After all, you just want the information, why leave the victim with psychic scars, as there always are from torture.   This is frightening because it might make the public much more accepting of torture.   And on top of that, how will we ever find out if torture is going on?  Only from the torturers themselves.</p>

<p>This is just the start of a trend.  Tools like &#8220;brain fingerprinting&#8221; already exist which cause no pain but examine your brain to find out if you remember something you are being shown, or if it&#8217;s the first time you are seeing it.  People have already suggested this is so benign as to be suitable for airport screening!</p>

<p>I predict we&#8217;ll see newer and &#8220;better&#8221; torture and interrogation techniques in the near future.  Better brain scans.  Polygraphs that actually work.  More powerful drugs that affect not just memory but compliance.   Perhaps eventually nanomachines that reach in and target brain centers to create compliance.</p>

<p>Some of these may already exist &#8212; though I think not too many or our intelligence communities would be doing a better job on terrorism than they are.</p>

<p>But they will exist.  How will we as a society cope with them?  We already seem willing to forget about the prohibitions on torture in the constitution and international law.  We&#8217;ll pretend the prohibitions don&#8217;t even exist for these new forms.</p>

<p>The only way to avoid them will be to work soon for strong laws and eventually an explicit constitutional amendment protecting the right of privacy in our thoughts.  And that will be a long time coming.</p>

<p>Update: More stories of Versed and other memory drugs in my new <a href="/tags/memory">memory tag</a>.</p>
