<p><b>The Impeachable Offenses of Barack Hussein Obama Part 5</b>
<br>by Terence James Mason
<br><font size="-1">The time has come, the Walrus said, to speak of many things... My mundane 
life has intervened with updating (and consolidating) this series as I had originally hoped 
to, but not only has that situation changed a bit of late, but the situation on the national 
and world stage is such as to demand commentary. The numbering below continues from the 
original series. I will note that other authors have now published whole books on the subject 
of impeachable offenses.

<p><b><i>The Golden Mean: Libertarian Politics, Conservative Values</i> By Nelson Hultberg</b>
<br>Reviewed by L.Neil Smith
<br><font size="-1">For those who may have come in late, the Zero Aggression Principle 
holds that nobody has a right, under any circumstances, to initiate physical force 
against another human being for any reason. Nor is it morally acceptable to advocate 
or delegate the initiation of physical force. This may be the single most important 
moral, ethical, or political idea that any human being has ever had. Once expressed, 
it represents the end of kings and commissars, premiers and presidents. It takes us, 
in a gigantic quantum leap, from slavery and serfdom to freestanding independence.

<p><b>"What are we going to do about it?"</b>
<br>by Sean N. Gruber
<br><font size="-1">"You're all just a bunch of fucking slaves!!! And what are you gonna 
do about it? What are you gonna do about it?!!!"&mdash;Jim Morrison If it wasn't for the cops 
what would Obama's&mdash;or Bush's or whoever the current, flavor- of- the- week tyrant, that 
happens to have the "government" and it's guns in their possession-- decree's matter? I 
seriously doubt Hillary Clinton or John McCain are going to take to the street to enforce 
"laws" that tell me I can't own guns or smoke some dope (although Rumsfeld and Cheney might 
if they couldn't find some moron with an overpowering amount of testosterone and an 
under-powering amount of education, intelligence and plain old common sense.) The police are 
the enforcers. I contend that in fact THEY are the literal government. (It's funny to me that 
so many of the same people who are the staunchest advocates of electing "good sheriffs" are 
the most critical of my previous contention.)

<p><b><i>Castigo Cay</i> by Matthew Bracken: A Review</b>
<br>by Sean Gangol
<br><font size="-1"><i><b>Contains Spoilers</b></i> I admit that I am somewhat late with 
this review. I had originally planned to publish this review about a year ago, but I got 
caught up with other things, which put me behind on my writing. Before I begin, I want 
to point out that I have been a longtime fan of Matthew Bracken, ever since he published 
his first book <i>Enemies Foreign and Domestic</i>. In his most recent book, <i>Castigo 
Cay</i>, the plot revolves around an ex-Marine Corps sniper named Dan Kilmer who sails 
from port to port in a boat he calls "The Rebel Yell" (possibly the coolest boat name 
ever). He does this to stay free from any form of government interference in his life.

<p><b><i>The Silver Circle</i></b>
<br>Reviewed by L. Neil Smith
<br><font size="-1">I know people who make movies. When I was in high school, if 
anyone had told me that someday I would be able to write that, I would have been 
skeptical, to say the least. And if anyone had told me, in the heyday of Walter 
Cronkite, Chet Huntley, and David Brinkley (I don't recall who was on ABC) that
the movies these movie-makers made would be radically libertarian, even propertarian 
anarchist in character, I would have called him a liar. But it turns out I am not 
a liar&mdash;I've always believed it's too much work&mdash;and such movie-makers, and 
their movies, do exist.

<p><b>Clinton Vs Christie / Alien Vs Predator : Whoever Wins We Loose</b>
<br>by Jeff Fullerton
<br><font size="-1">Last issue I wrote a letter to the editor pertaining to the pending 
elections that happened this week. Need to apologize for not vetting the so called 
"Libertarian" candidate in the VA race a little better. Day before the election on my 
drive to work, Glenn Beck was leading with a story that suggested he might not be so 
genuine. And Ron Paul also saying the same. More I thought about it; I remembered a 
guy on the PA Libernet back in the early 2000s who thought that land ought to be taxed 
instead of buildings and other improvements on the grounds that taxation not discourage 
people from improving property. Yet on the flip side he believed in a land tax because 
the Earth is common to all people and appropriation of land for private use was a 
withdraw of a limited resource from a common store. That sounded a little too 
collectivist for me and I think he may have been&mdash;I've heard of something called 
an "Eco-libertarian".

<p><b>Getting Rich Being Free</b>
<br>by A.X. Perez
<br><font size="-1">Just a thought: Disagreements between supporters and opponents of
liberty create business opportunities. For example, Starbucks doesn't want to alienate 
either its pro or antigun customers.This is appropriate, their goal is to sell coffee 
and food as thisearns them a profit. However, they have the right to tell people,
"Leave us out of your fight." So why don't we open explicitly pro gun coffee shops, 
bar and grills, restaurants, and so on?

<p><b>A FEW (HUNDRED) WORDS FROM THE PUBLISHER</b>

<p>Colorado is about to recall its third victim-disarmer in the 
state Senate. The Obammunists are fighting tooth and nail&mdash;not 
to overlook checks from Michael Bloomberg&mdash;to protect 
the precious backside of one of the worst collectivist 
douchebags ever take up space and waste oxygen.

<p>Evie Hudak would decide for your wife, your daughter, your 
mother, or your neice what works to defend herself from 
robbery and rape and what doesn't. The woman has no 
credentials in this field and knows nothing about it. But 
apparently, the corrupt and well-singed spirits of Howard 
Metzenbaum, Mario Biaggi, and Thomas Dodd came down to her
on a flaming pie and filled her in. So Colorado now has 
New York's gun laws.

<p>For the time being.

<p>There's far more at stake here than most observers 
understand. If Hudak is replaced by a Republican&mdash;not all 
Grand Old Partiers are alike; state leadership has opposed 
these recalls from the beginning and sees them strictly as 
incited by the Tea Party movement, a loose cannon they 
detest&mdash;the Democrats no longer hold the Colorado Senate, 
which means the recent orgy of gun-owner hatred is over. It
will also give freedom-fighters in other states something 
to rally around, and might even precipitate the roll-back 
of a century of socialism.

<p>The Dems are frightened spitless, witless, and shitless. 
They can see an end to liberalism, progressivism, and 
political correctness coming. Sometimes the light at the 
end of the tunnel is a freight train.

<p>Toot, toot!

<p>Democratic governor John Hickenlooper may veto the repeal 
the first time, if he's as stupid as his face looks and 
his name sounds. But he knows it will be the end of his 
political aspirations, which are all aimed at Washington, 
and he's been lying exceedingly low of late. He once opined
loudly that gun control doesn't work, then he turned his 
coat, and now he's rummaging through the closet all over
again.

<p>For more information and a chance to help (recall 
petitioning will be over by the time you read this, but if 
it's been successful then there will be an entire election 
campaign to be fought), go to www.recallhudak.com.

<p><center>* * * * * *</center>

<p>We see in the news that America's last lead refinery, 
capable of producing pure metal from raw ore, has shut 
down, and that, from now on, lead will have to come from 
other countries at enormously elevated prices.

<p>This means that the price of bullets, already artificially 
high thanks to the government's illegal manipulation of the
market, will skyrocket. How does .45 ACP sound to you, at 
over five dollars a round?

<p>What happened is that the EPA pollution standards were 
suddenly, and almost inexplicably, tightened <i>ten-fold</i> so 
that no company could go on producing the metal economically.
We say "almost inexplicably" because we know perfectly well 
what's going on, and so do you. This is yet another sneak-
attack by the unspeakable Obama Administration on the 
unalienable individual, civil, Constitutional, and human 
right of every man, woman, and responsible child to obtain,
own, and carry, openly or concealed, any weapon&mdash;rifle, 
shotgun, handgun, machinegun, <i>anything</i>&mdash;any time, any 
place, without asking anyone's permission.

<p>We are to be deprived, by any means, at any cost, of the 
machines and materials we need to prevent the 
eugenic/ecofascist massacre the administration and its UN
accomplices are planning for nine tenths of humanity.

<p>With this act, the EPA has declared war on every American.
It cannot be allowed to stand. This time it has to cost 
them something, and I suggest it be the EPA itself. It 
must be abolished, and every individual ever inconvenienced
by it must be indemnified, from the EPA budget, as well as 
from the pockets, paychecks, and pensions of every employee.

<p>Write your congressthing today. Remember to include mention
of the Colorado recall crusades. Make Ted and Mike and Rand&mdash;and 
I think maybe Sarah, too&mdash;talk about this loudly 
and in public until it happens.

<p>It's that or submit.

<p>No other choice.

<p><center>* * * * * *</center>

<p>You may have noticed that the very apex of butt-stupid 
bigotry has recently been achieved by Joseph Farah, the 
drooling moron who owns and operates World Net Daily, 
occasionally, a fine alternative opinion website.

<p>Suicidally bad timing, too. Just as the general freedom 
movement has climbed back out of the grave Obammunism put
it in, the country teeters on a razor-edge between freedom
and perpetual slavery, and we appear to have socialism on 
the run for the first time in a century, this strategic 
and tactical fumblewit, to judge from recent mailings,
has decided to alienate atheists, who make up a major 
fraction of his libertarian fellow travelers&mdash;and a 
surprising number of enlightened conservatives.

<p>Brilliant.

<p>Not.

<p>Second prize goes to Farah's best writer, Dr. Jerome Corsi,
a highly distinguished and articulate individual, I have 
admirded greatly, and who has done many great things, who,
for some reason that defies rationality, decided this week
to announce that there can be no such thing as recreational
sex. Sex is for reproduction only, Jerry informs us, not 
for fun. That's as opposed to Ayn Rand, who regarded sex 
as mankind's reward to itself for a life properly and 
productively lived. It's a life-saver when things aren't 
going very smoothly, as well.

<p>The word&mdash;I didn't read that far&mdash;is that he also 
provided his audience with a notice that one and only 
one position is acceptable in the jaundiced eyes of 
whatever fairies he sees at the bottom of his garden.

<p>Dr. Corsi, we reject your extremely sad and silly 
analysis, if you'll pardon the pun, which has told us 
a whole lot more about you than about sex. Much more, 
in fact, than any of us ever wanted to know.

<p><center>* * * * * *</center>

<p>Finally, it makes me very happy to tell all my readers
that I have been given an Honorary Life Membership in 
Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership. JPFO,
you see, is in the Holocaust prevention business.

<p>It's hard to convey, adequately, what this honor means
to me, certainly more than any literary award I've ever
won. It's more on the scale of having achieved the rank
of Eagle in the Boy Scouts of America.

<p>Thank you, my friends, comrades-in-arms, and so-far-unidicted co-conspirators.

<p>You know who you are: http://www.JPFO.org.

<p><b>BACK TO THE EDITOR HERE:</b>

<p>Sorry for the missing issue last week. I spent 6 days sleeping on a 
sofa in a hospital room while the medical people tried to fix my
wife. At first it seemed like a bad kidney/bladder infection, but
then things got more complicated and it turned out to be gallbladder
problems. Rotten Gallbladder Syndrome or something. So, after 5 days 
of studying the problem, out came her gallbladder, and home she went 
the very next day. And is continuing to get better and better. Me, 
I'm pretty worn out! I also lost 10-pounds in the last week. 
Stress is bad, nnnkay?
