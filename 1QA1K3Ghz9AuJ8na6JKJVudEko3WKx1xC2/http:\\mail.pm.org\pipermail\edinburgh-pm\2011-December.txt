Hey all,

I've just made my first-ever upload to the CPAN (woo! yeah!) in the
form of a bugfix release for List::Priority. You can see it at

https://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/authors/id/M/MG/MGOULD/List-Priority-0.03rc1.tar.gz

Now, I realise belatedly that I screwed up, and that developer
releases are meant to contain underscores rather than "rc". Will I get
feedback from cpantesters anyway, or should I re-upload?

I'm afraid I won't be able to make it to Ed.pm this month, as I'll be
down south with the family. However, I should be back in time for
Heretics on the 29th.

Miles

It looks like everything went OK, because this is now the first hit
for List::Priority on search.cpan.org:

search.cpan.org/~mgould/List-Priority-0.03rc1/Priority.pm

Accordingly, I've closed the "shift does the same thing as pop!" bug
that led me to fork the module in the first place.

Anyway, now that I've verified that the upload process works, I'd like
to ask for some more help on design. My current roadmap looks like
this:

v0.03

- basically, what's there now: the code now does what the
documentation says it does, which is all that's really required in a
module which has apparently been sitting around largely unloved for
nine years.
- rewrite some of the docs to (a) be less ugly, (b) be more
grammatical, (c) make the useful options{SIZE} feature more apparent.
- MOAR TESTS

v0.04

- replace the current horrible "return an error string when given the
wrong number of arguments" design with calls to croak(). (I'm thinking
an API-breaking change deserves to be separated from a bugfix
release).
- give some guidance in the docs as to what, if any, reason there is
to use this module over the other eleventy bajillion priority queues
on CPAN.

Questions:

1. Does this sound sane?
2. There's the potential for confusion between the recently-added
size() method (number of elements currently in the list) and
options{SIZE} (*maximum* number of elements the list will hold).
Should I rename one? What to?
3. What would you suggest doing in the other cases where functions
return error strings, namely "you tried to add an element to a list
that's already full of higher-priority things" and "you tried to add
something that's already in the list, and we don't support that for
reasons best known to the original author". croak()ing seems excessive
in this situation, but returning error strings doesn't seem very
sensible either.

I'd like to maintain the current low-dependency nature of the module,
if possible.

TIA,
Miles

It's also on Metacpan, although you get the 0.02 version by default:

https://metacpan.org/release/MGOULD/List-Priority-0.03rc1

I think that's the expected result for a dev release (and it looks
like *something* is treating "0.03rc1" as a dev-release version).

If you wanted to do any whitespace cleanups (convert from DOS format
to Unix, delete line-final spaces, adjust indentation, etc), this
would probably be a reasonable place to do them.

I suggest also looking at Makefile.PL.  The current version claims
that the author is one A. U. Thor <a.u.thor at a.galaxy.far.away>, which
seems moderately unlikely.  It also fails to declare your new code's
implicit test-time dependency on Test::More 0.88 (which is the first
version to provide done_testing()).  The simple way to do that is to
add it to PREREQ_PM:

    WriteMakefile(
        ?
        PREREQ_PM => {
            'Test::More' => 0.88,
        },
        ?
    );

Both of these sound very useful.

> 1. Does this sound sane?

Yes, with one caveat.  Given the existence of 0.03rc1, I'm not
completely sure whether 0.03 would be considered older or newer than
it.  One could in theory find out, but if I were in your situation,
I'd probably just call my next release 0.04 and be done with it ?
rather easier.

Also, the "return an error string" thing strikes me as something that
noone could possibly be relying on, and it's clearly not a good
design.  If you chose to do a single release with both sets of changes
you describe, I don't think that would be unreasonable.

Hmm, that's annoying ? I think the natural names are `size` for the
new method, and `capacity` for the constructor option; but adopting
that convention means that the thing to be renamed is the one that's
been around longest.  One possible approach to dealing with that is to
document a `capacity` option, and use that name in the `insert`
method, but support a `SIZE` option on construction so old callers
don't break.  Concretely, the constructor would look something like
this:

    sub new {
        my ($class, %options) = @_;
        $options{capacity} = delete $options{SIZE}
            if exists $options{SIZE} && !exists $options{capacity};
        return bless { size => 0, options => \%options }, $class;
    }

I'd say the options are:

- remove the limitations that cause those to be error conditions,
where reasonable
- use croak(); this doesn't add a dependency because Carp has been in
core since 5.000
- use die instead of croak()

For me, that's the order of preference (best first).

I'd have suspected it'll screw up some check or assumption somewhere, but that
PAUSE should email you to says so...

However, as you say, there it is, on CPAN.  I'm a bit surprised.

On the other hand, I expect the version will break various other things
downstream in undefined ways, however, not least dependency checking in modules
using yours.

Your plan looks sane, btw.  Although your API-breaking release should bump the
major version number shouldn't it?

Returning integer ids instead of strings, with the integers being mapped to a
more people-friendly string via a function might be saner, unless you want 'true
is success' semantics, in which case the ice gets thinner.    Croaking is more
normal and may be a better idea - although Perl's default exceptions and the the
existence of a gazillion alternatives are one of my least favourite parts of it.

I might suggest using some sort of release helper.  Module::Release is what I
currently use, because it's simple to use, however I have been attempting to fix
it so that it correctly parses PBP-recommended three digit versions.  (Currently
it assumes traditional Perl integer versions and does the Wrong Thing if they
aren't - certainly yours would fail to parse.)

The cool kids seem to use Dist::Zilla, which looks interesting, although expect
to install the kitchen sink and one or two large herbivores first.  local::lib
(and App::PerlLocalEnv/cpaninus) will probably help out if you decide to go
there - there's a gazillion plug-ins and it seems to be one of those fast-moving
targets distros can't keep up with.

Good spot! Should I change that to be my name or the original
author's? He's still listed as a co-maintainer, but apparently hasn't
touched Perl for some years.

"Not added because it's a dup" feels like something that shouldn't be
an error at all, but "not added because capacity() has been exceeded
and we're already full of higher-priority stuff" feels like correct
behaviour that you might want to know about as a caller. So I think
the Right Thing is to remove the restriction on duplicates and return
0 on "insert failed because you're over capacity".

I have no idea how hard it will be to remove the restriction on duplicates :-)

Good question.  I've stuck with the original author's name when I've
been in that situation, but I don't know whether that's expected
practice.  Nor, for that matter, whether it makes any difference if
the original author no longer does any Perl.

That sounds reasonable to me, on the face of it.  One question,
though: might callers *ever* want to know about the detail of which
inserts are (or would be) ignored?  If so, perhaps a `contains` method
would be a useful addition; die-on-duplicate-insert behaviour can then
be implemented by callers.

My naive reaction (without having thought much about how
List::Priority might be used) is to disagree: I'd want an exception if
`$container->insert($thing)` didn't leave $container with a $thing,
regardless of the sort of container.  Perhaps extend the API with a
`maybe_insert` method, which inserts only if there's enough spare
capacity?  Though I'm aware this would be another API change, so you
might decide to favour API stability even if you agree with me.

What are the use cases for the capacity-limit feature?

> I have no idea how hard it will be to remove the restriction on duplicates :-)

Now that I've actually looked at the code in more than the most
superficial way, I think I can tell you that it's trivial ? it's the
chunk of code starting here:

https://github.com/pozorvlak/List-Priority/blob/ade2a6b1d8c620d4bc9bc69de0859b43a7d1db06/Priority.pm#L41

I'm afraid it's not looking likely that I can make it tomorrow, and
I'm not sure about heretics next week either.  But if there are other
people getting together, I'll see if I can at least pop in briefly.

There are *checks* precisely zero modules on CPAN which depend on
List::Priority right now. Wow. Everyone seems to use POE::Queue::Array
(https://metacpan.org/module/POE::Queue::Array) instead. Which does
some things that List::Priority doesn't, but doesn't do some things
that List::Priority does - including the features that I chose L::P
for for my aiclass program :-)

> What are the use cases for the capacity-limit feature?

Here's mine: I was exploring a 19!-point space (about 10^17 points)
using A* tree-search. I was using a priority queue to store my
"frontier", ie the next points to explore, in order of how promising
they looked. But the frontier grew very quickly to the point where I
started to thrash my hard drive, causing Slowness, and eventually it
grew to the point where the OOM killer killed my program at 3am. So I
limited the capacity of the frontier to 1000, which was small enough
to keep the whole thing in RAM and make it go nice and fast. And I
didn't care too much about low-scoring points anyway.

Yes - I just wonder why the hell he put it in there! It seems a very
strange restriction to add. I'll knock it out and see how many tests
fail.

[Oh yes - we have tests now. Yay!]

Hi Guys,

I will not be able to make it.  I am a bit socialed out at the moment
and I think I need a night to recuperate.  However, I should be around
for Heretics on the 29th.

Brethren and sistren of the True Faith!

Tonight is the sacred Last Thursday of the Month! Therefore we must
gather, in defiance of the Craneite oppressors, to make our libation
to the Holy Camel, and to pay homage to the visiting scholar
O'Sfameron, from the fabled land of Li Ve R'Pool.

Said ceremony shall be held in Cloisters (appropriately enough), from
7pm onwards, though please do not hesitate to turn up early. I myself
will probably be late, owing to buses and Tesco deliveries and things.
Should I attempt to book a table? Is that even possible?

Until tonight!

Miles

Not at the Cumberland, but some people will be at Cloisters near
Tollcross from about 7pm.  Address and map here:
