I propose to close this poll next Friday (5th Aug).  Thanks to those who've
voted already.

    http://www.doodle.com/pxndpwwzqaqnfhwx

There are two parts: which location & when.  Vote for as many as suit.

The current location winners are:

    Meadows (5 votes)

    Carlton Hill (4 votes)

And in terms of "when", replacing the regularly monthly (august 25th) meeting
seems to be the clear fav.

Hi everyone,

Sam "Fine Structure" Hughes has put up a page called "Learn Perl in
about 2 hours 30 minutes" at http://qntm.org/perl. It's better than
most online Perl tutorials, but could still IMHO be greatly improved.
I've added my comments, under my usual 'net handle: anything I've
missed or got wrong?

Of course, I should probably just point him (and, more importantly,
his readers) at Dave's LPW talk
(http://www.slideshare.net/davorg/lpw-begin). But if people are going
to write Perl tutorials we should probably help them to write accurate
and useful ones.

Thanks to all who voted!

The overwhelming winners (sorry Wim!) being:

    Where: Meadows

    When: Replacing regular August meeting (Thur 25th Aug).

Anyone care to suggest a good patch of lawn to meet?

Also, anyone know what's going on around George Sq this year?  It's close-ish,
and it often has "watering facilities" during silly season, which would suggest
meeting somewhere north west of the tennis courts perhaps?

This assuming it's not piddling with rain ...

... Cloisters as the "rainy day pub" alternative?

ps. the day after, Friday 26th August, there is (the free to attend)

    http://www.dynamiclanguages.co.uk/dlc2011/

Might I suggest you alert as many of your techie friends, ESPECIALLY those
using Ruby, Python, JavaScript, PHP, VBScript, Objective-C or any of the other
many dynamic languages we all know and love.  Anyone who codes is welcome,
especially if you code dynamically!

pps. Richard Stallman is giving a talk.  Did I mention it was free to attend?

Hi All,

I just came across some code that used some old-style coding practice, and I
wanted to know if there was still any GOOD reason for using it:

The code I saw was referencing variables using the $:: pragma:

if ($::var) {
   ...
}

To my understanding this is a bit messy, and not to mention potentially
dangerous as it kinda goes against the "use strict;" methodology, does it
not?

I haven't seen this style code in a long time so I wanted to get other
feedback on its potential benefits before I suggest updating it.
Thanks in advance to all that can help.

Thanks Miles,

Yeah, I sometimes feel like "You're either with it or against it" when it
comes to "use strict;".  And since $:: is kind of a backdoor to get around
strict.... Let's just say I'm not a fan ;)

I looked it up and $:: is apparently a shortcut for $main:: .
Interesting, but still doesn't tell me why someone would choose to use that
syntax.....

Cheers,
Alex

perl -E 'use strict; $::fred = 7; say $::fred'

works fine for me! So I guess the point of this scheme is that it
allows you to use global variables (worse, *undeclared* global
variables) under the strict pragma. If that's the case, then my advice
is to dust off and nuke the site from orbit: it's the only way to be
sure. If your budget won't stretch to orbital nukes, then burning it

As a precursor to the European Smalltalk User Group conference
(http://tinyurl.com/42z7752) which is taking place in the Forum next week,
Stephane Ducasse is going to give a one-day introduction to Smalltalk this
coming Saturday. Knowing the lecturer I expect this to be a lot of fun; in
particular, if you've always wanted to know about Smalltalk but been afraid
to ask, come along. All welcome; no need to register, just turn up.

Date: Saturday 20th August
Time: 10.30 - 17.00 (may finish earlier; there will be a break for lunch at
some point; quiet coming and going is allowed)
Place: Informatics Forum, G03

Discovering Smalltalk

Smalltalk is a pure and elegant object language. This lecture will cover
the fundamental aspects of Smalltalk: syntax, semantics, and key aspects of
the system. Doing so we will also revise the real semantics of self/super.
We will show the power of polymorphism in action by simply learning from
the system. Finally we will go into more design aspect again based on the
systems. As a bonus we will start the lecture with a 15 min presentation of
Seaside, a powerful web framework for dynamic web application.

This lecture may be followed by a lecture on more advanced object-oriented
design: law of demeter, encapsulation, multiple interface of classes,
composition vs. inheritance

Bio: He is expert in object-oriented language design, dynamic languages,
reflective programming, language semantics as well as reengineering,
program analysis, visualizations, software metrics. Recently he worked on
traits, composable method groups, and this work got some impact. Traits
have been introduced AmbiantTalk, Pharo, Perl-6, PHP 5.4 and Squeak. They
influenced Scala and Fortress SUN Microsystems. Stephane is one of the
developer of Pharo (http://www.pharo.project.org/) an open-source language
inspired by Smalltalk. He is one of the core developer of Moose, an
open-source reengineering environment (http://moose.unibe.ch/). He is the
president of the European Smalltalk User Group and organize a yearly
international conference on Smalltalk. He wrote a couple of fun books to
teach programming and other serious topics such as dynamic web development
(http://book.seaside.st).

My guess is that the script was written for Perl 4, when that was how one
referred to global variables.

Rather than rolling your own import function (Exporter was not included with
Perl 4), one often wrote modules with things like

  sub main::foobar {

   ...

  }

If so, one has to congratulate the original coder: for writing code that 
is sufficiently robust & usefule that its still in use now!

(though perhaps it would be time to revisit to see if the code can be 
cleaned up, speeded up, and otherwise improved with techniques available 
in Perl 5.xx )

I think smarter people may have already answered this better, but fwiw, a quick
trawl through the perldoc files on the topic interested me, so I thought I'd
share below in case anyone hadn't already seen them.

I don't claim to be an authority, but $::var used to ensure you're accessing
$var in the 'main' package smacks of coding without the safety-net.  Depends
how high up you are and how many rocks are beneath you, should you (or your
code) "fall".

Also consider those you're hoping will be following in your footsteps,
including "future-you" - when you look at code you wrote 6 months ago & say
WTF?

man perlfaq7

    How can I access a dynamic variable while a similarly named lexical is in
    scope?

    If you know your package, you can just mention it explicitly, as in
    $Some_Pack::var. Note that the notation $::var is not the dynamic $var in
    the current package, but rather the one in the "main" package, as though
    you had written $main::var.

    http://perldoc.perl.org/perlfaq7.html#How-can-I-access-a-dynamic-variable-while-a-similarly-named-lexical-is-in-scope?

man perlfunc

    package NAMESPACE

    package Declares the compilation unit as being in the given namespace.  The
    scope of the package declaration is from the declaration itself through the
    end of the enclosing block, file, or eval (the same as the "my" operator).
    All further unqualified dynamic identifiers will be in this namespace.  A
    package statement affects only dynamic variables--including those you've
    used "local" on--but not lexical variables, which are created with "my".
    Typically it would be the first declaration in a file to be included by the
    "require" or "use" operator.  You can switch into a package in more than
    one place; it merely influences which symbol table is used by the compiler
    for the rest of that block.  You can refer to variables and filehandles in
    other packages by prefixing the identifier with the package name and a
    double colon: $Package::Variable.  If the package name is null, the "main"
    package as assumed.  That is, $::sail is equivalent to $main::sail (as well
    as to "$main'sail", still seen in older code).

    See "Packages" in perlmod for more information about packages, modules, and
    classes.  See perlsub for other scoping issues.

    http://perldoc.perl.org/perlfunc.html#package-NAMESPACE

man perlsub

    Private Variables via my()

    In fact, a dynamic variable (also known as package or global variables) are
    still accessible using the fully qualified "::" notation even while a lexical
    of the same name is also visible:

        package main;
        local $x = 10;
        my    $x = 20;
        print "$x and $::x\n";

ps. because Google *still* has rubbish support for non-alphanumeric characters
in querys [ http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%24%3A%3A ] I found this lot via
the following:

    $ perldoc perl

lists what docs are available.

    $ locate perlfunc

told me *where* there are files with "perlfunc" in the name.

    $ zgrep '\$::' /usr/share/man/man1/perl*

gave me some hints about where to start looking.

It's just fully-qualified name syntax, not a pragma.

As others have noted, the empty-named package is an alias for the
`main` package:

$ perl -E 'say *main::x{PACKAGE}'
main
$ perl -E 'say *::x{PACKAGE}'
main

> $::var

I've occasionally used this for (uncommitted!) temporary debugging
code ? do `$::n++` in the middle of some module's code, then other
packages can easily check how many times that line was invoked.  But
I've never seen any need for it in real code, and it has all the
problems that package variables always do.

Sort of; the usual intention of `use strict` (or, more specifically,
`use strict qw<vars>`) is to say you want your variables to be
lexically scoped.  But it's entirely deliberate that the variables
stricture allows you to use package variables as long as you fully
qualify their names; `perldoc strict` says that it "generates a
compile?time error if you access a variable that wasn't declared via
C<our> or C<use vars>, localized via C<my()>, or wasn't fully
qualified."  (That description omits mention of `state`, though.
*Makes note to file documentation bug.*)

Message-ID: <A4B7CBC8-9814-49F4-BCB9-2F3CF7840919@gmail.com>

Hi all,

The schedule for the Edinburgh Dynamic Languages conference, held Friday 26th August at the Surgeons Hall in Edinburgh, has now been finalised.

See http://www.dynamiclanguages.co.uk/ for details and to create your own schedule for the day.

Amongst our speakers we have:
Richard Stallman, talking about "Copyright vs Community",
Juozas Kaziukenas talking about RESTful web services with Python,
Nuno Job talking about XQuery and how it's changing the world,
Mike Peat talking about Javascript: a tiger in rabbit's clothing,
and more!

We have over one hundred users registered on the site, but I am sure some of you may just have heard of it or waited for the schedule to see if they wanted to attend or not.

I look forward to seeing you on Friday at the conference!

'till then,
-marco-

Subject: [Edinburgh-pm] Picnic in the Meadows, Thur 25th Aug
Message-ID: <20110822143230.GN9825@mooker.vm.bytemark.co.uk>

Thursday is the monthly meeting date!  Yay!!

The previous poll strongly favoured a picnic on the Meadows.

I'd suggest we meet around the north side of the park, and that Cloisters be
our rainy-day alternative [1].  At least, nobody's suggested otherwise after my
last mail.  Bueller, Bueller, anyone?

I've marked a meeting spot, Cloisters & the local Sainsbury's store here:

http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=209531368115308613302.0004ab18b6edf2e555db0&msa=0

Public toilets are conspicuous by their absence.

Bring whatever food and drink you want to consume or share.  I note that BBQs
are officially not allowed.  Remember it can get cool quickly once the sun
drops, and something like a rug to sit on is useful if the ground is "damp".

If anyone would like my mobile number to confirm plans "on the ground/day",
email me off list. Also, I shall try and post any last second change of plans
to the list here.

Yours,
Captain Logistics.

[1] I realise there are closer pubs, but in terms of size, seating, food &
real-ale, I reckon Cloisters wins.

This sounds good to me.

What time should we aim to meet?

well, I can get there from 6 onwards, but I'm not best keen to be sat on my own
for an hour.

On the basis people seem to generally turn up nearer to 7, I'd been assuming
that.

If anyone wants to meet earlier, shout :)

Unfortunately, I don't think that I will make it this time.  I am under
some significant stress at the moment and I need some time to myself
(and my gf, of course).  Have a good time!

I'm planning to be there, but unfortunately Ciorstaidh wasn't feeling
well enough to make the journey through.

re. barbecues: I believe there are now a few Designated Barbecue Spots
in the meadows. Is anyone planning to bring a disposable barbie or
similar? If so, I'll bring some veggie sausages or halloumi or
something. Actually, maybe I'll bring some halloumi anyway. Mmmm,
halloumi.

Hi all,

I'm planning on being there too.

As far as bbq's are concerned, I've met the guy who's responsibility it is.
Basically all he seems to care about is that they're far enough off the
grass which is easy to do. There supposedly are designated BBQ spots, but
good luck finding them. The map with their locations appears to have been
drawn from memory by someone who doesn't understand the concept of maps.

I've got a couple of disposable ones I'll bring down in case we wanna use
em. Play it by ear kinda thing. And, halllllloooouumiii, I like the way you
think miles.

Cheers,

Dan

Do they have them on the Meadows proper, or just on the Links?

But either way, I'm not sure we'll really have time for barbecuing ?
we're meeting at 7pm, sunset is before 8:30, and the weather is due to
fully cloud over by 10pm, so I suspect we'll be heading hurriedly for
a nice warm^W refreshing pint in Cloisters by 8pm or not much later.

Mmmm.

So, bad news: it's raining where I am, about 10 minutes walk from our
agreed meeting venue.

I think that means that, even if it stops pretty soon, and it doesn't
start again, the ground's going to be rather too wet for a picnic.

I suggest we invoke the fallback plan of going to Cloisters.  Anyone disagree?

best to call them -- they notionally do food, but I've known the chef to go
home early if he's not in teh mood.

Normally, yes.  Unfortunately, they said "not today" when I phoned
earlier to check.

I suspect I'll be hungry too.  How about we start in Cloisters, and
those who want dinner can move to the Bombay Bicycle Club (good
quality but reasonably priced curry restaurant a few doors down) at
some point?

I'm hungry *right now*, but fortunately I'd already bought some picnic
things. I'll bring them along and we can sneak out for
bread-and-hummus. What I've got won't feed six hungry Perl Mongers,
but hopefully will at least take the edge off until we can get to the
BBC.

Subject: [Edinburgh-pm] Ideas for a second monthly pm meet in a cafe?
Message-ID: <4E5AC7B9.3030105@gmail.com>

Hi,

I know of a few people (mostly who work on the south side of town, including
Kings Buildings) who would be interested in attending Perl Mongers meetings,
but who (1) don't drink, and don't like pubs and (2) find an evening meetup
on the other side of town difficult to get to.

So would anyone on the list be interested in a regular meeting in a cafe,
south side of town, either lunch time or perhaps 4pm? (This would be a
second meet each month, and not a replacement for the regular meetings in
the Cumberland.)

I'm open to suggestions for cafes. I know of many along the Meadows-
Tollcross-Bruntsfield-Morningside, but nothing nearer to Kings Buildings.

I might even call it a "south side scripting meetup" and invite people
interested in other scripting languages.

Rob

Interesting idea.  I'd definitely do my best to come along.

(Of the top of my head)

Earthy Foods?  Causewayside. Nice food, but not very cheap.

Spoon?  Southbridge. Large caf? space above street level. (Not esp. close to
Kings but has good bus connections)

You could be even less specific than that if you felt like it.  Depending on
what format you had in mind.

I have created a Google Group for organising the venue and time for the
first (and continuing) meetings of the Edinburgh South-Side Scripting Meetup:

Please join the group to help plan where and when.

And please forward this to friends, colleagues and other mailing lists that
you are on.
