I&#039;ve spotted that 2 tracks in Bioscape&#039;s last release are used to have wrong renders and have some nearly heard artifacts. I&#039;m sorry for that, both archives were updated already. Here is links for zips with fixed tracks from mp3 and flac releases, to save you from downloading whole album again: MP3 - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gliese-records.com/catalog/bioscape-mp3fix.zip" title="Открыть внешнюю ссылку">http://gliese-records.com/catalog/bioscape-mp3fix.zip</a> and FLAC - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gliese-records.com/catalog/bioscape-flacfix.zip" title="Открыть внешнюю ссылку">http://gliese-records.com/catalog/bioscape-flacfix.zip</a></div><div class="news"><p class="sub_header">March 23, 2014</p><p class="main_header">Upcoming updates and latest news</p>Hello people of the Earth! 2nd release is out on Gliese 581C in 2014 and much more of them is coming soon and later too. I want to share some news and upcoming improvements on a label for you.<br />
1. I&#039;m going to add Webmoney, Paypal &amp; etc for payments and contributions on a website, for everyone interested in some label upgrades, because all this money going to be used on the label only, for first time (year or few I guess, then we will watch), I&#039;m also going to use this accounts to share some of my money and make contributions too. Improvements we are going to use it for is going below.<br />
2. Website upgrade (coding + maybe additional design work). What we are going to add?<br />
a) Separate partition for promotional mixes from our musicians or from our brave listeners, which we can choose collectively. I think we also can share nice visuals/videos on our music.<br />
b) Also there is going to be partition for future CD releases tree, which are going to be real in this year I hope - because I&#039;m going to register a legal person here and connect it with a label activity to make it official and protected by law.<br />
c) Requirements partition, which are going to contain complete requirements for releasing material on Gliese 581C, including some useful advices for music makers I guess, to focus them on a popular mistakes, which most of newcomers do.<br />
d) Counter, showing how many funds we already have in Gliese 581C treasury - I want to see it clear and opened for all of you.<br />
e) Maybe some fixed credit position at the release info pages like &quot;Written &amp; Produced by; Mastered by, Artwork by, Compiled by.<br />
f) Partition with all info for donations/contributions.<br />
g) Partition with upcoming compilations and releases.<br />
h) Anything else you want, just share your thoughts here.<br />
3. About more deeper promotion and some profit for beer or even food - most of our artists are using bandcamp, so it&#039;s ok to give me html file hyperlinked to the bandcamp page containing your release with NYP (name your price) or whatever for your new release, we are going to share on Gliese 581C too. I would include it into release zips and let it be. 2nd part here is about Ektoplazm - till labels are charged for 20 Eur with every release, money may be a) donated, b) refunded, c) used on facebook for promotion of post with your release at the Ektoplazm&#039;s FB page. So if you are interested in C - you got to say me this when I would be ready for mastering of your release, and get this 20 Eur, because I won&#039;t going to pay it for you. All this section &quot;3&quot; is actual for all releases excluding compilations. If you want to promote compilations you compete through FB, you&#039;ve got to decide it together with other artists.<br />
4. I&#039;m going to upgrade CC license we are using (by-nc) <a target="_blank" href="http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" title="Открыть внешнюю ссылку">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/</a> to (by-nc-sa) <a target="_blank" href="http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" title="Открыть внешнюю ссылку">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/</a>, adding &quot;ShareAlike (sa) — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.&quot;<br />
5. I still searching for anyone active and having enough free time to share with me leading work on a label and be some kind of vice-head here and be ready to spread a hour or two in a week for a label if it would be needed. I cant offer any serious money here, but can give some cashy bonuses if we would have enough funds rarely. Unique mail and own ftp account with 6Gb share included.<br />
PS Some improves to a new requirements for music you submit - you&#039;ve got to mix your music normally and adequate. For a first time I can accept bad mixing and can advice you distantly and even mix some stuff for you, but only once for free. Every time you would submit not well mixed tracks after first time (excepting very rare situations) you are going to be charged for some amount of money due to the difficulty of work I should make - I really have a little of time every week to spent it for mistakes, you&#039;ve got to handle by yourself. Free mastering I always provide is a work too, taking some time, you know.<br />
<br />
With all the best,<br />
