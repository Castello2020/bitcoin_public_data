Miya just came into our #rescue today. She was hit by a car yesterday and her owner determined he could not afford her medical bills for treatment. She was surrendered to a shelter. We expedited her into our #rescue and had her seen by a vet. She has two fractures in her leg and she will require surgery which is already scheduled for next week. Our #rescue is looking at a $1400-$1800 estimate. If you would like to send a #donation, our address is: PO Box 8727, Seminole, FL 33775. Thank you!
