<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Alc�zar:</span></strong><strong><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></strong><span lang="EN-GB">A Moorish fortified palace, the most famous of which is the much modified <span class="SpellE">Alc�zar</span> de <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p>We have noticed the surname Alcazar here in Chile is always pronounced and written with an accent over the second syllable, and we also note that most Spanish sites, like the article below, indicates the same accent.</p> 

<p>From one source:</p>

<p>In the year 711 A.D.,  As the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, 
              Alc�zar de San Juan succumbs to the Arabic invasion. An important fortified enclosure is
              built, so that the name of the city becomes "Al-kasar" ("the palace").</p>


The site of the Alc�zar of Segovia, on the top of a rock shaped by the 
rivers Eresma and
    Clamores, shows the military origins of this fortress which, for 
centuries, was
    impregnable.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY">The oldest
    testimony we have of the Alc�zar is a document dating from&nbsp;the 
early days of the 12<sup>th</sup>

    century (1122), a short time after the town had been recaptured by 
Alfonso VI, which
    refers to the fortress as a hill-fort on the Eresma. A short time 
later, in a letter of
    1155, it was already being referred to as "Alc�zar". However, it is 
more than
    probable that the fortress had existed in earlier times, possibly 
since the Roman
    occupation, because granite blocks similar to those of the Aqueduct 
have been found in the
    course of recent excavations. In residencies of the monarchs of 
Castile, partly due to the
    beauty of its location and its unquestionable military secureness, 
and partly for its
    proximity to the famous hunting-grounds in the mountain forests.</p>

<p>The Alc�zar is one of Andaluc�a&#8217;s gems,&nbsp; a beautiful architectural 
masterpiece, whose history tells the story of Seville.</p>
<p>Originally a Moorish fort &#8211; the name comes from the Arabic for palace &#8211; the 
Alc�zar is one of the finest remaining examples of predominantly Mud�jar 
architecture in the country; but that only begins to tell the tale. This 
seemingly exquisitely designed palace &#8211; still officially designated as an 
official royal residence &#8211; has, in fact, been added to continuously over the 
years.<br>

<br>
It was at the beginning of the 10th Century that the original building was 
started but during the following century the ruling Almohades began to fully 
develop their royal fortress &#8211; on the western side of the current site. 
Following the reconquest, successive kings augmented the buildings but the 
predominant figure in this part of the Alc�zar&#8217;s history was the controversial 
Pedro I, who added, amongst other things, the mighty Palacio de Don Pedro. Pedro 
employed mainly Moorish and Jewish workers brought from Granada and incorporated 
huge fragments of buildings from C�rdoba, Valencia and the nearby ruined city of 
It�lica into the constructions. The buildings, and especially the wonderful 
gardens incorporated into the Palace, were developed all the way to the 19th 
Century. Indeed, the gardens near the Amohad Wall on the eastern side of the 
complex are a 20th Century addition. The fascinating thing, however, is that &#8211; 
with this profusion of Mund�jar, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque styles &#8211; the 
Alc�zar has such a wonderful feeling of unity about it.</p>
<p>There are so many aspects about this palace to fascinate and intrigue 
visitors &#8211; both inside the rooms, in the patios and the wonderful gardens.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most spectacular and luxurious of the rooms are the Cuarto Real 
Alto and the Sal�n de Embajadores. The former is the suite of rooms used by the 
Spanish Royal family, although usually open to the public, and is as 
extravagently decorated as you might expect. The Sal�n de Embajadores was 
originally the throne room of Pedro I and has sumptuously tiled walls and a 
ceiling with a magnificent cedarwood cupola, with elaborate star patterns. It 
has a particularly spectacular archway, Arco de Pavones, covered with motifs of 
peacocks.<br>
<br>

This room is part of Pedro I&#8217;s incredible fusion of Muslim and Iberian styles &#8211; 
the Palacio de Don Pedro. You&#8217;ll especially notice the Patio de las Doncellas, 
the Courtyard of the Maidens, commemorating the annual demand by the Moors of 
100 virgins from their Christian kingdoms. This is as astonishingly beautiful as 
anything in the Alhambra &#8211; containing a large reflective pool, with sunken 
gardens on either side, exquisitely shaped arches, and spectacular wooden doors. 
The irony of this beauty being the creation of a ruler who murdered many of his 
own family in order to keep his position will add more poignancy to the 
occasion. The upper storey was added later by Carlos V and mixes Italian 
Renaissance and Mud�jar styles. Go from there into the adjoining C�mara Regia, 
with its mix of plaster and tilework, and you&#8217;ll fully understand why people 
become so enchanted by the atmosphere of the Alc�zar.<br>
<br>
There are many other compelling attractions. The Sala de Audiencias, for 
example, has the first known painting of Columbus&#8217; American discoveries. The 
Casa de Contrataci�n includes the chapel in which Columbus reported back to 
Ferdinand and Isabella after his second journey.<br>
<br>
You&#8217;ll also see many references to Do�a Maria de Padilla &#8211; her bedrooms, her 
patio, her bathing waters. Now a symbol of purity to the people of Seville, this 
former mistress of Pedro I, who apparently loved her to distraction, had a 
fascinating life story.<br>

<br>
No reference to the Alc�zar would be complete, though, without reference to the 
delightful gardens. Andaluc�a has many beautiful gardens &#8211; notably at Granada 
and Cordoba, of course - but those of Seville lose little in comparison with any 
of them. Even on the hottest summer&#8217;s day &#8211; and they do get hot in Seville &#8211; the 
gentle elegance and grace of the gardens, with their delicate water features, 
meticulous planting and cunning use of light and shade, will be soothing and 
restorative.<br>
<br>
There is so much more that could be said about the Alc�zar of Seville. Just the 
other side of Plaza del Triunfo from the mighty Cathedral, the main entrance for 
visitors is through the Puerta del Le�n. No matter how brief your stay in the 
city, don't miss it.</p>


Alcazar:&nbsp; What&rsquo;s In A Name <br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">The name Alcazar means castle, palace or fortress, or home.&nbsp; The origin of Alcazar is Spanish Arabic from qasr.&nbsp; The Moors of Spain and Arab distinction built alcazars throughout their territories.&nbsp; Etymology aside, the name Alcazar carries the connotation of richness and color.</span></p>

<p><img style="border: 10px solid white; float: left;" src="alcazar3.jpg" alt="" /><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">Mostly, the term Moor refers historically to several historic and modern populations of Muslim (and earlier non-Muslim) people of Berber and Arab descent from North Africa, some of whom came to inhabit the Iberian Peninsula. The North Africans termed it Al Andalus, comprising most of what is now Spain and Portugal.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />The Andalusian Moors of the late Medieval era inhabited the Iberian Peninsula after the Moorish conquests of the Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates, and the final Umayyad conquest of Hispania.&nbsp; The Moors' rule stretched at times as far as modern-day Mauritania, West African countries, and the Senegal River.&nbsp; Earlier, the Classical Romans interacted (and later conquered) parts of Mauretania, a state which covered northern portions of modern Morocco and much of north western and central Algeria during the classical period. The people of the region were noted in Classical literature as the Mauri.<br /><br />The term Mauri, or variations thereof, was later used by European traders and explorers of the 16th to 18th centuries to designate ethnic Berber and Arab groups speaking the Hassaniya Arabic dialect.&nbsp; Today such groups inhabit Mauritania and parts of Algeria, western Sahara, Morocco, Niger and Mali and to those in India and Sri Lanka.&nbsp; Mauri was the genesis of the name of the ancient kingdom of Mauretania, which gave its name to the modern Islamic Republic of Mauritania.&nbsp; In the Philippines, some residents use a variation of the term to designate some Muslim populations, the Moros.<br /><br />Alcazar is a name of the dwellings originally built and occupied by the Moors.&nbsp; Today, the connotation is broader.&nbsp; There is a video game, the name of cafes and shops in Paris and the French Rivera.&nbsp; Alcazar is the name of a band, hotels in the United States and Canada, and is a comic book feature.<br /><br />Alcazar do Sal is a municipality in Portugal which is composed of six parishes.&nbsp; The name Alcazar means home, hospitality, relaxation, pleasure.&nbsp; May you experience them all, Alcazar.</p>

  <p><strong>Next to the Cathedral of Seville</strong></p>
  <p>we can visit <strong>Reales Alcazares</strong>. It was the first <strong>royal palace in Seville</strong> formed by a series of smaller palaces, which is why its often referrd to in the plural &raquo;Reales Alcazares. The Alcazar Palace has been a seat of power and a royal residence, in fact, it remains teh official residence of the current royal family. Inside examples of Moorish architectur are mixed with gothic, renaissance and baroque elements. The gardens are also beautiful, where the gentle murmur of the water and teh smell of teh flowers create a paradise atmosphere.</p>

The Alcazar comprises a series of palaces which are the most  important example of <strong>civil architecture in Seville</strong>. In the interior, the  outstanding palace grounds, gardens and servants quarters are spread over an  area enclosed by walls on the south side of Sevilles Historic City Centre.  Rather than an architectural unit, the Alcazar has an intimate atmosphere  created by an intermingling of Muslim artistic elements with others from the  Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque periods. The most striking contribution by  Pedro I&nbsp; was the reconstruction of the  older parts of the Abbadi Alcazar and other early palaces. </p>

        <p><strong>Alcazar palace</strong> </p>
        <p>is a part time residence of the <strong>Royal Family</strong>, and it is the oldest Royal Palace used in Europe. Noteworthy as  it is it not mererly a singular palace but a series of palaces, the product of  successive reforms that took place since the Arab occupation. Thus these  grounds bring together a perfect symbiosis, a succession of architectural  styles, from Islamic to Neoclassical, incorporating Mudejar elements, Gothic,  Renaissance, Plateresque, Purist, Baroque and Rococo; all contributing to the  magnificence of this landmark. They are present at its beautiful gardens,  patios, rooms and tapestries.<br />

          There are lots of fascinating rooms,  corridors and courtyards inside the Fortress. You'll get impressed since you  join the palace from the Lion gate. Going straight we arrive to Hunting  Courtyard and then to the Mudejar Palace, where there are some of the rooms I  show you here (Courtyard of Maidservants, Ceiling Room of Charles V,  Ambassadors Room, King's Bedroom, Dolls Courtyard, Ceiling Room of Philip II  and Infante's Room) all of them in Mudejar style.<br />
          The other parts are the Gothic Palace (where this tapestry  is found), the Court Room, the China house and two more courtyards.<br />
