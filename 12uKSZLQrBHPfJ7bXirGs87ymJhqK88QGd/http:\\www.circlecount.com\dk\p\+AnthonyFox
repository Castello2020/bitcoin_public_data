I've been in a huge struggle the past year and a half with digestive issues. It's led me away from the narrow confines of modern medicine and I've had to reconsider the weight I give to subjective and anecdotal evidence which is a topic worth discussing all by itself.I've come to the conclusion that the field of gastroenterology is far behind where it should be because, well think about it - Do you want to be a poo inspector?Modern medicine is all about te$ting, excuse me for the typo, testing. Observing patients and listening to what they have to say doesn't get much weight. When in comes to gastroenterology that means looking at a lot of poo. Who wants to do that?On a personal note, the battle for rages on but the progress I've made in the last few... more »

It has a doctor/patient email exchange, records, test results, and you can set appointments through it.So, I saw my new doctor for the first time and we discussed my issues, candida primarily and she had me get labs done.I turned out my thyroid is out of whack. It probably has been for quite awhile and it's likely an effect of the candida. She emailed me a prescription based on the test results (prescriptions by email, that's pretty cool!).However, the symptoms have been getting steadily worse in the last few weeks since I saw her and thyroid condition has brought with it difficulties concentrating and mood instability, so looking up stuff about it is very difficult.

2014-01-08 00:40:36 (5 comments, 0 reshares, 5 +1s)Lately I've been having difficulty with people who don't understand context.For instance, in a forum post I made about the basics of music theory, someone with a very advanced understanding jumped in and posted a huge swath of what, to most beginner musicians, would be incomprehensible technical jargon.Learning music theory is intimidating enough for beginners and the stuff he was talking about is only relevant to the tiniest fraction of musicians who have dedicated their lives to specifically studying music theory.When I told him he was off-topic and explained why, he couldn't understand what I was saying. He said my attitude was condescending.My problem isn't being condescending. Well not in this case.My problem is that I don't recognize the context of the internet. This guy is the context of the internet. Him and people that... more »
2014-01-03 21:24:02 (2 comments, 0 reshares, 5 +1s)Snarky and condescending on the internet? How 2010!I know, I'll grab my "iphone" and "tweet" about it. Puh-leese! Hello, 2014 calling!Let me guess? You're still breathing air? OMG!! I haven't touched that stuff in literally AGES!!Oh! Oh! Ohhhh!! I'm having a heart attack!! Seriously folks. I'm not kidding... Oh. My. God. People, you gotta try this... I'm. Dying. It's so... retro.It's the next big thing... XD﻿
2014-01-03 07:07:38 (4 comments, 0 reshares, 4 +1s)The fashionistas are always wrong. Twice.What they are hailing this season will be cliche next, and what's in next season will be out the following. With the perspective of time, and by their own standards, they live in a perpetual state of being wrong.Everything that goes out of style, eventually comes back, in a "retro" movement. So, not only are they wrong for having liked what they liked, eventually they will be wrong for having dismissed it.They can't help but eventually recognize this, at least on a subliminal level.What a burden to carry. I'm not sure if I feel admiration for them, or pity.﻿

2013-11-18 19:57:42 (2 comments, 0 reshares, 6 +1s)A**holes are contagious!Ever find yourself dealing with a jerk and becoming one yourself?And then, feeling guilty about it!?!I think that guilt is more about betraying our own ideals and integrity than any possible (unlikely) harm we may have done to the a-hole in question.What brings this up? It's a bunch of technical Linux crap and a forum I haven't been to in three years that has gone horribly sour in the interim. (Archlinux forums)﻿
2013-11-07 13:09:44 (8 comments, 0 reshares, 22 +1s)I gotta rant here for a second.I'm doing a lot of research into health and nutrition and it drives me crazy that mainstream medicine considers freakin' opinion to be valid evidence and yet dismisses anecdotal evidence, even when there is an overwhelming amount of it.Opinion can be interesting and is, sometimes, worth considering but it is NOT evidence, regardless of the source. On the other hand, anecdotal evidence is, by definition, evidence.Care does need to be taken when analyzing anecdotal evidence, especially to not confuse cause with supposed cause and there does need to be a sufficient volume of anecdotal evidence to do this accurately.Medicine and the social sciences are utterly contaminated by this methodology and the entire human race suffers because of it.Oh, but you should trust your doctor. ~snark~﻿
2013-10-28 14:58:59 (15 comments, 0 reshares, 11 +1s)Wanted: Poo InspectorOkay, the title is a joke but the subject isn't. I've been in a huge struggle the past year and a half with digestive issues. It's led me away from the narrow confines of modern medicine and I've had to reconsider the weight I give to subjective and anecdotal evidence which is a topic worth discussing all by itself.I've come to the conclusion that the field of gastroenterology is far behind where it should be because, well think about it - Do you want to be a poo inspector?Modern medicine is all about te$ting, excuse me for the typo, testing. Observing patients and listening to what they have to say doesn't get much weight. When in comes to gastroenterology that means looking at a lot of poo. Who wants to do that?On a personal note, the battle for rages on but the progress I've made in the last few... more »

Wow. Just wow.﻿

Are you familiar with this genre?Call it Epic, Cinematic, or Trailer (as in film/game trailers) Music.I'm working on my musical chops right now with the goal of making music like this and I'm wondering if anyone here would be interested hearing it. I'm probably six months to a year away from making anything worth showing.﻿

If anything, vampires would find sex disgusting. At the very least they would see it as passionless.I'm okay with sexy monsters, as long as they're living creatures. Vampires ain't that.﻿

2013-08-18 23:18:54 (1 comments, 0 reshares, 1 +1s)Twenty years from now this will be seen as a landmark that will have spawned hundreds of imitations and inspired many thousands to follow the path that it blazes.Jack Kincaid is, without exaggeration, a genius.What is it? Imagine a major Hollywood director, like J.J. Abrams, made an audio book. It would probably be something very much like Edict Zero - FIS.It's even more amazing when you realize how many of the voices Jack Kincaid; the writer, producer and director; is doing himself. The guy is some kind of freak. A wonderful and delightful freak! :)﻿
