				<description>This is heavily being promoted by early Angel Investors who bought the bitcoin when it was about 5 or 6 cents. These early investors lobbied,bribed and influenced the media and internet forums to make this bitcoin popular and grow. This type of Ponzi is seeing its rise because of these early angel investors, the result of cartels laundering their proceeds from drugs,extortion and illegal gambling and people who are just basic suckers and gullible. Look at the Chinese government, they said it is not a currency and told their banks not to deal in bitcoins. Chairman of the federal reserve Alan Greenspan said it is not a currency.</description>

				<description>Yes , I totally agree, anybody holding bitcoins is getting totally killed , by laughter , laughing at all the poor saps who did not get in when it was below 8 bucks. Even the idiots who got in at 100 are getting killed by laughter , and next year it will be the ones who got in at 500 dollar. When they cost 10 grand a unit even them suckers will be getting killed when they hit 100 grand a unit.</description>

				<description>&quot;There is intrinsic value in gold and especially silver due to their industrial uses.&quot;

What nonsense. If 'intrinsic' value was in anyway relevant then the price of gold and silver would be similar to this supposed intrinsic value. In an industrial capacity gold is less useful than copper. Copper is currently trading at about $6 per kilo, while gold is about $44,000 per kilo. In reality there is no such thing as intrinsic value. On a desert island a gold bar is less useful than a coconut, which you can at least eat.</description>

				<description>There is no &quot;cracking&quot; like breaking into an account by cracking a password. If there was an innovation that enabled someone to mine all the rest of hte bitcoins instantly that would be a real attack. But then the bitcoins you have would still be yours and miners would still get their fees for verifying transactions. Just that one miner would suddenly have a disproportionate number of coins so could manipulate prices. But then they wouldn't want it to go to zero. So, my hair is an eagle, therefore you argument is invalid.</description>

				<description>I agree with you on bitcoin but when it comes to hard assets like gold and silver you haven't got a clue. There is intrinsic value in gold and especially silver due to their industrial uses. U.S. debt is on it's way towards 18 trillion. If you compare a long term chart of gold to u.s. debt, the trajectory of debt to gold price is quite similar. Go read your asinine little ego masturbation session in 10 years and see who's laughing.</description>

				<description>....

Tesla?

What a moron that seller was. 

lets say Bitcoin was at $1,000. this means the seller would accept 100 Bitcoins for the car if priced at $100,000 USD.

Ok

So, five minutes after the transaction goes down and dude is driving the Tesla away, Bitcoin crashes to $500. Suddenly the moronic Tesla seller just sold the car for $50 Large! He just got smooooked.

Could it go up? Sure. Then the BUYER is now the moron because he might have just paid $150,000 for a car valued at $100,000 USD.

Point is. Anybody pricing a sale in this shit is a complete idiot. The price swings are so extreme you really have no idea what price you actually buy or sell something. Its a complete shit show...</description>

				<description>Worry not Kryptic. If the NSA does not have a backdoor to the Bitcoin algo, rest assured they are busy cracking it as we speak.

The U.S. will pay off portions of the Federal deficit using Bitcoins mined after the NSA cracks the Bitcoin algo.</description>

				<description>&quot;that the USD also has no intrinsic value, don't you?&quot;

Don't be a friggin moron. The US Dollar is backed by the full force of the United States economy. Do you know anything stronger than that? I mean besides your ignorance about Economics?

				<description>Bitcoins are totally dependent on the ability of the algorithm to resist cracking. Once the algorithm is cracked, the value will drop to zero as soon as that becomes public knowledge.

With BitCoins at around $1,000, the payback to the person who can crack the algorithm is in the millions, possibly in the hundreds of millions, which creates a massive financial incentive. History teaches us that people do respond to this kind of financial incentive, so BitCoins days are numbered.</description>

				<description>But its accepted just about everywhere in the world as a medium of exchange, and it's backed by the United States Government (For better or worse). 

BitCoin is still a relatively new medium of exchange. It's not widely accepted and it's backed by......................

BitCoin is a confidence game in the true sense of the word. As long as people have confidence in it, it will have value. The price volatility you see in BitCoin is direct result of the confidence fluctuating in terms of its perceived value.</description>

				<description>You've completely missed the point, the USD is accepted here in the US because it has legal tender status. You cannot refuse to accept it. Overseas it is needed as a medium of exchange backed up by the US military. Other nations have found it to be to their advantage to go along. 

No nation would even consider giving bitcoin legal tender status, full stop. Add to that the ease of criminal misuse including facilitating terrorism, money laundering, and tax evasion, and you have all the justification needed for a full-on DHS crackdown.</description>

				<description>MONEY as a concept has no intrinsic value moron! That is what makes it MONEY! Money is an abstract; it's a socio economic unit of account. Which is why gold/silver/bitcoin as money is a totally flawed historical concept and why the Austrian hard monetarists are completely wrong with all their predictions or even historical account of what money is.

It's hilarious watching the same nutswingers who got taken to the smelter on gold and silver now defend bitcoin. Suddenly they're in it for the long haul. Keep stackin bitcoins, but when you have to sell them to BUY THINGS, don't say you weren't warned of what money really is.</description>

				<description>Yes, that sounds correct.

Tha value of Bitcoin is the utility of a global financial transaction network with near zero fees.

You can send a million USD for nothing between countries. The cost however is that you have to buy and sell bitcoin to do this.</description>

				<description>People always ask, how do you short Bitcoin? Well some exchanges allow you to borrow BTC to short. Also, other exchanges have futures on bitcoin.

But if you really think about it, how do you short Bitcoin? You hold USD. Unfortunately, that trade isn't working out so well recently!</description>

				<description>Correct, this is an excellent buy opportunity. The media's effect on bitcoin price is hilarious and so predictable if you keep up to date. Sold at 1000 (bitstamp price) and rebuying now. However a fair warning for people buying back: this may be a bull trap because most of media right now is similar to this article, so weak hands are still panicky since the China thing actually being good isn't mainstream knowledge just yet.</description>

				<description>The way to play bitcoin is to try to acquire as much bitcoin as you can.

The price in USD somehow eventually takes care of itself! Ask any long term bitcoin investor, 50% drops in a day aren't a cause for concern so long as at the end of the day, you have more bitcoin!!</description>

				<description>The price volatility is to be expected since bitcoin has no intrinsic value. It is worth what someone else will offer for it. And that is exactly the problem. Everyone dealing in it is well aware of that and is nervous, so they react precipitously.

The bigger problem is that bitcoin is not controlled by any government which makes it an ideal venue for criminal activity including money laundering. The terrorists seem to have also taken notice. For them, it is a sort of electronic Hawala. That is why I think bitcoin is doomed. If it becomes successful, it will by definition become a threat to major governments and their currencies. Don't expect them to accept that calmly, they won't. And frightened governments can react to perceived threats quite abruptly.</description>

				<description>I'm not in it, but for some reason I find this more exciting than American television sports. Part of it is the beautiful charts and depth graphs available, complete with coverage by Sam, and color commentary by Joe and friends.

				<description>This correction was caused by misreporting of the news out of China. 

The Chinese government changed Bitcoin's status from quasi-legal to fully legal. They decided to classify it as a commodity, not a currency, and therefore Bitcoin exchanges are not required to adhere to the Chinese government's currency trading rules. This is all good news. I wish the U.S. government would do the same, thus putting an end to the uncertainty that's preventing the U.S. from getting its own high-quality exchange!

Once investors learn the truth behind the media's latest round of garble and skew, the growth in price will resume. The silver lining is that this is an excellent entry point!</description>
