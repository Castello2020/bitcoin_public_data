Taste the alpha
So, after All The Code was up for a few hours I made one small change to the production system, breaking codeviewing for the better part of half an hour. Anyways, I came up with a way to improve results that shouldn't take more than a hundred lines or so to implement, so as soon as I get some free time I'm going to give that a shot (not on the production version though, I've learnt my lesson there). On a less than totally random note, newsforge put up a small blurb on it for awesome.
