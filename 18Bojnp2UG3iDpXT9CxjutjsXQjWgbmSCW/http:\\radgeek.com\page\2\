<p class="first">Can you hear that? It&#8217;s the Call for Abstracts. <em>Your</em> abstracts. The <a href="http://aaeblog.com/2014/05/03/call-for-abstracts-libertarianism-and-privilege/">Molinari Society is putting out a Call for Abstracts</a> for our 11th annual Symposium at the APA Eastern Division meeting, 27-30 Dec. 2014, in Philadelphia. Send us an abstract for a paper by 26 May 2014:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3><a href="http://aaeblog.com/2014/05/03/call-for-abstracts-libertarianism-and-privilege/">Call for Abstracts</a></h3>
  
  <p><em>for the Molinari Society’s Year 11 Symposium to be held in conjunction with the American Philosophical Association Eastern Division meeting, December 27-30, 2014, in Philadelphia.</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>Symposium Topic:</strong>
  <strong>Libertarianism and Privilege</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>Submission Deadline:</strong> 26 May 2014</p>
  
  <p>In recent years, “privilege” has become the default model for most of the Left’s critical discussion of structural oppression, resistance, and challenges to social justice. Critical discourse today recognizes many forms of structural social privilege, including white privilege, male privilege, and privilege based on heterosexuality, gender identity, and economic or political class. Privilege is said not only to touch on political power but also to have interpersonal and epistemic dimensions – informing social interactions and cultural expressions, and raising concerns about the position of social critics and limitations or distortions of knowledge.</p>
  
  <p>In addition, the relationship between libertarianism and privilege has begun to attract increased interest, both within and beyond libertarian circles. Libertarianism has been described both as essentially an opposition to privilege, and as essentially a rationalization of privilege. Does libertarian theory have the resources to address questions of structural privilege – especially those forms of social privilege that do not appear to derive from state action? Should it address such questions? What unique insights or contributions might it offer to critical discussions of privilege? How might an account of structural social privilege modify or develop libertarian approaches?</p>
  
  <p>Abstracts should be submitted for the 2014 Symposium by 26 May, 2014. Submissions from any point of view are welcome. Please submit an abstract only if you expect to be able to present the paper in person at the Symposium. (Final papers should be of appropriate scope and length to be presented within 15-30 minutes.) Submitting authors will be notified of the acceptance or rejection of their papers by 31 May, 2014.</p>
  
  <p>Submit abstracts as e-mail attachments, in Word .doc format, PDF, or ODT, to <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#x6c;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#x67;&#114;&#111;&#98;&#64;&#x61;&#x75;&#x62;&#117;&#114;&#110;&#46;e&#x64;&#x75;">&#x6c;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#x67;&#114;&#111;&#98;&#64;&#x61;&#x75;&#x62;&#117;&#114;&#110;&#46;e&#x64;&#x75;</a>.</p>

<p class="first">From <a href="http://blog.fair-use.org/2014/02/21/the-liberator-1835-1839-1851-available-pdf/">time</a> to <a href="http://blog.fair-use.org/2013/03/04/liberator-vols-3-4-now-available/">time</a> I have <a href="http://blog.fair-use.org/2013/01/21/volumes-i-and-ii-of-the-liberator-now-available-in-facsimile-pdfs/">mentioned</a> my ongoing project of <a href="http://fair-use.org/the-liberator">making full issues of William Lloyd Garrison&#8217;s <cite>The Liberator</cite></a> available at <code>fair-use.org</code>. <cite>The Liberator</cite> is big (52-53 issues every year, for 35 years!) and the project has progressed at a slow pace. But <a href="http://blog.fair-use.org/2014/05/08/the-liberator-scanning-project-week-1/">I&#8217;m happy to announce</a> that that should be picking up &#8212; thanks to a break from other obligations, a fundraiser to cover the costs through the Molinari Institute, and generous contributions from supporters all over the Internet <a href="http://blog.fair-use.org/2014/05/08/the-liberator-scanning-project-week-1/">the <cite>Liberator</cite> scanning project has added 105 new issues to the online archive</a>, and should be able to proceed much more quickly and steadily from here on out &#8212; it&#8217;s on pace to get <em>every issue of <cite>The Liberator</cite> available in full, online, for free, by the beginning of August 2014</em>. Want to help make that happen?</p>

<p><strong>Here&#8217;s the deal.</strong> When the fundraiser project started, thanks to occasional scanning when I had the time to volunteer, <code>fair-use.org</code> had ten years&#8217; worth of <cite>The Liberator</cite> online: Volumes I.-IX. (1830-1839) and Volume XXI. (Jan.-Dec. 1851). In order to finish the remaining 25 years&#8217; worth of issues this summer &#8212; instead of sometime around 2019 &#8212; we&#8217;re raising funds through our fiscal sponsor, the <a href="http://praxeology.net/molinari.htm">Molinari Institute</a> &#8212; in order to get the scans online and begin to prepare an extensive, open, free and researcher-friendly archive and index for anyone who wants to learn more about radical abolitionism and the history of American social movements. The fundraiser will cover the labor costs for the scanning and the increased web hosting costs for what&#8217;s likely to become a very widely used web resource.</p>

<p>Thanks to generous donations from 8 donors, the Liberator Scanning Project has already raised over 10% of the goal &#8212; $246 out of the projected $2,000 budget. And thanks to those donations, <strong>I&#8217;ve already been able to add two new volumes</strong> &#8212; <a href="http://fair-use.org/the-liberator">Volume X. and Volume XI. of <cite>The Liberator</cite> (1840-1841)</a> &#8212; to the online archive at <a href="http://fair-use.org/the-liberator">fair-use.org/the-liberator</a>. The project is on track to add the next two volumes (XII. and XIII.) by the end of this week.</p>

<h3>About the project:</h3>

<p>The goal is to make every issue of <cite>The Liberator</cite>, from 1831-1865, available in full, online, for free, and to add free tools to aid students and researchers in searching through the archives of the paper.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Phase I.</strong> is to scan every issue from every year of <cite>The Liberator</cite> from microfilm sources and to make facsimile PDFs available online for free at <a href="http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/">fair-use.org/the-liberator</a>. If the fundraiser is fully funded, <strong>we should be able to add about two new volumes&#8217; worth of facsimile PDFs each week, and complete Phase I by August 2014</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Phase II.</strong> is to prepare a <em>free, online hypertext index</em> of <cite>The Liberator</cite>, similar to the Individuals and Titles and Periodicals sections of <a href="http://libertyindex.fair-use.org/note/Main_Page">Wendy McElroy&#8217;s indispensable Comprehensive Index to <cite>LIBERTY</cite></a>. The index will provide an easily searchable, easily browseable and interlinked complete table of contents for every issue of <cite>The Liberator</cite> and an index of names, book titles and periodical titles appearing in its pages. If we reach our stretch goals for the fundraiser, then the fundraiser will cover most of the labor cost for Phase II as well as for the scanning project. After Phase I is complete, I should be able to work out a plausible timeline for completing Phase II, but my guess at this point is that it could possibly be completed by the end of the year.</li>

<li><strong>Phase III.</strong> would be to begin to <em>transcribe individual articles and columns from the PDF facsimiles into lightweight, standards-based, linkable searchable HTML</em>. This will be an immense amount of work and  systematic effort to complete it will be a bit down the road. We&#8217;ll do another round of fundraising to support the Phase III transcriptions once Phase I. is complete and Phase II. is in progress.</li>
</ul>

<h3>About <cite>The Liberator</cite></h3>

<p>Garrison&#8217;s <a href="http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/"><cite class="journal">Liberator</cite></a>, running from 1831–1865, was the most prominent periodical of radical Abolition in the united states. Proclaiming, in <a href="http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/1831/01/01/the-liberator-01-01.pdf">the first issue</a>, that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8230; I am aware, that many object to the severity of my language; but is there not cause for severity? I <em>will</em> be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this subject, I do not wish to think, or speak, or write, with moderation. No! no! Tell a man whose house is on fire, to give a moderate alarm; tell him to moderately rescue his wife from the hand of the ravisher; tell the mother to gradually extricate her babe from the fire into which it has fallen; &#8212; but urge me not to use moderation in a cause like the present. I am in earnest &#8212; I will not equivocate &#8212; I will not excuse &#8212; I will not retreat a single inch &#8212; <strong>AND I WILL BE HEARD.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Together with the circle of black and white radicals that his paper attracted, Garrison&#8217;s <cite>Liberator</cite> helped  to organize, and offered a forum for, the Abolitionist movement that spent the next 35 years working for the immediate emancipation of all slaves, condemning racial prejudice and <a href="http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/1847/06/11/american-colorphobia">&#8220;American Colorphobia,&#8221;</a> and insisting that emancipation could only truly come about by inspiring a radical moral and social transformation. It urged a politics of radicalizing conscience, and denied that electoral gamesmanship, partisan politics, or political compromise would ever bring about liberation on their own. In the age of the Fugitive Slave Acts, the Garrisonians denounced the united states Constitution as a weapon of the slavers, <strong>&#8220;A Compromise with Death and an Agreement with Hell.&#8221;</strong> Rejecting the use of either political or military power as a means of overcoming the slave system, they argued for <a href="http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/1855/06/15/on-the-dissolution-of-the-union">Disunion</a> (&#8220;No Union with Slaveholders, religiously or politically&#8221;), holding that the <em>Northern free states</em> should secede from the Union, thus peacefully withdrawing the Federal economic, political and military support that the Slave Power depended on, and (they argued) driving the slave system to collapse, by kicking out the Constitutional compromises that propped it up. Garrison and his circle, in the face of condemnation from more conservative anti-slavery activists, also constantly drew parallels and connections between the struggle against slavery and other struggles for social liberation, taking early and courageous stances in defense of <a href="http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/1853/10/28/womens-rights">women&#8217;s rights</a> and <a href="http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/1838/09/28/declaration-of-sentiments-adopted-by-the-peace-convention">international peace</a>.</p>

<p>If you have access to microfilm and scanning equipment, you could also help the project immensely by <a href="http://fair-use.org/contact">contacting us at fair-use.org</a> about hosting any alternative page-scans of some issues &#8212; as with any 19th century periodical, many of the issues that I&#8217;m scanning already had blemishes, tears or folds on the pages when they were preserved in microfilm, and if any parts of the text are illegible in our edition (the <cite>American Periodical Series</cite> microfilm collection, University Microfilms International, Ann Arbor, Mich., as found in the <a href="http://www.lib.auburn.edu/">Auburn University Libraries</a> in Auburn, Ala.) I&#8217;d love to have alternative page-scans of those issues from other sources.</p>

<p>Thanks for anything you can do. And as always, <a href="http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/">read, cite, and enjoy!</a></p>

<div class="body">
<p class="first">Many psychological situationists<sup>[<a href="#shocking-results-n-1" class="footnoted" id="to-shocking-results-n-1">1</a>]</sup>  like to push social-psychology experiments as proof that most people don&#8217;t have, or perhaps even couldn&#8217;t have, robust character traits. So, for example, they&#8217;ll cite the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_Experiment">Milgram experiment</a>, supposedly to show how people mostly do not stick to traits of compassion or kindness towards the <q>learner</q> when the lab-coat authority tells them that they have to hurt him. </p>

<p>And maybe this does show that a lot of middle-class Americans lack a <em>particular character trait</em>. Perhaps a lot of middle-class Americans aren&#8217;t as reliably compassionate and as kind as you might hope. But hell man, I already knew that. On the other hand, if you&#8217;re trying to push the idea that studies like Milgram undermines the idea that people have, or that they could could form, robust character traits, that seems like a <span lang="la">non sequitur</span>. One of the obvious results that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Obedience-Authority-Experimental-Perennial-Classics/dp/006176521X?tag=radgeek-20">Milgram himself took from his study</a> is that a lot of people (including a lot of middle-class Americans) have a really robust, situationally-insensitive character trait of <em>obedience</em>, a trait which is so robust that for a large minority it persisted even up to the point where they honestly believed they were torturing or killing a person in the other room.</p>

<p>The fact that this character trait is a <em>vice</em> doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not a robust and stable character trait. It looks like quite a robust and stable character trait. The question is whether it&#8217;s possible to make that trait <em>less</em> robust; and also  and whether it&#8217;s possible to cultivate different traits, which might look more like decency and virtues. If it&#8217;s possible to be so hella committed to obedience at all costs, then maybe it&#8217;s possible to become committed to other things which are not genocidally awful.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the past three years, Rich and 3,000 other average people have been quietly making probability estimates about everything from Venezuelan gas subsidies to North Korean politics as part of <a href="http://www.goodjudgmentproject.com/">the Good Judgment Project</a>, an experiment put together by three well-known psychologists and some people inside the intelligence community.</p>
  
  <p><ins class="ellipsis editorial" title="[Elision by the editor.]">.&#160;.&#160;.</ins> For most of his professional career, Tetlock studied the problems associated with expert decision making. His book Expert Political Judgment is considered a classic, and almost everyone in the business of thinking about judgment speaks of it with unqualified awe.</p>
  
  <p>All of his studies brought Tetlock to at least two important conclusions.</p>
  
  <p>First, if you want people to get better at making predictions, you need to keep score of how accurate their predictions turn out to be, so they have concrete feedback.</p>
  
  <p>But also, if you take a large crowd of different people with access to different information and pool their predictions, you will be in much better shape than if you rely on a single very smart person, or even a small group of very smart people.</p>
  
  <p><q>The wisdom of crowds is a very important part of this project, and it&#8217;s an important driver of accuracy,</q> Tetlock said.</p>
  
  <p>According to one report, the predictions made by the Good Judgment Project are often better even than intelligence analysts with access to classified information, and many of the people involved in the project have been astonished by its success at making accurate predictions.</p>
  
  <p><ins class="ellipsis editorial" title="[Elision by the editor.]">.&#160;.&#160;.</ins> <q>There&#8217;s a lot of noise, a lot of statistical random variation,</q> Tetlock said. <q>But it&#8217;s random variation around a signal, a true signal, and when you add all of the random variation on each side of the true signal together, you get closer to the true signal.</q></p>
  
  <p>In other words, there are errors on every side of the mark, but there is a truth at the center that people are responding to, and if you average a large number of predictions together, the errors will end up canceling each other out, and you are left with a more accurate guess.</p>
  
  <p>That is the wisdom of the crowd.</p>
  
  <p>The point of the Good Judgment Project was to figure out if what was true for the dead ox is true for world events as well.</p>
  
  <p>It is.</p>
  
  <p>In fact, Tetlock and his team have even engineered ways to significantly improve the wisdom of the crowd — all of which greatly surprised Jason Matheny, one of the people in the intelligence community who got the experiment started.</p>
  
  <p><q>They&#8217;ve shown that you can significantly improve the accuracy of geopolitical forecasts, compared to methods that had been the state of the art before this project started,</q> he said.</p>
  
  <p>What&#8217;s so challenging about all of this is the idea that you can get very accurate predictions about geopolitical events without access to secret information. In addition, access to classified information doesn&#8217;t automatically and necessarily give you an edge over a smart group of average citizens doing Google searches from their kitchen tables.</p>
  
  <p class="attribution">&#8212;&#8201;Alix Spiegel, <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2014/04/02/297839429/-so-you-think-youre-smarter-than-a-cia-agent"><cite class="article">So You Think You&#8217;re Smarter Than A CIA Agent</cite></a> (2 April 2014), <cite>NPR Parallels</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s nice to see closer attention to this in ongoing research. It ought to be completely unsurprising to hear these results, though. The basics of the wisdom-of-crowds findings are well-established by now, even old hat. So it should not be surprising that when you let a lot of people look at a problem, they often do better than the predictions of official experts. If folks are still agog that jes&#8217; folks might do better at predicting than spies with access to <q>classified information,</q> then it may be because they have too much of a science-fiction picture of how intelligence agencies actually work, and too much of a picture of intelligence agencies as omnicompetent, omniscient secret conspiracies &#8212; as if the most significant information for predicting world events were some secret world of deep, dark esoteric truths that are locked away in <q>classified</q> files, which give them some immense and systematic advantage over jes&#8217; folks without access to such files. But that&#8217;s not how it works. The overwhelming majority of intel analysis has nothing to do with classified information in the first place; it has to do with the completely unsexy reality of systematically gathering publicly available information from foreign newspapers, television, statistical abstracts, etc. There&#8217;s no reason to think that privileged government experts have an advantage in doing that; the image of spy agencies as omniscient forces in control of secret wisdom has much more to do with politics than it does with practical reality.</p>

<p>So I just stumbled across this passage today; it&#8217;s kind of like a perfect addendum to the <q>Xenophobia and Anarchophobia</q> / <q>U.S. vs. Them</q> section of <a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2009/11/08/no-borders-no-state/">my old No Borders / No State presentation</a>, reheated, perfectly seasoned and cooked up together with everything I have to say about worker-owned, informal-sector food vendors and disruptive social and economic agoras.</p>
