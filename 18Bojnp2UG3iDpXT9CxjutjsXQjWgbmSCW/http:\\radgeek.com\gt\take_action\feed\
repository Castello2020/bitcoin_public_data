<p class="first">From <a href="http://blog.fair-use.org/2014/02/21/the-liberator-1835-1839-1851-available-pdf/">time</a> to <a href="http://blog.fair-use.org/2013/03/04/liberator-vols-3-4-now-available/">time</a> I have <a href="http://blog.fair-use.org/2013/01/21/volumes-i-and-ii-of-the-liberator-now-available-in-facsimile-pdfs/">mentioned</a> my ongoing project of <a href="http://fair-use.org/the-liberator">making full issues of William Lloyd Garrison&#8217;s <cite>The Liberator</cite></a> available at <code>fair-use.org</code>. <cite>The Liberator</cite> is big (52-53 issues every year, for 35 years!) and the project has progressed at a slow pace. But <a href="http://blog.fair-use.org/2014/05/08/the-liberator-scanning-project-week-1/">I&#8217;m happy to announce</a> that that should be picking up &#8212; thanks to a break from other obligations, a fundraiser to cover the costs through the Molinari Institute, and generous contributions from supporters all over the Internet <a href="http://blog.fair-use.org/2014/05/08/the-liberator-scanning-project-week-1/">the <cite>Liberator</cite> scanning project has added 105 new issues to the online archive</a>, and should be able to proceed much more quickly and steadily from here on out &#8212; it&#8217;s on pace to get <em>every issue of <cite>The Liberator</cite> available in full, online, for free, by the beginning of August 2014</em>. Want to help make that happen?</p>

<p><strong>Here&#8217;s the deal.</strong> When the fundraiser project started, thanks to occasional scanning when I had the time to volunteer, <code>fair-use.org</code> had ten years&#8217; worth of <cite>The Liberator</cite> online: Volumes I.-IX. (1830-1839) and Volume XXI. (Jan.-Dec. 1851). In order to finish the remaining 25 years&#8217; worth of issues this summer &#8212; instead of sometime around 2019 &#8212; we&#8217;re raising funds through our fiscal sponsor, the <a href="http://praxeology.net/molinari.htm">Molinari Institute</a> &#8212; in order to get the scans online and begin to prepare an extensive, open, free and researcher-friendly archive and index for anyone who wants to learn more about radical abolitionism and the history of American social movements. The fundraiser will cover the labor costs for the scanning and the increased web hosting costs for what&#8217;s likely to become a very widely used web resource.</p>

<p>Thanks to generous donations from 8 donors, the Liberator Scanning Project has already raised over 10% of the goal &#8212; $246 out of the projected $2,000 budget. And thanks to those donations, <strong>I&#8217;ve already been able to add two new volumes</strong> &#8212; <a href="http://fair-use.org/the-liberator">Volume X. and Volume XI. of <cite>The Liberator</cite> (1840-1841)</a> &#8212; to the online archive at <a href="http://fair-use.org/the-liberator">fair-use.org/the-liberator</a>. The project is on track to add the next two volumes (XII. and XIII.) by the end of this week.</p>

<h3>About the project:</h3>

<p>The goal is to make every issue of <cite>The Liberator</cite>, from 1831-1865, available in full, online, for free, and to add free tools to aid students and researchers in searching through the archives of the paper.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Phase I.</strong> is to scan every issue from every year of <cite>The Liberator</cite> from microfilm sources and to make facsimile PDFs available online for free at <a href="http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/">fair-use.org/the-liberator</a>. If the fundraiser is fully funded, <strong>we should be able to add about two new volumes&#8217; worth of facsimile PDFs each week, and complete Phase I by August 2014</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Phase II.</strong> is to prepare a <em>free, online hypertext index</em> of <cite>The Liberator</cite>, similar to the Individuals and Titles and Periodicals sections of <a href="http://libertyindex.fair-use.org/note/Main_Page">Wendy McElroy&#8217;s indispensable Comprehensive Index to <cite>LIBERTY</cite></a>. The index will provide an easily searchable, easily browseable and interlinked complete table of contents for every issue of <cite>The Liberator</cite> and an index of names, book titles and periodical titles appearing in its pages. If we reach our stretch goals for the fundraiser, then the fundraiser will cover most of the labor cost for Phase II as well as for the scanning project. After Phase I is complete, I should be able to work out a plausible timeline for completing Phase II, but my guess at this point is that it could possibly be completed by the end of the year.</li>

<li><strong>Phase III.</strong> would be to begin to <em>transcribe individual articles and columns from the PDF facsimiles into lightweight, standards-based, linkable searchable HTML</em>. This will be an immense amount of work and  systematic effort to complete it will be a bit down the road. We&#8217;ll do another round of fundraising to support the Phase III transcriptions once Phase I. is complete and Phase II. is in progress.</li>
</ul>

<h3>About <cite>The Liberator</cite></h3>

<p>Garrison&#8217;s <a href="http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/"><cite class="journal">Liberator</cite></a>, running from 1831–1865, was the most prominent periodical of radical Abolition in the united states. Proclaiming, in <a href="http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/1831/01/01/the-liberator-01-01.pdf">the first issue</a>, that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8230; I am aware, that many object to the severity of my language; but is there not cause for severity? I <em>will</em> be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this subject, I do not wish to think, or speak, or write, with moderation. No! no! Tell a man whose house is on fire, to give a moderate alarm; tell him to moderately rescue his wife from the hand of the ravisher; tell the mother to gradually extricate her babe from the fire into which it has fallen; &#8212; but urge me not to use moderation in a cause like the present. I am in earnest &#8212; I will not equivocate &#8212; I will not excuse &#8212; I will not retreat a single inch &#8212; <strong>AND I WILL BE HEARD.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Together with the circle of black and white radicals that his paper attracted, Garrison&#8217;s <cite>Liberator</cite> helped  to organize, and offered a forum for, the Abolitionist movement that spent the next 35 years working for the immediate emancipation of all slaves, condemning racial prejudice and <a href="http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/1847/06/11/american-colorphobia">&#8220;American Colorphobia,&#8221;</a> and insisting that emancipation could only truly come about by inspiring a radical moral and social transformation. It urged a politics of radicalizing conscience, and denied that electoral gamesmanship, partisan politics, or political compromise would ever bring about liberation on their own. In the age of the Fugitive Slave Acts, the Garrisonians denounced the united states Constitution as a weapon of the slavers, <strong>&#8220;A Compromise with Death and an Agreement with Hell.&#8221;</strong> Rejecting the use of either political or military power as a means of overcoming the slave system, they argued for <a href="http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/1855/06/15/on-the-dissolution-of-the-union">Disunion</a> (&#8220;No Union with Slaveholders, religiously or politically&#8221;), holding that the <em>Northern free states</em> should secede from the Union, thus peacefully withdrawing the Federal economic, political and military support that the Slave Power depended on, and (they argued) driving the slave system to collapse, by kicking out the Constitutional compromises that propped it up. Garrison and his circle, in the face of condemnation from more conservative anti-slavery activists, also constantly drew parallels and connections between the struggle against slavery and other struggles for social liberation, taking early and courageous stances in defense of <a href="http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/1853/10/28/womens-rights">women&#8217;s rights</a> and <a href="http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/1838/09/28/declaration-of-sentiments-adopted-by-the-peace-convention">international peace</a>.</p>

<p>If you have access to microfilm and scanning equipment, you could also help the project immensely by <a href="http://fair-use.org/contact">contacting us at fair-use.org</a> about hosting any alternative page-scans of some issues &#8212; as with any 19th century periodical, many of the issues that I&#8217;m scanning already had blemishes, tears or folds on the pages when they were preserved in microfilm, and if any parts of the text are illegible in our edition (the <cite>American Periodical Series</cite> microfilm collection, University Microfilms International, Ann Arbor, Mich., as found in the <a href="http://www.lib.auburn.edu/">Auburn University Libraries</a> in Auburn, Ala.) I&#8217;d love to have alternative page-scans of those issues from other sources.</p>

<p>Thanks for anything you can do. And as always, <a href="http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/">read, cite, and enjoy!</a></p>

<p class="first">This upcoming Fall is going to be an exciting season for the <a href="http://distro.libertarianleft.org/">ALL Distro</a>. It begins next in San Diego: I&#8217;m going to be putting on a workshop at the <strong><a href="http://libertopia.org/2013">Libertopia 2013 Festival</a></strong> (August 30 - September 2), on <strong><q>Black-and-Red Markets – How to Build a Gift Agora, or: Left-Libertarian Counter-Economics, Grassroots Mutual Aid and Radical Left Counter-Institutions,</q></strong> which intended as a sort of introduction, for people interested in agorist counter-economics, to some points of productive contact with the grassroots forms of mutual aid, solidarity, and bottom-up counter-institutions emerging from the Anarchist and anti-authoritarian Left, and some expansion and workshopping of <a href="radgeek.com/gt/2009/05/19/motorhome-diariesinterview-agorism-counter-economics/">some of the ideas suggested in the comments on <q>Black-and-Red Markets</q> here</a>. In addition to my talk, I&#8217;m also going to be bringing a trunk full of anarchist and left-libertarian literature with me &#8212; chapbooks from the Distro, <a href="ttp://radgeek.com/gt/2011/10/14/markets-not-capitalism-1st-ed/"><cite>Markets Not Capitalism</cite></a>, books by Gary Chartier and Kevin Carson, and flyers, buttons and magazines on left-libertarianism and counter-economics. I&#8217;ll be working with compas from C4SS to set up a table in the Festival&#8217;s exhibition space. We&#8217;ll be bringing a strong free-market anti-capitalist presence to Libertopia, passing out literature, selling books, spreading ideas, answering some questions and starting some conversations about left-wing market anarchist ideas.</p>

<p>This is just the kick-off for a season of travelling, talking, and spread the word: the Distro will be be distributing our literature and talking about individualist anarchism at the <strong>New Orleans Anarchist Bookfair</strong> and <strong>SFL Regional Conferences</strong> in October; I&#8217;ll be travelling to give a talk on Anarchism at the <strong>University of Oklahoma in Norman, OK</strong> this November; I&#8217;ll be making a research and literature-gathering journey to the <strong>Labadie Collection</strong> in Ann Arbor, Michigan; and there may be more to announce soon. More on all of that soon. But for now, we&#8217;re trying to cover the costs for Libertopia, and to replenish our travel budget, so that we can keep up with scholarship, speaking and traveling for a busy Fall season. <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/all-libertopia-2013">Here are the costs we&#8217;re trying to cover</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>To pay <strong>transportation and lodging costs</strong> to get the Charles Johnson and the ALL Distro from Auburn, Alabama to the festival in San Diego, California (approx. costs $800)</li>
<li>To rent an <strong>exhibition booth</strong> at the conference for our literature and for person-to-person outreach (cost: $400).</li>
<li>To cover out-of-pocket <strong>transportation &amp; lodging</strong> expenses for other Molinari Institute speakers who will be presenting workshops or panels at Libertopia (approx. costs $1,000).<sup>[<a href="#all-libertopia-n-1" class="footnoted" id="to-all-libertopia-n-1">1</a>]</sup></li>
<li>To replenish the Institute&#8217;s travel budget and provide <strong>seed money</strong> for our upcoming travel to bookfairs, speaking appearances, research, etc. (approx costs $600).</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.gofundme.com/all-libertopia-2013">You can help out here</a>, or by using the widget over on the right. Help us ALL get to Libertopia!</p>

<p>Thanks! And tell your friends. Anything you can chip in will help us a lot during the upcoming season. Hope to see y&#8217;ALL there!</p>

But there is a real chance to save the store now, and to help it not only continue as a used bookstore and event space, but also to expand into a new arts space (in the emerging Arts District in downtown Opelika).  A donor has come forward with a new, low-rent location, so Gnu&#8217;s Room is trying to <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/savethegnusroom/save-the-gnus-room">raise some money between now and <strong>June 15</strong> which would allow them to cover the fixed costs of the move</a>, and so to keep the bookstore in operation. Here&#8217;s more from the Kickstarter campaign page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Gnu&#8217;s Room:</strong> a non-profit bookstore and community art space has been the cornerstone of our independent arts community in Auburn, AL.</p>
  
  <p>Due to the difficulties of high urban rent and waning financial support, The Gnu&#8217;s Room is struggling to make ends meet and fulfill its mission of promoting literacy and the arts in Southeast Alabama. Our community is heavily marginalized in the predominant culture of today&#8230; and those who love books, independent films, and local music have got to come together and show their support!</p>
  
  <p>We are trying to raise the seed money to move <strong>The Gnu&#8217;s Room</strong> into a huge, low-cost warehouse space in the new <em>Arts District of Opelika</em> (supported by the <em>Alabama Arts Council</em>, <em>The Railyard</em> independent venue, and the future <em>Cotton Seed Studios</em>)</p>
  
  <p><strong>But we need help to make this move possible!</strong></p>
  
  <p>Pledges of varying amounts can earn you rewards like <em>free books</em>, <em>tickets to our benefit concert</em>, <em>local artwork, and genuine ivory scrimshaw bookmarks</em>&#8230;. Plus the added reward of keeping our artistic community strong and well&#8230;</p>
  
  <p>Don&#8217;t let our favorite meeting place for all things artistic, inspirational, and happily weird disappear! <strong>The Gnu&#8217;s Room</strong> plays a vital role in serving the area with rare volumes of nearly-forgotten wisdom and creating more arts through their publishing house, <em>Solomon &amp; George Publishers</em>. We want to use the freedom of the <em>Opelika Arts District</em> space to expand community services to include e-publication archiving of these rare works, i.e. the Gnu Library, in-house printing services, art galleries, and a scrap exchange program for resident artists. <ins class="ellipsis editorial" title="[Elision by the editor.]">.&#160;.&#160;.</ins> The biggest challenge facing our organization is pursuing often non-existent arts funding in our state and region. We hope to overcome that difficulty by providing useful services in a retail format. For example: We re-sell donated books in our bookstore. The Scrap Exchange will sort and recycle materials to bring low cost arts-and-crafts, packaging, and garden supplies to our proactive community members. <ins class="ellipsis editorial" title="[Elision by the editor.]">.&#160;.&#160;.</ins> The new location will create not just more opportunities for our mission, but continue our ability to provide a common meeting place for the forum of artistic and creative solutions.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The campaign has until <strong>June 15, 2013</strong> to reach their fundraising goal. As of press time, there&#8217;s about $2,500 left to go in order to meet it. I just backed the project myself; if you can, please consider backing it with me, and help us save this precious community space, one of the long-time strongest supporters and most open forums for the arts, culture and philosophy in the Auburn-Opelika community.<sup>[<a href="#save-the-gnus-room-save-the-world-n-1" class="footnoted" id="to-save-the-gnus-room-save-the-world-n-1">1</a>]</sup></p>

From the post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The absolutely devastating impact of the Tornados in Oklahoma has prompted a concentrated relief effort for those who have suffered in this region. There is no limit to who you can help or what you can do… but please do something. Many #AmeriSec members and other humanitarian groups will be on scene to help in anyway we can. This is an operation that all can assist with and if money, transportation or any issues that would hinder you from being able to help please, use social media, video and any other means to KEEP the word moving. As we have seen with #OccupySandy the impact of individuals helping with natural disaster has a tremendous impact… So Please assist in any way you can. WE ARE LEGION and WE have the ability to assist in the suffering on the ground so please help!</p>
  
  <p>Please make video and pastebins with information that could assist independent relief workers and all others</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Edit (12pm).</strong> And here&#8217;s some more from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ZakkFlash/posts/10151360118156734">Zakk Flash</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tornadoes touched down last night in Moore, Oklahoma, killing at least 51 people (20 children among them). We can’t control the weather, but we can try to stop climate change before it gets worse, and we can definitely help build solidarity networks to respond to emergency situations. </p>
  
  <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/COBRACollective?directed_target_id=0">Central Oklahoma Black/Red Alliance (COBRA)</a> will be hosting a gathering of folks who are interested in the People&#8217;s response to the disaster. Folks are invited to come by my offices at Community Action (1155 E Main, Norman OK 73071) at noon today to discuss the current response from the Red Cross, organized labor, faith-based communities, and the like. </p>
  
  <p>We&#8217;ll also be discussing decentralized relief and creative opportunities to help folks most affected by the storm. Not everyone is connected or comfortable working with NGOs and there are independent efforts that can make a huge difference. Look at Occupy Sandy as an example.</p>
  
  <p>In the meantime, if you have any type of medical background/credentials and want to help relief efforts, get to the Warren Theater. If you don’t have medical credentials but want to help, get to the Home Depot in Moore.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If you want to help people in the area affected by the tornados, strongly consider offering support wherever possible, and wherever they ask for it, from decentralized, grassroots mutual aid groups like these. (They need your help a lot more than well-funded, bureaucratically organized efforts like Red Cross or Salvation Army.) Ordinary people working together in solidarity can accomplish remarkable, life-saving things.</p>

<p class="first">In Baltimore, <a href="http://www.redemmas.org/">Red Emma&#8217;s</a> has some big plans, and they are looking for some grassroots support to build out their worker-owned radical bookstore, café and community space.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s more from the Red Emma&#8217;s collective, <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/redemmas2?c=home">via IndieGogo</a>. As you may know, one of the harshest restraints on most worker-owned shops, co-ops and radical spaces are the extreme difficulties they have in paying for maintenance and expansions &#8212; you need resources to expand but you need to expand to get access to resources, and it&#8217;s hard to get bank loans, credit, or any other form of capitalization when you don&#8217;t look like a traditional corporate capitalist enterprise. That doesn&#8217;t mean it can&#8217;t be done but it does mean if it&#8217;s going to happen it largely depends on <em>us</em> and our networks to step up and put up the mutual support for the kinds of radical spaces that we want to see, that their institutions won&#8217;t fund. Anyway, the campaign is running now over at IndieGoGo, and <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/redemmas2?c=home"><em>any</em> support you can send their way</a> will really help with what sounds like some really awesome plans.</p>

<div class="figure">

</div>

<blockquote>
  <p>After 8 years in the storefront at 800 Saint Paul, Red Emma&#8217;s has decided it&#8217;s time to move: our current space just isn&#8217;t big enough to hold all the things we want to collectively make it do.</p>
  
  <p>Over the past eight years, we&#8217;ve hosted a thousand public events, created two new radical spaces (2640 and the Baltimore Free School), organized international conferences, built an amazing annual radical bookfair, and served as a hub knitting together Baltimore&#8217;s different politically engaged communities, all the while keeping a collectively-owned and operated business open just about 365 days a year.</p>
  
  <p>&#8230; We&#8217;ve just signed a lease for the fall of 2013; located at 30 West North Avenue, next door to Liam Flynn&#8217;s Ale House (itself started by founding Red Emma&#8217;s collective members!), the new space will be over five times the size of our current location. </p>
  
  <p>We&#8217;ll be expanding our food operation to a full kitchen, moving beyond our current limited cafe menu to really let some of the culinary talent we&#8217;ve got in the collective shine.  And we&#8217;ll be doing this in a way that makes extensive use of locally sourced agricultural products while keeping prices affordable: healthy, sustainable food should be the norm, not a luxury. We&#8217;ll be increasing the footprint of our bookstore sixfold—space constraints alone have prevented us from building the world class selection we&#8217;ve dreamed of, and the new space will make it possible to really build the kind of radical bookstore Baltimore deserves.</p>
  
  <p>&#8230; The space is going to be far more welcoming; not only are we going to vastly expand the number of seats, we&#8217;ll also be full-accessible in the new space &#8230; And most importantly, scaling up is going to let us do something we&#8217;ve always dreamt of: pay the people working on the project a living wage. Our current storefront has never been big enough to reach the economies of scale we would have needed to keep funding our political mission and also pay ourselves something sustainable for the long-term; most of us work on a volunteer basis right now, and those of us who do get paid don&#8217;t get much. With the new space, our plan is to start with a living wage and work our way up from there.   </p>
  
  <h3>Our plan and your help</h3>
  
  <p>Between renovations, equipment purchases, licensing, and other fees, we need roughly $250,000 to open this new space; we&#8217;re hoping to raise <em>at least</em> $50,000 through crowdfunding on this site, but the more we can raise here the less debt we will start off with in the new space.  While the funds we raise here and elsewhere are crucial, there&#8217;s going to be all sorts of opportunities to pitch in to help us get the new space off the ground in other ways as we get closer to opening.  Keep up with the status of the project by following us on <a href="http://twitter.com/redemmas">Twitter</a>, liking us on <a href="http://facebook.com/redemmas">Facebook</a>, or <a href="http://redemmas.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/all">subscribing to our mailing list</a>.</p>

<div class="illustration">
<a href="http://www.redandblackcafe.com"><img src="http://radgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/red-and-black-cafe.jpg" alt="" title="The Red &amp; Black Cafe" /></a>
</div>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you&#8217;re not familiar, the <a href="http://www.redandblackcafe.com/about/">Red &amp; Black</a> is a worker-owned co-operative restaurant in Portland, Oregon. The food&#8217;s all vegan; the ingredients are mostly organic, and either locally sourced or Fair Trade. The worker-owners are organized as an IWW shop, and directly manage their own workplace. It&#8217;s also an important hub for the anarchist community in Portland, providing a venue for regular talks, films, and other community events. I just sent $50; which is more than I can really afford right now, but the Red &amp; Black, and places like it, matter. A lot. <em>Any</em> mutual aid you can send their way &#8212; or anyone you can tell about this situation &#8212; will really help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a follow-up, here is a note that the folks at Red &amp; Black posted a few days ago to <a href="http://www.redandblackcafe.com/">their website</a> and to their Facebook page. I&#8217;d link directly, but it appears that the permalinking on their website is broken; so instead:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A little over a month ago we alerted our friends and allies that the Red &amp; Black Cafe was in trouble. We had reached a crisis point, were unable to pay our mortgage, and we made the difficult decision to stop paying ourselves. We’re happy to say, that there’s light at the end of the tunnel. At this point we’re treading water and are figuring out when we can pay ourselves again.</p>
  
  <p>This is due to our own grit and determination to survive and because of the outpouring of support in the form of donations and increased business. But also in the form of help. Help with things like design work, cutting our ingredient costs, &amp; setting up amazing events…</p>
  
  <p style="text-align: center">The Red &#038; Black clearly matters to a lot of folks!</p>
  
  <p><strong>We’re a quarter of the way to our goal of $20,000. So we’re kicking up our fundraising drive and we need even more help to reach outside of our immediate communities. We also have some awesome project ideas and could use help getting them off the ground. If you’ve got some skills, and/or know of someone who can help us out, contact us! Spread the word.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Tell your friends, family, co-workers, and that person you just met why you think we’re special!</p>
  
  <p>Here are some suggestions but please do add your own:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>100% vegan food &amp; drink. We are a space that is unapologetically for animal liberation. We regularly host fundraisers, prisoner letter writing nights and animal lib speakers and workshops. We’re also friendly to omnivores and, we hope, informative and not preachy on the subject.</li>
  <li>Safer space: We’re committed to supporting survivors of sexual assault and relationship abuse. We are also committed to confronting and disrupting oppressive language and behavior in the cafe and we encourage the same from you or anyone else who sees it.</li>
  <li>The Red &amp; Black is welcoming to folks who are houseless. Whether or not you have an address you are welcome to: use the bathroom w/o buying something first, have free wifi, charge your phone, use the free computer terminals, get hot water, come to events or meet your friend. We are working with Sisters of the Road to explore the possibility of accepting EBT (foodstamps/snap) from houseless folks, people over 60 and people on SSI! It’s not a sure thing but we’re making every effort to figure this out.</li>
  <li>Environmental stuff: We pick up coffee and supplies by massive, amazing bike trailer. Our produce is local, organic and bike delivered! We serve food from the lowest trophic level!</li>
  <li>Labor movement &amp; co-op stuff: We’re an Industrial Workers of the World closed shop (100% union members), we’re worker owned, there’s no boss and we’re all paid the same wage for the same work. Every participates in the day to day restaurant work as well as the behind the scenes work. We act in solidarity with labor every chance we get. This includes buying authentically fair trade coffee from Equal Exchange, another worker owned co-op. We participate in regional and national worker co-op efforts through the USFederation of Worker Co-ops.</li>

</div>

<p class="first">I just read this note from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/redandblackcafe">Red &amp; Black Cafe&#8217;s page on Facebook</a>. If you&#8217;re not familiar, the <a href="http://www.redandblackcafe.com/about/">Red &amp; Black</a> is a worker-owned co-operative restaurant in Portland, Oregon. The food&#8217;s all vegan; the ingredients are mostly organic, and either locally sourced or Fair Trade. The worker-owners are organized as an IWW shop, and directly manage their own workplace. It&#8217;s also an important hub for the anarchist community in Portland, providing a venue for regular talks, films, and other community events. I just sent $50; which is more than I can really afford right now, but the Red &amp; Black, and places like it, matter. A lot. <em>Any</em> mutual aid you can send their way &#8212; or anyone you can tell about this situation &#8212; will really help. (The website doesn&#8217;t seem to have a post about the current situation yet; but you should be able to use <a href="http://www.redandblackcafe.com/help-us-replace-our-busted-window/">the PayPal donation buttons in this post</a>. I just attached a note to the donation asking them to put it to use wherever it would be most helpful.)</p>

<p>From the Red &amp; Black collective, via Facebook:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Red &amp; Black is in trouble. Our finances have reached a crisis point. This situation has been brewing for many months as our cash flow slowly dried up. To be blunt: we are unable to make our mortgage payment on time and we’ve bounced checks to some of our vendors and staff. A couple of days ago at our collective meeting we contemplated shutting our doors for good.</p>
  
  <p>So what happened? Like many other local restaurants after 4+ years of recession (depression?): we need more business. In this economy many people have less money to eat out. Our situation is compounded by the fact that we have never had anything near a comfortable amount of working capital. We attempted to raise sufficient capital during the fundraising drive we held when we decided to buy our building. While we did raise enough money to make our down payment, we were far from our goal. This left the collective financially vulnerable to the point that a slow month could bankrupt us. <ins class="ellipsis editorial" title="[Elision by the editor.]">.&#160;.&#160;.</ins></p>
  
  <p>While there are several things we do that don’t make a lot of business sense, financially, they are things we refuse to compromise on. We are welcoming to unhoused folks who often can’t afford to spend money at the cafe. We make most of our food from scratch which is labor intensive and because our ingredients are (mostly) organic, they are more expensive.</p>
  
  <p>We are also much more than just a restaurant. We are a community space; specifically we are a radical, queer-positive safer space; an important hub for many overlapping grassroots political projects, a cop-free zone, an amazing vegan restaurant, a music venue, a hangout and meeting space for Industrial Workers of the World union members, a low income collective household upstairs— the list goes on.</p>
  
  <p>In order to meet this challenge head on we’re making changes that we believe will not only avert catastrophe, but put us on a path of financial sustainability. The most dramatic and immediate change is that we’ve decided to work without pay until we can turn this situation around. This decision is both difficult and easy to make. Difficult because we, as individuals, can’t afford it for long and because we are a closed union shop with the goal of paying ourselves a living wage. But the decision is also easy because the alternative is something none of us want: losing the Red and Black.</p>
  
  <p>So we are fundraising $20,000 in donations, gift certificates and merchandise sales. This amount would not only cover our current obligations, it would mean having an adequate amount of working capital for the first time. We would be able to afford to go back to a paid wage, to purchase adequate equipment, fix the window, and keep the building. This is a crucial time for the Red and Black and we need your help! <ins class="ellipsis editorial" title="[Elision by the editor.]">.&#160;.&#160;.</ins></p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>URGENT ACTION</h3>
  
  <h3>TRADE UNION LEADER KILLED, OTHERS IN DANGER</h3>
  
  <p>A trade union leader was shot dead on 24 March in Guatemala City, together with three other men. He may have been targeted for his trade union activities. Other members of the trade union may be in grave danger.</p>
  
  <p>Luis Ovidio Ortíz Cajas was shot on 24 March at around 8.30pm as he walked to a shop near his home in the capital, Guatemala City. He was a public relations secretary of the Executive Committee of the National Trade Union of Health Workers (<span lang="es">Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Salud de Guatemala</span> – <abbr>SNTSG</abbr>). A group of men were playing cards outside the shop. As Ovidio Ortíz was about to go into the shop, a young man got out of a white sedan car and started shooting at him and the group playing cards, with what a local source said was a 9mm pistol. Another local source said that Ovidio Ortíz was shot about eight times, twice in the head and six times in his upper torso. The other men who died as a result of the attack were: a farmer, Bildave Santos Barco, who was shot twice in the head and died instantly; Fredy Leonel Estrada Mazariegos and Oscar Alexander Rodríguez Lima who died later in hospital. Two other men were wounded.</p>
  
  <p>The trade union of which Ovidio Ortíz was a member has campaigned for many years on issues of corruption in the management of the country&#8217;s public health facilities, and in December 2010 filed an official complaint against the previous Minister of Health, accusing him of corruption. On 22 March the trade union&#8217;s Executive Committee reached an agreement with the Ministry of Labour regarding seniority-based annual pay rises (<span la="spa">bono de antigüedad</span>) for health sector employees.</p>
  
  <p>Please write immediately in Spanish or your own language:</p>
  
  <p>Call on the authorities to order an independent, thorough and impartial investigation into the killing of Luis Ovidio Ortíz Cajas and the three other men (Bildave Santos Barco, Fredy Leonel Estrada Mazariegos, Oscar Alexander Rodríguez Lima) killed on 24 March, publish the results and bring those responsible to justice;</p>
  
  <p>Urge them to take immediate steps to provide all necessary protection to SNTSG members, in accordance with their wishes;</p>
  
  <p>Remind them that human rights defenders, including trade union leaders, have the right to carry out their activities without any restrictions or fear of reprisals, as set out in the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders.</p>

  <p>Trade unionists in Guatemala face dangerous conditions due to their work on labour rights.</p>
  
  <p>Byron Arreaga, a member of an administrative workers’ trade union, the <span lang="es">Sindicato de Trabajadores Administrativos del Segundo Registro de la Propiedad</span> (Trade Union of Administrative Workers for the Second Property Registrar, <abbr>SITRASEREPRO</abbr>) was shot dead in the north-western city of Quetzaltenango, on 13 September 2011.

<p>Received this morning in my inbox from a friend involved with Nevada Prison Watch. The solidarity e-mail campaign is from Change.org; the notice about the hunger strike comes from <a href="http://www.prisons.org/hungerstrike.htm">California Prison Focus</a>, a member of <a href="http://prisonerhungerstrikesolidarity.wordpress.com/">Prisoner Hunger Strike Solidarity</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>From:</strong> A. Parker<br />
  <strong>Subject:</strong> Please sign the petition to support the demands of the prison hunger strikers in Pelican Bay State Prison, California</p>
  
  <p>Please sign <a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/support-prisoners-on-hunger-strike-at-pelican-bay-state-prison">the petition to support the demands of the prison hunger strikers in Pelican Bay State Prison, California</a>, who will start an indefinite hungerstrike on July 1st.</p>
  
  <p><a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/support-prisoners-on-hunger-strike-at-pelican-bay-state-prison">http://www.change.org/petitions/support-prisoners-on-hunger-strike-at-pelican-bay-state-prison</a></p>
  
  <p>Prisoners in the Security Housing Unit (SHU) at Pelican Bay State Prison (California) are going on an indefinite hunger strike as of July 1, 2011 to protest the cruel and inhumane conditions of their imprisonment.  The hunger strike was organized by prisoners in an unusual show of racial unity.  The hunger strikers developed five core demands.  Briefly they are:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p><strong>Eliminate group punishments.  Instead, practice individual accountability.</strong> When an individual prisoner breaks a rule, the prison often punishes a whole group of prisoners of the same race.  This policy has been applied to keep prisoners in the SHU indefinitely and to make conditions increasingly harsh. </p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Abolish the debriefing policy and modify active/inactive gang status criteria.</strong> Prisoners are accused of being active or inactive participants of prison gangs using false or highly dubious evidence, and are then sent to longterm isolation (SHU). They can escape these tortuous conditions only if they &#8220;debrief,&#8221; that is, provide information on gang activity. Debriefing produces false information (wrongly landing other prisoners in SHU, in an endless cycle) and can endanger the lives of debriefing prisoners and their families.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Comply with the recommendations of the US Commission on Safety and Abuse in Prisons (2006) regarding an end to longterm solitary confinement.</strong>  This bipartisan commission specifically recommended to <q>make segregation a last resort</q> and <q>end conditions of isolation.</q>  Yet as of May 18, 2011, California kept 3,259 prisoners in SHUs and hundreds more in Administrative Segregation waiting for a SHU cell to open up.  Some prisoners have been kept in isolation for more than thirty years. </p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Provide adequate food.</strong>  Prisoners report unsanitary conditions and small quantities of food that do not conform to prison regulations.  There is no accountability or independent quality control of meals.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Expand and provide constructive programs and privileges for indefinite SHU inmates.</strong>  The hunger strikers are pressing for opportunities <q>to engage in self-help treatment, education, religious and other productive activities&#8230;.</q>  Currently these opportunities are routinely denied, even if the prisoners want to pay for correspondence courses themselves.  </p>
  
  <p>Examples of privileges the prisoners want are: one phone call per week, and permission to have sweatsuits and watch caps. (Often warm clothing is denied, though the cells and exercise cage can be bitterly cold.)  All of the privileges mentioned in the demands are already allowed at other SuperMax prisons (in the federal prison system and other states).</p></li>
  </ol>

  <h3>PETITION LETTER</h3>
  
  <p>Grant the 5 Core Demands of the Pelican Bay SHU Hunger Strikers</p>
  
  <p>Dear Warden Lewis, Secretary Cate, and Governor Brown:</p>
  
  <p>We support the prisoners on hunger strike in the Security Housing Unit (SHU) of Pelican Bay State Prison and
  those in other units joining them. We strongly urge you to grant their five core demands as soon as possible.</p>
  
  <p>[Your name]</p>

I&#8217;m sure just about everyone who reads this blog regularly already knows who Roderick is, but for you irregulars out there, he&#8217;s a friend and an old teacher of mine, a left-libertarian, Anarchist philosopher and one of the founders of the <a href="http://all-left.net/">Alliance of the Libertarian Left</a>, and a swell guy who definitely doesn&#8217;t deserve anything like this. Nobody deserves anything like this, but this in particular hurts. So let&#8217;s do some mutual aid and go ALL out for a comrade and a friend.</p>

<p>Please pass the word about this to anyone who might be able to help in any amount. (Not many people can chip in $8,000 for random anarchists in distress, but there might be a few hundred people who can chip in $20 in the name of mutual aid, which comes to the same thing.) Also, if you know anyone who might be able to help with the legal situation, please pass the word along.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="http://aaeblog.com/2009/07/22/wtf-update/">Read this update on the situation.</a> It looks like it may be the government-cartel Credit Mafia rather than the Tax Mafia that inflicted the levy based on a decades-old bill with no notice or warning. The original document says one thing; the creditor&#8217;s attorney now claims another. Either way, Roderick could still use the help.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>
<h3>Request for Emergency Help</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve never asked for money on my blog before, but I&#8217;ve just been hit with a major financial emergency.</p>

<p>Several months ago, the Alabama Department of Revenue decided I&#8217;d underpaid on state taxes from ten years earlier.  (I wasn&#8217;t aware of having done so, but I don&#8217;t have those records any more and so can&#8217;t prove otherwise.)  After they&#8217;d added on interest and late fees, the total due was about $12,000.  I submitted a request form to pay it off in installments; they never said yes or no to the request form, but I kept sending in payments and they kept cashing them, which led me to be more sanguine than in retrospect I should have been.</p>

<p>Then suddenly today, without warning or announcement (either from the tax department or from my bank), the tax department completely cleared out my checking account, <em>and</em> my savings account, <i>and</i> my mother&#8217;s checking account (I guess because we&#8217;re joint on it), leaving me $8000 overdrawn to boot.</p>

<p>I found out the money&#8217;d been taken only by checking my balance online today &#8211; and I had to go to the bank in person to find out it was a tax levy (the online balance had no information about who&#8217;d withdrawn the money).  </p>

<p>My college salary doesn&#8217;t start up again until September, and I have no relatives from whom to borrow, so here I am with no money (or actually, <em>negative</em> $8000) for food, rent, or bills for the rest of the summer. </p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t had a chance to contact either the tax department or a lawyer yet (having spent the afternoon waiting and waiting at my bank), but I&#8217;m not exactly optimistic about getting a swift and favourable resolution.</p>

<p>Which is why I am desperately requesting help.  If you can help, please <em>let me know whether it&#8217;s a gift or a loan</em>, and send either via PayPal:</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="http://aaeblog.com/2009/07/22/wtf-update/#comments">Read this update on the situation.</a> It looks like it may be the government-cartel Credit Mafia rather than the Tax Mafia that inflicted the levy based on a decades-old bill with no notice or warning. The original document says one thing; the creditor&#8217;s attorney now claims another. Either way, Roderick could still use the help.</p>
