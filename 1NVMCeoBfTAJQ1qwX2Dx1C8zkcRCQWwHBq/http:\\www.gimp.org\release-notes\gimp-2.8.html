<h1>GIMP 2.8 Release Notes</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  GIMP&nbsp;2.8 is the result of three years of hard work and
  collaborative development. This version of GIMP is equipped with a
  wealth of new features, including some highly requested ones. Keep
  reading to find out exactly what GIMP&nbsp;2.8 has to offer you in
  areas such as the user interface, tools, and plug-ins.
</p>


<h2>User Interface</h2>

<h3>Single-Window Mode</h3>
<img alt="Single-window mode screenshot" class="right" src="images/2.8-single-window-mode.png" />
<p>
  GIMP&nbsp;2.8 introduces an optional single-window mode. You can
  toggle between the default multi-window mode and the new
  single-window mode through the <i>Single-window mode</i> checkbox in
  the <i>Windows</i> menu. In single-window mode, GIMP will put
  dockable dialogs and images in a single, tabbed image window. The
  single-window mode setting is of course preserved if you quit and
  start GIMP again. Single-window mode removes the necessity for users
  of having to deal with multiple windows. <b>Developers:</b> Martin
  Nordholts, Michael Natterer <b>Interaction Architect:</b> Peter
  Sikking
</p>

<h3>Multi-Column Dock Windows</h3>
<img alt="Multi-column dock windows screenshot" class="right" src="images/2.8-multi-column-dock-windows.png" />
<p>
  GIMP&nbsp;2.8 allows dockable dialogs in a dock window to be placed
  in multiple columns. To create a new column in a dock window, drag
  and drop a dockable dialog on the vertical edges of the dock
  window. This is an appealing feature for multi-monitor users where
  one screen can have a big dock window with all the dialogs and the
  tools, while all images are on other displays. <b>Developer:</b>
  Martin Nordholts <b>Interaction Architect:</b> Peter Sikking
</p>

<h3>More Screen Real Estate For Dockable Dialogs</h3>
<img alt="Removed docking bars screenshot" class="right" src="images/2.8-removed-docking-bars.png" />
<p>
  The docking bars have been removed and replaced with overlaid
  highlights. The dockable drag handle has been removed and the
  dockable menu button has been moved up to the tabs. A new Automatic
  tab style has been added which makes dockable tabs use the available
  space. <b>Developer:</b> Martin Nordholts
</p>

<h3>Save And Export</h3>
<img alt="Save and export screenshot" class="right" src="images/2.8-save-and-export.png" />
<p>
  A rather big conceptual change is that saving and exporting images
  now are clearly separated activities. Saving an image can only be
  done in the XCF format which is GIMP's native file format, able to
  save all kinds of information necessary for works in progress.
</p>
<p>
  To export into other formats <i>File->Export...</i> needs to be used.
  This distinction makes it clearer if all available information is
  stored in a file, or not. There are some optimizations for alternative
  workflows such as opening a jpg, polishing it, and quickly exporting
  back to the original file. This conceptual change has also allowed us
  to get rid of the annoying dialogs that warned about the flatting of
  images when saving to non-layered formats. <b>Developer:</b> Martin
  Nordholts <b>Interaction Architect:</b> Peter Sikking
</p>

<h3>Layer Groups</h3>
<img alt="Layer groups screenshot" class="right" src="images/2.8-layer-groups.png" />
<p>
  For complex compositions, a flat layer structure is very limiting.
  GIMP&nbsp;2.8 lets users organize their compositions better through
  the introduction of layer groups which allow layers to be organized in
  tree-like structures. Layer groups are fully scriptable through the
  GIMP plug-in API. <b>Developer:</b> Michael Natterer
</p>

<h3>Tools Drawn With Cairo</h3>
<img alt="Tools drawn with cairo screenshot" class="right" src="images/2.8-tools-drawn-with-cairo.png" />
<p>
  All tools rendering on canvas have been ported to Cairo to provide
  smooth antialiased graphics and make GIMP's look and feel match
  modern users expectations. All but a few plug-ins have been ported
  over to Cairo as well. Additionally all tools now use an on-canvas
  progress indicator instead of the one in the statusbar.
  <b>Developer:</b> Michael Natterer
</p>

<h3>On-Canvas Text Editing</h3>
<img alt="On-canvas text editing screenshot" class="right" src="images/2.8-on-canvas-text-editing.png" />
<p>
  Text editing with the Text Tool is now performed on-canvas instead
  of in a separate window. The editing on-canvas is rather
  sophisticated: apart from the usual text formatting features like
  font family, style and size selectors you get numeric control over
  baseline offset and kerning, as well as the ability to change text color
  for a selection. You can also use a combination of Alt and arrow
  keys to change baseline offset and kerning. This feature was
  originally developed during Google Summer of Code 2008 and heavily
  improved since. <b>Developers:</b> Daniel Eddeland, Michael Natterer
</p>

<h3>Keyboard Shortcut Changes</h3>
<p>
  Since the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+E and Ctrl+Shift+E have been
  repurposed for the image export mechanisms, new keyboard shortcuts
  have been setup for 'Shrink Wrap' and 'Fit in Window', namely Ctrl+J
  and Ctrl+Shift+J respectively. <b>Developer:</b> Martin Nordholts
</p>

<h3>Simple Math In Size Entries</h3>
<img alt="Math in size entries screenshot" class="right" src="images/2.8-math-in-size-entries.png" />
<p>
  Enhancements have also been made to the size entry widget, which is used for
  inputting most of the x, y, width, height parameters. For example, in the
  scale dialog it is now possible to write '50%' in the Width field to scale
  the image to 50% of the width. Expressions such as '30in&nbsp;+&nbsp;40px'
  and '4&nbsp;*&nbsp;5.4in' work, too. <b>Developer:</b> Fredrik Alströmer
</p>

<h3>Minor Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added 'Windows→Hide docks' menu item that does what 'Tab' does and
    also displays its state, which is now persistent across sessions, too.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added infrastructure allowing to embed user interface elements on
    the canvas. This is currently used for text styles in the text tool,
    and (experimentally) when a color correction tool is invoked while
    the canvas is in full-screen mode.
  </li>
  <li>
    To make dock window titles manageable, only show the active dockable
    in the dock window title.
  </li>
  <li>
    The layer modes have been rearranged into more logical and useful
    groups based on the effect they have on compositing of a
    layer. Layer modes that make the composite lighter are in one group,
    layer modes that make the composite darker in another group, and so
    forth.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can now Alt+Click on layers in the Layers dialog to create a
    selection from it. Add, subtract and intersect modifiers Ctrl, Shift
    and Ctrl+Shift keys work too. This makes it easy to compose contents
    of a layer based on the contents of other layers, without detours.
  </li>
  <li>
    New docks are created at the pointer position.
  </li>
  <li>
    Removed Toolbox from list of Recently Closed Docks, handle that
    directly in the Windows menu.
  </li>
  <li>
    Allow closing the toolbox without closing the whole application.
  </li>
  <li>
    Default to non-fixed-aspect in Canvas Size dialog.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the Preferences dialog, only have one setting for the window hint
    for both the toolbox and the docks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Support arbitrary affine transforms of brushes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Got rid of the Tools dockable and move toolbox configuration to
    Preferences.
  </li>
  <li>
    A question that often arises is how to change the UI language in
    GIMP, which has traditionally been a bit cumbersome. Not any longer,
    it is now possible to change the language in Preferences.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added 'Lock content' button to the layers, channels and paths
    dialogs, made the lock buttons more compact.
  </li>
  <li>
    Allow renaming list items with F2.
  </li>
  <li>
    Allow binding arbitrary actions to extra mouse buttons.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Developers:</b> Michael Natterer, Martin Nordholts, Alexander Jones, Alexia Death, Sven Neumann
</p>



<h2>Tools &amp; Plug-ins</h2>

<h3>Brush System Improvements</h3>
<img alt="Brush system improvements screenshot" class="right" src="images/2.8-brush-system-improvements.png" />
<p>
  The brush dynamics engine has been expanded considerably, making almost
  all aspects of the brush engine drivable by a multitude of inputs,
  all of them configurable with their own response curve.
</p>

<p>
  Because of the expansion, dynamics were separated from tool options
  and converted into a resource in their own right. The Google Summer
  of Code 2009 Advanced GUI for Brush Dynamics project was the start
  of its development. <b>Developers:</b> Alexia Death, Michael
  Natterer, Zhenfeng Zhao
</p>

<h3 class="spillover">Tool Preset Improvements</h3>
<p>
  You can now save existing state of any tool as a preset and give it
  a meaningful name. The presets are accessible from a new Tool
  Presets dockable dialog and additionally can be tagged so that you
  can easily manage a lot of presets.
</p>

<p>
  This new feature completely replaces the previously existing tool
  presets system to a new level of accessibility. It also makes it
  possible to distribute tool presets just like any other resource
  because each preset is saved as an individual
  file. <b>Developers:</b> Michael Natterer, Alexia Death
</p>

<!--
<p>
  A Python script for converting old tool presets to new
  ones will be provided with the next development release.
</p>-->

<h3>Cage Transform Tool</h3>
<img alt="Cage transform tool screenshot" class="right" src="images/2.8-cage-transform-tool.png" />
<p>
  A completely new <em>Cage transform</em> tool has been added thanks
  to the excellent work of one of our Google Summer of Code 2010
  students. The tool implements an innovative approach to free
  transformation and makes it possible to easily warp parts of objects
  using an adjustable user-defined polygonal frame. <b>Developer:</b>
  Michael Muré
</p>

<h3 class="spillover">File Plug-Ins</h3>
<p>
  A plug-in for loading JPEG2000 images has been added, as well as
  plug-ins for X11 Mouse Cursor files and fundamental OpenRaster (.ora)
  import and export support. Added RGB565 support to the csource
  plug-in. <b>Developers:</b> Aurimas Juška, Takeshi Matsuyama
</p>

<p>
  A Cairo based PDF exporter was implemented. While being somewhat
  simplistic the exporter saves text, embedding fonts into the final PDF
  file, and attempts to convert all flat filled areas to vector
  objects. <b>Developer:</b> Barak Itkin
</p>

<p>
  Last, but not least, a Web-page plug-in was added to render any web
  page into an image using Webkit. <b>Developer:</b> Mukund Sivaraman
</p>

<h3>For Tablet Users</h3>
<img alt="For stylus users screenshot" class="right" src="images/2.8-for-stylus-users.png" />
<p>
  A new experimental widget was added to meet the requirements of graphic
  tablets users. The widget combines a slider, a label and a numeric
  value control which simplifies adjusting a value using a stylus,
  better visualizes the current value and provides a more compact UI.
  It is now used in the Tools Options dockable dialog for opacity
  control and most options of brush based tools.
</p>

<p>
  Another useful feature for users of advanced input devices such as
  graphic tablets is a completely new dialog for input device
  configuration which allows configuring per-device pressure curves to
  compensate for hardware differences and personal per-pen
  preferences.
</p>

<p>
  People with Intuos tablets and either Artpen or Airbrush styluses
  will be glad to find that Airbrush wheel and Artpen rotation are
  available for driving dynamics via the 'Wheel'
  input. <b>Developers:</b> Michael Natterer, Alexia Death
</p>

<h3>Resource Tagging</h3>
<img alt="Resource tagging screenshot with brushes" class="right" src="images/2.8-resource-tagging-brushes.png" />
<p>
  It is now possible to tag GIMP resources such as brushes and
  patterns to group them. The tagging is performed from the 
  respective dockables e.g. the <em>Brushes</em> dockable, and it is 
  possible to filter resources based on these tags.
</p>

<p>
  The tags are saved to an XML file, external to the data files
  themselves. It is possible to tag multiple resources simultaneously
  in the UI, but currently only while being viewed as a list. This
  feature was developed during Google Summer of Code
  2008. <b>Developer:</b> Aurimas Juška
  <b>Interaction Architect:</b> Peter Sikking
</p>

<h3 class="spillover">Resources</h3>
<p>
  We have started overhauling the default set of resources and in this
  version there have been some changes to the default set of brushes.
  The silly 'Untitled' title has been removed from unnamed palette
  entries. A wholly new set of brushes for painting has been added and
  makes use of the new tagging system. <b>Developer:</b> Martin Nordholts 
  <b>Artists:</b> Johannes Engelhardt, Ramón Miranda, Guillermo Espertino
</p>

<h3>Minor Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Allow specifying the written language in the Text Tool. This helps
    with choosing an appropriate font, or appropriate glyphs for the
    selected language.
  </li>
  <li>
    Moved 'Text along path' from tool options to the text context menu.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add diagonal guides to the Crop Tool.
  </li>
  <li>
    Support rotating brushes.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Smooth Stroke feature from GIMP Painter was ported to GIMP.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added 'Rule of fifths' crop guide overlay.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added an icon for the Desaturate tool.
  </li>
  <li>
    Support loading 16bit (RGB565) raw data.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added palette exporter for CSS, PHP, Python, txt and Java, accessed
    through the palette context menu.
  </li>
  <li>
    Support printing crop marks for images.
  </li>
  <li>
    Made the Pointer dockable show information about selection position
    and size.
  </li>
  <li>
    Replaced the brush scale control in tool options by a brush size
    one that works in pixels, and does the right thing when the brush
    changes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved the Free Select Tool on-canvas feedback.
  </li>
  <li>
    Made it possible to use GEGL for scaling images.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<h3>Plug-in Development</h3>

<!-- FIXME the link below doesn't work -->
<p>
  GIMP 2.8 also further enhances its scripting abilities. For example,
  API changes to support layer groups have been made. Here is
  a <a href="http://developer.gimp.org/api/2.0/libgimp/libgimp-index-new-in-2-8.html">list
  of new symbols in GIMP 2.8</a>.
</p>

<h3>API Changes</h3>

<!--FIXME new object API, moving stuff to contexts etc. -->

<p>
  A lot of GIMP APIs have been refactored to simplify developing new scripts.
</p>

<h3>License</h3>
<p>
  The GIMP license has been changed to (L)GPLv3+.
</p>

<h3>GEGL</h3>
<p>
  The projection code which composes a single image from layers has been
  ported to GEGL. This includes the layer modes, as well as support for
  layer groups. Also, preparations have been made for better and more
  intuitive handling of the floating selection. <b>Developers:</b>
  Michael Natterer, Martin Nordholts
</p>

<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<p>
  The GIMP developers now maintain a roadmap for GIMP development
  found here:
  <a href="http://wiki.gimp.org/index.php/Roadmap">http://wiki.gimp.org/index.php/Roadmap</a>
</p>

<h2>GIMP 2.8 Screenshots</h2>
<div class="plain-screenshots">
  <a href="../screenshots/1280x800-fresh-start.jpg">
    <img alt="First GIMP 2.8 startup" src="../screenshots/1280x800-fresh-start-thumb.jpg" />
  </a>
  <p>First startup of GIMP&nbsp;2.8 on a 1280x800 desktop.</p>
</div>

<h2>Known Regressions</h2>
<p>
  GIMP 2.8 relies on a newer version of GTK+2 that unfortunately has partially 
  broken support for graphics tablets such as Wacom. If your graphic tablet 
  doesn't work in GIMP 2.8 as it should, we recommend downgrading to 2.6 until 
  we release GIMP 3.0 that relies on GTK+3 which has fully functional support 
  for advanced input devices.
</p>

<p>
  To address the needs to migrate from the old tools presets system to the new 
  one we provide a <a href="http://wiki.gimp.org/index.php/Mindstorm:Preset_converter">script</a> 
  in Python. However, the old tools presets are not 100% convertible to the new 
  tool presets. For instance, brush scale from 2.6 can't be converted to brush 
  size in 2.8.
</p>

<h2>Download</h2>
<p>
  The development snapshots of GIMP can be downloaded as source code
  from ftp.gimp.org or from one of the mirrors listed in
  the <a href="/downloads/#mirrors">Downloads</a> section.
</p>
<p>
  Distribution of binary packages of the development version is
  discouraged unless it is made clear that this is an early development
  snapshot. Users should be referred to these release notes or similar
  information.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
GIMP 2.8 must <strong>not</strong> be installed in the same prefix as
other GIMP 2.x versions. If you want to keep your GIMP 2.6
installation in parallel to GIMP 2.8, you have to choose a separate
installation prefix at compile-time and ensure that you use different
library search paths for each version. If you do not set up your
environment differently for each version, you will experience
conflicts with the libraries and at least one version is likely to
fail.
</p>

<p>
Also, do <strong>not</strong> install GIMP 2.8 to /usr/local because
on most systems, its libraries would override the libraries of a stable
GIMP 2.6 installed into /usr, breaking your distribution-installed
GIMP from slightly to completely. The same applies to any prefix
your system uses for the purpose or overriding things in /usr/lib.
</p>

<p>
You install the new version into a separate prefix, say /opt/gimp-2.8
by passing <kbd>--prefix=/opt/gimp-2.8</kbd> to the configure
script. Then, in order to run the binary installed there, you change
your environment to look for executables in /opt/gimp-2.8/bin by
setting <kbd>PATH=/opt/gimp-2.8/bin</kbd> and you tell your linker to
pick up libraries from /opt/gimp-2.8/lib by setting
<kbd>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/gimp-2.8/lib</kbd>.  Do not forget to
<kbd>export</kbd> both variables.
</p>

<p>
You can use a tiny wrapper script called gimp-2.8 and place it into
/usr/local/bin or elsewhere in your PATH. The script would look
something like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh

PATH=/opt/gimp-2.8/bin:$PATH
export PATH
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/gimp-2.8/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

/opt/gimp-2.8/bin/gimp-2.8 "$@"
</pre>
