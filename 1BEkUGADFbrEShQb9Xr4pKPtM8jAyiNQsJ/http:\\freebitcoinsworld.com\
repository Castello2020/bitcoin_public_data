				<h2>Get a Wallet!</h2>
				<p>
				You can either store your wallet locally or store it online. <a href="http://Coinbase.com" target="_blank">Coinbase.com</a> is an online wallet that is surprisingly simple to set up. 
				Wallets require you to use or download a fairly large blockchain file – about 6GB – so downloading and updating a local wallet 
				may be a non-starter. Like all wealth storage mediums, keeping your bitcoins “local” is probably a better idea than trusting a 
				web service, but that’s a matter of private preference. There is no preferred wallet type and there are obvious trade-offs to both. 
				Privacy advocates would probably say a local wallet is best. </br>
You can download a local wallet here but make sure you keep a copy of your data backed up.</br>
Once you’ve created a wallet, you get an address like this: <b>1BEkUGADFbrEShQb9Xr4pKPtM8jAyiNQsJ</b>.</br> This, without the period, is a direct way to send bitcoins to your wallet. Make a note of your address. In Coinbase, the wallet address found under linked accounts.

				<h1>A Few Words About Bitcoins & Mining</h1>
				<p>
			Bitcoin is a distributed, peer-to-peer digital currency that functions without the 
			intermediation of any central authority. The concept was introduced in a 2008 paper by a pseudonymous developer known as "Satoshi Nakamoto".
			
Bitcoin has been called a cryptocurrency because it is decentralized and uses cryptography to control transactions 
and prevent double-spending, a problem for digital currencies. Once validated, every individual transaction is 
permanently recorded in a public ledger known as the blockchain. Payment processing is done by a network of 
private computers often specially tailored to this task. The operators of these computers, known as "miners", are 
rewarded with transaction fees and newly minted Bitcoins. However, new bitcoins are created at an ever-decreasing rate.

<br/><br/>As of writting this, one Bitcoin is worth 720$! Thats insane! You can min up to 720$ per day and to be honest their value is skyrocketing also! You can read more about
 Bitcoins on official website <a href="http://bitcoin.org/en/" target="_blank">Bitcoin.Org</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin" target="_blank">Bitcoin Wikipedia page</a> or follow news at 
 <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin" target="_blank">Reddit!</a>
