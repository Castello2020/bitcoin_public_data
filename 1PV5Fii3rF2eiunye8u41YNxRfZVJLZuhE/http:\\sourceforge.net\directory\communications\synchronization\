This application synchronizes Lotus Notes Calendar entries with Google Calendar. GCal supports syncing with both iOS (iPhone/iPad/iPod) and Android devices, so you can now view your Lotus Notes calendar on your mobile device. GCal also allows you to view the calendar using any ical/rss/html compatible viewer.
