Details for Virtual Audio Cable 4.09 EDGE
Created by luap33 6 years ago Applications : Windows : English
VAC is intended to connect several audio applications together in real time. It's like a sound card with hardwired input and output: when an application sends an audio stream to a virtual cable, other applications can record this stream from the other cable end. Thus, you can record and process output of almost any audio application by almost any other audio application. VAC operates like TotalRecorder but is more universal.Use it to create a chains of software synthesizers (Generator, Reality), audio processors, recorders (WaveLab, Sound Forge, Adobe Audition), sequencers (Cakewalk, Cubase), Internet Telephony / Voice applications (Skype) etc. VAC is a native 32- and 64-bit WDM PnP driver and works under Windows 2k / XP / 2k3 / Vista.Version 4.09 features bugfixes and updates.
