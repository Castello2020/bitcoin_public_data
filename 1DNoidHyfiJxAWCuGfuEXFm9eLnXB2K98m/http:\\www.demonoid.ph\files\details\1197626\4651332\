<< Prev Next >>| 1 - 15 | 16 - 21 | Posted by protenniser 6 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ]Hi all,First thanks for the application. I have a quick question. I try to play heroes of might and magic II on this, however every time after the installation it asks me for the entering the play disk. When I try to create dmg.s of the cd files in mac OSx, the virtual OS9 does not recognize them. Is there a quick way to create .dmg files or other kind of files that can be mounted to this OS9 as cds? The ones knowing the answer please pm me. It is very much appreciated!Posted by freedumb2000 5 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ]This works so far, but I am havig trouble expanding .hqx files. It seems like Stuffit is not included while it used be included with a real OS 9 install. Now I can't install Stuffit because it also come in an .hqx file. If i expand the Stuffit .hqx installer file in OS X and copy it over to OS 9, it won't let me execute it as an application.Any ideas?Posted by TheRugi 4 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ]This is awesome, being able to play all those old nostalgic games I used to play as a kid. But many of my games run slowly or doesn't load certain things (missing sprites, sounds, music, etc). I noticed in the system profiler that my machine speed is 100 MHz. Is there any way to increasing this at all?And yes I tried raising the amount of memory reservable for a game, but it didn't help.Posted by devduttc 3 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ]hi plz seed plz see i also need to try Posted by disabledsheep 2 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ]This is awesome!
