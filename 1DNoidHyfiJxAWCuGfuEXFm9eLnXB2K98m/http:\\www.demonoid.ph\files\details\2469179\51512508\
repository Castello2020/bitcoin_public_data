I recently got an HDTV (thank you Black Friday) and would like to use my Xbox to play HD files. I usually just download the SD version of shows like The Walking Dead or Dexter but it appears that MKV is the format for movies and TV shows in HD. I know that MKV files will not play on the Xbox and that an AVI file is required. Is there are simple way to make this conversion and retain quality? I just tried XenonMKV to convert this file and got an error instantly. Thoughts? I found this guide: http://www.afterdawn.com/guides/archive/how_to_play_mkv_content_on_xbox_360.cfmI'm not sure I want to jump through 15 hoops to make this work. Thanks in advance for any help!
I run with cannibals who bite the hand that feeds because it tastes better than the food.Posted by denwagh 4 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ]Not sure on the 360 but on the PS3 I use a DLNA server which converts MKV on the fly... Mayve something like that for 360:? Posted by Zippyduda 4 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ]A warning to people there's a big fucking sound at around the 27:20 mark that nearly broke my speakers. Turn it down there. Or fix that problem in the file please.Otherwise fine quality.Posted by tommygun459 4 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ]Bad torrent,when I went to extract the files a pop up message said there are missing files.Posted by silv3rs669 4 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ]why is it that most of the people complaining about this torrent have very low ratios... hmmm sorry, im just an old schooler here, kinda stuck in my ways.video extracted fine, and that bad sound edit is at 27:35. other than that it plays finebtw, block lists do help, in a huge way. if ya dont know what they are, research them, and install them. all this bad data you get, will stop. and ive already said too muchPosted by qwerty4030 4 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ]doesnt play even after installing all codecs known to manPosted by Sinserenity 4 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ]battleshipsteve: you can actually use ps3 media server for your 360... it works fine despite it's name, and should help your problem.I haven't used it on my 360 in some time, but I believe messing around with the encoder settings will help you play mkv files that give you trouble. at any rate, normally the media server transcodes the mkv file from your pc to play on 360. you can also try the steps here:http://www.overclock.net/xbox/667301-mkv-playback-360-a.html#post8446227Posted by hustler01 4 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ]Video quality is great. 27:35 edit is complete. STOP whining about .rar's it is protocol, and it isn't about to change. Use 7-Zip. It kills WinRar.Thank you to uploader.

Might want to turn it down or mute it.Thanks to silv3rs669 and Zippyduda for the heads up.| 1 - 15 | 16 - 30 | 31 - 43 | << Prev Next >>
