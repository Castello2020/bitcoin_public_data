Details for TCOM: Oblivion Mod Compilation
Created by LumberingTroll 4 years ago Games : Windows : Full Game : English
This is outdated and a new version is now uploadedhttp://www.demonoid.me/files/details/2680252/12336734/ I reworked TOMCOM for better stability and better features, please redownload this package. This package contains all materials needed to get this compilation up and running minus Oblivion, its DLC and its patches. Those you must obtain on your own. In this first release I will focus on the core mechanics, game play elements and large packages; primarily FCOM (Franscescoâ€™s, Obscuroâ€™s OblivionWarCry, Martâ€™s) the core mechanics are things like KCAS (Kobuâ€™s Character Advancement System) Stealth Overhaul, COBL, Craftybits, Unique Landscapes, Better Cities and more. All files are in OMOD formate with FCOM in mind, mods that need specific FCOM support will have them in the OMOD package. Please be sure to see and READ the entire documentation located here.http://docs.google.com/View?id=dq2p85r_8cqgfb9gt

<< Prev Next >>| 1 - 15 | 16 - 30 | 31 - 45 | 46 - 55 | Posted by edgelife 3 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ]I have the same missing mesh issue with battlehorn, kinda weird, but if you go into the console menu, select the mesh with your mouse and type 'disable' and it'll go away, granted there won't be a gate any more but its better than that annoying yellow thing.Posted by capone970 3 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ]I too have the issue with the missing gate at battlehorn. In addition to that, there is a missing mesh behind the counter at the bank of cyrodill. I have reinstalled completely twice, can anyone help!?Other than that, this pack is fantastic, it is like an expansion. THanks for the up. Posted by ellendel 3 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ]I think the missing mesh of battlehorn its connected with the unnoficial patches in the tcom pack.I will tray to reinstall all again and test with other unnoficial patch.I'll post the results.Posted by ellendel 3 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ]I did it ;).I applied another unofficial patches instead of the tcom pack and now the battlehorn castle looks perfect without missing mesh.Even i can close the front Door of the castle now hehe.Just google and donwload these "unofficial Oblivion patchs" and "Unofficial Oblivion Mods Patch" maybe just this last one, i dont know i applied both of them and the shivering isle unofficial patch too.Sry for my band command of english Posted by pearson3372 3 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ]Dude, this compilation is really nice. Much thanks. If you are planning any other expansions to this comp, I'll totally download. This saved me hours from dwnloading from the nexus, working on compatability, etc. Posted by Iceheartonyx 3 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ]I know it probably a long shot but is there any chance of this getting updated? Or has anyone been able to get this working lately? Because from my latest round of trying I think I had everything together until hitting wyre bash...oh man do I not like that program and that's also where the documentation starts to fall part. If anybody has some tips for me I'd love to hear them. Also lots of love to the original creator of this pack, it looks like it took a ton of effort to put together.Posted by LumberingTroll 3 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ]It will intact be updated, ive been waiting for the next version of Unnecessary Violence to be released, and the dev for that said it should be "soon" as of last month. TCOM v2 will pretty much be a complete recreation, with all the current versions and some new stuff. It will be a while longer though. Posted by lazytitan 3 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ]Is there a better guide for this? I dont know if im just a moron or what but i have re install and tried this at least 15x now and it just doesnt work for me. I try to follow the damn guide to a T but every damn time i get to a step i dont know what to do because its not covered and it just flat out wont work for me. cant even get game to run. Posted by Fearlessjay 3 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ]I had a few issues getting this working too, ended up getting the other torrenthttp://www.demonoid.me/files/details/2254471/353832/that's already made and just adding the mods from this I wanted, worked great. Posted by Celtic12 3 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ]Thanks a bunch, a long install process, but pretty idiot proof so long as you read the docs. | 1 - 15 | 16 - 30 | 31 - 45 | 46 - 55 | << Prev Next >>
