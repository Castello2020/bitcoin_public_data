Details for CBC The Human Behavior Experiments
Created by heretic576 7 years ago Movies : Documentary : TV Rip : English
Why would four young men watch their friend die, when they could have intervened to save him? Why would a woman obey phone commands from a stranger to strip-search an innocent employee? What makes ordinary people perpetrate extraordinary abuses, like the events at Abu Ghraib?Answers to these contemporary questions can be found in past social psychology experiments. The Milgram obedience experiment shocked the world by proving that most people were willing to kill fellow human beings if an authority figure was held accountable. A famous diffusion-of-responsibility experiment sought to understand why 38 people who witnessed a brutal murder in New York did nothing to help. Finally, the Stanford Prison experiment showed how the world of the jail could transform a decent, moral person into a brutal, sadistic guard.Documentarian Alex Gibney (Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room) revisits these three famous behavioral studies to explore some perennial questions about why human beings commit unethical acts under particular social conditions. After seeing this film, you may never say "bad apples" again. http://www.cbc.ca/bigpicture/human.htmlFile Name ..........: cbc.the.big.picture.the.human.behaviour.experiments.640x464..aviTotal Size (MB) ....: 1,376.01 MBTotal Streams ......: 2 Stream(s)Video Length .......: 01:36:55Video Codec Name ...: XviD MPEG-4 codecVideo Bitrate ......: 1856 KB/sResolution .........: 640 x 464Aspect Ratio .......: 1.37:1Framerate ..........: 29.970 FPSQuality Factor .....: 0.208 B/pxAudio Codec Name ...: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3)Audio Bitrate ......: 128 KB/s (CBR)Channels ...........: 2 ChSampling Rate ......: 48000 Hz
