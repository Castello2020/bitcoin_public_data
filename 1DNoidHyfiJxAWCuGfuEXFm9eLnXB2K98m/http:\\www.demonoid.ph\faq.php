<p><strong> User Information </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a name="ui_1"></a><strong>Why is the registration closed periodically?</strong><br>
    We only open registrations when our resources permit.&nbsp; A tracker/site of a large scale such as this, needs to close registration for periods of time.&nbsp; The only way to register while registration is closed, is to be invited.&nbsp;. Also, try asking some of your friends, it is likely that some of them have a Demonoid account already.
	<br><a href="#ui">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <li><a name="ui_2"></a><strong>I registered my account, how come I didn't get the confirmation E-Mail?</strong><br>
    Have you registered with the correct E-Mail address?&nbsp; <br>
    If you have, did you checked your SPAM folder?&nbsp; <br>
    Sometimes, the registration E-Mail has been filtered from your inbox and ends up in your spam folder.&nbsp; If still you don't receive the confirmation E-Mail, please try registering again, using a different E-Mail address
	<br><a href="#ui">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <li><a name="ui_3"></a><strong>I've forgotten my password, what do I do?</strong><br>
    There's no need to worry.&nbsp; There is a link called &quot; Lost Pass&quot; right near the text box where you log in.&nbsp; Click that and verify some information.&nbsp; A link to reset your password will be E-Mailed to the address which is registered with the site.&nbsp; 	<br><a href="#ui">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <li><a name="ui_4"></a><strong>Can I invite my friend to Demonoid?</strong><br>
    You sure can!&nbsp; You can access the &quot;invite&quot; feature under your control panel. The link is on the upper right corner of every page ..&nbsp; This will generate a code that the receiver will have to input when they register.&nbsp; There is a set number of invites so use them wisely.	<br><a href="#ui">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <li><a name="ui_5"></a><strong>Can you delete my account?</strong><br>
    No. But you can stop using it and the site will automatically set it as inactive after some time.<br><a href="#ui">Back to top</a><br><br></li>

 <li><a name="ui_9"></a><strong>What is an avatar and signature, and how do I add one to my profile? </strong><br>
    An avatar is a small image which is displayed under your user name.&nbsp; As long as the image in question is within the scope of the site rules, there is no limitation to what this image can be.&nbsp; Adding an avatar is simple.&nbsp; You must first host it on an internet image hosting site and place the image URL in the &quot;Avatar URL&quot; section of &quot;Account Settings&quot;.&nbsp; A signature is the equivalent to a &quot;signature&quot; of a letter.&nbsp; It's something that will be posted after every post you make.&nbsp; It can be text (like a quote) and/or an image (as long as it's in the scope of the site rules).&nbsp; Displaying images in the signature is a little different than the avatar.&nbsp; These must be place in between [ img]image URL here[ / img] BB tags.	<br><a href="#ui">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
 <li><a name="ui_10"></a><strong>I have been warned, can you tell me the reason?</strong><br>
    We do not notify the users or give the reason of the warnings to avoid giving the moderators the extra work of arguing with the warned users. If you received a warning, it means you broke the site rules in one of the comment posts, private messages or in one of your uploads. All the site rules can be found on this page.<br>

<p> &nbsp; <strong> BitTorrent</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a name="bt_1"></a><strong>What is BitTorrent?</strong><br>
    BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer protocol which allows users to connect directly to each other to send and receive parts of a file through a central server called a &quot;tracker&quot;.&nbsp; The tracker itself does not contain or transmit any information pertaining to the actual content.&nbsp; It only coordinates and manages connections between peers.
<br><a href="#bt">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <li><a name="bt_2"></a><strong>What is the required software and where can I get it?</strong><br>
    In order to connect to the tracker and get the files the .torrent file points to, you will need to have installed a BitTorrent Client. Please do not use BitComet, BitLord and its derivatives. They cause your ratio to be misreported, and cause transfer troubles.</li>

<ul>
  <li><a name="bt_3"></a><strong>Seed( er)? Leech( er)? Peer?&nbsp; What are you talking about? (Terminology)</strong><br>
    These words are BitTorrent terminology.&nbsp; A seed or seeder is a person who has a full copy of the content in this torrent.&nbsp; &nbsp;They are either the original distributor or someone who has completed the download and is just uploading.&nbsp; A leecher is a person who has begun downloading this torrent and does not have a full copy as of yet.&nbsp; Also referred to as a peer.&nbsp; A hit-and-runner is a leecher who completes the download, but doesn't seed until they reach a ratio of 1.0.&nbsp; Of course, this is frowned upon. These hit-and-run users are often called leechers, as in the parasite, the blood-sucker that lives in the tropics. Although the same word is used as someone who hasn't finished downloading, it is also used as a derogatory term.&nbsp; <br><a href="#bt">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><a name="bt_4"></a><strong>What is this &quot;*.torrent&quot; file?</strong><br>
    A .torrent file is basically a small text file containing necessary information required to start your download/upload.&nbsp; Such necessary information would include, file sizes, file names, tracker URLs, comments, hashes, etc<br><a href="#bt">Back to top</a><br><br></li>

<strong><p>Downloading / Using Torrents</p></strong>
<ul>
  <li><a name="dut_1"></a><strong>How do I start Downloading files?</strong><br>
    After choosing a suitable client read the FAQ on the client homepage for any configuration tips, install (restarting your browser may be required), find files you are interested in, click the link and start downloading.
<br><a href="#dut">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <li><a name="dut_2"></a><strong>My client says I've only downloaded X% but the file is the correct size, what gives?</strong><br>
    Unless otherwise configured clients pre-allocated the file size of the torrent which is &quot;filled&quot; with the data as it is downloaded.<br><a href="#dut">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  
<li><a name="dut_3b"></a><strong>Why is the torrent offered as a txt file too?</strong><br>
   There are some firewalls and internet filters that disallow the download of torrent files. Because of that, we also offer the same torrent files with a .txt extension for download. If you are having trouble getting the torrent, try downloading it using the "download as text file" link, change the extension from .txt to .torrent, and open it with your torrent client.<br><a href="#dut">Back to top</a><br><br></li>

  <li><a name="dut_4"></a><strong>Why is my download stuck at 99.9%?</strong><br>
    There are actually a few factors which may contribute to this problem.&nbsp; Though 99.9% is the most common, it actually happens with percentages in the high 90s (96%, 97%, 98% and anything in between).<br><a href="#dut">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <ul>
    <li>There may be an anti-leech protection in effect limiting transfers to you.&nbsp; Many clients does have this feature to ensure peers give back what they have taken to the swarm.</li>
    <li>The final piece(s) may be something changeable.&nbsp; Check to see what is left on the download.&nbsp; If the file(s) in question are &quot;. DS_Store,&quot; &quot; Thumbs.db,&quot; or &quot;desktop.ini,&quot; you may select these files and choose to omit them from the download.&nbsp; If the seeder's version of these files changed, then they will fail the hash check, preventing anyone from getting the original.&nbsp; Similarly, if on your side, these [hidden] files are &quot;read only&quot; and/or protected, your client will keep downloading and discarding that which cannot be replaced.</li>
    <li>There may be a physical problem preventing you from completing the download.&nbsp; Try stopping the torrent, run scandisk, and restarting the torrent.&nbsp; This will fix any errors on your harddrive.</li>
    <li>The more pieces you have, the harder it becomes to find people who have the pieces you need. That's why downloads sometimes slow down or even stop completely. Just be patient and you will get the remaining pieces.</li>

  <li><a name="dut_9"></a><strong>Why am I getting &quot; urlopen error (10061, 'Connection refused')&quot; error?</strong><br>
    This could be a symptom for a range of problems resulting in you not being able to connect to the tracker, you internet connection going down, firewall/router interfering with your connection, server/tracker being busy or even being banned from a tracker, most commonly this error will resolve itself or you could try restarting your client. <br><a href="#dut">Back to top</a><br><br></li>

    Unless configured otherwise some clients will keep all the files in a torrent open during the downloading process. This error occurs with some of the larger multi-file torrents, which can have hundreds or thousands of component files. When the number exceeds the OS limit, the OS refuses to allow them all to be opened, preventing the client from accessing them. To resolve the problem either &nbsp; limit the number of files the client will have open at any one time or increase the OS limit for the number of open files.<br><a href="#dut">Back to top</a><br><br></li>

    See &quot;Why am I getting &quot;Piece XXX failed hash check&quot; error?&quot; ( above), the extra data is the redownloaded data from the failed hash check.<br><a href="#dut">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <li><a name="dut_23"></a><strong>Can I resume a previously broken torrent?</strong><br>
    Yes you can. To resume simply open the .torrent file as you would to download and choose the save location as where you have the completed files.<br><a href="#dut">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <li><a name="dut_24"></a><strong>Why did an active torrent suddenly disappear?</strong><br>
    The main reasons for this are:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;1. The torrent may have been out-of-sync with the site rules.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;2. The torrent was not seeded. Torrents expire after 5 days without a seed.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;3. It was a bad release. A replacement will probably be uploaded to take its place.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;4. The torrent expired. Older torrents are sometimes automatically deleted when the peer count gets high to avoid running out of RAM and killing the server. <br><a href="#dut">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <li><a name="dut_25"></a><strong>Why am I downloading so slowly?</strong><br>
    There are many factors which may affect your transfer speeds.<br><a href="#dut">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <ul>
    <li>There aren't enough peers/seeds.<br>
      Most think just seeds are enough for a quick download, but leechers also affect transfer speeds.&nbsp; You may download the pieces they have already acquired.&nbsp; However, if there are too many leechers, they may already be taking all the speed.</li>
    <li>You are behind a firewall.<br>
      If you are behind a firewall, then this will limit the number of peers you are able to connect to.&nbsp; Although you can make outgoing connections to peers, they cannot make any connections to you.&nbsp; Forward the ports your client is using and you noticed you'll get more connections.</li>
    <li>You are saturating your bandwith.<br>
      Although uploading is a good thing, if you are maxing out your upload stream, you will saturate your bandwith, thus lowering your download speed, as well as slowing down any other internet action(s).&nbsp; How TCP/IP works, is when you download a packet, you must reply to the sender saying you received it.&nbsp; This will prompt the sender to send another packet.&nbsp; If you are at max on uploads, it may take a while for your reply to get to it's destination, which prevents you from getting the next packet.&nbsp; The best way to battle this, is to limit your uploads to 80% of your maximum speed. IE: If you have a maximum upload rate of 40 kilobytes per second, limit that to 32 kilobytes per second.&nbsp; The 8 kilobytes is enough buffer for replies and even browsing the web.</li>
    <li>You're not uploading enough.<br>
      Remember, bittorrent is a sharing protocol.&nbsp; If you're being stingy with the uploads, other clients won't transfer to you.&nbsp; Many clients even tell you that your download rate is proportional to your upload rate.&nbsp; This does seem to be the case in small to medium swarms, but sometimes doesn't apply to large swarms.&nbsp; In any case, be sure to upload as much as you can.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>Whatever the problem may be, be sure to give it some time.&nbsp; Sometimes it just takes time to connect to the right peers.&nbsp; Bittorrent is the best sharing protocol out there and is designed to more often than not, max out your download speed.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a name="dut_26"></a><strong>How do I fix this NAT error?</strong><br>
    The majority of NAT errors are a result of incorrectly configured firewalls or routers, open the listening port that your client is using in your firewall and/or router, if your client uses a port range try to limit this to around 10 ports any more is unnecessary and could pose a security risk. If you don't know how to open ports check any documentation that you may have or the &quot;makers&quot; support/help. <a href="http://www.portforward.com/default.htm">Portforward.com</a> is very informative on this subject and remember<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> is your friend.<br><a href="#dut">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <li><a name="dut_27"></a><strong>Which port should I use?</strong><br>
    Some ISP's throttle the connection on the known default Bit Torrent ports 6881 - 6889 so changing the listening port of your client will help avoid the affects of this traffic restriction, some care should be taken when selecting a port see&nbsp; <a href="http://www.glocksoft.com/trojan_port.htm">Here</a> for known port nasties.<br><a href="#dut">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <li><a name="dut_28"></a><strong>What is this <em>&quot; Go to demonoid.ph&quot;</em> error I keep getting?</strong><br>
    It means the torrent is not being tracked by Demonoid anymore, because it was deleted by its owner of by a site moderator. Please try using the torrent search to find a similar torrent.<br><a href="#dut">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <li><a name="dut_29"></a><strong>What is this &quot;Torrent Rating System&quot; and how does it work?</strong><br>
    The torrent rating goes from 1 to 10, 1 being the worst rating, and 10 the best.&nbsp; When a torrent has not been rated yet, it will have a &quot;n/a&quot; instead of the score.&nbsp; Please remember this is a rating system on the &nbsp; <strong><em>quality</em></strong>&nbsp; of the torrent content, not how much you liked it or disliked it.<br><a href="#dut">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Creating / Uploading Torrents </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a name="cut_1"></a><strong>I want to share my stuff, how do I make a torrent?</strong><br>
    Making a torrent is not as difficult one would think.&nbsp; All that the torrent making software does is hash the files of content (which makes the torrent identifiable), add the announce URL (so those who download it can connect to the tracker) and add the various file information (such as file names, size, etc.).&nbsp; There are various programs/clients that are able to create torrents.<br><a href="#cut">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <ul>
    <li>  <a href="/faq_creation_utorrent.php"><strong>Torrent creation tutorial (uTorrent)</strong></a></li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><a name="cut_2"></a><strong>Are there any guidelines I must follow when uploading a torrent?</strong><br>
    Yes, there are guidelines.&nbsp; Displayed before you upload torrents, are the list of rules you must abide by.<br><a href="#cut">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
</ul>
<p>These rules are:</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong> Include <a href="/info_file.php"> this</a> info file inside the torrent</strong><br>
      This is a simple text file that says this torrent is tracked by demonoid.ph.&nbsp; If you fail to add this to your torrent, then the site will reject it. </li>
    <li><strong>No adult material allowed</strong><br>
      Demonoid has a strict policy against pornographic material.&nbsp; Any content depicting a sexual act will be deleted.&nbsp; There are countless sources to distribute this type of material and Demonoid is not one of them. </li>
    <li><strong>No spam (make quick money / Win an iPod / online poker / pyramid schemes, etc.)</strong><br>
      Get rich quick schemes, money pyramids, free stuff and the likes do not benefit anyone.&nbsp; Torrents such as these will be deleted on sight. </li>
    <li><strong>No hate inducing material of any kind. </strong></li>
    <li><strong>No passworded archives.</strong><br>
      Passworded archives (. rar, .zip, .ace, .tar, .7z, etc.) are not allowed.&nbsp; Forcing people to go to other site to acquire a password is a nuisance on the community.&nbsp; Torrents which are reported for violating this rule are immediately deleted. </li>
    <li><strong>No torrents from private trackers </strong><br>
	Torrents from trackers that require registration on a site to download are not allowed.</li>
	 <li><strong>No duplicate material</strong><br>
		Please search before uploading to check if the material is already on the site</li>
    <li><strong>No trojans or virus infected archives<br>
      </strong>No infected torrents are allowed.&nbsp; Torrents infected with trojans, virii, adware, spyware, malware, etc. will be deleted. </li>
    <li><strong>No hacking tools (reading material related to this subject is ok) </strong></li>
    <li><strong> Try to make sure your torrents are well-seeded for at least 24 hours or until there are some seeds to replace you.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </strong></li>
  </ul>
  <li><a name="cut_3"></a><strong>Why is a torrent I uploaded not listed?</strong><br>
    The site updates the torrent listing every few minutes.If more than ten minutes passes since you uploaded it, and it's still not there, try uploading it again.&nbsp;Also, you need to seed the torrent in order for it to apper on the list.&nbsp; A non-seeded torrent is immediately labled as a &quot;dead&quot; or inactive torrent.&nbsp; You may search for your torrent applying the filter [dead torrents] or [dead and active torrents].&nbsp; Once you begin seeding your torrent, it will automatically be made visible by the site.<br><a href="#cut">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <li><a name="cut_4"></a><strong>I uploaded a torrent, why does it appear to have been deleted?</strong><br>
    Are you sure your torrent was in sync with the rules?&nbsp; The torrent Moderators are constantly browsing the site, looking for torrents that break the rules.&nbsp; Even if your torrent barely stays within the scope of the rules, if it receives too many complaints, it will be deleted.<br><a href="#cut">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <li><a name="cut_5"></a><strong>What is this <em>&quot; Torrent not in pool yet&quot;</em> error I keep getting?</strong><br>
    This means the tracker has not had the time to read the database yet. The tracker reads the database every 3 minutes or so, and then adds the new torrents to it's torrent pool. You need to wait for the torrent to be on the pool to be able to seed it.&nbsp; If you get this error, stop the transfer, wait 3 minutes (usually it takes less, but make it 3 to be sure), and then restart it.<br><a href="#cut">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <li><a name="cut_6"></a><strong>Am I allowed to upload my torrent tracked by Demonoid to other sites?</strong><br>
    Yes you are.&nbsp;It's your torrent, as long as the torrent is in sync with  the site rules, you may do with it whatever you want.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    It may actually be wise to add your torrent to other sites.&nbsp; This will undoubtedly increase your traffic.&nbsp; More traffic means a faster distribution of the torrent.<br><a href="#cut">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <li><a name="cut_7"></a><strong>What is &quot;normal seeding mode&quot; and what is &quot;super-seeding mode&quot;?<br>
    </strong>Seeding mode is the regular way a client seeds.&nbsp; A peer who requests a piece from you will get that piece.&nbsp; Super-seeding mode is slightly different.&nbsp; In super-seed mode, you will transfer a single piece only once.&nbsp; This means you will not transfer any piece more than once.&nbsp; This speeds the &nbsp; <strong><em>initial</em></strong>&nbsp; distribution of the torrent, by ensuring that when you have uploaded 100% of your torrent, there will be one full distributed copy among all your peers.&nbsp; However, please remember that super-seed mode is only useful for the initial distribution.&nbsp; Afterwards, seeding will be quicker on normal mode.&nbsp;<br><a href="#cut">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Stats </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a name="st_1"></a><strong>What is this &quot;ratio&quot;?</strong><br>
    The upload to download ratio is just that: a ratio.&nbsp; BitTorrent is a sharing protocol.&nbsp; So obviously, sharing is expected.&nbsp; The ratio system was introduced to allow you to monitor your transfer amount.&nbsp; A ratio of 1.0 means you've uploaded as much as you've downloaded, but it's encouraged to give more than you take<br><a href="#st">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <li><a name="st_2"></a><strong>What is a good ratio?</strong><br>
    1.0 or above.&nbsp; This means you have upload more than you have downloaded.&nbsp; This mentality is vital to the <em>sharing</em> community.&nbsp; Although sometimes it is difficult to seed what you have downloaded, please just try to make an effort.<br><a href="#st">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <li><a name="st_3"></a><strong>How is the ratio calculated?<br>
    </strong>Every member starts off with 0 kilobytes downloaded and 0 kilobytes uploaded, giving them a ratio of 1.0.&nbsp; Every kilobyte/megabyte/gigabyte transfered afterwards begins to effect your ratio.&nbsp; The simple equation for the ratio calculation is uploaded/downloaded.&nbsp; In example: You've uploaded 50 megabytes and downloaded 150 megabytes, your ratio will be: 50/150=0.33.&nbsp; Or if you've uploaded 200 megabytes and downloaded 150 megabytes, your ratio will be: 200/150=1.33.&nbsp; Obviously, the latter is the preferrable ratio.&nbsp; Please pay attention to your ratio and seed accordingly.&nbsp; <br>
    Only data transfered via the Demonoid tracker will count toward your ratio.<br><a href="#st">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <li><a name="st_4"></a><strong>My ratio is getting too low, am I going to be banned?<br>
    </strong>The ratio system is purely statistical and somewhat innacurate for the ones with shared or dynamic ips. Besides what other users may think of you for not sharing, there is no punishment for having a low ratio.<br>
    <br><a href="#st">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <li><a name="st_5"></a><strong>Why isn't my ratio being reported properly?</strong><br>
    There are a few reasons your ratio isn't updating properly.&nbsp; If the server is unresponsive, slow, or overloaded, the &quot;event=stopped&quot; message which is required to update your stats may become lost.&nbsp; Similarly, a faulty, experimental, or beta testing a client, may also cause your stats to be misreported.&nbsp; Another possibility is the site may have a different IP associated with your account than the one you sent the &quot;event=stopped&quot; message with. If your client supports DHT and it is enabled any data transfered via these means will not count toward your ratio.<br><a href="#st">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
  <li><a name="st_6"></a><strong>What are the best practices for ensuring my ratio is updated correctly?<br>
    </strong>There are a few things you may try to ensure a proper ratio update.<br><a href="#st">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><a name="st_7"></a><strong>Why doesn't Demonoid use a &quot;live tracker&quot;?</strong><br>
    Demonoid tracks too many peers, and live-tracking would put too much of a strain on our server.<br><a href="#st">Back to top</a><br><br></li>
