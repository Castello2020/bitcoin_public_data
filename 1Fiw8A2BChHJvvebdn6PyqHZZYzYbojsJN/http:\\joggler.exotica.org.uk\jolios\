  <small>O2 Joggler (running the built in software)</small>
</div>
<h2>Versions available:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Joli OS 1.2 (Joggler Image v1.13 - 03/01/2014):</strong><br />
    <a href="/img/jolios_1.2-v1.13-btrfs.img.gz">Download the Btrfs version</a> (875 MB) - md5sum fc7640e812ba24c7978ecce009535d45.<br />
    <a href="/img/jolios_1.2-v1.13-ext4.img.gz">Download the Ext4 version</a> (756 MB) - md5sum 7dbd2f56c29b8ce4bbcaab7d7e611bbf.<br />
    <em>These images require a minimum of a 4GB USB stick.</em>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Version Notes:</h3>
<ul>

  <li>The Btrfs versions use the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs">Btrfs filesystem</a>.They use LZO compression as well as the ssd_spread mount option that is optimized for non rotating storage and should be more friendly than ext4 for write wear on the flash.</li>
  <li>The F2FS versions use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F2FS">F2FS Filesystem</a> which is specifically designed for flash memory. The F2FS images need twice the flash size due to the way the images are built and free space is managed. This is a relatively new filesystem, and I haven't done much testing in terms of performance/reliability on the O2 Joggler.</li>
  <li>The ext4 versions are using standard ext4 filesystem with journalling switched on.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>For the most free space and good performance on slower devices try Btrfs.</li>
    <li>For a new flash friendly filesystem on larger sticks try F2FS.</li>
    <li>For a more common filesystem, with good performance, you can use the ext4 versions (ext4). <br/>The ext4 journal may very well wear out your usb flash device more quickly than F2FS/Btrfs though. You can disable the journal by using "tune2fs -O ^has_journal /dev/YOURUSBDEVICE3" with the flash drive in another machine. You will however, lose some of the integrity advantages the journal gives, in exchange for a more flash friendly filesystem.</li>
    <li>My own choice is ext4 - I was using Btrfs before, but with our 3.2 kernel ext4 seems to perform better, although Btrfs with LZO compression could be faster on USB sticks with slow read/write speeds. I also leave the ext4 journal enabled and the system seems pretty resilient to hard reboots.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>

</ul>
<p>
Note: There are also other Linux distributions available for the Joggler including <a href="../ubuntu/">Ubuntu Linux</a> and <a href="../mint/">Linux Mint</a> from this site.

<h3>Writing the Image to a USB Stick</h3>
<p>
The downloaded file is a full compressed drive image with all partions.
</p>
<h4>Linux</h4>
<p>
Decompress and copy to a blank / unused USB Stick using a command such as dd: (Note that all previous contents on the USB stick will be wiped!)
</p>
<pre>
gzip -dc IMAGENAME.img.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/YOUR_USB_DEVICE
</pre>
<h4>Windows</h4>
<p>
Note these instructions are untested, but should work - they are based on the instructions from an older Joggler image on <a href="http://www.stephenford.org/joggler/">http://www.stephenford.org/joggler/"</a>. You can refer to that page if needed as it goes into more detail.
</p>
Download Win32DiskImager from <a href="https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer/0.1/0.1">https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer/0.1/0.1</a>. Then unpack the .img.gz file using something a tool like <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a>. Run W32DiskImager.exe, and select the unpacked .img file.  Choose the drive that corresponds to your USB stick and use "Write" to write the image.
<h3>Booting from USB</h3>
<p>
Insert the USB stick into your Joggler, and turn the power on. It should boot to the Desktop. To run a command with root privileges use "sudo". The default user and password if/when requested for certain tasks is:
</p>
<p><strong>
User: joggler<br />
Pass: joggler
</strong></p>
<p>
You can (and probably should) change this password at your next convenience, either using the Gnome user management tools or from a terminal using "passwd".
</p>
<h3>Overheating / Throttling issues</h3>
<p>
As you may be aware, the Joggler has problems with the cpu throttling when the temperature reaches 70&deg;C making the system pretty unusable. Previously people have solved this by adding larger heatsinks which improve cooling (Often cutting the case to make space etc). Hacking the Joggler hardware is not something everyone wants to do, but fortunately there is an alternative - you can modify the thermal trip point via software. An unmodified Joggler, after being powered up for some time seems to idle at around 60 - 66&deg;C with the LCD on (less with it off), so it doesn't take a lot of usage to bring the temperature up to 70&deg;C at which point the throttling starts. By increasing the throttling trip point, the device becomes much more usable for longer periods, and for many tasks, doesn't throttle at all. Read on to find out how.
</p>
<p><strong>
Note if you make the changes below you are  allowing the machine to run hotter than it is set to run by the firmware. You could permanently damage your device by playing with the thermal trip points. Do this at your own risk!</strong></p>
<p>The default throttling trip point is 70&deg;C. I have successfully increased this to 80&deg;C on my Joggler. There is another safety trip point at 100&deg;C where the cpu will halt/stop. We won't of course be playing with that one. Boot up the image and enter a terminal and type.</p>
<pre>
sudo nano -w /boot/grub.cfg
</pre>
<p>At the end of the line that contains "splash" add the parameter "thermal.psv=xx" where xx is the trip point you want for the passive cooling (throttling) - for example to increase the passive throttling point to 80&deg;C use "thermal.psv=80". This means that your machine will not start throttling until it reaches 80&deg;C rather than 70&deg;C. It is possible this could shorten the life of your device, however I have been running my Jogglers like this for years with no problems.</p>
<p>I also recommend you read up in <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt">http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt</a> on the various
thermal.* parameters before trying this so you are familiar with the settings and risks.
</p>

<h3>Right mouse button / secondary click from touchscreen</h3>
<p>
For a right-mouse click press and hold your finger on the touchscreen for 1 second.
</p>

<h3>Moving windows when they do not fit on the screen</h3>
<p>
Bringing up the on-screen keyboard, and pressing the left alt, and then tapping on a window will allow you to drag it. This is useful in the case where some of the contents of a window are off the screen. You can also configure utilities like "easystroke" to use simple gestures for actions like this.
