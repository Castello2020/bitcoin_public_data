          <h1>About Shinya</h1>

<p>Shinya is and adventure RPG taking place in fictional medieval world and
featuring teenage girl as the main heroine. It is currently in development
by my single-man game studio.</p>

<h2>Overview<br>
            </h2>
            <p>The story of Shinya takes place in fictional town
              Spielburg and its environs in continental Western Europe
              during late Middle Ages.<br>
              The protagonist is young girl called Sara, who lost both
              her parents at very early age and has been brought up by a
              distant relative. When coming back to her hometown (aunt
              plans to get her married to "get rid" of her) she
              gradually starts to feel, that something sinister is
              happening behind the scenes at the otherwise tranquil
              town. For some reason or the other (she is very young at
              not perfectly reasonable always) she starts to investigate
              it - and will be involved in complex and dangerous
              plots...<br>
            </p>
            <p><img style=" width: 480px; height: 360px;" alt="Sara"
                src="Sara-20120331.jpg"><br>
            </p>
            <p>The game has freely navigable world of about 4km in both
              directions with many buildings, NPC characters, enemies
              and so on. Story progresses through sub-quests and
              interactions. There is continous day-night cycle - some
              quests can only be completed at certain time. But you have
              to sleep regularly - even stamina potions can not keep you
              active indefiitely.<br>
            </p>
            <p>The actual name of the game is 深夜. "Late at night" in
              Japanese and something similar in Chinese.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The prehistory of Shinya can be traced back to Floyd - an
              experimental 3D engine I wrote in 90s as a side project to
              Sodipodi. Since then the engine has seen three major
              rewrites and eventually became called Sehle. It was
              developed in parallel with <a
                href="http://khayyam.kaplinski.com/">Khayyam</a> (a
              posing and scene building program).</p>
            <p> Writing computer games has been my interest for long
              time - but the real life has always made its corrections
              to all plans. Until about a year ago, when I felt
              confident enough to start with Shinya (then code-named
              Aosora) in full throttle. On the one hand Sehle was
              becoming stable and powerful enough to actually drive real
              game, on the other hand I tried and was able to model some
              OK-looking models in Blender.</p>
            <p> Currently Shinya is almost 100% written and modeled by
              me - except some textures and background music.</p>
            <p>Shinya is inspired by many great games I have played
              through years, most importantly Quest for Glory 1 &amp; 5.
              These games had really wonderful (although different) feel
              and I very much hope that I will be able to express
              something similar in Shinya.<br>
              Other games that have strongly influenced my views about
              game design are Warlords 1, Final Fantasy VII and Des
              Blood 4.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>Supporting development</h2>
            <p>In my estimation the game needs at least one more year
              full-time work. Unfortunately I cannot work on it
              full-time and thus two years is more probable time.<br>
              If you same extra Euros or bitcoins to spare, donations
              are very helpful and welcome. It will allow me to schedule
              some more time from my real-life duties to Shinya
              development and/or buy some content from artists.<br>
