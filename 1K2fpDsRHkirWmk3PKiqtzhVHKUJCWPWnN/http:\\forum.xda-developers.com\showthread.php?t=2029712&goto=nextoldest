26-03-14

Overdue images of 240DPI mod
Also new version of DPI mod which doesn't crash when the settings file gets corrupted.
18-03-2013
Release 240DPI mod beta (Use at own risk) I will post some screenshots when my phone returns (USB connector broke )
See below for details 22-01-2013
Hopefully resolved the issues people were having.
21-01-2013
Probably the last version of this mod.
Big thanks to my three donators, People like you keep developers making awesome things.
Changelog:
The sorting issue on reboot has been fixed, Samsung made it so it would only properly work if you have all apps in alphabetical order.
As a happy side effect my start up code seems twice as fast as samsung, reducing start up time!
Instructions
Just download the attached APK and update the current version, and reboot your device for the changes to take effect.
02-01-2013 - 1898 downloads
New version compatible with framework 2.0, Attached to this post. *People who update: Make sure you download and install the latest xposed framework, Before pressing "Install/Update" else you will receive incomparable message*
Get it here - (2.0: Removed the native library replacement again, support for 4.1 and 4.2, Instagram crash fixed, ...)
15-12-12
Initial release - 1737 downloads
*Not compatible with version message / Updating procedure*
1. Follow the link and download the xposed framework (again)
2. Install the apk and overwrite the current installation
3. Open the xposed installer and hit "Install / Update"
You are now on the latest version of the xposed framework, And ready to update my mod.
Requirements
Root
XposedFramework - http://forum.xda-developers.com/show....php?t=2012770
Another multi window mod?
Yes! Because of the wonderful xposed framework it should work on all roms that have the normal multiwindow control.
But wait there is more! With others mods if you try to move an app to the bar from the edit page sometimes, you're suddenly dragging a different app, but with my mod this is fixed Now also features correct sorting on reboot and faster start up times. How to Download and install the xposed framework from the thread above (no flashing required, but does require root)
Download and install my attached APK
In the xposed installer app goto the modules pane and activate my mod
Reboot
Enjoy
How to 240 DPIDownload and install the xposed App settings mod http://www.villainrom.co.uk/forum/th...settings.5486/

Seems to work fine on 4.1.2 LK7 . It didnt seem to like apps that only work in landscape but I expected that. Thanks very much for this so much easier than the other mods.

I don't know but i think so, just test it i guess The worst that could happen is that the multiwindow bar process stops, and then you can disable the mod with 4 clicks.

Its working fine on the N7105 just make sure you install the xposed framework correctly and all the mods work brilliantly

It should work on any stock rom. Just make sure you install the xposed framework once you've opened it. You have to reboot for a mod to work once activated in the xposed framework

I just sat down to make this myself, since I noticed that people still need to download an "updated" version of Multiwindow for their phone... Nice work Just saved me making it Having trouble getting an answer? | What is XDA about? | How to ask for help?

Wonderful. I think if xposed mods were grouped up in pulser_g2 thread to make that a sort of repository, it would make more people aware of them.

I don't agree, either 1 post or 100 posts which will you notice? Also if things start stacking up developers wont be able to keep questions and such separated, if everyone posts in the same thread.
