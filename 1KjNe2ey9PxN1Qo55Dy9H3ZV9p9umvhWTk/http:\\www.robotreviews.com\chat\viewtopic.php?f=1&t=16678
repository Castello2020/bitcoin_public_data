4210 can update firmware but wont power on
by newmom » December 22nd, 2012, 1:11 pm This is a new problem for me. 4210 will not power on, except when attached to scheduler update. It counts down from a hundred and then beeps and displays DONE. But when up attached, it does nothing ( no lights or power at all). Strange thing is when re attached, it powers on (just the lights) then counts down again, over and over.Anyone have a clue?

by vic7767 » December 22nd, 2012, 1:31 pm That just indicates that the battery power is present on the SCI port and the Scheduler bootloader is running. The Roomba MCU is probably duff.

Re: 4210 can update firmware but wont power on
by newmom » December 22nd, 2012, 1:41 pm So you mean the PCB is junk and even though I am getting the count down, the firmware is not updating? I didn't pay much for this Roomba and it looks to have some usable parts, so not a total loss. Does th e PCB have components that I could use on another PCB or is the whole thing toast?

Re: 4210 can update firmware but wont power on
by newmom » December 22nd, 2012, 1:55 pm Why don't I ever remember that????????????????/ Yes, it powers on with the remote, but isn't working any where close to correct. Is there any way to run diagnostics if I can't get it to power on without the remote? It is going in a circle stopping sometimes continuing after a seconds sometimes it reverses.

by vic7767 » December 22nd, 2012, 2:13 pm Now would be the time to take the cover with the button User Interface and take it apart and clean the button membrane and contact surfaces then test.

by newmom » December 22nd, 2012, 3:02 pm Okay, I kind of thought that but I was just hoping I could run diagnostics first to see if there was even a reason to do the work New Mom to four irobots

by newmom » December 22nd, 2012, 6:40 pm Yes, it was the control panel buttons. I just happened to have another cover that I used with it and it worked perfectly. Thanks very much for all your help this year and Happy Holidays!

Re: 4210 can update firmware but wont power on
by mfortuna » December 23rd, 2012, 9:17 am Just an FYI, if the scheduler update works, the roomba has good firmware in it and should work. There is a specific error code if the firmware is corrupt, the status light blins twice a second.In the service manual, one of the first things suggested when the robot won't turn on is to use a known working control panel.
