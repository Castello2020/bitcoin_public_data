Inspired by this recent post, I've decided to offer one time protein measurement service for your protein supplements.
Here is how it works:
1) Post what you want to submit below. Double submissions of the same brand is accepted. (Edit: Please explicitly indicate that you can send a sample.)
2) I'll PM you my address. I live in the US.
3) You'll send me a spoonful of your powder in a small ziplock with the brand name and your reddit nick. Unopened sample packs are preferred. It should reach me by May 27.
4) Following week I'll measure the samples using a colorimetric assay from Biorad (same or similar to the one in the other post). I'll post the results on a public Google doc and indicate who sent which sample.
Does it sound good?
tl;dr
PS: Hopefully it won't take too much of my time, but in case you want to get me a cup of coffee here is a bitcoin address of mine: 14Gy12JvWG43ft56ckfLVAyBNz6frwgwzX
EDIT: I'm going to sleep now. Hopefully this will not lead to thousand submissions by tomorrow.
EDIT: It looks like we can cover all the major brands. Thanks for the help. We have more than enough volunteers now. I am heading to gym and then to the lab. I'll PM as much people as I can later tonight and make a public Google spreadsheet to followup the submissions.
EDIT:Here is the spreadsheet of who committed what. I'll update as I PM.
EDIT: I tried to cover all the major brands, types and price ranges. I am sorry if I didn't choose yours and thank you for the offers, especially the ones offering full tubs. Now we'll wait for the samples. In the meantime I'll discuss some technical details in a separate post.
EDIT: Thanks to whoever got me Reddit Gold. Cheers!
