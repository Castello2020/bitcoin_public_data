		<description><![CDATA[If you can account for all the printed dollars right now it would proof the true value of the currency.  Since the dollar is printed faster than the value is traded on you are diminish the value before you even exchange it.  The gold and bitcoin share the similar value.  Has gold really risen in value or the dollar fallen in value.  Lets put it in perspective.  1oz of gold valued at $150 dollars in 1974 would by me luxury suit. Will the $150 get me same suit?  Well 1oz of gold will.  Because you cant inflate or deflate something that is constant just like bitcoin.  The only difference between BTC and Gold that btc is a liquid value and secured Gold cant be secured or liquid.  Since more and more people believe in BTC the more value it will share with gold plus sustain liquidity and security.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This spike will fade, like the previous two, but what&#039;s important is to look at the overall trend, and it&#039;s always an incline. Bitcoin has a great bounce to it, and even after the last plummet it never dipped below $100/BTC for long, which is huge considering it was at $1.00 just a year ago.
You&#039;re a fool to think the current spike will keep up, but you&#039;re similarly a fool to think Bitcoin doesn&#039;t have a bright future.]]></description>
