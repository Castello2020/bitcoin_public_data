  <h2>Why donate ?</h2>
  <div class="c">
    <p>
      There are a few reasons we need donations:
      <ol>
	<li>We're a small team, and we make Android applications mostly for fun, but
	  we need to justify the time we spend on it.</li>
	<li>We have lots of innovative ideas, but we lack the manpower to implement
	  them all in reasonable time.</li>
	<li>We also need manpower and time to test on various platforms, and ensure
	  worldwide distribution, with all carriers.</li>
	<li>We hate advertisement as much as anyone, and would love to remove them
	  from our apps if we had other ways to make money.</li>
	<li>We are about to launch an operation where we promise to open-source our
	  applications when they reach a point where they brought a certain amount
	  of money. Donations you make today will be part of this revenue.</li>
      </ol>

  <h2>How to donate</h2>
  <div class="c">
    <h3>Flattr</h3>
    Flattr is a new micropayment platform, and it seems promising. If you want to give
    people a way to reward you with a few cents for your blog posts or articles, you
    might want to take a look at it. To flattr us, follow this button:<br/>
    <a href="http://flattr.com/thing/109449/Electric-Goat-Android-applications" target="_blank">
<img src="http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png" alt="Flattr this" title="Flattr this" border="0" /></a>
    <h3>Bitcoins</h3>
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> is a new digital currency.
    Well, if you have bitcoins, you know how it works. To donate bitcoins, use this address: 1MZyvKfnzne4jTto21spWPPNkYe1HsNhq5.</p>
    <p>As an incentive to use bitcoins, for our opensourcing operation, we will use the
    very good rate of 1 BTC for $0.5 (as of today, 1 BTC is worth less than $0.3).</p>
    <h3>Advertisement</h3>
    <p>We're not going to ask you to click ads; please don't if you're not interested.
      But you can support us by not using any ad blocker. Displaying our ads is a way
      to help us. Is you hate ads and use an ad blocker, please consider the other ways
      to donate.</p>
