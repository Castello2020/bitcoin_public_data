	<strong>Money for only running your computer!? It&#39;s more likely than you might think! No referral pyramid scam shit, you can make as much money as you have computing power to devote.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<span style="color:#B22222;"><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>***NOTE: Since the difficulty is very high, unless you have an ASIC mining device and/or a very significant aggregate hash rate <span style="font-size:20px;">(over several TENS OF Ghash/sec or more)</span> you are probably going to spend more on electricity than you can recoup in mined bitcoins, even when mining in a pool! If you have access to free electricity though, then there really is no argument against mining <img alt="wink" height="20" src="http://www.newslobster.com/wp-content/plugins/ckeditor-for-wordpress/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/wink_smile.gif" title="wink" width="20" />(aside from the *possibility* of shortening the lifespan of your graphics card(s)/mining hardware). For solo mining, you may end up waiting for many months/years to generate your own block and get 25 bitcoins (plus transaction fees), or use lots of electricity to maybe not ever generate a block at all.***</strong></span></span>
</p>
<p>
	This post is aimed mostly at people who are already familiar with <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a>), and would like to get started using their GPU(s) to mine for bitcoins in a Windows environment.<br />
	Just some quick terminology: miner = program which is external to bitcoin-qt.exe that uses your graphics card to perform calculations; your GPU is much more efficient at the type of calculations bitcoin does than your CPU
</p>
<p>
	First of all, you are going to need a graphics card that supports CUDA and/or OpenCL; most graphics cards from the past 2-3 years will support this.<br />
	<span style="color: rgb(178, 34, 34);"><strong>*UPDATE*:</strong> If you are unsure, please download <a href="http://www.ozone3d.net/gpu_caps_viewer/" target="_blank">GPU Caps Viewer</a> (I recommend the portable version) to determine if you have a compatible video device and a working version of OpenCL installed. <strong>If you are using an AMD/ATI card you likely need to install the <a href="http://developer.amd.com/gpu/AMDAPPSDK/downloads/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">ATI APP SDK</a></strong> (make sure you obtain the correct version for 32/64-bit Windows).</span>
</p>
<p>
	Please make sure you are using the most recent drivers for your particular graphics card.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><u>Important:</u> Make sure that windows explorer is configured to show file extensions and show hidden folders - In windows explorer go to tools(alt+t)</strong>&rarr;<strong>folder options</strong>&rarr;<strong>view tab</strong>&rarr;<strong>tick the show hidden files/folders button, and also make sure the box for hide file extensions is <em>unchecked</em>. This is very important or you may end up trying to create bitcoin.conf.txt without even realizing the .txt extension is still present!</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<em>Last Updated 7-November-2013 <span style="color:#a9a9a9;">(This info should still *mostly* be correct, please leave a comment if anything is significantly wrong/missing)</span></em>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255);"><u><strong>Too Long; Didn&#39;t Read / Easy and somewhat automated version:</strong></u></span></span></span>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.</strong> Go to <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org" target="_blank">www.bitcoin.org</a>, download and install the most recent version of bitcoin (the default file path should be fine).
</p>
<p>
	<strong>2.</strong> A GUI-based tool exists <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=3878.0" target="_blank">here</a> which will help to speed this up and will automate a lot of the setup steps. Go to the linked forum thread, download and extract the archive somewhere, and then run <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">guiminer.exe</span>.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>3.</strong> From the GUIMiner interface, click solo utilities &rarr; set bitcoin client path. Point the dialog box to <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">bitcoin-qt.exe</span>; likely located at <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe</span> or <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe</span>. Next click solo utilities &rarr; create solo password. Pick anything arbitrary for username and password but remember it, as you will need to use this later. Then finally you want to click solo utilities &rarr; launch bitcoin client as server.
</p>
<p>
	This will launch bitcoin ready to be mined with, you must first wait for all the blocks to be downloaded before you can start to mine, and this may take several hours; you can view the current block count <a href="http://blockexplorer.com/q/getblockcount" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>4.</strong> Once all the blocks are downloaded, select solo from the server drop down box, then enter the username and password that you used before, then click start mining. Congratulations, you are now mining for bitcoins
</p>
<p>
	<strong>(Recommended) 5.</strong> Since the difficulty is high now, you will only likely see an immediate return if you mine as part of a pool. The GUI Miner will greatly expedite pool setup and you can find some more information about pools <a href="http://www.newslobster.com/bitcoin/how-to-set-up-pooled-bitcoin-mining-in-windows" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Additional notes:</strong> The GUI Miner also does not display the actual console window of poclbm or whatever miner you may be using; this may be desirable for some people.

	<span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="background-color: rgb(0, 128, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 0);"><u><strong>Long, manual set up version using batch scripts and the command prompt:</strong></u></span></span></span>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><span style="color:#800000;"><em>Please note that the long version of this guide will show you how to do everything manually and via the command line. This is somewhat advanced and only recommended if you are comfortable manually creating/editing text files and using the command prompt.</em></span></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.</strong> To start, head over to <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/" target="_blank">http://www.bitcoin.org/</a> and download the latest windows client. Install it to wherever you want, but it may be of benefit to keep the directory path somewhat simple, because batch scripts and launching from the command line will follow. For argument&#39;s sake, I will just assume you are using the default install path on the 64-bit version of windows, so your install directory may be:
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin</span>
</p>
<p>
	At the time of writing, the latest version of bitcoin is 0.3.23, and your overall path to bitcoin-qt.exe should be:
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe</span>
</p>
<p>
	To start, open up a command prompt (windows key + r &rarr; type cmd &rarr; hit enter), and then navigate to the directory where bitcoin-qt.exe is located. If you&#39;ve been following along with my examples, you will want to type this into the command prompt window:
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin</span>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>2.</strong> Put the command prompt aside for just a second, because before launching bitcoin, you will need to create a text file called <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">bitcoin.conf</span> (the location of this file will vary depending on which version of Windows you are using)
</p>
<p>
	If you are using Windows 7 or Vista, navigate to:<br />
	<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin</span>
</p>
<p>
	If you are using Windows XP, navigate to:<br />
	<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">C:\Documents and Settings\[username]\Application Data\Bitcoin</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">(You will probably need to create the &quot;Bitcoin&quot; directory, as bitcoin-qt.exe will auto-create it on first run, but you haven&#39;t yet run it&#8230; This is also where showing hidden folders comes into play, because on Windows 7 the AppData directory is hidden; Application Data may be hidden on XP as well)</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Inside the appropriate folder, just right click and select new</span></span>&rarr;text document, then rename this file to <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">bitcoin.conf</span>
</p>
<p>
	Once you have created this file, open it up with your favorite text editor and add the following 2 lines (don&#39;t forget to save it when finished):
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">rpcuser=youruser<br />
	rpcpassword=yourpw</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Where <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">youruser</span> and <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">yourpw</span> should be any arbitrary username and password; this is supplied to the miner later on via command line so that the miners can communicate with bitcoin-qt.exe (these are the values that bitcoin expects, if the miner specifies different values at launch you will likely get RPC errors).</span>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>3.</strong> Next, you want to start bitcoin-qt.exe with the &#39;<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">-server</span>&#39; argument specified. This tells bitcoin that there will be external programs running and allows bitcoin to communicate with them. To do so, bring your command prompt back into focus and type:
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">bitcoin-qt.exe -server</span>
</p>
<p>
	(alternatively you can just launch bitcoind.exe from the \daemon directory, which is the GUI-less client, but I prefer to use the GUI client. Using bitcoind.exe is equivalent to launching bitcoin-qt.exe with the arguments -server -daemon specified)
</p>
<p>
	Now you will see bitcoin start up for the first time. Your client must first download the <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=block_chain" target="_blank">block chain</a> before you will be able to start generating coins, and this is done automatically on first startup. You will see the number of blocks begin to increase over time, and at the time of writing there are 130,805 blocks (you can view the current block count <a href="http://blockexplorer.com/q/getblockcount" target="_blank">here</a>). This can take many hours, so be patient and let it do its thing. This process can be sped up if you forward port 8333 TCP on your router, but this is not required.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>4.</strong> Next, head on over to <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=1334.0" target="_blank">this thread</a> and download the latest <strong><em>poclbm_py2exe</em></strong> binary from the first post. There are other miners available which work in windows, but m0mchil&#39;s is the one that I use and this guide will instruct how to set up this particular miner. (poclbm stands for (I believe&#8230;) <u>P</u>y<u>O</u>pen<u>CL</u> <u>B</u>itcoin <u>M</u>iner)
</p>
<p>
	If you have been following along so far, I would suggest that you create a new directory inside <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin</span> to reflect the latest version of the windows binary. At the time of writing the most recent version is <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">poclbm_py2exe_20110709</span>, so you should create a new directory
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">and then extract the contents of the archive to this new folder. The executable which will be used is </span>poclbm.exe</span><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">, but this must be launched via command line and given several launch parameters. This can be tedious to do on windows, so we will expedite this with a batch script.</span></span><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> (and your final path<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> to poclbm.exe s</span>hould be </span></span><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709\</span><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">poclbm.exe)</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>5.</strong> You can place the batch script anywhere you like; I put mine on my desktop for easy access. </span></span>Right click again and create a new text file, then rename it to <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">whatever_you_want.bat</span>, all that matters here is the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">.bat</span> extension. Right click on this file and hit edit (double clicking on it will launch it). In this batch file you want to put the following contents (this is assuming you&#39;re following the convention of this guide so far - if you are using your own directory structure, then use whatever location you have chosen instead):
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">start /D&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709&quot; poclbm.exe youruser:yourpw@localhost:8332 --device=0</span><br />
	<strong><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">(Similarly, for using a pool you can do something like this:&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">start /D&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709&quot; </span><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">poclbm.exe http://poolworker.1:pool_pw1@api2.bitcoin.cz:8332 --device=0</span></span><strong><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"> )</span></span></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">***(</span><strong><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Important Note: </span></strong><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Some people have been having issues with the batch script failing to launch initially. It seems that it may be important to specify your device number along with the rest of the launch parameters on each line of the batch script. This can be done by simply specifying <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">--device=X</span>, where X is the number of your desired video device; most likely 0. If you have multiple devices, then the 2nd device is likely &quot;1&quot;, and so on; if you are using onboard video I am not sure how this would work&#8230;)***</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&quot;start&quot; just tells the batch script to start a new process in its own window, the /D parameter specifies the directory that the program is located in (this allows the batch script to be launched from anywhere on your computer), and then poclbm.exe is just the target program, followed by the arguments it needs to run properly. Make sure to use the same user and password that you specified earlier in your bitcoin.conf file. Quotes are needed whenever paths have a space in them.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
	Now all that&#39;s left to do is save this file and wait until bitcoin finishes downloading all the blocks; <u><strong><span style="color:#b22222;"><em>you cannot generate until you have acquired all blocks</em></span></strong></u>.<br />
	(<strong>You may end up waiting a long time for this to finish, so if you want to take some time to go read more about bitcoins and how the system works, now is a good time</strong> )
</p>
<p>
	Once all blocks have been acquired, make sure bitcoin is running with the -server switch, then simply double click on your batch file. A new window should pop up and after a few seconds. If all is going well, your hashrate will be displayed. When you want to exit just &quot;x&quot; out of the window or press ctrl-c.
</p>
<p>
	You can make a batch script to launch bitcoin-qt.exe with the -server argument as well, its contents should look something like this:<br />
	<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">start /D&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin&quot;</span><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"> bitcoin-qt.exe -server</span>
</p>
<p>
	If you have more than one graphics card, you can use them both at the same time by doing something similar to this within your batch file:
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">start /D&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709&quot; poclbm.exe </span></span><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">youruser:yourpw@localhost:8332</span><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"> --device=0<br />
	start /D&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709&quot; poclbm.exe </span></span><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">youruser:yourpw@localhost:8332</span><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"> --device=1</span></span>
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">for however many devices you use. This will open up a new window for each graphics card and show each card&#39;s hashrate.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
	Another switch you may want to play around with is the -w switch, which indicates the worksize for your card to use; for example:

<p>
	<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">By default, m0mchil&#39;s miner will use the maximum work size supported by your card, most likely 256 or 512. </span></span>You can play around with different sizes to see which gives you the highest hashrate; the size must be a power of 2. You will know if you have exceeded your card&#39;s maximum size if the miner errors or crashes when you try to start it; going too small will greatly lower your hashrate. You can also play around with the -v argument as well.
</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	If you notice your desktop is being sluggish you can mitigate this by adding:
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">-f 60</span>
</p>
<p>
	to the end of each line of your batch script.
</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Assuming you have gotten this far and everything works, you can add the totals of each individual hashrate from your GPU(s), and put the grand total into <a href="http://www.alloscomp.com/bitcoin/calculator.php" target="_blank">this calculator</a> to get an idea of how much you can earn daily (if you use a pool). If you are mining solo assume that the expected average time to generate a block is easily <strike>4-8 weeks</strike> several decades&#8230;or much longer (but this will get you 25BTC).
</p>
<p>
	Now all you have to do is wait&#8230;
</p>
<p>
	Note that it will likely take many weeks to generate coins, and you are likely to notice an increase in your power bill while you run your bitcoin miners (Please Note: if you are not using high-end hardware, it is likely that you will spend more on power than you can recoup via bitcoin generation and sales for solo mining). Additionally, you may want to look into doing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXr6IIj1sLY" target="_blank">something like this</a> with [<strike><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/index.php?page=rivatuner" target="_blank">RivaTuner</a></strike> <strong>NO LONGER UPDATED, SEE BELOW</strong>] or a similar app to mitigate the temperature increase on your graphics device(s). (I think that rivatuner also works with newer amd/ati cards)<br />

<p>
	<strong><u>Troubleshooting:</u></strong> It seems that some people are having issues where the batch script just pops up for a second and then closes without anything happening. This usually indicates that whatever you are trying to launch is failing and quickly prints out an error message on the console window opened by the batch script, but since it fails immediately it closes too quickly for you to read it. In order to determine what the problem is, you will need to navigate to the location of poclbm.exe within a new command prompt; just use <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">cd <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">as</span></span> is described somewhat in step 1. Once you are in the directory where poclbm.exe is located, you should now try to launch poclbm.exe with the arguments exactly as they are contained in the batch script. So assuming you have been following the conventions of this guide so far, and your batch script fails to start the miner successfully, you would type the following once you are in the directory <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">:</span></span>
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">poclbm.exe </span></span></span><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">youruser:yourpw@localhost:8332</span><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"> --device=0</span></span></span>
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">This is just how you would normally launch the miner anyway, the batch script simply does this for you when you double click on it. By entering this manually from within an already-open command prompt, if the miner fails to launch, the error messages will be printed to the console and will remain there for you to read. This should give you the specific problem that is preventing your miner from launching, and allow you to provide a more specific error message than &quot;it doesn&#39;t open&quot;.</span></span></span></span>

	Once you do finally generate some coins, you can head on over to <a href="http://www.mtgox.com" target="_blank">www.mtgox.com</a> and create an account. You can now deposit some bitcoins into your account and get trading (there are other exchange sites but mtgox still the largest). More information can be obtained by talking with the folks in #bitcoin-otc on irc.freenode.net; people may be willing to purchase bitcoins directly from you for paypal or other methods of currency exchange. <span style="color:#ffff00;"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: Paypal does <u>NOT</u> like bitcoin, you <u>SHOULD NOT</u> mention bitcoins at all in any correspondence with paypal, nor should you mention it at all when transferring money!!!</strong></span></span></span><br />

I did these steps with a GeForce 9600 GT, and got 8000 khash/s.&nbsp;<br />
Then I noticed that my driver wasn&#039;t as up-to-date as I thought it was, and after updating, got to 14000 khash/s. Doesn&#039;t sound too great compared to others here&#8230;.<br />
I checked GRU caps viewer, and I definitely have BUDA and openCL.<br />

			<p>Another success&#8230;<br />
Installing the ATI stream SDK didn&#039;t work for me, I had older ATI drivers. Uninstalled the stream SDK, downloaded &amp; installed the latest Catalyst driver (the Accelerated Parallel Processing version), didn&#039;t need to re-install the stream sdk (it appears Catalyst 10.12 comes with stream 2.3). Doing 27M on my HD 4670, pretty good.<br />
For interest I tried running the OpenCL on the CPU. I got about 1650 khash, compared to 3300 khash on the main client. So for me OpenCL on the CPU ran exactly half as fast as the native client on the CPU. I know that&#039;s not how you&#039;re supposed to use it, just interesting.<br />

			<p>Thanks for the informative write-up.  You helped me go from 6mhash/s to 365mhash/s now that I&#8217;m using my 5870 as a miner as well as a 9800gtx+ which is in another machine that I&#8217;m using as a remote miner client.</p>
<p>Needless to say I&#8217;m very happy 8D</p>
<p>I have one concern though, when using the gethashespersec command on the bitcoin.exe -server, it only calculates the CPU hashes/s as per the bitcoin GUI.  Is there any way to get a total hashes/s, including the external miners?  </p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m being too skeptical but I&#8217;d like some confirmation that the work the external miner GPUs are doing is not being wasted as those numbers just sound too good to be true! That or I sorely underestimated the computing power of a GPU <img src="http://www.newslobster.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

			<p>it would be nice if there was some indication in either the bitcoin GUI or the debug.log that anything was happening, if not poclbm itself.<br />
I connected to test and at least saw what it looked like to generate a few blocks, but&nbsp;my log looks very different on the test and the main. Main looks like<br />
IRC got join<br />
	IRC got join<br />
	IRC got join<br />
	AddAddress()<br />
	IRC got new address<br />
	received: addr (31 bytes)<br />

	AddAddress()<br />
	IRC got new address<br />
	IRC got join<br />
	IRC got join<br />
	sending: addr (31 bytes)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
mostly, where the test one actually looked like it was calculating more&#8230; does this make sense? I read on the forums that the newest poclbm was supposed to have a &quot;block status&quot; but all i see in my window is a slightly changing ###### khash/s number&#8230;.</p>

			<p>It can be annoying sometimes not knowing if it&#8217;s working, but if you can see the hashrate, it is working. When you finally do get a block it will show up with like &#8220;abcd0ef12 12/20/10 04:20 accepted&#8221;, but not much more than that. After a while it will show up in your bitcoin.exe UI as a &#8220;Generated&#8221; transaction.</p>
<p>Running -testnet just gives you a much lower difficulty so blocks will appear within a few minutes to indicate that all is well.<br />
Don&#8217;t forget, for testnet, you may need to make a copy of your bitcoin.conf file inside the /bictcoin/testnet folder in your appropriate user profile location.</p>

			<p>Thanks. I have a headless desktop, only used VGA/TV converter occasionally.&nbsp;<br />
Windows device manager shows there&#039;s a HD5700 card, but ATI stream SDK keeps saying there&#039;s no OpenCL driver found. CPU is used instead (something like that). I can run the poclbm but only got mere 1800 Khash out of it (the CPU I suppose).</p>

I create the bitcoin.conf file in &quot;C:\Users\Nick\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin&quot;, with a username and password, and then start bitcoin via the command line using -server.&nbsp;<br />
But when I do it says &quot;Warning: to use the &#039;-server&#039; option, you must set rpcpassword = &lt;password&gt; in the configuration file &#039;C:/Users/Nick/AppData/Roaming/Bitcoin/bitcoin.conf. If the file does not exist, create it with owner-readable-only file permissions&quot;<br />

			<p>Hi, lobster, only a noob question : </p>
<p>	I just don&acute;t get this part :<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Next, you want to start bitcoin.exe with the &#039;<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace">-server</span>&#039; argument specified. This tells bitcoin that there will be external programs running and allows bitcoin to communicate with them. To do so, bring your command prompt back into focus and type:<br />
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace">bitcoin.exe -server&quot;</p>
<p>	i mean, if i change the .exe file into &quot;bitcoin.exe -server&quot; the program will not be able to execute.. i don&acute;t know what else can i do&#8230; maybe i read wrong..also, i followed all the following steps, and when i click (BUT WITH THE BITCOIN OPENED WITHOUT THE -SERVER) the .bat file i get this message : </p>
<p>	&quot;problems communicating with bitcoin RPC&quot;</p>
<p>	Hope to get a solution!, thanks for your time<br />

			<p>Nick: bitcoind will work for you, but if you use regular bitcoin.exe you need to execute it from the command line, that is where you specify &quot;-server&quot;. Also, the batch script should only be open for a very short period of time to launch whatever you are using it to launch, and should not even stick around long enough for you to need to x out of it.</p>
<p>ted: There are no calculations to be &quot;resumed&quot;, bitcoin tries to &quot;solve&quot; a problem basically, and it just throws lots and lots of possible solutions at it. You may get lucky and find one and thus generate a block, but there is nothing that needs to be resumed if you stop coin generation</p>
<p>matteumayo: I plan to do that once slush gets the issues he&#39;s been having with his pool fixed</p>
<p>anon: that sounds a bit low perhaps, you may want to ask about that on the forums or IRC</p>

			<p>Matthew, when you run the GPU client, it says the total k/hash rate, just combine that rate with the CPU rate displayed on the bottom left of the bitcoin client when it&#039;s generating.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The CPU rate will always be much smaller in comparison to the GPU however.</p>

			<p>Nick: I think you are still confused. You should not be renaming your executable to include &quot;-server&quot;. You need to launch bitcoin.exe from the command prompt, and you only type &quot;-server&quot; into the command line or your batch script. When you launch bitcoin.exe properly with the -server argument, it will just show up normally as the bitcoin gui, but will also allow you to use your miner with it (you can then minimize bitcoin to the system tray if you launch bitcoin.exe). bitcoind.exe is just the gui-less version of bitcoin so you will not see anything aside from the console window that says &quot;bitcoin server starting&quot;.</p>
<p>When you do finally generate a block, the bitcoin gui (using bitcoin.exe, NOT bitcoind.exe) will show a &quot;Generated&quot; transaction and you will be credited with 50btc. Also, the miner will report something like this to indicate a block has been generated:</p>

			<p>32000 khash/s with an ATI 4600. Not great, but SIGNIFICANTLY faster than my quad core cpu. Running with all 4 cpu&#039;s, it was 4200 khash/s, and the fan (of course) ran constantly! HUGE difference even with a mediocre card&#8230; Thanks LobsterMan!!!</p>

			<p>Julio (I&#39;ll do my best to interpret your question <img src="http://www.newslobster.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  ): I don&#39;t think that there is any negative effect from running both at the same time (CPU + GPU), aside from increased heat output and power consumption. These components are designed for intensive computation, so letting them idle is just &quot;wasting&quot; cpu cycles that could have gone into possibly generating coins. Again though, you should take power consumption into consideration, because most modern hardware and quad core cpu&#39;s can use a lot of energy. Just make sure that the temperature of your card and cpu are reasonable and make sure yours fans are working (and dust-free) and you should be ok.</p>
<p>The only real consideration for me is whether or not I am playing a game at the moment, as counter-strike is somewhat laggy when I am running 2 miners. If you don&#39;t mind the lag, there should be no problem letting the miners run essentially forever.</p>
<p>Personally, I have rivatuner set up so that when my cards heat up, the fans go to 80% speed (~2600rpm, I am afraid of having them run at 100% all the time) and my GPU cores usually max out at around 80-84&deg;C</p>

			<p>I followed your instructions (attempting both bitcoin.exe - server and running from bitcoind.exe), and I triple-checked that the .conf and batch files were set up properly.&nbsp; But once I have Bitcoin running and then launch the batch file, I just see the command window pop up very briefly and then go away.&nbsp; I don&#039;t get the window you describe that shows a hash rate from my GPU (which is an Nvidia).&nbsp; What could be going wrong?<br />

			<p>Thanks, Lobsterman.&nbsp; I ran it in the console window and this is what I got as the message:<br />
<code>Traceback (most recent call last):<br />
	&nbsp; File &quot;poclbm.py&quot;, line 3, in &lt;module&gt;<br />

<p>	ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found.</code><br />
It looked like the problem might be that I needed to unzip the file &quot;library.zip&quot;, which I did, into the same directory as the poclbm_py2exe_20110222 folder, but got the same message.&nbsp; I also tried copying libeay32.dll from the main bitcoin directory into that folder (because I had seen bitcoind.exe need that DLL in the same directory), but still got the same message.<br />
Any further suggestions?&nbsp; Does library.zip need to be unzipped, or unzipped a different way?<br />
Thanks again for helping me troubleshoot this.&nbsp; You&#039;re a good human.</p>

			<p>Daniel: The syntax of your batch file is incorrect&#8230;you want a space between python and poclbm.exe; I&#039;m also not sure if you can use underscores as spaces, but your main problem is that \ should be a space.</p>
<p>I also edited your email address out of your post, I&#8217;m pretty sure spammers scrape these pages for emails so you don&#8217;t really want to put yours out in the open like that.</p>

			<p>Hi,<br />
Thanks for the information and the python. Excellent.<br />
I found that using -f 60 did not help my desktop responsiveness (winXP 64) - however changing thre priority on the process of poclbm.exe to &#039;below normal&#039; helped a lot. With minimal loss of hashes.<br />
Hope this helps someone.<br />

			<p>&quot;system cannot find the file specified&quot; which obviously means I mistyped the file name. Except i typed it right, and I am in the right directory.

c:\Bitcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110222&gt; poclbm.exe --rpuser=user --rpcpassword=pass --device=0<br />
the system cannot find the file specified.<br />

			<p>Matthew: make sure the EXE file is actually in that folder. It sounds like it&#039;s not. It could be due to an issue with extraction, or the files were&nbsp;unknowingly&nbsp;extracted to a subfolder.<br />
Alternatively, try a GUI version of m0mchil&#039;s tool here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=3878.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=3878.0</a>. I had to use it as --device=0 was actually pointing to my CPU. I didn&#039;t figure this out (wondering why Mhash/s was so low) until I used the GUI tool.<br />
I&#039;m currently using it to get 160Mhash/s on my 5770. I don&#039;t believe there&#039;s any performance hit in using it; if there is, it would be negligible.</p>

			<p>Hi Lobsterman, thanks for linking to my GUI tool. I was one of the first people to use your guide way back in December and it really helped get me started in the Bitcoin community <img src="http://www.newslobster.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /><br />
Your post mentions you haven&#039;t tried the GUI - I&#039;d encourage you to give it a try even if you have already got things running on the command line. It makes it a lot easier to manage multiple miners in a nice tabbed interface, supports several common pools out of the box, and in the next version you&#039;ll be able to view your balance from inside the GUI.&nbsp;<br />

			<p>Here&#039;s a quick script that could replace the bat-file. This is a vbscript.<br />
	It could be put in the startup-folder, and it will run the bitcoin deamon<br />
	and poclbm.exe in the background. I&#039;ve just made this little script, and<br />
	verified that it works. It will also make a couple of log files. runtime.log<br />
	will track the running time in seconds for each session. Rate.log will keep<br />
	track of khash/s every minute. This could be expanded in many ways. One idea<br />
	could be do code some interaction with the calculatorr that calculates the<br />
	likelyhood of you completing a block and recieving a 50 bitcoins. Or you could<br />
	expand on this script and make an automated ftp-upload to a web site that could<br />
	keep track of your mining efforts.</p>
<p>	To make this working on my machine (windows 7, 64bit running ATI Radeon HD 5700,<br />

			<p>cwilli: &quot;Generate coins&quot; from within bitcoin should only be using your cpu and should have no effect on your gpu miners.

			<p><strong>Update: Issue Resolved</strong><br />
In case anyone else encounters something similar, I ended up uninstalling everything &#039;ATI&#039; - drivers, CCC, etc., removing both cards (I swaped their positions as well just to be safe), attaching the crossfire cable, and rebooting - then i installed the latest drivers, etc. from Radeon (the 11.5 set). I think there was some kind of driver conflict going on.<br />
I now have two GPUs I can target with the miner (device 0 and 1 - CPU is now 2) and getting about 180,000 khash/s on each (going with -w 128 added abouut 30,000).

			<p>First of all, thanks for the guide Lobster!<br />
in my bitcoin.conf I have<br />
rpcuser=user<br />
rpcpassword=1<br />
my batch file is<br />
start /DC:\bitcoin\poclbm_20110428\ poclbm.exe --user=user --pass=1 --device=0<br />
The error I get is &quot;Problems communicating with bitcoin RPC&quot;. I&#039;ve read other solutions on it, but none of them seem to apply to me. I had a suspicion that it was a permissions issue, but running both as administrator did not help.<br />
The other issue I suspect are my ports, but since I am using University of California, Santa Barbara internet, I don&#039;t know if the required ports are blocked or not. However, PTP and other applications which could require port forwarding normally work.&nbsp;<br />
I don&#039;t know what else could be causing the issue.</p>

			<p>Alan: First of all make sure your file extensions are correct, and that&nbsp; you have actually called the file bitcoin.conf and not bitcoin.conf.txt. Further, also make sure you have acquired all the blocks. Other than that, make sure you are using the most recent version of bitcoin and your graphics drivers. Of all the people who have had this issue, it&#39;s turned out that one of the aforementioned scenarios is usually the problem&#8230;It&#8217;s also probably not related to port forwarding. Maybe it doesn&#8217;t like user=user, you could also try changing that around</p>
<p>Also make sure you&#8217;ve launched bitcoin with the -server switch</p>

			<p>Hey Lobster<br />
Good to see someone actively helping people with their guides. You are the man.<br />
Anyway,<br />
	I&#039;m getting the same issue as Alan. Box is an i7 950 with dual GTX 580s on W7 - Bitcoin has been running for hours and the blocks count at the bottom is sitting pretty at 129159. When I first ran the batfile it just said bitcoin was still grabbing blocks. Pretty sure it&#039;s done now cause the message I&#039;m getting is the problems communicating with bitcoin rpc issue. All system drivers including video are up to date. Using:<br />
start /dD:\Programs\Bitcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110428 poclbm.exe --user=charlie --pass=charlie --device=0 --verbose<br />
Even tried:<br />
start /dD:\Programs\Bitcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110428 poclbm.exe -0 192.168.1.110 --user=charlie --pass=charlie --device=0 --verbose (i.e. specifying my system, even used 127.0.0.1, same issue)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Netstat shows a connection on port 8333 so I added --port 8333 to the run as well. Router (WRT54G running open DDRT) has my box set as DMZ AND ports 8333 and 8332 forwarded to my system. Still nothing. Tried running both bitcoin and the bath file as administrator - Nothing. Any ideas?</p>

			<p>Hi<br />
I also noticed that 0.3.22 doesn&#039;t work as well but when I start the guiminer for solo mining, the difficulty is at 1 when the current difficulty is much higher. Is it safe to assume that the guiminer is simply calculating for nothing?</p>

			<p>Hey LobsterMan,<br />
Nice tutorial. I&#039;m sorta new to BTC but you tut got me up and running quickly. Thanks!<br />
A question though:<br />
I have bitcoin.exe running in server mode on PC &quot;X&quot;. I have poclbm running on PC &quot;X&quot; and its working fine. I also have PC &quot;Y&quot; running poclbm with arg --host=IP_OF_PCX. And it seems to be working.<br />
Are PC &quot;X&quot; and PC &quot;Y&quot; working together to solve a block, or are they working on one block each? If the latter is true, then how do I set things up to have separate PC GPUS pool resources to solve one block? I&#039;ve read your other posting regarding pooling, but it refers to third party services. How can I do this &quot;in-house&quot;?<br />
Thanks again!<br />

			<p>For anyone with the -server launch giving them the &quot;bitcoin.conf does not exist&quot; error, this one.<br />
&quot;Warning: to use the &#039;-server&#039; option, you must set rpcpassword = &lt;password&gt; in the configuration file &#039;C:/Users/Nick/AppData/Roaming/Bitcoin/bitcoin.conf. If the file does not exist, create it with owner-readable-only file permissions&quot;<br />
The problem I had was that I use windows 7 and the file was actually called &quot;bitcoin.conf.txt&quot;.&nbsp; You have to turn off &quot;hide extentions for known file types&quot; in Tools&gt;Folder Options&gt;View&nbsp; then rename it to &quot;bitcoin.conf&quot;.<br />

			<p>Would it matter that I already had been running the bitcoin.exe client for days, with Generating Coins enabled (nothing ever happened except for having my CPUs pegged at 100%.<br />
Do I need to delete everything out of my AppData\bitcoin\ folder before I start this GPU mining? I wasn&#039;t aware that I couldn&#039;t mine with just the bitcoin.exe client. I have a Radeon 6950 and a core i7 920. I should be able to mine fairly decently.<br />
And last thing: What&#039;s the difference between using bitcoin.exe to generate coins (is that the same as mining, seems to, as CPU was pegged) or using a mining program, like the poclbm.exe I download?<br />

			<p>bill: I&#39;ve had other people ask for similar things&#8230;I suppose a tl;dr version couldn&#39;t hurt</p>
<p>Peter Filias: That sounds about right, you may be able to tweak -w and -v to get a few more mhash/s out of it. Also note basic CPU mining has been removed from bitcoin 0.3.23 since it is really inefficient to mine on a CPU through the default client with the difficulty so high.</p>
<p>bupojung: Yes that seems about correct as well</p>
<p>Carlos RH Ruiz: Looks like either a drivers issue or you are trying to use the wrong device for poclbm, you may want to use gpu caps viewer which is linked at the top of this post to ensure you are capable of running opencl</p>

			<p>Hey LobsterMan,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I am a complete and total noob at this.&nbsp; I set up the miner correctly and got it running, everything is fine there.&nbsp; My question is, how do i know when i have mined a coin?<br />
This is the part that i dont get.&nbsp; How does it know i am the one mining it and where will these coins show up once i complete a block?<br />
Also one more question, do i have to continuously work an entire block straight through or can I stop the miner and then start it up say a few hours later and have it still working the same block? or will i be starting all over on a new block?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
thanks for any help</p>

			<p>brian, you did not say how much you paid for your laptop. to get 5850 class gpu in a laptop, you&#039;d need to pay around $1000+. also, you need to apply the amd Catalyst driver package that contains the opencl runtime (IF your laptop maker allows it, some demand you use their flavor of driver which may not have opencl). otherwise, those 2 things will limit your speed. also, add the command &quot;-v -w 128&quot; to guiminer (don&#039;t forget to save settings).<br />
mege, when you open up guiminer it should show &quot;device 0-0 cypress&quot; in the dropdown. if not, it may be a driver issue. go here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.guru3d.com/category/driversweeper/" rel="nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/category/driversweeper/</a>.&nbsp;use this to clean up your registry:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.piriform.com/CCLEANER" rel="nofollow">http://www.piriform.com/CCLEANER</a>.&nbsp;then reinstall the latest drivers:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/radeonaiw_vista64.aspx?type=2.4.1&amp;product=2.4.1.3.42&amp;lang=us&amp;rev=&amp;ostype=Windows%207%20-%2064-Bit%20Edition" rel="nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/radeonaiw_vista64.aspx?type=2.4.1&#038;product=2.4.1.3.42&#038;lang=us&#038;rev=&#038;ostype=Windows%207%20-%2064-Bit%20Edition</a>&nbsp;(this is 64-bit) or here:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/radeonaiw_vista32.aspx?type=2.4.1&amp;product=2.4.1.3.42&amp;lang=us&amp;rev=&amp;ostype=Windows%207%20-%2032-Bit%20Edition" rel="nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/radeonaiw_vista32.aspx?type=2.4.1&#038;product=2.4.1.3.42&#038;lang=us&#038;rev=&#038;ostype=Windows%207%20-%2032-Bit%20Edition</a>&nbsp;(32-bit).<br />

			<p>Hello, I&#039;ve followed the guide to the letter but I seem to be having a problem with my batch file. Therefore I went to troubleshooting and just accessed the file poclbm.exe with the command prompt. When I put in: </p>
<p>	poclbm.exe --user=pop --pass=sal --device=0<br />
	All it does is respond: poclbm.exe: error: no such option: --user<br />

			<p>with the latest version of poclbm, syntax --user and --password no longer exists. now it must be used like this:</p>
<p>poclbm <a href="http://user:pass@host:port" rel="nofollow">http://user:pass@host:port</a> --device:0</p>
<p>where user is your username, pass is your password, host is your computer (usually typing &#8216;localhost&#8217; is enough) and port is the server port for bitcoin, usually 8332.</p>
<p>so it became like this:</p>
<p>poclbm <a href="http://user:pass@localhost:8332" rel="nofollow">http://user:pass@localhost:8332</a> --device 0</p>

			<p>Hey there. Does mining with GPU still working? Now when there are ASIC mining hardware difficulty should be rocketing up, thus decreasing probability to get BTC&#039;s. GPU cards should use more electricity than they earn BTC now. Or is it not the case when BTC prices are increased?</p>

			<p>Mining with most GPUs isn&#39;t really worth it any more for the most part&#8230;it depends though, with the price so high&#8230; If you have more than a few hundred MHash/sec and are part of a pool you may still be able to make more money than you spend in electricity, but with the difficulty going so high to match the price I really don&#39;t know&#8230;</p>

			<p>clay: As far as I remember&#8230;the GUIMiner has poclbm or whatever miner already included in the package. 2.8mhash/sec looks like a CPU&#39;s rate of mining speed (not a gpu)&#8230;and most pools will give you hashes with &#8220;difficulty 1&#8243; to hash in order to earn shares. You probably do want to join a pool if you are using a GPU to mine.</p>

<span>Hey Guys,</span><br />
	<span>Great guide. &nbsp;I had to follow though some of the comments concerning with the .bat files, .conf files, and .txt files. &nbsp;It&#039;s better to just open Notepad first and then save properly than just right clicking and adding a .txt files with the file name and extension.</span><br />
	<span>Anyways, I&#039;m having some issues; I&#039;m getting this error when trying to run the .bat script&hellip;</span><br />

			<p>SlyG07: There are tons and tons of error message and I haven&#39;t experienced them all&#8230;the #1 thing that will fix most problems is get the latest graphics card drivers, and be sure that your card even supports OpenCL in the first place.

<p>You could also try getting a more recent version of poclbm too, because it seems that some issues may have been fixed in there too.</p>

			<p>	Hello, Im wondering that is it possible that my solo machine cannot get any block forever due to my hash rate is not high enough. As I understand (If Im correct), only first 6 miner that get the solution of a deal are considered as contributers and only they will get new coins. So what if there are always somebody get solution faster than me? Is that means that its possible that I moght get nothing forever? And how does the calculator you peovided calulate my time of earning block?</p>

	Hao Cher: Very possible you may never get a block solo mining (only the first one person who finds the block will get it in the case of solo mining)&#8230; Probability dictates that you should get one eventually, but it is not guaranteed.

			<p>I just want people to know about the GP-GPU mining of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies such as Litecoin, BBQcoin, etc., despite your using your graphics card to generate the hash, your CPU is still being used to ferry the data back and forth between the main memory and your cards, also does the actual submitting of your shares, so the CPU is still being used.</p>
<p>If you use both your CPU and your graphics card (GP-GPU) at the same time and you use all cores at once on the CPU you&#8217;re asking for trouble. Because the CPU has to run your application, the operating system it sits on and of course ferry the data back and forth from the memory to the cores and to the cards and back again, when the data hash is done, then send it. Your CPUs can&#8217;t very well do their job if they are cranked at 75 ~ 100%.</p>
<p>If you have a descent graphics card now that&#8217;s fairly inexpensive, such as an ATI HD5750, it&#8217;s best to stick with GP-GPU number crunching only / hash-bashing.</p>
<p>If you are really serious about this you can get a dedicated miner for Bitcoin from Butterfly Labs which does cryptological  hashes only and a very specific kind (which Bitcoin at current uses). Which would then free up your computer to do other things, such as to game on.</p>
<p>As of the date today, Friday, June 7, 2013, I would not advise anyone to do solo mining unless you get upwards of 332 and above Terahash rates per second. Yes, that is a nut-case high number but you have to remember, pools have all the computing power together and is additive but if you do it solo, you&#8217;re all alone.<br />
You should see the other pools that are mining for Bitcoin, since they use the same shares as what you are mining from the source, they are your competition. So, that means you have to be much faster than all of them combined in effort to keep yourself afloat, thus also generating income at a descent rate too.</p>
<p>So, if you can&#8217;t do this and don&#8217;t have that kind of hardware (give you a hint, it&#8217;s over 1/4 million bucks USD to date to even getting anywhere near this number. It&#8217;s not just the hardware you would be paying for, it&#8217;s the power bill too, by this time you would have a secured building, secured rack enclosures, high speed Internet; 1 ~ 10 Gbps optical Ethernet multi-homed and a crud load of the Butterfly Labs 1,500 GH/s Bitcoin Miner<br />
BitForce Mini Rig SC. </p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>1,000 GH/s is 1.0 TH/s (TeraHash)<br />
1,000 MH/s is 1.0 GH/s (GigaHash)<br />
1,000 kH/s is 1.0 MH/s (MegaHash)</p>
<p>So, just by looking at the note as information, you realize exactly how much processing you need to be doing to outrun the other pool, it borders at this point in time as insanity.  Most people can&#8217;t afford all of this, let alone know how to configure<br />
the myriad of hardware options to get this high-end processing done and submitting hashes like the big dogs.</p>
<p>Stick to pool mining for now.</p>

			<p>I need to correct one error I made in the last statement and it wasn&#8217;t clear.  The operating system and your applications are in memory (collectively sitting on the CPU and the rest of the system).</p>
<p>If you try to use the CPU at max and the GP-GPU at max at the same time your numbers will drop because the bus line in the computer systems are shared with all the components in your system, that gets loaded down and in most cases, DMA can&#8217;t occur if certain conditions aren&#8217;t met. In this case, it&#8217;s not met, which means that your cards will starve for data, which makes the hashrates drop like a rock. If you stop using the CPU for this purpose and just run it on your GP-GPU, your hashrate skyrockets again (which is the way it should be).</p>
<p>When the GP-GPUs crank up to 70 ~ 89 degrees Celsius, that&#8217;s normal for this type of application, make sure you have darn good air circulation in your case and it&#8217;s cool in your room where you are using the system, because you can overheat the cards really quick, if you&#8217;re above 25 degrees Celsius (room temperature), which is 77 degrees Fahrenheit in your room where you are running your computer.</p>

	Just chiming in, the above info by Alex B. is pretty much correct <img src="http://www.newslobster.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
</p>
<p>
	If you want to earn any bitcoins at all, you should use a pool (and mining BTC with your CPU is pretty much pointless at this point in time). It is in theory possible that someone with 100mhash doing solo mining may even generate their own block, but the odds are very much against that happening within 50 years so so&#8230;but since it is all based on luck essentially, you could possibly hit 3 blocks all in a row in under 100 seconds&#8230;but this is even more rare <img src="http://www.newslobster.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
</p>
<p>
	You can see the various pools and their respective percentage of the aggregate hashrate at <a href="http://www.bitcoincharts.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bitcoincharts.com</a> and <a href="http://blockchain.info/pools" rel="nofollow">http://blockchain.info/pools</a>
</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	If you do have &quot;decent&quot; hardware, as in a modern gpu or two, if you can ensure that your cooling is adequate and are aware that your hardware will be somewhat stressed and may (but probably won&#39;t) fail, and you are in a situation that allows you access to free electricity (such as living in a college dorm or apartment), then you may as well mine if you are not using your GPUs for gaming or something else at the time (in a pool, but again there is a small, small chance you could hit a block solo too). Also note that if your computer is in an enclosed space or small room, the area is likely to go up in temperature quite a bit while mining, so make sure nothing catches on fire etc&#8230;</p>

	jacob: If you read the guide carefully it tells you how to start a miner in its own command prompt window, so what it won&#39;t shut before you can view the error message&#8230;. <img src="http://www.newslobster.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
</p>
<p>
	Other than that, some people seem to have the best luck with GUIMiner, as I think the latest version of standalone poclbm may still have some bugs in windows</p>

	JimB: Well&#8230;. that is debatable. If you mine in a pool, with approx 280MHash/sec, you will get *some* bitcoins, but it will probably be very few, only on the order of maybe 0.005 to 0.01 per day/week (I don&#39;t know the exact number, I just pulled that out of my ass, but it is probably somewhat comparable to that). The question is, is it profitable for you to sell or hold the bitcoins you mine, vs. how much it costs you in electricity to run your mining device. If you have a graphics card or other device to mine, and for example live on a college campus with &quot;free&quot; power, then it may be &quot;profitable&quot; to mine anyway even though you will gain very few BTC (as some is better than none). I would however caution that unless you are able to get your hands on a multi-gigahash &quot;ASIC mining device&quot; (google that for more info), you probably should NOT purchase anything with the intent to mine; aside from acquiring it soley for novelty factor (as in the USB block erupters), because you will probably not recoup your investment at this stage in the game.
</p>
<p>
	Who is &quot;gaming&quot; the system now? &#8230;no one really in particular. Some people have these much sought after ASIC mining devices and they are the competitive forces generating most of the BTC at present.
</p>
<p>
	3 Years ago any CPU could mine bitcoins well (and GPUs extremely well). The difficulty was very low and bitcoins were plentiful (but only worth a few &cent;&#8230;don&#39;t we all wish we kept more from way back when&#8230;.). The &quot;difficulty&quot; factor self-adjusts automatically based on how many people mine for bitcoins, and in general only goes up. If you want to learn more about difficulty and how that all works see here (a bit technical but still describes how things work <img src="http://www.newslobster.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />  ): <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty" rel="nofollow">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty</a></p>

I ask because after watching MrJayBushs youtube vid I have my rig doing 260ish Mhash/s but with problems. I have 3 miners on guimer, all slushs pool.&nbsp;My APU does ~1.5Mh/s, and my two RadeonHD6700s do ~300Mh/s. but the only results are with my APU. I get a couple of shares an hour at 1.5MH/s and zero accepted/stale shares with my GPUs. Anybody gots any suggestions? I just found this site so when I have time I&#039;ll look through it more, so apologies in advance.</p>

			<p>	Really, this is the craziest&nbsp;stuff,&nbsp;I have ever heard. Mining for bitcoins on your computer, by the time you mine one of this stupid things or any amount for that matter you&#039;ll be dead. Come on, the US treasury did it better, they cut down trees, put nice little graphics on a piece of paper and call it a dollar bill, and it took them a shorter time than mining for &quot;bitcoins&quot;! What a waste of good computing power.</p>
