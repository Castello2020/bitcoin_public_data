    <h2>What is "Secret Sharing"?</h2>
    
    Citing from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>
    article about <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing">Secret
      Sharing</a>:
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	In <a
	  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">cryptography</a>, a
	<b>secret sharing scheme</b> is a method for distributing a <a
	  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secrecy"><i>secret</i></a> amongst
	a group of participants, each of which is allocated a <i>share</i> of
	the secret. The secret can only be reconstructed when the shares are
	combined together; individual shares are of no use on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
	More formally, in a secret sharing scheme there is one <i>dealer</i>
	and <i>n</i> <i>players</i>. The dealer gives a secret to the players,
	but only when specific conditions are fulfilled. The dealer
	accomplishes this by giving each player a share in such a way that any
	group of <i>t</i> (for <i>threshold</i>) or more players can together
	reconstruct the secret but no group of less than <i>t</i> players
	can. Such a system is called a <i>(t,n)</i>-threshold scheme.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        A popular technique to implement threshold schemes uses <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation">
	polynomial interpolation</a> ("Lagrange interpolation"). This
        method was invented by <a
   	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shamir"> Adi Shamir</a> in
        1979. You can play around with such a scheme on the <a
        href="http://point-at-infinity.org/ssss/demo.html">demo page</a>.
	</p>
    <p>
    Note that Shamir's scheme is provable secure, that means: in a
    <i>(t,n)</i> scheme one can prove that it makes no difference
    whether an attacker has <i>t-1</i> valid shares at his disposal or
    none at all; as long as he has less than
    <i>t</i> shares, there is no better option than guessing to find
    out the secret.
    </p>
      <h2>Where is "Secret Sharing" used?</h2> Some popular examples are:
      <ul>
      <li><p>
	Good passwords are hard to memorize. A clever user could use a
	secret sharing scheme to generate a set of shares for a given
	password and store one share in his address book, one in his
	bank deposit safe, leave one share with a friend, etc. If one day he
	forgets his password, he can reconstruct it easily. Of
	course, writing passwords directly into the address book would
	pose a security risk, as it could be stolen by an "enemy". If
	a secret sharing scheme is used, the attacker has to steal
	many shares from different places.</p>
      <p>
        A typical application of this scenario is the secure implementation of
	an encrypted backup system. Assuming that data recoveries are
	needed rarely, backup data can be public key encrypted -- this
	can be done automatically and without user interaction -- while
	the private recovery key is protected via secret sharing.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li>
	"A dealer could send <i>t</i> shares, all of which are
	necessary to recover the original secret, to a single
	recipient, using <i>t</i> different channels. An attacker
	would have to intercept all <i>t</i> shares to recover the
	secret, a task which may be more difficult than intercepting a
	single message" (<a
	  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing">Wikipedia</a>).
      </li>
      <li>
	The director of a bank could generate shares for the bank's
	vault unlocking code and hand them out to his employees. Even
	if the director is not available, the vault can be opened, but only,
	when a certain number of employees do it together. Here secret
	sharing schemes allow the employment of not fully trusted
	people.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <span class="progname">ssss</span> is an implementation of Shamir's secret sharing
      scheme for UNIX/linux machines. It is free software, the code is
      licensed under the <a
      href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GNU GPL</a> v2.
      <span class="progname">ssss</span> does both: the generation of shares for a known
      secret and the reconstruction of a secret using user provided
      shares.  The software was written in 2006 by B. Poettering, it
      links against the <a href="http://gmplib.org/">GNU libgmp</a>
      multiprecision library (version 4.1.4 works well) and requires
      the <tt>/dev/random</tt> entropy source.

      Someone contributed a <a
      href="http://www.seidlitz.ca/ssss/">Windows port</a> of (an
      outdated version of) <span class="progname">ssss</span> (but
      with a lightly too sloppy random number generation, in my
      opinion).
    </p>

    <h2>How is <span class="progname">ssss</span> used? Is there an
    online demonstration?</h2> 
    <p>
      The generation of shares given a known secret is shown first.  A
      (3,5)-threshold scheme is used, that is: 5 shares are generated,
      the secret can be reconstructed by any subset of size 3.
    </p>
<pre>
% ssss-split -t 3 -n 5
Generating shares using a (3,5) scheme with dynamic security level.
Enter the secret, at most 128 ASCII characters: <i>my secret root password</i>
Using a 184 bit security level.

2-fbc74a03a50e14ab406c225afb5f45c40ae11976d2b665
3-fa1c3a9c6df8af0779c36de6c33f6e36e989d0e0b91309

5-4756974923c0dce0a55f4774d09ca7a4865f64f56a4ee0
</pre>
<br/>
    These shares can be combined to recreate the secret:
<pre>
% ssss-combine -t 3
Enter 3 shares separated by newlines:
Share [1/3]: <i>3-fa1c3a9c6df8af0779c36de6c33f6e36e989d0e0b91309</i>
Share [2/3]: <i>5-4756974923c0dce0a55f4774d09ca7a4865f64f56a4ee0</i>
Share [3/3]: <i>2-fbc74a03a50e14ab406c225afb5f45c40ae11976d2b665</i>
Resulting secret: my secret root password
</pre>
<br/>

    You can try it out on the
    <a href="http://point-at-infinity.org/ssss/demo.html">demo page</a>.

    <p>
      If larger secrets are to be shared a hybrid technique has to be
      applied: encrypt the secret with a block cipher (using openssl,
      gpg, etc) and apply secret sharing to just the key. See the <a href="ssss.1.html">man
      page</a> for more information about this topic.
