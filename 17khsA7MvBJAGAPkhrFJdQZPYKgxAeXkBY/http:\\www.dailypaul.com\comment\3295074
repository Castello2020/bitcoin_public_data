100% pure real money?
Submitted by MMJ Ministry on Sun, 12/22/2013 - 23:51. Permalink
the paper dollar price is listed. and the gold and silver prices are actually for stock market paper which isn't backed by the physical metals. i don't think we even know the fractional reserve metals accounting methods they (big banks) use do we? what happens when everybody wants to cash out and get their physical? it's all just paper contracts that are manipulated by the big banks daily.
gold and silver is a 5000 years old commodity but the paper banker iou's this thread is based on sure isn't.
