i've understood the game since the 90's my friend
Submitted by MMJ Ministry on Wed, 04/10/2013 - 22:41. Permalink
ever since i read the elkhorn manifesto aka shadow of the swastika via Gatewood Galbraith. i also read a great story on the subject back then by michael ruppert about the POP where he talked about cia drug money laundering and how legalized drugs would crash the stock market. Barbara Trents The Panama Deception was another eye opener back in the day. then you have the barry seal story and Gary Webb's series dark alliance etc etc.
