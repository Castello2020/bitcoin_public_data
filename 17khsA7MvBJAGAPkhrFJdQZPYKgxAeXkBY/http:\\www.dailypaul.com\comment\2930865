i don't think it is legal for them to run the plates
Submitted by MMJ Ministry on Mon, 01/28/2013 - 10:04. Permalink
i believe it various from state to state and may differ by jurisdiction but usually law enforcement needs probable cause or some kinda warrant to run the plate #'s through the database to identify everyone there. if they run it you should be able to file a foia request and find out. if the prosecutor in not corrupt and in cahoots with the police/sheriff they will file charges which in most states is a felony. most likely the da is on the take with the leo's so don't expect a prosecution. expect retaliation as you would from any gang or the mob.
