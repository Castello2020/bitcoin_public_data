like alcohol you mean?
Submitted by MMJ Ministry on Wed, 08/28/2013 - 17:27. Permalink
how about prescription drugs, are those a sin? who gets to decide?
i think there is something in the bible against being a "drunkard" and it seems like i also read about them getting "stoned" a lot too. those long haired peace and love hippies sure knew how to party. there was a dude named moses i read about that partied pretty hard and had a bunch wives and built this big bad ass ship that was full of exotic animals and sh!t, no pun intended. those were the days.
