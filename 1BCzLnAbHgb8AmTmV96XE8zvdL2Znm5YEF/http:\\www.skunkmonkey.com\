<div class="posted-aut-cat">Posted in January 4th, 2014  </div>

<div class="posted-aut-cat">by <a href="http://www.skunkmonkey.com/author/admin/" title="Posts by Skunky" rel="author">Skunky</a> in <a href="http://www.skunkmonkey.com/category/ecoins/" title="View all posts in eCoins" rel="category tag">eCoins</a></div>

<div class="post-content"><p>While mining is usually used as the analogy for obtaining coins and is quite apropos, we are going to use a jigsaw puzzle analogy to try and give a little more detail how mining in a pool works. It’s not meant to explain what crypto-currency is or delve into the mathematical aspects of what hashing is. I saw someone on reddit explain it this way but in much less detail and thought it was really good. I&#8217;ve embellished and rewritten what I remember from scratch.</p>
<p>We’re going to start with a factory that makes jigsaw puzzles. This factory is like the coin network. The factory sends out new puzzles like the network sends out blocks. So for our purposes, the puzzle represents a block. Now, you can solve the puzzle yourself or you can get a few friends together and work on it, pooling your resources. Now, when the factory designs a new puzzle, a copy is given to everyone in the network to work on. The race is on to complete the puzzle because the first person to solve the puzzle gets a reward in coins.</p>
<p>Let’s get down to solving this puzzle! Each person picks up a piece, guesses at which way to orient the piece, then tries one location to see if it fits. If not, rotate the piece and try again until either you or someone else solves that puzzle. This process is the equivalent of hashing. When you see your hash rate as 100kh/s, in means you are trying to place a puzzle piece 100,000 times a second. So the faster you mine, the more pieces you can try placing giving. Some puzzles are harder than others and this is indicated by the difficulty. The higher the difficulty, the harder the puzzle gets and the longer it takes to complete.</p>
<p>If the piece you attempt to place seems to fit, others are asked if it really belongs there or if it was jammed and forced into place. If everyone agrees that you placed the piece correctly, you work is accepted (yay!!!) and are credited with one valid share towards the reward if you or someone in your pool completes the puzzle. If it turns out the piece didn&#8217;t really belong there it’s rejected (booooo). This continues until someone solves the puzzle placing the last piece. So now we have one correctly placed puzzle piece equals one valid share in the pool. If another pool or solo miner finishes the puzzle before us, work is stopped on current puzzle and the next one from the factory is started.</p>
<p>When someone places the last piece, the completed puzzle is passed around to other members of the network so it can be confirmed as correctly solved. Once enough people agree that the puzzle is correctly solved, the person, or pool that solved it gets the reward of a random number coins. If another person or pool finished the puzzle and it’s confirmed before yours, the block is considered orphaned and no one gets anything in your pool. The time between each puzzle the pool solves is called a round.</p>
<p>If you are solo mining, you get to keep all those coins to yourself, but only people with a lot of hardware can make that worthwhile. When you are in a pool, the coins are divided up among people that successfully placed a piece of the puzzle. The more pieces you placed, the bigger the share of coins you get. This is why you want as high a hash rate as possible, the more pieces you can try per second, the more you can place correctly.</p>
<p>Pools have two ways of calculating the the number coins each member gets. One method does some manipulation to make sure the higher rate members don’t get all the rewards and the lowest get enough to make it worthwhile. For our purposes, we will use the standard method to explain it. </p>
<p>When the puzzle is finished, the number of correct pieces placed by everyone this round is totaled up. For our example, we’ll say all together the pool placed 1000 pieces(shares) correctly and represents the work done by the pool as a whole(round). During that time you correctly found the place for 50 of those pieces(valid shares). Lets say the random reward(coins) was 500,000. Now taking the reward and dividing by the work done (500,000/1000) we find that each share is worth 500 coins. Since you placed 50 of those pieces, your share is 50 * 500, or 25,000 of those 500,000 coins.</p>
<p>Hopefully this has helped you understand how a pool divides up the work and rewards. Keep in mind there are a number of factors, including random ones, in determining how much you get for your efforts so you have to look at an average over time. When trying out a pool, it’s usually best to give it at least 24 hours to see what you can average out over that time frame. Anything smaller and you are going to find a greater margin of error.</p>

<div class="posted-aut-cat">Posted in December 22nd, 2013  </div>

<div class="posted-aut-cat">by <a href="http://www.skunkmonkey.com/author/admin/" title="Posts by Skunky" rel="author">Skunky</a> in <a href="http://www.skunkmonkey.com/category/general/" title="View all posts in General" rel="category tag">General</a>, <a href="http://www.skunkmonkey.com/category/news/" title="View all posts in News" rel="category tag">News</a></div>

<div class="post-content"><p>If someone had told you a few years ago about about some crazy idea involving using computers to &#8220;mine coins&#8221;, you would have thought they were talking about Minecraft or that they were just crazy. What if they had also told you that you could run a simple program on your computer when you aren&#8217;t using it to make a few thousand of these cyber-coins a day? You would definitely had called them a whack job wasting your time.</p>
<p>BitCoin(BTC), at the time of this article, is hovering just under $600 after a $1200 bubble pop a few weeks back. Now close your eyes and think back to that year or so ago when you first heard about BitCoin. Are you there? Remember you were told you could make thousands per day? Yeah, makes you sick doesn&#8217;t it, because I know a lot of you <i>did</i> hear about BitCoin a year or more ago.</p>
<p>Well, there may still be some golden opportunities on the Crypto &amp; Currency frontier. A new dog is in town that just started in early December called Dogecoin, using Ð (the Latin capital letter for eth) as it&#8217;s symbol. There has been much written on how one pronounces Dogecoin, or doge for short, but I&#8217;ve been reading it as &#8220;Dog-E-Coin&#8221;. That really isn&#8217;t important, but it&#8217;s nice to have the voice in your head say it with confidence. What is important, however, is that while no one expects Ð1=$1000USD, there&#8217;s no reason it can&#8217;t reach at least Ð1=$1USD. Even if it only reaches $0.01USD,  Ð10k=$100USD. </p>
<p>For example, I am making Ð10k a day right now. Of course how much you make depends on your hardware, but as time goes on, it gets harder to mine and your average will drop. The trick is to get in early and hold out for the long term. To illustrate why, the first 100,000 places mined(blocks) contain a random number of coins between 0 and 1 million maximum. After that first 100k block, the maximum number drops, so those blocks have the most potential. BitCoin has matured past that point so far that it takes large computing resources to mine effectively. As of this writing, the Dogecoin network is in the 23k range, so there are well over 75,000 blocks with a potential 1 million coins in each!  </p>
<p>Even if Dogecoin becomes totally worthless, you will have gained valuable knowledge into the currency of the future. The best part is that it&#8217;s really easy to get started. If any of my friends want more information, want to get in on the fun, or just help me by running a miner for me, contact me via Skype or on IRC #doge irc.installgentoo.com. If you already know what you&#8217;re doing, join the InstallGentoo pool and help us solve some blocks!</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<div class="posted-aut-cat">Posted in September 3rd, 2013  </div>

<div class="posted-aut-cat">by <a href="http://www.skunkmonkey.com/author/admin/" title="Posts by Skunky" rel="author">Skunky</a> in <a href="http://www.skunkmonkey.com/category/rants/" title="View all posts in Rants" rel="category tag">Rants</a></div>

<div class="post-content"><p>Let me start by saying I love Steam. They really seem to have almost perfected personal game management from purchase to play. I say almost because it still has a few issues. One of the most annoying ones for me is the amount of space wasted by files left over after an install. We&#8217;re talking redistributable files from Microsoft like .NET and DirectX installers. These files are used once and never needed again. Even worse, each game can end up with an exact copy of the same files. We&#8217;re talking almost 200MB per each game install in some cases. Sometimes they even get left behind when you uninstall the game. Some informal checking found that better than 50% of your games will have at least some left over install files. Some people might say, &#8220;Why bother? I&#8217;ve got a terabyte of space!&#8221;. Well, I like to keep my drives free of as much extra garbage as possible and a few gigabytes is a lot of waste in my book.</p>
<p>Steam could easily help cut down on the waste by having a common repository for these rather common installers from Microsoft. This would be the perfect solution and shouldn&#8217;t be hard to implement. Until Steam figures out a way to cut this cruft from it&#8217;s library, I&#8217;ve found you can remove this garbage without adverse effects. The files may return if the game updates or you do a verify cache, but they are 100% not needed after install or for game play and can safely be removed.</p>
<p>This guide will first explain the files used in the Steam install process then show you how to reclaim that wasted space. This guide assumes you have basic computer skills including navigating your hard drives with Windows Explorer and editing text files.</p>
<h3>Steam Installer</h3>
<p>When you run a Steam game, from the first time to every time after that, it runs an installer script that runs extra installers for thing&#8217;s like .NET and DirectX if they aren&#8217;t installed already. Now this is fine the first time you run the game, but is totally unnecessary after that and can even make game start up times longer. If you look in the root folder of a game in your Steam library, you will notice one or two .vdf files. After examining a few you will learn what files and folder names to keep an eye out for so you can delete them. This installer file is just a text file, so you can open it with Notepad or your favorite text editor. If you do a Windows Search from your Steam library folder (Default: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common) for *.vdf you will find the installers.</p>
<p>Open a .vdf file and let&#8217;s have a look. As you see at the top, it&#8217;s an &#8220;InstallScript&#8221;. There are several optional sections that can appear, but the one we are interested in is called &#8220;Run Process&#8221;. If the script you opened doesn&#8217;t have this section, pick a different one. As you can see, there is a list of various additional installers/patches that the installer fires off. Take note of the names and folders because you will be seeing them a lot. </p>
<h3>Cleaning Up The Mess</h3>
<p>Now that you have the tools and knowledge to find these useless files, you can safely delete them. Look for folders named &#8220;installers&#8221; or &#8220;redist&#8221; and variations. These files will remain deleted until the game updates or you use the verify game files feature. No problem, just revisit the game folder and delete them again.</p>
<h4>Advanced Users</h4>
<p>While experimenting around, I found that you can actually remove the items in the &#8220;Run Process&#8221; section to further insure the game doesn&#8217;t even bother to check when launched. The .vdf file is run every time you launch the game and it runs each installer again. Of course they just quit immediately as they are already marked installed, but you can still see them being run in the launch dialog. By removing the entries in this section I&#8217;ve gotten games to launch faster. I&#8217;ve recently noticed that the Steam client is always refreshing the .vdf file for some games. I don&#8217;t know if this is new and for all games, but I&#8217;d not seen it till today as edits and even deleting the .vdf file altogether has worked for some games in the past. I&#8217;ve had some success with saving the script as an empty file. You can&#8217;t just delete it as Steam will download it if not present, so at a minimum it needs to be an empty file.</p>
<h3>Last Note</h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry about deleting important files or screwing up the installer script .vdf. You can always use the Verify Game Files feature to restore the files. If the game always re-downloads the installers, have a look at the Advanced Users section. You may need to try deleting the Run Processes section.</p>
<h3>My Results</h3>
<p>This is the improvement I got just now on 48 installed games. Bear in mind that I had already cleaned 2-3 games before this pass and your mileage will vary.<br />

<div class="post-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a while since I left some droppings here on the site. I&#8217;ve been trying to put things back together after losing my shit in the economic shit-hole that our government has dropped us in. I&#8217;m just starting to get comfortable in my new cage, but I&#8217;ve still got that itch I can&#8217;t scratch telling me there is still a shoe to drop.</p>
<p>Hopefully, I&#8217;ll be posting more frequently. I&#8217;ve had a lot to say recently but have been doing most of my ranting on Reddit. I&#8217;m going to see if I can&#8217;t channel some of that into some blog posts here where I can express myself without it having to be in response to some one else.</p>
