		<script src="http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div><p>&#8220;Hello.  Landmark Education.  This is Alexia, how may I help you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi Alexia, how are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good.  How are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good.  My name is Jones Brixton. I&#8217;m registered to do the Landmark Forum advanced course next weekend, and I want a refund.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ochay, sure,&#8221; there was some sounds of clambering with the phone.  &#8220;So what makes you think you want a refund?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I signed up to do it after I did the Landmark Forum.  I felt like most everything I learnt in the Landmark Forum was stuff I already knew.  I thought that the advanced course might be stuff that I hadn&#8217;t learnt yet, but as soon as I read the curriculum, I felt disappointed.  It held no appeal for me.  Then hearing people talk about what they learnt in the advanced course, I just didn&#8217;t see the point of it.  And also I have $3000 credit card debt, so I feel my $800 could be put to better use elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ochay.&#8221;  They all pronounce &#8220;Okay&#8221; as if it were a German word.  &#8220;I got it!  A large part of the advanced course is about your act.  Your act is like your personality type that you&#8217;ve had since you were very young, that keeps you from feeling fulfilled.  All your negative associations, and your masks to cover up your true self.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, some people â€“ not saying this is you -&#8221; That&#8217;s precisely what she was saying.Â   &#8220;- some people have an &#8216;I know better&#8217; act.  So when they come in to do the Landmark Forum, they don&#8217;t get much out of it, but as soon as they start the advanced course, it all hits them at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  I did the Landmark Forum.  One of the main reasons I did it was because I wanted to know what was holding me back from finish my novel.  It didn&#8217;t shed any light on that.  In the end, I don&#8217;t think it matters how many courses I do â€“ I think I just have to take responsibility for myself, and just do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ochay, yes.  The Landmark Forum teaches you responsibility.  But just knowing that you have to be responsible doesn&#8217;t help you.  You have to know how to put it into action.  That&#8217;s where your act comes in.  Your act is at the root of everything you do.  You can&#8217;t see your act now â€“ trying to see your act would be like trying to see the backs of your own eyeballs.  So in the advanced course, we get to the bottom of your act and we create a new one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done that already!&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed &#8220;Maybe I was wrong about you being an &#8216;I know better&#8217;.&#8221;  I laughed too.</p>
<p>I said &#8220;The reason I think that I&#8217;ve heard the stuff from the Landmark Forum before â€“ while it was very good â€“ the reason I&#8217;ve heard it is because I&#8217;ve studied, and actively pursued new paths to get knowledge, and -&#8221;   I was going to continue, but suddenly I felt acutely aware that what I was saying could be construed as justifying myself.  &#8220;- yeah.&#8221;  She was judging me.  I stopped talking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got it!&#8221;  Do you really.  &#8220;By taking the advanced course, you can get to the core of who you are, so you can be free of your past and create a new act.  That way, you can get on and be successful in your life.&#8221;  And you won&#8217;t be doomed to failure, as you will without the Landmark Forum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a very clever sales pitch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can say that, but calling it a sales pitch is a very effective way of rationalising it so that you won&#8217;t have to face the truth.&#8221;  The truth being that you should give the Landmark Forum your money.  &#8220;You called me expecting to get a sales pitch.  You&#8217;re seeing everything I&#8217;m saying through a filter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t really have expectations.  But here you are trying to convince me to not get the refund.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to convince you of anything, I&#8217;m simply -&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes you are.  Yes you are.  Yes, you are!&#8221;</p>
<p>She stopped for half a second, and continued, without refuting what I&#8217;d said.  &#8220;Jones, don&#8217;t think that calls like this aren&#8217;t routine.  We expect calls like this to come through.  People start getting nervous about what they might have to face in the advanced course, and they start looking for an easy way out.  I can give you a refund â€“ that&#8217;s fine.  But is that really what you want?  You seem very uncertain.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, I felt very uncertain.  I said &#8220;Let me think.&#8221;</p>
<p>I paused for a minute.  One whole minute.  I sat there in silence trying to find the essence of me, that still small voice that never leads me into folly.  Out of all the high pressure situations I&#8217;ve been in, in my life, this would probably rank top three.  I just can&#8217;t explain how weird it was.  The leader of my Landmark seminar series would later try to explain to me that it was some kind of mistake, that maybe Alexia had been in a bad mood.  But no, you don&#8217;t get mindfuck skills like this by mistake.  This was well-trained ingrained, precise mindfuck shit.  It was a work of art, really.  You don&#8217;t do it like this just because you&#8217;re in a bad mood.  This was much worse than a bad mood.  It was a torrent of emotionless pressure, consistently applied until your mind broke.  I felt pressure to be the ball of reactions that she expected me to be.  It was fucked.  It was brilliant.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a rule in sales for the silent close.  &#8220;Jones?  Are you still there?&#8221;  First one to speak, loses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m still here.  I&#8217;m just thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay&#8230; So what do you want to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want my money back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay&#8230; All but $110 is refundable.  The charge will be reversed onto your credit card.  Is there anything else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.  You keep saying that I&#8217;m interpreting everything you&#8217;re saying.  I think it&#8217;s the other way around.  Good bye.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I have attended one day forum and walked out &#8230;and now i have a higher purpose in life to save others from this nonsense.</p>
<p>I believe God runs this universe and has also given us the free will and strength, grace and inner power to sustain ourselves in life&#8217;s difficult situations. Landmark has completely ruled out the creator which is absoluteiy annoying and i am not talking abt any religion here. I am talking about the living God.</p>
<p>How hard it is to understand..that someone created you and you can always ask him for help in your difficult situations&#8230;The day landmark starts healing relationships, cancer and raising the dead&#8230;i will start recommending it to others&#8230;</p>
<p>Cmon people, stop deceiving yourself and others.</p>

		<p>I attended the the landmark forum just a weekend ago.  it was a roller coaster of emotions.  I got in touch with some of my loved ones and felt a sense of relief.  I also felt pretty amazing during the whole experience because I was on my own and people were listening and paying attention to me.  yap, i know what your thinking poor lonely isolated girl,  thats pretty much my life.  I just wanted something to help me break through my lack of motivation.  Do I believe in God, ABSOLUTley!! Did I question the landmark forum and God, absolutley.  There where things said that I didn&#8217;t believe in but however I am signed up for the advanced course.  I just would like a  break through in my life so I can live the way God needs me too.  I have a boyfriend who was constantly reminding me through my weekend at the landmark forum how I am getting brainwashed, its a cult and they will say and do whatever to get me $.  I guess it worked, has it changed me?? no I just feel a whole lot calmer.  And yes I am constantly still anaylzing my life, just like I did before the forum.  no I am not a weak person, yes I can see how a lot of people have a negative view about the forum&#8230; take it as it is.  I saw peoples lives being changed for the better right in front of my eyes.  I don&#8217;t know if I am being brainwashed, well hell at least its for the better, right!!!?</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m glad you made a stand for yourself. Wonderful stuff. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that the other person is interpreting everything you said. Alexia is just a human being with wants, needs and fears like the rest of us. You sound happy with the choice you made so I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;d be happy for you.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mindfuck&#8221; is a perfectly reasonable interpretation of what happened. But you know from the Forum that it&#8217;s just one of many possible interpretations.</p>

		<p>The only reason she sounded like such a horrible sales person is because she was an assistant. Landmark offers people to come in and assist around the offices whenever they can after they complete their Forum, I&#8217;ve done it a couple of times. </p>
<p>Truth is they get you on the phone and you have to talk to people giving you a whole array of questions you&#8217;re not ready to answer, at least for the few couple of calls. This is a perfect example of that. </p>
<p>Its little situations like this that give the whole curriculum a bad name. Its really the perfect combination between an empowering self-help course and the perfect business layout as well. But for people to jump to conclusions regarding the morals of the entire business when they spent maybe 5 hours in the forum before giving up shows their approach to difficult and strange occurrences in their life. NEVER believe any of this crapola on the Internet. The absolute best way is to go sign up for yourself and give it a shot, its a risk that I didn&#8217;t want to take but at the end of my Forum I can honestly say it was the best decision I ever made. Otherwise, I&#8217;d still be the cynical, anti-social, sleeping all day good-for-nothing I was.</p>

		<p>Last weekend I completed the Landmark Forum,<br />
I just want to say that for whatever you get out of it or not get out of it these guys are sure the best Sales and Marketing Gurus I have even seen &#8211; they are masters of the subtle and sometimes not so subtle sales technique, word of mouth is the cheapest and most effective sales technique  anyone or any firm can utilise.  Be wary and go into it with both eyes wide open and your wallet closed ! This way you may protect yourself and also maybe actually get something from it.</p>

		<p>I can&#8217;t help myself:  In response to Mike&#8217;s July 16 comment, &#8220;Landmark offers people to come in and assist around the offices whenever they can after they complete their Forum.&#8221;    WTF!  This is a For-Profit Company, and they use volunteer labor&#8230; lots of it; their business model depends on it.<br />
During my Forum experience ::shudder:: there were 2 paid staff maintaning the ever-present registration tables, 1 paid presenter, and 8-12 volunteers who attended the entire weekend doing most of the work.<br />
What was really disturbing was the following: the 8-12 volunteers were not what I would call attractive or had any charisma.  However, during the tuesday night &#8216;graduation&#8217; where I was meant to bring my marks -excuse me, friends- the 8-12 volunteers were nowhere to be seen, they had all been replaced by beautiful women and handsome men, no bullshit.  There was not one, zero, nil, un-attractive landmark person to be found during graduation night&#8230; creepy.<br />
They are masters of marking and mind manipulation.  As I&#8217;ve said in an earlier post; yes, I did get a couple of very unseful personal insights from the weekend, but I sure did not need the mindfuck that went with it.</p>

		<p>Help! I need the people at Landmark to leave me alone! I have declined again and again the invite to enroll in the SLEP but was signed up by a friend who paid my way. I&#8217;m not doing it. The reasons are my own, end of story. The calls I am getting are becoming scary borderline harassment. I was called 6 times yesterday by six different people. I have told them all the same thing &#8220;I&#8217;m not interested. Thank you but I&#8217;m not doing it. Delete my information and never call me again.&#8221; What does it take to get them out of my life!!!!&gt;???????</p>

		<p>i&#8217;m not sure. perhaps you should talk to some sort of moderating body. i&#8217;m not sure if there is an ombudsman for creepy self-help seminars, but there should be something. also if the phone calls are unsolicited that can constitute abuse of phone systems, just as if a telemarketer calls you when you&#8217;re on the do not call list</p>

		<p>I got a full refund from Landmark &#8211; after I attended the 2nd Course. But I&#8217;ll never get back the 3 days I wasted in there (6 days if you count the first course). I believe I got the refund b/c re-enrollment stats are so important to the course leaders that refunding someone who doesn&#8217;t sign up for the next course means they can strike that name off the list of participants and say that they achieved a higher percentage of enrollments than they actually did.</p>
<p>I tried to leave on the first night and asked for only a partial refund.  They wouldn&#8217;t refund me anything. So I stayed and really tried to get something out of it, but 90% of the course was merely pressure to sign up for Course 3. Including very creepy tactics using group members and leaders to pressure each other. </p>
<p>The final night was truly scary for those of us who simply weren&#8217;t interested in continuing. Personal attacks, being followed around the room, craziness. The course leader came over and spoke very harshly to me. The anger I&#8217;ve seen in Landmark Forum leaders when anyone questions the Forum is frightening.</p>
<p>The leader later apologized for her anger, which I was glad of. When I explained that I had wanted to leave on the first night, she offered me a full refund.</p>
<p>That was the one reasonable thing that happened all weekend (though I should add that my group members were very nice, interesting, and supportive. I would have enjoyed working with them on our mutual goals but most of the wknd was spent discussing who was signing up for the next course. A waste, in my opinion, of all of our time)</p>
<p>And, though I believe being offered a refund was reasonable, I ultimately believe it was offered in order to preserve the leader&#8217;s re-enrollment stats.</p>
<p>Never going near that place again.</p>

		<p>My husband and I did landmark in 2006.  We did the full curriculum for living.  The first course, the advanced and then one day a month for three months.  It was worth every penny.  Very cheap even though I hate spending money out and that was an issue for me initially.  For those people who come away from landmark with all those negative feelings and critisms really did not get a full and deep understanding of how truly amazing landmark is.  It definitely takes quite a while to understand how landmark works.  I take my Christian belief very seriously and follow bible counsel.  You need to be humble ,  honest,  willing to listen, willing to be responsible for your actions.  We are still going to do stupid things, say silly things, however the big difference is we now have the tools of how to put bible counsel into practice, by being loving and kind to our fellow humans.  I am not too sure if everyone is capable of being willing to benefit from landmark as they are so resistant to change in life generally, so it take real courage to step up your actions in your life. In conclusion, don&#8217;t do one landmark session,  be prepared to do several, don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s because they want to make money out of you.  Most importantly be prepared to be fully ready to be open to new possibilities.  Only then you will love this information.</p>

		<p>I have a friend trying to convince me to get involved, and I am pretty unwilling to pay the fee for a seemingly common sensical approach to being cognizant that I am one being living in a world occupied by billions of other people. I have read so many different pieces about the basic tenets of the program and though I agree with them, I don&#8217;t think I need a lecture&#8230;or to witness my peers&#8217; public humiliation. The part that makes me particularly skeptical is this view from those that have &#8220;bought&#8221; in to the program that refuses to accept that it isn&#8217;t for everyone. If it doesn&#8217;t change your life, then you did it wrong. Or you&#8217;re not open enough. That is a ridiculous mentality. People are different. No matter how great something is, I accept that not everyone in the world will believe what I think is great is in fact &#8220;universally&#8221; great. Our bodies do not respond the same way to medicines, why would our brains respond the same way to &#8220;ideas&#8221;? I would love to hear someone admit that though they have been &#8220;transformed,&#8221; they know it&#8217;s not for everyone. We know it&#8217;s not for anyone in lower income brackets. Perhaps because they have more to worry about than their failed relationships&#8230;like feeding families and paying rent. That was judgmental, but I find it hard to take an organization that really believes in social change seriously, unless they are socially changing something.</p>

If you have a breakthrough, it&#8217;s probably because you are dedicating a large swath of time to looking at yourself, which you might not usually do, and certainly not for that many hours. I still think that&#8217;s a great thing, but way overpriced.</p>

		<p>Do not do this! Do not waste your time and money! Do not risk destroying the awesome human being you already are!</p>
<p>After suffering painfully through the three day BS extravaganza, I survived without &#8220;popping&#8221; my mind still intact, but sleep deprived, angry and and down right fed-up! Bullies, manipulative and in all honesty, if you are emotionally vunerable it could be down right dangerous for you!</p>
<p>You do not need this&#8230; You (whoever you may be reading this) are a unique and amazing person. Do not let them take away your soul and replace it with Landmark zombification!</p>

		<p>I took the Forum over twenty years ago to improve family relationships. My family thought I was crazy and closed the door in my face.</p>
<p>Now they have all taken the Forum and I am still the one who is crazy.  Go figure.  I am authentic, intentional, committed and live with integrity &#8211; through my FAITH.  That&#8217;s what killed &#8216;IT&#8217;  for me with my daughter. I get it.  I wish she did.</p>

		<p>Hello..<br />
I find this article really interesting. I just did the landmark forum, and although I am really happy with the results don&#8217;t get sold into doing more!!!! I like what &#8220;doctor&#8221; had to say, in all honesty you can do this kind of work from a lot of other books..such as &#8220;You can heal your life&#8221; and Al-Anon. </p>
<p>I will admit, I got sold into doing the advanced&#8230;:( I&#8217;m not sure if anyone can help me out, can I try and get a refund that I paid for to do the advance course? Can I do the same thing to get refunded? will it work? Help!</p>

They probably won&#8217;t give it up without a fight, but be persistent and stand your ground. They&#8217;ll probably tell you that they&#8217;re going to refund all but $150 or something. You can probably talk them into refunding the whole thing.</p>

		<p>The entire curriculum is shared online and every day of the entire curriculum.  It&#8217;s very clear that it&#8217;s not a process that lasts forever.  If you do the curriculum as designed it&#8217;s under $1,500USD.  The education is incredible and although &#8220;simple&#8221; or &#8220;obvious&#8221; to some, it&#8217;s the group dynamic that allows you to discover it yourself.   -LMF &amp; LMA completed, SELP to go&#8230;.</p>
