This will become the basis for guidelines applicable to similar currencies in future. Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Tuesday Japan is still trying to explain the collapse of Mt. Gox and figure out how the Tokyo-based company could lose nearly half a billion dollars in bitcoins. Gains from trading bitcoins on online exchanges, purchases made with bitcoins, and companies earning revenue from bitcoin transactions will be subject to Japanese tax.

But it won't be a currency, like yen or dollars — instead, bitcoins will be treated as a tradeable commodity like gold or oil. How Japan plans to enforce these regulations, no one knows for sure.
After the largest bitcoin exchange, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, collapsed with potentially hundreds of millions of dollars unaccounted for, a Japanese lawmaker asked the government to make its position on the virtual currency clear.

                  <div class="video-fulldescription description-scroll">Relieved investors sent stocks sharply higher on Tuesday after Russia pulled troops back from the border of Ukraine. The rally pushed the Standard & Poor's 500 index to an all-time high, erasing steep losses from Monday, when investors feared that the confrontation between Russia and Ukraine would escalate or even lead to a war. Traders were relieved when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops participating in military exercises near Ukraine to return to their bases. The S&P 500 rose 28.18 points, or 1.53 percent, to close at 1,873.91. It was the biggest gain for the benchmark index since October.
Facebook is reportedly in talks with solar drone maker Titan Aerospace to buy the company for $60 million. The move could help Facebook, one of the major backers of Internet.org, achieve one of the initiative's goals: to bring internet connectivity to the world. Titan's atmospheric drones are solar-powered and can run for up to five years without landing. The deal, first reported in TechCrunch, means that Facebook could use the "atmospheric satellites" - a distinction that suggests they would fly above FAA-regulated space, to increase regional connectivity. The drones could also be used for weather monitoring or earth imaging.
President Barack Obama sent Congress a $3.9 trillion budget Tuesday that would funnel money into road building, education and other economy-bolstering programs. The move handed Democrats a playbook for their election-year themes of creating jobs and narrowing the income gap between rich and poor. The blueprint for fiscal 2015, which begins Oct. 1, is laden with populist proposals designed to fortify those goals. It includes new spending for pre-school education and job training, expanded tax credits for 13.5 million low-income workers without children and more than $1 trillion in higher taxes over the next decade, mostly for the wealthiest Americans and corporations.
According to Nikkei, the Japanese government will set rules for trading bitcoin, including imposing taxes on transactions with the virtual currency. This will become the basis for guidelines applicable to similar currencies in future. Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Tuesday Japan is still trying to explain the collapse of Mt. Gox and figure out how the Tokyo-based company could lose nearly half a billion dollars in bitcoins. Gains from trading bitcoins on online exchanges, purchases made with bitcoins, and companies earning revenue from bitcoin transactions will be subject to Japanese tax.

Start of this week with today's top news stories in Money & Tech:

Bitcoin's price has stabilized back up to around $500 dollars, following a recent plunge to below $400 due likely to concerns over regulatory uncertainty in China, as well as extensive tax implications in the US. As trust in the bitcoin ecosystem returns, Sir Richard Branson reaffirmed his commitment to the digital currency in an article with Delta's SKY Magazine, calling it "the pioneer of a global currency."

Japan's first bitcoin ATM arrived at the warehouse of its new owners, import company Raimu, on Thursday. The company plans to install the Robocoin machine in Suzuka City soon. Raimu CEO Motonori Kan is optimistic, despite the recent blows to bitcoin's reputation, saying that they are excited "to be a part of one of the biggest inventions in history."

Ossian Smyth has become Ireland's first bitcoin-friendly politician, accepting the digital currency for his campaign in the upcoming local elections in seaside Irish town Dun Laoghaire next month. The Green Party candidate is running on a platform for greater political transparency, promising to publish every document or contract of public interest once he is in office, and praising bitcoin as "one of the most transparent ways of receiving donations."

"La Maison du Bitcoin" - which means "The House of Bitcoin" - will be France's first bitcoin center with its grand opening in the heart of Paris on May 13th. The center will be open weekdays to offer co-working space, weekly pitches and workshops to bitcoin-related startups, and will be the home for local bitcoin meetups, as well as its own bitcoin miner and bitcoin ATM.

In Cleveland Heights, Ohio, Cedar-Lee Road will soon become the second "Bitcoin Boulevard" in the world, following in The Netherlands' footsteps. Starting May 1, a total of 8 local businesses - including Sweetie Fry, Mitchell's Fine Chocolates, The Tavern Company, and Parnell's Pub - will all begin to accepting bitcoin.

Sunlot Holdings Ltd, the group of interested Mt. Gox investors, has launched a final attempt to save the bankrupt exchange. Their new website SaveGox.com asks for support from creditors to help prevent liquidation, and instead convince the Tokyo Court to reconsider the proposal for rehabilitation. The group fears that liquidation "would be good neither for Mt. Gox creditors nor bitcoin's reputation with the general public and regulators," hoping instead to "provide restitution to customers and restore faith in the digital currency." Members of the group have already confirmed that creditors owning over 70 percent of the exchange's lost bitcoins are in support of the revival plan.

The New York City Bitcoin Center will be home to a bitcoin themed music festival on Saturday, May 3rd, led by local New York musician Ross Mintzer. The event will be a celebration of humanity, music and cryptocurrency, intended "to create a platform for digital currency enthusiasts to bond." As Mintzer puts it, "In music we have freedom of expression. Bitcoin gives us that same freedom in finance, but I believe that's only the beginning."

CoSign Coin has launched their new Secure Bitcoin Escrow service, which uses multi-signature wallets and transactions to offer users protection from theft and fraud. The company has designed their new escrow service "to be as intuitive and user-friendly as possible," with the goal of bringing confident and secure multi-signature transactions into mainstream use.

We also got to sit down with CrowdCurity CEO Jacob Hansen recently to talk about his crowdsourced IT startup and their efforts to improve web security with cryptocurrency. Find that video here shortly.

Today in Money & Tech:

Yesterday, we reported that the Federal Election Commission issued guidelines allowing bitcoin political donations in response to a specific request from political action committee Make Your Laws. However, we've since learned that the parameters of this decision may extend beyond those laid out specifically for this individual use case. We're joined by Christopher David, founder and CEO of CoinVox, who shed more light on what this decision from the FEC actually means.

USA Today has temporarily changed the logo in the header of their website incorporating the Bitcoin symbol. Clicking on the Bitcoin logo leads to an article on the FEC's approval of bitcoin political campaign donations.

Voting on the Bitcoin Foundation's two vacant board seats concluded last night with BTC China CEO Bobby Lee and bitcoin entrepreneur Brock Pierce winning by a small margin. Bobby Lee has been a strong voice for the bitcoin community in China, where his bitcoin exchange BTC China has been doing it's best to stand up against the China central bank's ban on bitcoin-related bank accounts. Brock Pierce, another avid proponent of the bitcoin community, is involved in several bitcoin startups such as GoCoin, ExpressCoin, KnCMiner and Robocoin Asia, and is helping drive the proposal to revive bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.

The proposed plan to revive bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has received preliminary approval in an Illinois court, allowing it to be more formally vetted in Japan. The plan would involve settling the current class action lawsuits, and then granting those former exchange users a 16.5% equity stake in the new operation. However, the defense argues that this plan would also create new lawsuits from both the new and former Mt. Gox users, which could keep the accused parties in litigation for an undefined period of time.

 The IRS announced Wednesday that it will be contracting out to cybersecurity nonprofit National Cyber-Forensic Training Alliance starting June 1st. The contract will involve researching crimes utilizing digital currencies, and providing the federal government with real-time cyber threat intelligence. According to the IRS document, the Alliance will be expected to "identify significant cybercriminals engaged in financial crimes, as well as initiatives that highlight virtual currencies and virtual currency exchangers that service criminal clientele."

The Winklevoss Twins have filed with the SEC to have their new Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange, which would make it the first publicly-listed bitcoin exchange traded fund. According to the SEC filing, the Winklevoss ETF is expected to IPO for $1 million total shares worth a total of 200,000 bitcoins, so that each share is worth one-fifth of a bitcoin.

The China Digital Times has leaked a set of documents instructing Chinese media to censor their coverage of certain sensitive issues in China. This time, bitcoin made the list, which ended with instructions to refrain from participating in or reporting on The Global Bitcoin Summit 2014 kicking off tomorrow in Beijing. The instructions said "All websites are asked not to participate in or report on the summit. Do not hype bitcoins. All reporting on bitcoins must henceforth accord with the specifications of financial regulatory agencies." This comes as additional negative news for the Summit, after the recent announcement from 5 of the largest Chinese bitcoin exchanges that they will not be attending or participating in the event.

Meanwhile in China, a company called Hardbit has announced the release of a physical Bitcoin wallet. About the size of a credit card but thicker, the device touts many security features, as well as a camera to allow it to make in-person bitcoin transactions quickly. The wallet is now on sale in China, with plans to distribute internationally from May 10th onwards.

A temporary halt on withdrawals from the bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox on Friday and subsequent price decline have prompted trading platform SecondMarket to start a pilot program to buy and sell bitcoin, a move it says highlights the need for a major U.S.-based bitcoin exchange.

SecondMarket, which made its name as a platform that allowed investors to trade shares of Facebook Inc. FB before the company went public, has established itself in the bitcoin space through its open-ended bitcoin trust.

There is no major bitcoin exchange based in the U.S., even as U.S. investors are pouring millions into domestic bitcoin start-ups and U.S. companies are beginning to adopt the virtual currency as payment.

Mt. Gox, which is based in Japan, isn't even the largest bitcoin exchange. The largest by 30-day volume is Bitstamp, which based in Slovenia, according to data from bitcoincharts.com. The second-biggest is BTC-e, which appears to be based in Bulgaria. Mt. Gox is third.

"The single most important thing that we can do...is get some serious exchanges established here in New York," Circle's Allaire said at the hearing. Circle is a company that aims to make bitcoin payments easier for merchants.

There are companies working on establishing bitcoin exchanges in New York, but witnesses at the hearing pointed to the regulatory uncertainty and reluctance from banks to work with bitcoin companies as major hurdles.

In recent trade, bitcoin traded at $741.30 on the bitcoin exchange Bitstamp and $763 on Mt. Gox. That's a decline from trading around $900 earlier this week on Mt. Gox and in the early $800s in the same period on BitStamp. Here's a two-month chart of prices on Bitstamp:

Russian authorities have issued warnings against using Bitcoin, saying the virtual currency could be used for money laundering or financing terrorism and that treating it as a parallel currency is illegal.
Reddit, Virgin Galactic, and Overstock.com now accept Bitcoin.

So do dating site OKCupid and travel site CheapAir.com. Game giant Zynga is now in the testing phase. Two big Las Vegas hotels accept Bitcoin. Already, 21,000 merchants are using Coinbase to accept Bitcoin from customers.

JP Morgan Chase has filed a patent for a Bitcoin-like payment system. And Russia's largest bank is working on a Bitcoin alternative as well.
Ben Bernanke and the Department of Justice have both cautiously blessed Bitcoin. While crypto-currencies remain insulated from central bank manipulation, governments have thus far been tolerant, perhaps because their capability to track transactions is more advanced than Bitcoin believers admit.
Indeed, Bitcoin is not really that anonymous, as the NSA can track Bitcoin trades.

Few protests elicit the same collective gasp from the internet as smashing up an iPhone, so the device-mutilating fury of some members of the Bitcoin community has plunged Apple into a new controversy over policies in its App Store. btc china Imagine a world in which you can buy anything in secret. No banks. No fees. No worries inflation will make today's money worth less tomorrow.

The digital currency Bitcoin promises all these things. And while it's far from achieving any of them — its value is unstable and it's rarely used — some have high hopes.</div>

BITCOIN WONT REPLACE the USD but will be the INTERNET CURRENCY for the WORLD

As 2013 came to an end, many reflected on last years biggest tech news — and Bitcoin was a serious contender. But the main question remains: why are people interested in Bitcoin?

This whole debate reappeared when Charlie Stross stated that Bitcoin looks like it was designed as a weapon intended to damage central banking and money issuing banks, with a Libertarian political agenda in mind — to damage states ability to collect tax and monitor their citizens financial transactions. Paul Krugman then quoted his post, neither denying nor approving this thought.

If major Bitcoin enthusiasts dont have any political agenda in mind, then what is the future of Bitcoin? At its heart, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that doesnt rely on any central bank. Bitcoins are just a chain of characters defined by algorithmic rules, and transactions are handled by the network of miners.

Yet, in a months time, the value of a bitcoin went from 200 to more than 1,000 on all the exchanges. In other words, it is as volatile as it can get. Right now, there are only around 12 million of bitcoins in circulation, and many Bitcoin holders are recent converts that buy and sell every day. So how could you think about using bitcoins to pay the rent? You could simply hold your bitcoins and expect to triple your wallet value in a couple of weeks instead.

Thats why I believe Bitcoin isnt the next world currency. Bitcoins true purpose is not what everyone originally expected — you wont buy a pizza in bitcoins anytime soon. Moreover, Bitcoin wont be able to remain an unregulated currency for long.

So Bitcoins true purpose lies somewhere else. As Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer payment network, you dont need any banking institution to make large transfers. Bitcoin could become the first meta-currency that sits on top of traditional currencies, the common language between USD and EUR. Thats what Dixon finds interesting, Bitcoin is as much a money transfer protocol as a currency. And it has the potential of disrupting the traditional banking system.

U.S. Senate informational panels deemed it legitimate. Detractors dismiss it as unstable and a vehicle for criminal trade. China has banned new deposits on its largest exchange.

Bitcoin began in 2009 as an electronic payment system and currency allowing for peer-to-peer payments and financial exchanges without financial regulation or a third party, such as a bank. Users establish an online wallet using their local currency and exchange with other bitcoin owners.

Recent days have brought headlines about Chinese authorities clamping down on Bitcoin — not wanting various institutions to deal in the digital currency.

The latest is that BTC China, the big Bitcoin startup there, announced that it could no longer accept deposits in the local currency.

This makes sense. One of the big things that everyone was talking about was how Bitcoin made for the perfect tool to circumvent capital controls (restrictions on getting money out of the country). bitcoin accept bitcoin digital currency government regulation p2p tech technology price federal reserve future foundation euro dollar usd u.s. dollar currency forex bitcoin trading litecoin litecoin trading internet consumer 2013 2014 media news code cryptocurrency bitcoin mining bitcoin wallet bitcoin exchange bank banking trading agenda elite gold silver bullion sell gold gold trading shopping wallet exchange united states u.s. usa america agenda nwo 5 years old learn how to supply demand price bitcoin accepted high risk gambling life savings central bank max keiser alex jones infowars gerald celente lindsey williams global currency reset david icke farrakhan speech
So Bitcoin is getting crushed. Not that long ago it was above 1,000. Then it settled into around a 900 area, then it dropped to around 700.

Now its around 500.

It seems the growing tensions in Asia (Japan-China sabre-rattling and Indian capital controls) have prompted more great rotation out of fiat and into digital currency as China/India markets open. For the first time ever, the price of one unit of Bitcoin exceeds the price of an ounce of gold...

The world currency market has lived through the outgoing year quite calmly. The new year promises moderate strengthening of commodity currencies, including the ruble. But experts have different opinions about the behavior of the main units of payment - the dollar and the euro.

Catch up with today's top news stories in Money & Tech:

Blockchain.info announced today that it has struck a five year deal to exclusively manage the domain Bitcoin.com. The domain's sleek new homepage now features three main links for the Blockchain wallet service, Zeroblock news and charts, as well as a search function to explore the rest of Blockchain.info. As stated in their announcement, this is part of the mission quote "to create new learning experiences and introduce millions of users to Bitcoin."

SecondMarket has taken another step towards the ultimate launch of America's first fully regulated Bitcoin Exchange, releasing a new website for their quote "Experienced, Full Service Bitcoin Trading Services". CEO Barry Silbert says he hopes to launch the fully licensed exchange for all compliant users this summer.

Walmart has announced the April 24th launch of their new Walmart-2-Walmart Money Transfer Service, in partnership with global remittances company Ria, which could clarify their decision to cut ties with Gyft.com. The new low-cost service will allow customers to transfer money between the over 4,000 Walmart stores nationwide, and is aimed at helping the almost 28 percent of Americans who are either underbanked or unbanked and rely on money transfers.

ZaZZZ, billed as the first Marijuana vending machine in the US, will also be accepting bitcoin.  Since the legalization of marijuana in 2012, Bitcoin has become popular among dispensary owners who have been rejected by traditional financial institutions. The ZaZZZ machine however is far from an anonymous way to buy the newly legal drug, as it is equiped with an ID reader, and a video camera.

Former Congressman Ron Paul took to popular question-and-answer website Quora to express his thoughts about bitcoin, saying "Though I don't personally believe that Bitcoin is true money, it should be perfectly legal and there should be no restrictions on it... For this to operate, we need to have freedom from government intervention when it comes to the Internet."

Dogecoin creator Jackson Palmer and the Dogecoin Foundation are putting together Dogecon SF on April 25th in San Francisco, in partnership with Follow The Coin. The event's organizers expect it to be the largest dogecoin gathering yet, lining up celebrity speakers such as litecoin creator Charlie Lee, Doge tip bot co-founder David Dvorak, and bitcoin evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos.

Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Tuesday that the government is still trying to figure out what has led to the collapse of the Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox and is not sure whether crime is involved.

"We still have not had a clear grasp of the situation," Aso said in response to a reporter's question after a cabinet meeting. "(We) don't know if it was a crime or just a bankruptcy."

Mt. Gox, once the world's biggest bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on Friday, saying it may have lost nearly half a billion dollars worth of the virtual currency due to hacking into its faulty computer system.

Here are today's top news stories in Money & Tech:

The blockchain is headed for space. Jeff Garzik's Dunvegan Space Systems is partnering with Deep Space Industries to build satellites called 'BitSats' that will be launched into space as a backup bitcoin orbital system. From orbit, these BitSats will be able to broadcast out transaction data from the blockchain to any users with a downlink. Garzik made the first payment to Deep Space Industries via BitPay, where he is also a senior software developer, and is now accepting bitcoin donations to help complete the project.

Bitcoin trading platform Atlas ATS has formed a partnership with The National Stock Exchange to speed up regulatory approval. By partnering with this self-regulatory organization, Atlas ATS hopes to bypass FinCEN's money-transmitting license in favor of SEC-approved rules that are more tailored to digital currency exchanges. Kraken and CoinMKT are also taking this route, as several exchanges race to become the first fully regulated digital currency exchange.

Nine state banking officials from the US Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), including New York Superintendent Ben Lawsky, have launched the Emerging Payments Task Force. The new task force plans to investigate bitcoin and other virtual currencies in the hopes of developing state regulation best practices, as well as more educational resources. The discussion will begin with a public hearing on May 16th in Chicago.

With the reluctance of Irish banks to accept bitcoin, ATM provider BitVendo and safe deposit box facility Merrion Vaults have partnered to provide cold storage to BitVendo's local cryptocurrency users. The service allows users to store their bitcoins safely in Merrion Vaults' high quality and secure safe deposit vault in Dublin.

Butterfly Labs has been on rocky ground since this month's lawsuit against the bitcoin mining hardware company, accusing it of collecting payments for false orders and using customer equipment for their own mining. This recent lawsuit is only the latest accusation of fraud against the Kansas-based company. What's more, co-founder Sonny Vleisides has been found in violation of his probation since pleading guilty to one count of mail fraud in 2010, which will likely extend his probation another two years. 

Dorian Nakamoto, the man famously falsely identified as bitcoin's creator, has filmed a YouTube video with Andreas Antonopoulos to thank the bitcoin community for its support. Antonopoulos led a fundraising campaign for Nakamoto that raised over 47 bitcoins - worth nearly $23,000 dollars - in a new bitcoin wallet that Nakamoto says he will keep open as a new bitcoin user. Watch that YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7YmJZ-qVW8.

Bitcoin documentary The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin premieres today at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City. Money & Tech will be attending the screening, as well as the film's after-party hosted by Charlie Shrem. We will be bringing you video coverage and interviews from that event soon.

We will also be attending the next major digital currency event this Friday, Dogecon SF, which will be San Francisco's first dogecoin conference. The event is hosted by Follow The Coin, and will feature prominent industry speakers such as litecoin creator Charlie Lee, industry expert Andreas Antonopoulos, and of course, Dogecoin's own creator, Jackson Palmer. We sat down with Tina Hui and Matt Schlicht from Follow The Coin to talk about what we can look forward to at Dogecon SF.

Catch up with today's top news stories in Money & Tech:

BTC China announced via Twitter today that it has suspended Chinese yuan deposits from the Bank of China, following their halt on customer deposits with the China Merchants Bank late last month. In related news, the CEOs of five major Chinese bitcoin exchanges OKCoin, Huobi, BTC China, BTC Trade and CHBTC have withdrawn from this weekend's Global Bitcoin Summit in Beijing. The executives released a joint statement explaining that they will no longer be participating in large bitcoin meetings or gatherings.

In Switzerland, the first Swiss cryptocurrency exchange eCUREX launched on Sunday. The new exchange now provides a platform for real-time trading between cryptocurrencies, and plans with its second phase to offer real-time trading between bitcoin and litecoin and major fiat currencies including the US dollar, Euro, British pound, and Swiss franc.

Australia's first dedicated bitcoin investment fund, the Future Capital Bitcoin Fund, launched on Monday with a balance of $30 million dollars. The fund is now accepting further investment, as well as expressions of interest from "companies facilitating payments, exchanges, trading and smart property rights." The fund's managers are eager to realize bitcoin's value as a payments protocol and decentralized trust system, saying "we see great scope for the broader adoption of Bitcoin and its related applications to redefine the global payment status quo."

Digital currency accelerator Alternet Systems announced Monday its new Digital Bank initiative. The new initiative will develop innovative consumer products such as multi-asset debit and credit cards, with a goal of offering seamless integration of multiple payment options on one platform to people all over the world, particularly "people in the parts of the world with volatile currencies."

The US Conference of State Bank Supervisors and their Emerging Payments Task Force have announced plans to hold a public hearing on emerging payments issues, including digital currencies, in Chicago on May 16th. The hearing will feature panel discussions with key businesses and individuals involved in the payments and digital currency industries, and will be open to the public and media.

The Electronic Funds Transfer Association and the ATM Industry Association have jointly released their second commissioned report entitled "Bitcoin: Virtual Currency with Real Opportunities." The report points out "a unique set of challenges to regulators", but overall reflects a positive attitude about bitcoin's potential benefits as a "fascinating new payments technology," echoing their first report "An Introduction to Bitcoin ATMs", which was similarly optimistic.

Accomplished athlete Elsa Hammond is accepting bitcoin donations per mile or oar stroke for The Great Pacific Race, where she will attempt to break world records in the self-proclaimed biggest, baddest human endurance challenge on the planet. Rowing teams from all over the world will compete in this first ever race across the Pacific ocean, which will commence on June 7th and stretch for 2,400 miles from Monterey, California to Honolulu, Hawaii.

We attended the first ever Bitcoin Job Fair this past weekend at Silicon Valley's Plug And Play Center, where we interviewed the event's organizers and attendees. We'll be bringing you those interviews here all this week.

Wrap up this week with your top news updates in Money & Tech:

Las Vegas-based bitcoin ATM manufacturer Robocoin announced Thursday the introduction of their new Robocoin Bank, which they are calling "the first Bitcoin bank with a physical presence." The project will involve turning the company's entire army of existing Robocoin ATMs into banking branches, fully integrating them with the company's online banking services. The rebranded kiosks will also have the ability to send bitcoins anywhere via a phone number, without needing an address or QR code, and then provide instant bitcoin-to-cash withdrawals to create what the company calls "banking and remittance 2.0″.

Canadian digital currency exchange CAVirtex announced plans on Thursday to launch a network of bitcoin ATMs across Canada. The launch would also come with a number of service improvements, including re-introducing their balance deposit feature, as well as a new trading API and merchant user interface. The company has reportedly been in touch with several different ATM manufacturers, but hasn't yet announced any more details or official timeline for deployment.

Chinese bitcoin exchange FXBTC announced today that it will be officially shutting down on May 10th, finally caving to the "unprecedented pressure" from the People's Bank of China and the resulting restrictions on its banking services. The company posted the news on their website today, saying "no matter how hard we work, when faced with the PBOC's blockade, we are essentially powerless."

Despite the bleak regulatory news in China, Bitcoin startup Bihang has launched in Beijing with the intent of separating peer-to-peer transactions from reliance on centralized organizations and third-parties. The startup's two co-founders see the opportunity for "a whole new set of rules for the game, which will turn a lot of traditional trading practices on their head."

Senator Rand Paul offered his thoughts on bitcoin in an interview with Fortune on Thursday, saying he thinks it could work, but adding, "I'd make it exchangeable for stock... if you're going to create a currency, have it backed up." This is a similar sentiment to that expressed by his father, former Texas Senator Ron Paul, who also supported bitcoin but said the digital currency does not have the characteristics of "true money."

Voting for the two vacant Bitcoin Foundation board seats ended Wednesday night with no definitive winners. According to the Foundation's bylaws, candidates must be elected by "a majority of quorum of Industry Members". And although there were clear favorites this round, with BTC China CEO Bobby Lee receiving 44 votes, and venture capitalist Brock Pierce garnering 34 votes, none of the candidates received the required 52 vote majority to be elected to seat. As a result, a second round of voting will be conducted, with more details on that coming early next week.

We also have more interviews from the recent Dogecon SF event, which we'll be bringing you later today, along with more information on today's news on our Money & Tech website at http://moneyandtech.com/may2-news-update/</div>

Bitcoin wallet provider Xapo has announced that its much-anticipated bitcoin debit card will launch by the end of this month after accepting pre-orders since April. The new cards will be accepted by any business that accepts debit cards or credit cards from its network partner, though the company has yet to disclose the name of that card network.

The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (or FINMA) has shut down the launch of the country's newest batch of bitcoin ATMs from digital finance broker and bitcoin ATM operator Bitcoin Suisse AG, quote "pending clarification of open legal questions." In light of this, Bitcoin Suisse has also halted all of its other planned bitcoin ATM launches as well as services for its existing ATMs, but hopes to be back online before the end of this month.

Darkcoin, an alternative digital currency that promises privacy of transactions, is now listed on Bitfinex, a fee-based exchange that until now only allowed trading for Bitcoin and Litecoin. DarkSend, the protocol on which Darkcoin is built, masks the link between sender and recipient by mixing transactions to anonymize the movements on the blockchain. Bitfinex plans to add more tools and services for Darkcoin traders soon, including trading on margin, trading on leverage, and shorting. 

Bitcoin-powered mobile platform Cheers is enabling bitcoin tips for musicians, and allows users to share music on its social network and search for new artists to support. The new platform will also leverage The Echo Nest, a database with more than 35 million known songs and artists, as a means to identify songs while they're playing live. Co-founder Justin Womersley says the "The streaming model is not that great for the artist...there's a lack of an emotional connection... we wanted to create a tool that really connected people in the digital age." The company expects to release their iOS app sometime in the next few weeks.

50 Cent's new album Animal Ambition is now available for purchase with bitcoin thanks to a partnership with BitPay. As BitPay CEO Tony Gallippi says, "We are excited to see high profile independent artists use bitcoin and 50 Cent's trail as an innovator is outstanding.""

Digital currency-themed roadshow the North American Bitcoin Car Giveaway Tour, is set to hit the highways this July to promote the use of bitcoin among everyday consumers. Co-organized by bitcoin business media company Kryptoz and bitcoin advertising platform BitPages, the tour will start the first week of July at the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, then make stops at events throughout Canada and the US. The tour will culminate at the Las Vegas Money 20/20 conference,  where it will hold its grand prize drawing for either a special edition 2014 KIA Soul or $10,000 worth of bitcoins.

The BitGive Foundation, a non-profit leveraging the power of the Bitcoin community to improve public health and the environment worldwide, is hosting a bowling tournament fundraiser in San Francisco this Sunday, June 8. Some of the industry's leading companies will compete for the winning title, including BitPay, Blockchain, Coinbase, and Xapo. The event is free for spectators and press to attend.

Money & Tech attended last week's San Francisco Bitcoin Meetup at Geekdom, and heard presentations from a number of industry members, including Matthiew Riou from BlockCypher and Taariq Lewis from the SF Bitcoin Devs Meetup.

Here are today's top stories in Money & Tech:

OKCoin, which claims to be China's largest exchange, has just completed a $10 million dollar Series A funding round, led by some of China's most prominent investors and venture capital firms, who clearly remain bullish on bitcoin, despite China's recent regulatory crackdown on digital currencies. That said, part of this new investment will be used to help expand OKCoin's operations outside of China, where the landscape and government regulations are more supportive.

Also in regulatory news, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is investigating whether it has the authority to regulate bitcoin and other digital currencies under the same rules as commodities markets, and has started with "an internal discussion at the staff level" according to acting chairman Mark Wetjen.

The Australian Tax Office has released a letter with new taxation guidelines to one of its local bitcoin entrepreneurs, specifying that income and profits derived from bitcoin transactions are taxable, and subject to both the Goods and Services Tax (or GST) and capital gains tax. Though this may seem like a lot of added bureaucracy, this actually puts Australia on par with Singapore in a rather tolerant stance on bitcoin, particularly in comparison to the reactions of other governments around the world.

In Mt. Gox updates, a new class action lawsuit was proposed Friday to seek $500 million in compensation for Canadians who had stolen funds in Mt Gox. Both this Canadian lawsuit, as well as the class action lawsuit already filed in the US, have named the Japanese Mizuho Bank as a defendant for allegedly aiding in fraud by providing banking services to the exchange.

During a CNBC interview on Friday, Warren Buffett spoke up once again about bitcoin, telling people to "stay away from it," because "it's a mirage basically... [and] the idea that it has intrinsic value is a joke." However, Buffett also demonstrated a fundamental lack of understanding about bitcoin in his speech, oversimplifying its definition as "a method of transmitting money" and equating it to a check or "very fast money order."

Dorian Nakamoto is taking serious steps to deny his involvement in bitcoin, hiring a lawyer and releasing a statement this morning to clear his name, saying quote "I did not create, invent, or otherwise work on Bitcoin. I unconditionally deny the Newsweek report." He adds that this will be his last public statement on the matter, and asks that others now respect his privacy.

In Bitcoin merchant news, TigerDirect is now the second major online superstore to pass the $1million mark in total bitcoin sales, less than two months after it started accepting the digital currency with BitPay. Overstock had previously reached that milestone on March 4th.

The Philippines' second largest daily deals site MetroDeal is now accepting bitcoin for its discount vouchers and coupons. The company runs limited time offers in a similar model to US-based sites Groupon and LivingSocial, and has become widely popular among the Philippines' 33 million active Internet users, which could make it a very effective tool for raising awareness and adoption of bitcoin there.

In emerging alt coin news, three developers have created Potcoin, a new cryptocurrency based on Bitcoin that is meant to defy conventional banks, money laundering authorities, and the DEA in order to build out a safer way for marijuana dispensaries to deal with daily transactions. Other new alt coins are experiencing their own growing pains, with Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin all seeing recent price slumps. 

Newly announced Spaincoin, which has been created to help ease financial woes in Spain, has seen a large uptick in value, while Auroracoin, the new alt coin intended to help the Icelandic people, is seeing uncertainty and concerns from Icelandic parliament leading up its planned public distribution next week. And Dogecoin just set a new record for the largest amount ever tipped on Twitter, with recent donations in the tens of thousands being sent via @tipdoge to campaigns like Doge4Water.

Money & Tech attended a recent San Francisco Bitcoin Meetup at 20Mission. We'll have videos from that event available here soon.

Here are today's top stories in the world of Money & Tech:

After a nearly two-month long holding pattern in the $400 dollar range, the price of bitcoin crossed the $500 dollar threshold overnight into Thursday morning. This positive growth is likely due in large part to recent good news in the industry, including BitPay's record-breaking Series A funding round and Circle's much-anticipated product announcement. It is difficult to tell yet whether this is short-lived spike, but many are confident in the overall trend of renewed optimism.

At the same time, the price of Ripple is experiencing a precipitous drop with the news that Ripple Labs co-founder Jed McCaleb plans to sell his sizable stake of the digital currency. McCaleb took to the XRP Talk forum on Wednesday to announce that he would begin the sale in two weeks, saying "Because I have immense respect for the community members and want to be transparent, I'm publicly announcing this before I start." The Ripple price has decreased by at least 40% as a result, according to the three largest Ripple exchanges.

Canadian lawyer Christine Duhaime is writing the world's first law book to cover digital currencies, in collaboration with a team of economists, as well as other legal and financial crime experts. Duhaime hopes this book will help provide guidance and insight into the quickly evolving industry, and has stressed how important it is for law to keep up with its developments, saying "there are legal issues with such fundamental legal and economic shifts that need to be addressed in the legal literature and that's what we're doing."

Bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem, who faces federal money laundering charges related to the Silk Road, is no longer under 24-hour house arrest. Though still confined to the city of New York, Shrem is now allowed to leave his home between 9am and 9pm, Sunday through Thursday. This will give Shrem greater freedom to pursue current work endeavors, including his new business development role at online payment platform Payza.

Denmark-based bitcoin exchange CCEDK is due to open this month, promising future clients a crime-free platform on which to trade both bitcoin and litecoin in exchange for Danish and Norwegian kroner, British pounds, dollars and euros. CEO Ronny Boesing assures that the exchange will operate with complete transparency, as if it being overseen by a financial watchdog, especially since Denmark's Financial Supervisory Authority stated recently that it is looking into regulating this kind of business in the future.

Czech bitcoin ATM company General Bytes is ready to start shipping their brand new 'BATMTwo' machines across Europe and internationally. The new ATM features an email option that helps verify a customer's identity, and can also help setup those without a pre-existing wallet. The company has been testing their new ATMs at two locations in Prague and one in Slovakia, and has plans to ship a few more to the Netherlands next week, with another 15 machines built and available for immediate sale.

The Bitcoin Beginners Fair has been rescheduled to Tuesday June 3rd. The event will still be held at 20Mission in San Francisco, where industry professionals will be on hand to help new users learn about bitcoin and setup their first wallet. Blockchain and GogoCoin will also be gifting a small amount of free bitcoin to each attendee. For more information and to RSVP, visit BitcoinBeginnersFair.com. We hope to see you there!

Wrap up your week with today's top news in Money & Tech:

China continues to shake the bitcoin price, which dropped around $45 this morning, as Chinese publication Caixin once again published an article reaffirming the People's Bank of China's stance against bitcoin. The Chinese central bank reportedly met with commercial banks and payment processors in business with bitcoin exchanges, openly criticizing Bank of China and China Merchants Bank in particular for continuing their service with bitcoin exchange BTC China. The Caixin article states that the PBOC hopes this time to completely cut off the funding line into Bitcoin trading.

Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander issued an "Investor Alert" Thursday, cautioning his constituents that buying or trading digital currencies could carry significant risk. In his statement, Kander misinterpreted the fundamental function of digital currencies like bitcoin, likening them to "Investments that are sold as a way to make a quick profit," and adding "I encourage Missourians to be wary of any investments that promise an unusually quick return."

Mobile security startup Lookout has identified a new, more sophisticated type of bitcoin mining malware dubbed "BadLepricon," which is delivered via your phone's wallpaper. Lookout identified six affected wallpaper apps, which Google has now removed from their Google Play store.

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal Wednesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke about the company's growing interest in mobile payments, saying "We have almost 800 million iTunes accounts and the majority of those have credit cards behind them. We already have people using Touch ID to buy things across our store, so it's an area of interest to us."

At a panel Wednesday following the Tribeca premiere of Bitcoin documentary The Rise And Rise of Bitcoin, Charlie Shrem took the opportunity to talk about his current indictment, saying that he and his lawyers have "found a lot of mistakes and holes in the case." We interviewed Charlie shortly after the screening, and will be releasing that video early next week.

Money & Tech was also at the after-party following the Bitcoin documentary on Wednesday night in New York, where we spoke with the film's creators and featured guests. Watch that video at http://moneyandtech.com/rise-and-rise-of-bitcoin-afterparty

Following its Worldwide Developer's Conference on Monday, Apple released an update to its App Store Review Guidelines that could bode well for bitcoin and other digital currencies. The update states that quote "Apps may facilitate transmission of approved virtual currencies provided that they do so in compliance with all state and federal laws for the territories in which the app functions." It is still unclear if bitcoin will be one of these "approved" virtual currencies. But if so, this could mean the computing giant will finally allow bitcoin wallet apps like Blockchain and Coinbase, which it had previously pulled from its app store. We spoke with Blockchain's Director of Product Dan Held, who said quote "we are cautiously optimistic.  The language used doesn't clearly define what requirements Apple sees as "approved virtual currencies" or what they may stipulate as fully compliant.  We are exploring this opportunity thoroughly and we hope that Apple will be lenient in their interpretation."

The US Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has charged bitcoin entrepreneur and evangelist Erik Voorhees with offering shares to bitcoin-related websites SatoshiDICE and Feed Ze Birds without first registering them, as required by federal securities laws. Voorhees has reportedly agreed to settle charges against him, forfeiting the over $15,000 dollars in profits as well as paying an additional $35,000 dollar penalty. This appears to be the first SEC action taken to address the growing number of bitcoin companies trading publicly without SEC approval.

Great American Insurance Group's Fidelity/Crime Division has become the first in the insurance industry to offer commercial coverage for bitcoin, in an effort to meet the evolving needs of its customers. The extended crime policy will include protection for employee dishonesty, money and securities, forgery and computer fraud, and is now available in most states to both commercial and government policy holders who accept bitcoin.

The UK's Financial Conduct Authority, which has until now steered clear of digital currencies, has announced a new initiative called Project Innovate that could help boost bitcoin businesses in the UK. FCA Chief Executive Martin Wheatley says their new initiative is designed to promote innovation in the financial sector, creating room for "the brightest and most innovative" companies, and recognizing that virtual currencies, crowd funding, and peer-to-peer are among the industry's most transformative developments.

The Dutch central bank has issued a warning on bitcoin to banks and other financial institutions, advising them to be aware of the integrity risks in processing digital currency transactions. However, the warning does not address digital currency's end-users, focusing only on how financial institutions should tread carefully, given the relatively high degree of anonymity and possible indirect effect on their reputation.

South Africa-based digital currency exchange iceCUBED has now expanded its full service to Botswana users, thanks to efforts from its new chief evangelist, Alakanani Itireleng, who has become Botswana's key Bitcoin evangelist. As part of her mission, Alakanani has also joined forces with the SOS children's village in Botswana, eager to show how bitcoin can help raise funds without borders and quote "also show that we in the bitcoin community are not greedy or thieves as people tend to think. Let the good outshine the bad and I am trying to do just that."

Leading banking and finance executives will gather next week on June 11th and 12th in London to share insights into current trends and emerging innovations in payments systems at this year's PayExpo event. Attendees will be treated to four separate conferences, the Future of Payments Summit, Merchant Payments, Mobile Money Europe and Prepaid 2014 with a packed agenda of workshops and notable exhibits such as financial services tech provider Fiserv and alternative digital currency NXT.

The Bitcoin Beginners Fair will take place this evening at 20Mission in San Francisco. Attendees will receive a small amount of bitcoin courtesy of partners Blockchain and GogoCoin, who will be there along with BitPay, Piper Wallet, and the BitGive Foundation to help bitcoin newbies learn about the digital currency and how they can get started using it. For more information and to RSVP, visit BitcoinBeginnersFair.com, and we hope to see you there tonight.

Here's what is happening today in Money & Tech:

After hovering in the $500 range for the past few days since the Mt. Gox crash, the price of Bitcoin saw a positive spike of over 15% yesterday, reaching as high as $710 on BitStamp, before settling back down into the upper $600's. This sudden increase shows that the community is ready to feel optimistic about this virtual currency again, as they gather together around a stronger focus on accountability and transparency in response to the recent crises.

Flexcoin, the self-proclaimed "world's first bitcoin bank," has shut down following a cyber theft on Sunday that cleaned out its entire "hot wallet" storage of 896 bitcoins, worth over $600,000. Flexcoin has been able to identify the two bitcoin addresses responsible for the theft, and will "attempt to work with law enforcement to trace the source of the hack." Thankfully, Flexcoin customers with cold storage accounts have been assured their funds are still available and can be retrieved free of charge.

ZeroBlock, a property of Blockchain.info, today announced their acquisition of popular trading platform RTBTC, which has already facilitated over $150M in trading volume across multiple exchanges. Now integrated into ZeroBlock, the newly rebranded ZeroBlock Trading Platform will become part of the product's pro version for traders at $20/month, offering them a suite of essential tools and advanced trading features, including mobile trading on iOS and Android, along with ZeroBlock's signature real-time market prices and news feed.

Mexico will be getting the country's first digital currency exchange soon, with newly formed Bitso, allowing traders to exchange bitcoin with the Mexican Peso. According to co-founder & CEO Pablo González Delezé, "Bitso is passionate about the future of Bitcoin, and bringing to Mexico a safe, secure and easy to use platform for trade and remittance via this exciting new medium." A launch date hasn't been announced yet, but users are currently able to register on the Bitso website.

Warren Buffett gave his diagnosis on Bitcoin in an interview with CNBC yesterday, saying that "It does not meet the test of a currency," and that he "wouldn't be surprised if it's not around in 10 or 20 years." Yale Professor and Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller also offered his thoughts in the New York Times, suggesting an alternative electronic money solution that he believes can do a better job of revolutionizing our current financial system.

Japanese authorities continue to investigate into the Mt. Gox collapse, but are still unsure of the cause, or even which government body should handle the case. As Finance Minister Taro Aso said in a briefing yesterday, "It's difficult to know whether there was a crime or a simple corporate failure." In the meantime, Japan's finance ministry and national tax agency are also looking at ways to govern future Bitcoin transactions, considering applying consumption and corporate taxes, despite the fact that the cryptocurrency is not considered a legal currency in Japan.

Overstock.com today announced they have finally officially passed the $1 million mark in sales done in Bitcoin. Since first accepting the digital currency on January 9th, over 4,300 customers have paid for their products in bitcoin. CEO Patrick Byrne says he is very pleased, yet surprised that they have "hit this milestone so quickly."

Kickstarter also reached a milestone yesterday, surpassing $1 billion in total pledges on its site. Since its launch on April 28, 2009, more than 5.7 million people from 224 countries have pledged money to various crowdfunding projects, the majority going to gaming startups, and have helped an impressive 44% of those projects reach their funding goals.
