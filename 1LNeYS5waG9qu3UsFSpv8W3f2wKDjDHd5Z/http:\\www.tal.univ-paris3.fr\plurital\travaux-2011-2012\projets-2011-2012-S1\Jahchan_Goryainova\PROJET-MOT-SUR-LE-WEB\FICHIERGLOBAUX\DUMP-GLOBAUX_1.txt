this is not a joke.

   but it is where I talk about all the movies I watch

Friday, February 25, 2011

Since you've been gone...

   Thanks Toothpaste for Dinner!
   I must offer some profuse apologies. Or maybe not. I ran into Brunch
   Bird last weekend at, of all places, of course, the movies. (I was
   there to watch The Roommate. How was it you ask? Hysterically amazing!)
   She asked if I had a blog when I told her that I liked hers and I said
   "I do, but it sort of went defunct after watching Girl with the Dragon
   Tattoo." (Oh, and how was that you ask? Only the best movie I saw in
   2010!) She said, "Well, it's never too late to start up again. I'd
   know." And she is right.
   And I have seen some really worthy movies. I don't think I am an
   extraordinary writer, or maybe even that good, but my friends seem to
   enjoy it. So, back to movies. Well, all of the Swedish Steig Larsson
   movies were high points in my movie watching year last year. But I
   never wrote about them. I don't know if I ever will, but hopefully. So
   what has been going on with me, you ask? Well, lets do a photo run
   down, shall we?
   According to my last post I stopped writing after I went to GA in
   March. Well, I went back in May. It was the epic Georgia trip. It will
   go down in the annals of the Georgia Trips. Well, until Lori and I go
   on our ten year anniversary road trip though Georgia.
   Epic Georgia Adventure. May 2010.
   Let's see. Then the World Cup happened, right? Well, I rooted for
   Germany, until they lost to Spain. That German support involved many
   hours at Lucky Bar and included me being interviewed at 7:30am on the
   CBS local news! Good thing my State Department colleagues knew I was
   drinking beer at 8am on a work day. Here is me and a bunch of other
   Germany fans after they beat Australia (? Australia, right?)
   German Victory. And lots of Beer. World Cup 2010.
   The World Cup era was also a celebration of new housing arrangements. I
   moved in May and therefore was able to acquire this little piece of
   toilet paper shredding heaven at the end of June. She is excellent. For
   the most part. Except she shreds all my toilet paper. Named after a
   20th century Mexican Revolutionary, her name is
   Emiliano Zapata. July 2010.
   She's almost ten months old now (March 6) and is currently sitting in a
   reusable bag with a pair of my heels. Good work Zizzle.
   August was epic because not only did I audition for the Capitals Red
   Rocker squad (and did not make the cut) but I also went to DISNEYLAND
   for the first time!!! Good god, if you haven't been there book your
   plane ticket now. It is the most wonderful place on earth. Even better
   than Niagara Falls. And I bet you never thought you'd hear that come
   out of my mouth!
   The wonderful world of Disney. August 2010.
   We also spent time with our good friend Steven while there. He took us
   around Los Angeles. Mel and I were re-united with high school friends.
   We ate at Spago. Saw the Hollywood sign (though I think we actually
   looked to the right to see the Hollywood sign). Saw the jail where OJ
   was kept. Saw a Soviet submarine. Ate Jack in the Box and had an all
   around fantastic vacation!!
   Look to the left and I see the Hollywood sign.
   Everyone here is so famous.
   Including Craig Kilbourne.
   I told him he looked like my grad school advisor. HAH!
   August 2010
   But the fun didn't stop in August. Oh no, no. September brought about
   three momentous events.
   1. First UGA game day. We lost. Sad.
   Imagine us in Game Day dresses. September 2010.
   2. American Idiot on Broadway with Billie Joe Armstrong. Of course, now
   he is in the show for a two month run, but at the time he was only
   doing 8 shows. And I saw one of them! St. Jimmy died today/ He blew his
   brains out into the bay. September 2010.
   3. Another Virginia inspired beauty. This time for my left arm.
   You're looking at $300 of dogwood. September 2010.
   October was confusing. Zombies invaded Washington and I was there to
   document it. I almost got ejected from the National Mall by the Park
   Service because they didn't believe I was not a professional
   photographer. Why? It wasn't because they saw this post and were amazed
   at all my photos (I took all of them except the one of Billie Joe). No.
   It was because he took one look at my camera and thought it was too
   "professional." Dude, hate to break it to you, but I'm not the only
   person in the city with a DSLR. Durr.
   The Walking Dead invade Washington. October 2010.
   In November I did play professional photographer though. I took my
   friends' engagement photos. I loved it. Does anyone have anything they
   want me to photograph? My rates are reasonable! You can email
   photography.jdh@gmail.com if you're interested. I am available in DC
   but will travel. I'm not kidding. You'll be impressed when you see my
   work below.
   The real work. November 2010.
   December was pretty standard. Heartbreak. Presents. New Years Eve in
   Georgia. The Caps won the Winter Classic (in your face Pittsburgh!) and
   the year started off more miserable than I could possibly imagine. Work
   upheaval. Henious sinus infection. The complete opposite of Love,
   Valour, Compassion. So I really needed one weekend in January to go
   well. Luckily the weekend I spent in New York for Mel and Barry's
   birthday was excellent. If it hadn't been I don't think I'd be here to
   type this right now. I'd still be crying in a gutter.
   A new era of Hope. January 2011.
   This brings us, more or less, to the present day. I tried to buy a
   scratching post for the cat but the pet store was sold out. It was very
   tragic. (UPDATE: I have secured said scratching post. VICTORY!)
   But, this is neither a blog about my stupid cat nor a blog about my
   excellent photography skillz (though, seriously, email me if you want
   me to shoot something for you!), it is a blog about movies. So here,
   very very briefly, are my reviews of the movies I have seen since we
   last spoke (minus movies that weren't new to me--Dawn of the Dead,
   Interview with the Vampire, Titanic, Before Sunset, etc, etc, etc,
   etc.) And in no particular order...
   The movies:
     * All the Swedish Steig Larsson movies. The Girl with the Dragon
       Tattoo--the best one of the three. I am so glad I saw the movie
       before I read the book. The movie was so shocking because I had no
       idea what was going to happen. It was the best movie I saw in 2010!
       The Girl Who Played with Fire-- Good. I think the book and the
       movie were actually pretty different. Again, I saw the movie first
       then read the book. The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest--The book
       is waiting to be read on my shelf. P.S. sweet Mohawk!
     * 127 hours--very different then I thought it would be. I was
       actually surprisingly emotional. Go see it. Seriously. It is very
       good. Even though Danny Boyle annoys me. Though, I did enjoy 28
       Days Later. A lot.
     * Black Swan--overrated I think. I didn't care about any of the
       characters and was in fact hoping bad things would happen to them.
       Plus, I want to punch Natalie Portman in the face. Seriously. I did
       like that Frenchy though. I hope it doesn't win all sort of Oscars.
     * Casino Jack--Erik and I wanted to go see a movie and there was
       nothing out. So he suggested this. It was fine. I was entertained.
       It was interesting to "learn" about Jack Abramoff. Plus, I like
       Kevin Spacey and I like drinking my pomegranate Italian sodas at E
       Street.
     * A Film Unfinished--I saw this after I got my tattoo. Another good
       thing about E Street is that you can order beer there. Which I did.
       To stop the arm throbbing. A Film Unfinished is the footage that
       was recorded to make a Nazi propaganda film. The film was somewhat
       interesting even though nothing Nazi related seems to shock me
       anymore. I guess that is what you get for being a history major.
       Nothing in it stuck with me to this day. Just watch The Pianist
       instead.
     * Easy A--Watched this with Lori on the last GA trip. It was
       entertaining. I like that Emma Stone. Her parents were ridiculously
       amusing and Dan from Gossip Girl was in it. What's not to like??
     * Jackass 3D--I will confess, the only reason I watched this was
       because the boy I was crushing on worked on this movie. He was the
       stereoscopic supervisor. Basically, his job was to make it 3D. (You
       can figure out who he is on imdb) Otherwise, it wasn't nearly as
       amusing as I remember Jackass to be. I guess maybe I am getting too
       old for this? There was one though where a guy got his tooth pulled
       out. It made me feel like I was going to puke. So, maybe, mission
       accomplished?
     * The Roommate--This one was a pretty recent view and I will admit
       it, I saw it because I love horror movies and Leighton Meester.
       What of it? Christ Almighty this movie was bad. If we hadn't seen
       it at Chinatown and had the "interactive" movie experience (ever
       noticed the audience at Ctown can't shut the eff up? They talk to
       the screen. They think it is interactive) this would have been a
       total waste. But by the end the reaction from the audience with the
       action on the screen was so hilarious that we were all dying of
       laughter. I imagine this was not the desired effect when they made
       the film.
     * Up--I know. I know. How is it possible I haven't seen this yet?
       IDK. I watched it on Christmas, perfect movie for that day, right?!
       I loved it. I thought the animation was so excellent and the
       characters were so sweet. I was chastised though because I didn't
       cry at the beginning. I guess I have a stone where my heart should
       be?
     * Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1--I actually saw this
       movie twice! Once the day after Thanksgiving and once on Christmas.
       Don't you just love Harry Potter at holiday time? God, I do!! This
       is obviously the best HP yet. Why? Obviously because they split it
       in two so it can be closer to the story in the book. Love love love
       love love it. Can't wait till the end.
     * Blue Valentine--Ah yes, another E street wonder. What does it say
       about me, or maybe about that theatre, that anything I see there is
       more enjoyable than a movie anywhere else? And how do I remember
       that I had my pomegranate soda, resces pieces and a crab pretzel?
       They must pump some sort of hyper circulated air in, or something.
       Anyway. I liked this. It wasn't uplifting, but sometimes neither is
       life. Michelle Williams was way better than stupid Natalie Portman.
       SHE should win the Oscar. I also sort of realized I am in love with
       Ryan Gosling. I guess I should get in line.
     * Catfish--OH DAMN. Seriously. This was the other best movie of 2010.
       I want everyone to watch it. I wont say anything about it though,
       because I want you to experience it with fresh eyes. After Erik and
       I watched this we had to immediately go to another movie to cleanse
       the palate of this one. It was SO GOOD!!!
     * Devil--is the movie we saw after Catfish. What is with M.Night?
       Seriously. That guy can't make a good movie to save his life.
       Though. I did sort of like it. But it is really hard to tell if he
       is being serious or just thinks that he can make good previews and
       trick people into seeing his movies.
     * Inception--Yes, yes. A worthy Oscar contender. But lets be
       seriously. I love Leonardo DiCaprio. I would watch him read the
       phone book. I love him. Love, love, love. This was good. I liked
       it. I should watch it again. Oh Man... speaking of Inception and
       Up. Watch this. It is freaking HILARiOUS!!!!! Please watch it.
       Please. It is so good.
     * Let the Right One In--A Swedish vampire movie. I hear that the book
       is much better. Let's all just read the book, eh?
     * Dead Snow--Hahahahahaha. Yes. You know this movie. It has some of
       my favorite elements. Norway. Zombies. Nazis. Well, Nazis aren't my
       favorite, but they are historical. Yes, a somewhat historical
       zombie movie set in Norway. It was just as bad, or as good, as you
       expected. I watched this on Halloween. Totally viable.
     * Please Give--I watched this because I read something about it in
       Slate. The article was talking about this scene where the daughter
       wasn't a pair of jeans and how it was really sad and realistic. I
       don't know about that but I thought the movie was good.
       Entertaining. And the actors were quite good. And Amanda Peet was
       in it. Solved.
     * Saw 3D--Ok. Ok. This was just like Jackass 3D. Mel and I went to
       see this because her friend was in it. It was awful. Just awful.
       But we did see her high school friend get cut in half. Classic.
     * Waiting for Superman--I read something about this movie that said
       some of the scenes where the kids are waiting during the lotteries
       were actually fake. It was disappointing. I mean, I suppose what is
       more disappointing is that not everyone can go to school in one of
       the best counties in America, like I did. It is sad that people
       can't get quality education. I dunno that charter schools are the
       answer. I just wish people had more money so they could move to a
       good school district.
     * Survival of the Dead--This movie makes me sad. This is not George
       Romero quality. It was just atrocious. Just so, so, so so awful.
     * Rachel Getting Married--Here is the thing about this movie. It was
       actually pretty good. But towards the end Anne Hathaway has her
       hair highlighted and it was so hideous it was actually distracting.
       Like, I could not focus on the movie. Just ask Erik. He was there.
       Also, why was that family so weird? Maybe we will never know.
     * Midnight in the Garden of Good And Evil--Lori and I both read this
       book in preparation for our Georgia Road Trip 2011. It was an
       excellent book. Just excellent. It teaches you so much about
       Georgia history and prepares you to travel to Savannah. The
       narration was amazing. But Christ this movie was bad. Not even
       Kevin Spacey and Jude Law could fix it. Message to Hollywood: Just
       because a book is awesome doesn't mean it will translate well to
       film. Please consider why the book is good (narration and the
       character development) and make sure you can do that in the movie.
       Because they couldn't do it, it made the movie not good. We both
       fell asleep then had to return to watch it another day. Sad.
     * The Fighter--I just saw this last night. Yay for solo dates! This
       one was much better than Black Swan. Christian Bale should win an
       Oscar. Brother is scary good! I liked this one. I like that there
       is a character arc, and that I care what happens to them. And I am
       not sure, but were the sisters supposed to be funny, because
       hoo-boy. What was going on with them? Despite the fact it was a
       Thursday night and everyone in the theater was over 25 it was still
       interactive. Oh Chinatown.

   The television...
     * True Blood Seasons 1 and 2--Fuck I love this show. It is pretty
       unusual that I am interested in a show from the first episode, but
       I was with this one. Thanks to RaeJean to recommending it. I can't
       wait till I can watch Season 3.
     * Peep Show Seasons 1-7--God this show is hilarious. Peep Show is a
       BBC production about two friends, Mark and Jeremy (though my
       favorite character is Super Hanz...which I thought was Super Hands
       for a long time). It is sort of like It's Always Sunny in
       Philadelphia but set in England. I discovered the show one morning
       when I woke up from a night out at like 5 and I needed to wash my
       face and brush my teeth. I turned on the telly, which was on BBC
       because I was watching Law and Order: UK when I fell asleep and I
       was absolutely hooked! It is on BBC America Saturday mornings from
       4-6am... for those times when you're just getting home from the bar
       or are too drunk to fall asleep. Or you can watch all the episodes
       on Hulu. You wont regret it. It is hysterical.
     * The IT Crowd Seasons 1-3--The only reason I watched this show was
       because it was available on Netflix view it now. The first season
       was really funny. The other two, not as much. It reminds me of the
       show within a show on Extras. What was it called? When the Whistle
       Blows? It has the same sort of odd BBC production values... almost
       like it is a fake show.
     * The Walking Dead--Remember when I said the Walking Dead invaded DC?
       Well, these were the dead from this show. God. What didn't I like
       about this show? It took place in Georgia. Had Zombies. Was made by
       AMC. And it was one of the first scary shows I have ever watched.
       Other than MTV's Fear (god I miss that show) I have never actually
       been scared during a show. The first three or so eps of this show
       just made me so nervous. I loved it. The DVD comes out around my
       birthday. Hint. Hint.
     * Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 1--To say Lori was mad when I liked
       True Blood would be the understatement of 2010. She was like,
       "those aren't real vampires. Watch Buffy. Otherwise I will hate
       you." So over NYE weekend we watched Season 1. I will tell you, the
       vampires in TB are so much sexier (ugh) than the ones in BtVS. Lori
       would say "They're not supposed to be sexy! They're supposed to be
       evil!! I hate you." So Season 1 was sort of ridiculous. The
       production quality was very low and the episodes were hysterical.
       But we made a drinking game out of it and now Season 2 is much much
       better. Ah, the things we do for love!

   Wow. That took many days to complete. That is the full disclosure.
   Hopefully now that I have gotten those out of the way I can go back to
   updating regularly. Coming soon... (or what I have been watching, or
   have ready to watch...)
   Glee: Season 1 (two discs left)
   Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 2 (three episodes left)
   The Tudors: Season 4 (how did I not know this was out?! I will watch it
   once Glee is over)
   The Social Network (waiting at home to be watched Sunday)
   Mighty Ducks and D2 (purchased with an amazon card I won at work!)
   and thats all for now! Welcome back.
   See you at the movies. Or something. (E street. Not Chinatown)

Scream

   So what is this one about?
   If for some stupid, insane, inane reason, you don't know the plot of
   1996's Scream, Netflix will tell you about it...

     Horror maven Wes Craven -- paying homage to teen horror classics
     such as Halloween and Prom Night -- turns the genre on its head with
     this tale of a murderer who terrorizes hapless high schooler Sidney
     Prescott (Neve Campbell) by offing everyone she knows. Not your
     average slasher flick, Scream distinguishes itself with a
     self-parodying sense of humor. Courteney Cox and David Arquette
     co-star as a local news reporter and a small-town deputy.

   Amazing.
   And how much did I pay to watch?
   Nothing. I actually watched this while I was visiting my beloved in
   Georgia. The state not the country. She is also a netflix member,
   because she is amazing--as is netflix--and we watched this after a
   night of drinking on view it now. It was pretty much the greatest
   decision ever!
   And what did I think?
   Wow. When I first saw this movie I thought my head was going to
   explode. I watched it when I was in middle school and I'd never seen
   anything so amazingly brilliant in my entire life. I am not even being
   hyperbolic. It seriously blew my mind! It was so surprising with the
   way Wes Craven used typical horror movie convention and turned it
   completely on it's head!!
   The movie is so wonderfully quotable. So many amazing quotes. "What's
   the point? They're all the same. Some stupid killer stalking some
   big-breasted girl who can't act who is always running up the stairs
   when she should be going out the front door. It's insulting" and "Your
   mother was a slut-bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she
   was Sharon Stone or something, but let's face it Sydney, your
   mother...was no Sharon Stone" and "Listen Kenny, I know you're about 50
   pounds overweight. But when I say 'hurry,' please interpret that as
   'move your fat, tub of lard ass NOW!'" It also has music that is so
   awesome and retro without being too much of a time warp. I listened to
   that soundtrack like a million times. It is hilarious to listen to a
   movie and be able to sing all the songs because I remember them from
   when I was 13.
   This movie may be one of the most responsible for my love of horror
   movies. I don't just love slasher movies, though, I love all horror
   movies. This may have been one of the first ones I'd really seen by the
   time I could sort of understand what I was thinking about anything. It
   was just so incredible!!
   So what is the rating? (out of 10)
   Scream is just so gd clever it makes me sick! The characterization was
   amazing, with using horror movie cliches. And it paints an amazing
   picture of what was going on in pop culture in 1996.
   It is amazing. It is 100% a 10.
   I need to buy this on dvd like a million years ago. I have it on vhs
   somewhere...

Ghost Town

   So what is this one about?
   Welp, my delightfully under-used friend Netlfix tells us,

     British funnyman Ricky Gervais ("The Office," "Extras") stars in his
     first feature film lead as Bertram Pincus, a hapless gent who's
     pronounced dead, only to be brought back to life with an unexpected
     gift: a newfound ability to see ghosts. When Bertram crosses paths
     with the recently departed Frank Herlihy (Greg Kinnear), he gets
     pulled into Frank's desperate bid to break up his widowed wife's
     (Téa Leoni) pending marriage to another man.

   ok.
   And how much did I pay to watch?
   Nothing.
   One thing you might not know about me is I have recently (well, maybe
   not too recently, since the Olympics) started going 10 miles a day on
   Saturday and Sundays on the treadmill in my basement. For the most part
   this works well because I have recorded shows from the previous week
   that I can watch. At most, three episodes of Law and Order (and it's
   friends) and one episode of Gossip Girl. This seems to fit the time
   well.
   Unfortunately, the weekend I watched this I had nothing left to watch,
   so I used my HBO on demand and settled on this one. And since I don't
   pay for cable it really was nothing.
   And what did I think?
   Well, I am a big Ricky Gervais fan. I like his insane laugh. And his
   British accent. And his fat little face. He doesn't seem to have a lot
   of range to me, because I've never seen a role where he wasn't just
   playing Ricky Gervais. Luckily, though, I like him. So, it works well.
   As Bertram he was really playing himself. Grumpy old Ricky. There is
   something about him, though, that is so sincere, so his character arc
   was nice. He had a very nice chemistry with each other character in the
   movie, and you really wanted things to work out well for him.
   Interestingly enough, since it is a stupid idiotic romantic comedy,
   things had to fail then could be built back up. Romantic comedies are
   so flipping dumb. In life, when you like a boy (or a boy likes a girl)
   and you do something stupid to fuck it up, you often don't get a second
   chance. Romantic comedies give stupid people too much ammunition for
   them to think that everything will work out for them too. Romantic
   comedies are the devil. (except Love Actually, and does Clueless
   count?) I sound way more bitter than I am.
   So what is the rating? (out of 10)
   It was funny enough, but mostly, anything with Ricky Gervais will
   likely be enjoyable for me.
   I give it a 6.

Shutter Island

   So what is this one about?
   My beloved tells us,

     World War II soldier-turned-U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo
     DiCaprio) investigates the disappearance of a patient from a
     hospital for the criminally insane, but his efforts are compromised
     by his own troubling visions and by Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley). Mark
     Ruffalo, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer and Max von Sydow co-star
     in director Martin Scorsese's plot twist-filled psychological
     thriller set on a Massachusetts island in 1954.

   Mmmmmm, Leonardo DiCaprio AND Max Von Sydow?!?! Sign me up!!!
   And how much did I pay to watch?
   Erm. Well, my mother and I went to go see this at Cinema Arts. I don't
   remember if she paid. I think she might have, and then I bought some
   snacks. mmmmmmm, Cinema Arts popcorn! So, i think I paid nothing.
   And what did I think?
   Well, the more I think about this movie the more I like it.
   Interestingly enough, when I first watched this I didn't really like it
   as much. It really wasn't what I expected from the ads. I wanted it to
   be much, much, much scarier. (Love me some scary movies!)
   But now that I think about the movie, and its "twist" I think it is
   very smart. I'd like to see it again to see if there were any clues to
   figuring it out while the plot was moving forward.
   And I love Leonardo DiCaprio and Max VonSydow. Yumm.
   So what is the rating? (out of 10)
   Like I said, the more I think about it, the more I like it. So I'll
   give it a 7. Or maybe an 8. Something like that.

The Pregnancy Pact

   So what is this one about?
   Ah ha! Lifetime (yes, that Lifetime. Television for Women) tells us
   about their movie,

     Inspired by a true story, the film explores the costs of teen
     pregnancy with a story of a fictional "pregnancy pact" set against
     the backdrop of actual news reports about teen pregnancy from June
     2008. Sidney Bloom (Thora Birch), an online magazine journalist,
     returns to her hometown to investigate the sudden spike in teenage
     pregnancies at her old high school. Almost immediately, she comes up
     against Lorraine Dougan (Nancy Travis), the head of the local
     conservative values group and mother of Sara, a newly pregnant
     15-year-old. Meanwhile, the school nurse (Camryn Manheim) tries to
     convince the school to provide contraception to students to address
     the pregnancy epidemic but is met with great opposition from the
     school and community. As the number of pregnant girls climbs to 18,
     a media firestorm erupts when Time Magazine reports that the rise in
     the number of pregnancies at the school is the result of a
     "pregnancy pact." As the mystery unfolds about whether or not "the
     pact" is real, Sidney soon realizes that all of the attention is
     disguising the much larger issues that are at the core of the story.

   Shazaam that is long.
   And how much did I pay to watch?
   Zero dollars. I watched it on Lifetime. On my tv. At home. Awesome.
   And what did I think?
   Oh lord. One thing you might not know about me is that I love me some
   Lifetime movies. I mean, how the shit can you not?! Think about the
   fabulous Kirsten Dunst as star Fifteen and Pregnant. Or, Too Young to
   be a Dad with Paul Dano. Or Student Seduction with Elizabeth Berkeley.
   Or Co-Ed Call Girl with Tori Spelling. Do I really need to go on?! No.
   I do not. Lifetime movies are awesome. Awesomely bad. Awesomely
   awesome.
   And man, they really hit the nail on the head for me. I love the whole
   teenage pregnancy focus on tv these days. Why? I don't know. It
   actually might be a little sick. Because while, when I watch 16 and
   Pregnant, often times these girls are stupid and unimpressive and I
   think they are dumb and sort of got what they deserve, I feel so
   incredibly bad for them. Because they are so unprepared and just sad.
   So, this movie was awesome in that it was showing the typical tv
   teenage reaction to getting pregnant--you know, going to parties and
   drinking, saying ridiculous things like "I have to spend time with my
   friends, I can't spend time with the baby all the time!" (actually,
   yes, you can. When you decided to have a baby that is essentially what
   you decided. It isn't your fault. You're just a stupid 16 year old),
   and being clueless as to the fact that the boy who got you pregnant is
   pretty much not going to stick around. But, through wise old, old, old
   Thora Birch it also showed that teenage pregnancy isn't all the fun and
   games you think. Do people really think it will be all fun and games?
   Be serious.
   So what is the rating? (out of 10)
   It is a hard movie to rate because all lifetime movies are pretty much
   awful. So, is it good because it is awful, or is it just awful?
   It certainly is not the best Lifetime movie I have seen, but lets be
   serious, if it is on some Sunday afternoon, I'm not gonna pretend like
   I am not going to watch it. And it isn't like I spend a few hours
   watching Lifetime movies today. Be serious.
   So, I'll give it a 6. Better than average, but not by much!

   Meta-joke refers to several somewhat different, but related categories:
   self-referential jokes, jokes about jokes (also known as metahumor),
   and joke templates.^[citation needed]

[edit] Self-referential jokes

   This kind of meta-joke is a joke in which a familiar class of jokes is
   part of the joke.

   Examples of meta-jokes:
     * An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman walk into a bar. The
       bartender turns to them, takes one look, and says, "What is this -
       some kind of joke?"
     * A Priest, a Rabbi and a Leprechaun walk into a bar. The Leprechaun
       looks around and says, "Saints preserve us! I'm in the wrong joke!"
     * A woman walked into a pub and asked the barman for a double
       entendre. So he gave her one.
     * An Irishman walks past a bar.
     * Three men walk into a bar... Ouch! (And variants:)
          + A dyslexic man walks into a bra.
          + Two men walk into a bar... you'd think one of them would have
            seen it.
          + Two men walk into a bar... the third one ducks.
          + A seal walks into a club.
          + Two men walk into a bar... but the third one is too short and
            walks right under it.
          + Three blind mice walk into a bar, but they are unaware of
            their surroundings so to derive humour from it would be
            exploitative — Bill Bailey^[1]
     * W.S. Gilbert wrote one of the definitive "anti-limericks":

                There was an old man of St. Bees,
                Who was stung in the arm by a wasp;
                    When they asked, "Does it hurt?"
                    He replied, "No, it doesn't,
                But I thought all the while 'twas a Hornet." ^[2]^[3]

     * Tom Stoppard's anti-limerick from Travesties:

                A performative poet of Hibernia
                Rhymed himself into a hernia
                    He became quite adept
                    At this practice, except
                For the occasional non-sequitur.

     * These non-limericks rely on the listener's familiarity with the
       limerick's general structure:

                There was a young man from Peru
                Whose limericks all stopped at line two

     * (may be followed with)

                There was an old maid from Verdun

     * (and even with an explanation that the narrator knows an
       unrecitable limerick about Emperor Nero)
     * Why did the elephant cross the road? Because the chicken retired.
     * Two drums and a cymbal roll down a hill. (Cue drum sting)
     * A self-referential knock-knock joke:

                A: Knock, knock!
                B: Who's there?
                A: The Interrupting Cow.
                B: The Interrupt--
                A: MOOOOOOOO!!

     * A self-referential meta-joke:

                I've never meta-joke I didn't like.
                Why did the chicken cross the road? To have his motives
                questioned.
                Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit.
                There was a man who entered a local paper's pun contest.
                He sent in ten different puns, in the hope that at least
                one of the puns would win. Unfortunately, no pun in ten
                did

[edit] Joke about jokes (metahumor)

   Metahumor as humor about humor. Here meta is used to describe the fact
   that the joke explicitly talks about other jokes, a usage similar to
   the word metadata (data about data), metatheatrics (a play within a
   play, as in Hamlet), or metafiction.

   Marc Galanter in the introduction to his book Lowering the Bar: Lawyer
   Jokes and Legal Culture cites a meta-joke in a speech of Chief Justice
   William Rehnquist:^[4]

     I've often started off with a lawyer joke, a complete caricature of
     a lawyer who's been nasty, greedy, and unethical. But I've stopped
     that practice. I gradually realized that the lawyers in the audience
     didn't think the jokes were funny and the non-lawyers didn't know
     they were jokes.

   E.B. White has joked about humor, saying that "Humor can be dissected,
   as a frog can, but the thing dies in the process and the innards are
   discouraging to any but the pure scientific mind."^[5]

   Another kind of metahumor is when jokes make fun of poor jokes by
   replacing a familiar punchline with a serious or nonsensical
   alternative. Such jokes expose the fundamental criterion for joke
   definition, "funniness", via its deletion. Comedians such as George
   Carlin and Mitch Hedberg used metahumor of this sort extensively in
   their routines. Hedberg would often follow up a joke with an admission
   that it was poorly told, or insist to the audience that "that joke was
   funnier than you acted."^[6] These followups usually get laughs
   superior to those of the perceived poor joke and serve to cover an
   awkward silence. Johnny Carson, especially late in his Tonight Show
   career, used to get uproarious laughs when reacting to a failed joke
   with, for example, a pained expression. Similarly, Jon Stewart, hosting
   his own television program, often wrings his tie and grimaces following
   an uncomfortable clip or jab. Eddie Izzard often reacts to a failed
   joke by miming writing on a paper pad and murmuring into the microphone
   something along the lines of "must make joke funnier" or "don't use
   again" while glancing at the audience.

   In the U.S. version of the British mockumentary The Office, many jokes
   are founded on making fun of poor jokes. Examples include Dwight
   Schrute butchering the Aristocrats joke, or Michael Scott awkwardly
   writing in a fellow employee's card an offensive joke, and then
   attempting to cover it with more unbearable bad jokes.

   Limerick jokesters often^[citation needed] rely on this limerick that
   can be told in polite company: "A limerick packs jokes anatomical/ Into
   space that is quite economical./ But good ones, it seems,/ So seldom
   are clean,/ And the clean ones so seldom are comical."

[edit] Joke template

   This kind of meta-joke is a sarcastic jab at the fact that some jokes
   are endlessly refitted, often by professional jokers, to different
   circumstances or characters without significant innovation in the
   humour.^[7]

          "Three people of different nationalities walk into a bar. Two of
          them say something smart, and the third one makes a mockery of
          his fellow countrymen by acting stupid."

          "Three blokes walk into a pub. One of them is a little bit
          stupid, and the whole scene unfolds with a tedious
          inevitability."
          —Bill Bailey:^[1]
          "How many members of a certain demographic group does it take to
          perform a specified task?"
          "A finite number: one to perform the task and the remainder to
          act in a manner stereotypical of the group in question."

          There once was an X from place B,
          Who satisfied predicate P,
          The X did thing A,
          In a specified way,
          Resulting in circumstance C.

   The philosopher Sidney Morgenbesser summarised Jewish logic as "If P,
   so why not Q?"

Channel Four criticised over David Walliams's 'disgusting' joke

Channel Four could be found to have breached broadcasting rules over an
obscene joke made on one of its shows by David Walliams, the comedian.

   Comments Comments

   Appearing on Chris Moyles' Quiz Night, the Little Britain star told the
   Radio 1 DJ that he would like to perform a sexual act on a teenage
   member of the boy band One Direction.

   Ofcom, the media watchdog, is now assessing whether the show broke
   strict rules governing the use of offensive language amid growing
   concerns about declining standards on television.

   The watchdog and Channel Four have both received complaints, and
   campaigners described the lewd joke made by the children's' author as
   "disgusting" and "appalling".

   They argued it was as distasteful as the phone calls that Jonathan Ross
   and Russell Brand made to Andrew Sachs in 2008, claiming that Brand had
   sex with the Fawlty Towers actor's granddaughter.

   Agreeing with Moyles that Harry Styles was his favourite member of One
   Direction, Walliams talked fondly about the singer's hair on the show,
   which was watched by 1.1 million viewers.

     * Channel 4 criticised for new reality 'freak show'
       22 Aug 2010

   The 40-year-old comedian, who is married to the model Lara Stone and
   has published four books for children, including The Boy in the Dress
   and Gangsta Granny, then said: "I'd like to suck his ****."

   The show was aired at 10pm, only an hour after the watershed, and is
   likely to have attracted a large teenage audience.

   Producers of the show cleared the controversial exchange for broadcast,
   even though Channel Four could now be fined if found to be guilty of
   breaching guidelines on indecent behaviour.

   Under Ofcom's rules, broadcasters are asked to ensure that potentially
   offensive material can be justified by its 'context', which includes
   factors such as the time it was shown, the programme's editorial
   content and "the degree of harm or offence likely to be caused". There
   is no list of words that are banned from use on radio or television.

   While the show was aired after the watershed, the media watchdog will
   now assess complaints that it has received, in addition to the four
   made to Channel Four.

   The BBC initially only received two complaints after Russell Brand left
   messages on Andrew Sachs's answerphone, but the number rose to
   thousands after the incident was brought to the public's attention.

   Peter Foot, the chairman of the National Campaign for Courtesy, said
   that Walliams's remark was worse than the comments made by Ross and
   Brand.

   "I've never heard of anything going this far," he said.

   "I'm amazed there hasn't been more of an uproar about this because that
   it is incredibly graphic language to use.

   "It doesn't leave much to the imagination."

   Mr Foot said that Channel Four could not justify the lewd joke by
   saying it was shown after the watershed as he said many teenagers could
   have been watching.

   Earlier this year, a Government-backed report raised serious concerns
   about the level of sexual content that children and teenagers are
   exposed to on television.

   Vivienne Pattison, director of mediawatch, said that Channel Four's
   decision to broadcast the obscene remark demonstrates how far the
   boundaries of decency have been pushed.

   "You expect comedians to push the envelope, but it's down to producers
   to check that it doesn't overstep the mark," she said.

   "Chris Moyles and David Walliams have a huge young following. They are
   role models and responsibility comes with that.

   "Instead, jokes like this set up a context of behaviour that somehow
   normalises and justifies it.

   "This is leading to a coarsening of our culture."

   A Channel 4 spokesman said: “The show was appropriately scheduled
   post-watershed at 10pm and viewers were warned of strong language and
   adult humour.”

   An Ofcom spokesman said: "Ofcom received two complaints about the
   episode of the programme, which was broadcast after the watershed.

   "We will assess the complaints against the Broadcasting Code, the rule
   book of standards which broadcasters must adhere to."

BBC in decency row over obscene joke by Sandi Toksvig

MPs have urged Ofcom to investigate standards at the BBC after bosses claimed
that Radio 4 listeners would have taken “delight” in a joke about the most
offensive word in the English language that was aired during the afternoon.

   By Heidi Blake

   7:30AM BST 06 Jun 2011

   Comments Comments

   The corporation received a complaint about the comment by the presenter
   Sandi Toksvig on The News Quiz but said the swear word had lost much of
   its “shock value” and references to it were suitable.

   The executive who cleared the joke for daytime transmission said it
   would “delight” much of the show’s audience, adding that listeners
   would “love it”.

   The BBC’s rejection of the complaint has angered MPs and campaigners,
   who called for greater regulation of potentially offensive content on
   radio. The reference to the obscene word was in a scripted joke by
   Toksvig, the broadcaster and a mother of three, about the Conservatives
   and cuts to child benefit. It was broadcast last October at 6.30pm and
   the next day at 12.30pm. The programme was cleared by Paul Mayhew
   Archer, then commissioning editor of Radio 4 Comedy.

   Colin Harrow, a retired newspaper executive, complained to the BBC and
   the BBC Trust that the reference was offensive and unacceptable. Both
   bodies rejected his complaint. In a letter to Mr Harrow, Mr Mayhew
   Archer wrote: “If my job was simply not to risk offending any listeners
   I could have cut it instantly. But that is not my job. My job here was
   to balance the offence it might cause some listeners against the
   delight it might give other listeners. For good or ill, the word does
   not seem to have quite the shock value it did. I am not saying this is
   a good thing. I am simply saying that I think attitudes shift.”

   John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport
   select committee, called for Ofcom to investigate. “That word is way
   out in front in terms of people finding it offensive, and I think to
   broadcast it on radio at 6.30pm is inappropriate. Even though they did
   it by implication, nobody was left in any doubt about what was meant,”
   he said.

   “Perhaps it hasn’t occurred to the BBC that one of the reasons why this
   word has lost its shock value is that it is now being used on
   television and radio.

   “But I would expect them to be aware of the risk that children might be
   listening, especially at such an early hour. I hope that the gentleman
   who made the complaint takes this matter to Ofcom because I think they
   are the appropriate people to rule on this, not the BBC Trust.”

   Vivienne Pattison, of the Mediawatch-UK campaign group, said radio
   programmes, which are free of any controls, should be subject to a
   watershed. “This is in fact one of the only truly offensive terms we
   have left,” she said.

   The BBC said last night: “The BBC has rigorous guidelines. The News
   Quiz is a long-running panel show aimed at an adult audience. Listeners
   are used to a certain level of robust humour.”

   Ofcom said it would open an investigation if it received a formal
   complaint.

   It is not the first time the BBC’s standards on decency have been
   criticised. In October 2008, it received thousands of complaints over
   crude messages left by Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross on the answer
   phone of Andrew Sachs, the Fawlty Towers actor, which were broadcast on
   Brand’s Saturday night Radio 2 show. Brand and Lesley Douglas, the
   controller of Radio 2, both resigned.

   The Absolute Best of The Anti-Joke Chicken Meme Anything

The Absolute Best of The Anti-Joke Chicken Meme By Robert Wabash  [50 more
lists]

   more

   Anti-Joke Chicken is an Advice Animal meme that takes the setups to
   jokes and then explains them literally, which would usually kill the
   laughter in any room, but coming out of such a militant, humorless
   looking chicken, every one of the chicken's joke failures comes across
   as hilarious. So get ready for rational explanations or humorless
   answers to jokes that could probably be otherwise good. Here is the
   best of Anti-Joke Chicken, in all her joke-ruining glory. Nothing
   less/more satisfying than good anti-jokes.

Who is Anti-Joke Chicken?
       Anti-Joke Chicken is the latest animal advice meme to come out of
       Reddit and it hits home for a lot of people, because Anti-Joke
       Chicken is that person we all know that either can't tell a joke,
       or always needs to point out the grain of truth in the joke -- even
       though everyone around them is completely aware of what that grain
       of truth is, as that grain of truth is usually the joke, or why the
       joke is funny to begin with.
       Originally taken from a picture of a chicken that looks,
       admittedly, humorless...

       ... Anti-Joke chicken takes every joke literally, so most Anti-Joke
       Chicken memes will either tell an "anti-joke" (a joke that is funny
       because it's written or delivered so poorly) or they'll behave like
       this:

                      [anti-joke-chicken-photo-u51.jpg]
       Anti-Joke Chicken, for the most part, takes what will most likely
       be a classic joke of some kind and then botches it by taking the
       setup literally, which is usually a huge record-scratch moment in
       real life, but attached to a chicken's face that looks like she
       means business, the complete failure of the joke itself becomes
       hilarious. Here's the best of the Anti-Joke Chicken meme.

            It does when terminal velocity comes into play, so the denser
            one would fall faster. -_-

            Weight affects the terminal velocity though. So a heavier
            person wouldn't fall faster to begin with, but would
            accelerate for longer, therefore hitting the ground first.

                 body weight is in relation with size and bigger size
                 makes bigger wind resistance and we don't know wether
                 their fall is long enough to reach the terminal velocity

       The set up:\n\nBarack Obama, the Pope, and a Boy Scout are on a
       private flight. The pilot runs out of the cockpit and says "The
       plane is going to crash. There are only 3 parachutes, and I have to
       use one so I can the FAA what happened." The pilot puts on one of
       the chutes and dives out of the plane.\n\nBarack Obama turns to the
       Pope and the Boy Scout and says "I'm the leader of the free world
       and the smartest president in the history of the United States, so
       I must survive." He throws on a pack and dives out of the
       plane.\n\nThe Pope turns to the boy scout and says "Son, I've lived
       a long and fulfilling life. You take the last parachute and save
       yourself."\n\nThe boy scout replies "No problem, Mr. Pope. There
       are still 2 parachutes left. President Obama just jumped out of the
       plane with my knapsack." \n\nChicken: Because Barack is actually an
       idiot.

       The one regarding jumping out of an airplane is false. Everyone
       knows that weight and mass have no bearing on the velocity a moving
       body has when pulled by gravity. That chicken is retarded.

            I'm guessing you've gone to a low level physics class and did
            trajectory and gravity equations solved some problems did some
            lectures, understood it. I'm also guessing that you never got
            to anything involving air friction and how weight, surface
            area, and even shape play a role in determining falling long
            distances. If you got a feather and a small metal bead that
            had the same mass which would fall faster? the bead, although
            if they were both beads or if it was in a vacuum they would
            fall the same. So I'm hoping you can figure out how two people
            could fall differently if there are differences between them.

                 Scientist: Winner Guy Who Understands Physics: Loser But
                 the first person loses because they were writing on the
                 grounds of what everyone knows, yet used the word
                 "retarded" as their go-to burn. Yet the second person
                 loses even more, because they were writing on the grounds
                 of understanding physics. Which is completely lame and
                 unnecessary grounds by which to critique a joke.
                 Basically, anyone who would even bother writing on this
                 topic has too much time on their hands, or simply can not
                 understand the point of jokes. [it is highly unlikely
                 that the misleading representation of physics present in
                 that joke was going to have any repercussions in the
                 scientific community] There you have it, an ironically,
                 and exponentially long critique of some dork's paragraph
                 long critique of some other dork's few sentence long
                 critique of some random person's sentence long critique
                 of the overdone territory of blonde jokes. The End.

       It wouldn't matter what their weights were if a blonde and a
       brunette jumped out of a plane. All objects undergo acceleration at
       32.2 ft/s^2 in a free fall. However, it might matter what their
       relative surface areas were, because the frictional force might
       play a part in determining who hits the ground first. They also
       would not die for certain. There are numerous instances of people
       falling out of planes and surviving incredible falls.

   1. Inside joke
   An inside joke is a joke formed between two or more people that no one
   other than those few people will ever understand until you explain it
   to them. And even when you do explain it to them, they may get the joke
   but may not find it even remotely amusing. People generally find inside
   jokes annoying, as the joke makes absolutley no sense on its own in any
   context. I find that most of the stupidest ones that have been formed
   by own group were formed by accident. Perhaps that is why most of them
   make absolutely no sense.
   However, the inside joke can backfire. In one instance, two people can
   have an inside joke, and a third person finds out about said joke.
   Then, the third person find it even MORE funny than either of the two
   who formed in the first place. Truly annoying.
   I have about 100 or more inside jokes formed between me and one
   particular friend alone. We even have an inside joke about how someday
   every word we say is going to be an inside joke. Which, someday, may
   occur.
   Random person: Yeah, so I went to the pet store, and there were some
   bunnies there. They were really cute.
   Group of friends: BUNNIES ON THE CEILING! AHHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
   Random person: What?
   *inside joke is explained*
   Random person: Oh. Well, uh, that's not THAT funny.
   Group of friends: Yes it is! AHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
   Random person: Uh, ok... *backs away slowly*

   An inside joke is a joke, usually extremely silly and stupid, that you
   share with one or 2 other people. Only you and those people understand
   the joke; if the inside joke is explained to other people, they start
   to wonder if you are crazy because you find something so silly
   hilarious.

   A joke (or gag) is a phrase or a paragraph with a humorous twist. It
   can be in many different forms, such as a question or short story. To
   achieve this end, jokes may employ irony, sarcasm, word play and other
   devices. Jokes may have a punchline that will end the sentence to make
   it humorous.

   A practical joke or prank differs from a spoken one in that the major
   component of the humour is physical rather than verbal (for example
   placing salt in the sugar bowl).

[edit] Purpose

   Jokes are typically for the entertainment of friends and onlookers. The
   desired response is generally laughter; when this does not happen the
   joke is said to have "fallen flat" or "bombed". However, jokes have
   other purposes and functions, common to comedy/humour/satire in
   general.

[edit] Antiquity of jokes

   Jokes have been a part of human culture since at least 1900 BC.
   According to research conducted by Dr Paul McDonald of the University
   of Wolverhampton, a fart joke from ancient Sumer is currently believed
   to be the world's oldest known joke.^[1] Britain's oldest joke,
   meanwhile, is a 1,000-year-old double-entendre that can be found in the
   Codex Exoniensis.^[2]

   A recent discovery of a document called Philogelos (The Laughter Lover)
   gives us an insight into ancient humour. Written in Greek by Hierocles
   and Philagrius, it dates to the third or fourth century AD, and
   contains some 260 jokes. Considering humour from our own culture as
   recent as the 19th century is at times baffling to us today, the humour
   is surprisingly familiar. They had different stereotypes, the
   absent-minded professor, the eunuch, and people with hernias or bad
   breath were favourites. A lot of the jokes play on the idea of knowing
   who characters are:

     A barber, a bald man and an absent minded professor take a journey
     together. They have to camp overnight, so decide to take turns
     watching the luggage. When it's the barber's turn, he gets bored, so
     amuses himself by shaving the head of the professor. When the
     professor is woken up for his shift, he feels his head, and says
     "How stupid is that barber? He's woken up the bald man instead of
     me."

   There is even a joke similar to Monty Python's "Dead Parrot" sketch: a
   man buys a slave, who dies shortly afterwards. When he complains to the
   slave merchant, he is told: "He didn't die when I owned him." Comic Jim
   Bowen has presented them to a modern audience. "One or two of them are
   jokes I've seen in people's acts nowadays, slightly updated. They put
   in a motor car instead of a chariot - some of them are Tommy
   Cooper-esque."^[3]

[edit] Psychology of jokes

   Why people laugh at jokes has been the subject of serious academic
   study, examples being:
     * Immanuel Kant, in Critique of Judgement (1790) states that
       "Laughter is an effect that arises if a tense expectation is
       transformed into nothing." Here is Kant's 220-year old joke and his
       analysis:

     An Englishman at an Indian's table in Surat saw a bottle of ale
     being opened, and all the beer, turned to froth, rushed out. The
     Indian, by repeated exclamations, showed his great amazement. -
     Well, what's so amazing in that? asked the Englishman. - Oh, but I'm
     not amazed at its coming out, replied the Indian, but how you
     managed to get it all in. - This makes us laugh, and it gives us a
     hearty pleasure. This is not because, say, we think we are smarter
     than this ignorant man, nor are we laughing at anything else here
     that it is our liking and that we noticed through our understanding.
     It is rather that we had a tense expectation that suddenly
     vanished...

     * Henri Bergson, in his book Le rire (Laughter, 1901), suggests that
       laughter evolved to make social life possible for human beings.
     * Sigmund Freud's "Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious". (Der
       Witz und seine Beziehung zum Unbewußten).
     * Arthur Koestler, in The Act of Creation (1964), analyses humour and
       compares it to other creative activities, such as literature and
       science.
     * Marvin Minsky in Society of Mind (1986).

          Marvin Minsky suggests that laughter has a specific function
          related to the human brain. In his opinion jokes and laughter
          are mechanisms for the brain to learn nonsense. For that reason,
          he argues, jokes are usually not as funny when you hear them
          repeatedly.

     * Edward de Bono in "The Mechanism of the Mind" (1969) and "I am
       Right, You are Wrong" (1990).

          Edward de Bono suggests that the mind is a pattern-matching
          machine, and that it works by recognising stories and behaviour
          and putting them into familiar patterns. When a familiar
          connection is disrupted and an alternative unexpected new link
          is made in the brain via a different route than expected, then
          laughter occurs as the new connection is made. This theory
          explains a lot about jokes. For example:

          + Why jokes are only funny the first time they are told: once
            they are told the pattern is already there, so there can be no
            new connections, and so no laughter.
          + Why jokes have an elaborate and often repetitive set up: The
            repetition establishes the familiar pattern in the brain. A
            common method used in jokes is to tell almost the same story
            twice and then deliver the punch line the third time the story
            is told. The first two tellings of the story evoke a familiar
            pattern in the brain, thus priming the brain for the punch
            line.
          + Why jokes often rely on stereotypes: the use of a stereotype
            links to familiar expected behaviour, thus saving time in the
            set-up.
          + Why jokes are variants on well-known stories (e.g. the genie
            and a lamp and a man walks into a bar): This again saves time
            in the set up and establishes a familiar pattern.

     * In 2002, Richard Wiseman conducted a study intended to discover the
       world's funniest joke [1].

   Laughter, the intended human reaction to jokes, is healthy in
   moderation, uses the stomach muscles, and releases endorphins, natural
   "feel good" chemicals, into the brain.

[edit] Jokes in organizations

   Jokes can be employed by workers as a way to identify with their jobs.
   For example, 9-1-1 operators often crack jokes about incongruous,
   threatening, or tragic situations they deal with on a daily basis.^[4]
   This use of humour and cracking jokes helps employees differentiate
   themselves from the people they serve while also assisting them in
   identifying with their jobs.^[5] In addition to employees, managers use
   joking, or jocularity, in strategic ways. Some managers attempt to
   suppress joking and humour use because they feel it relates to lower
   production, while others have attempted to manufacture joking through
   pranks, pajama or dress down days, and specific committees that are
   designed to increase fun in the workplace.^[6]

[edit] Rules

   The rules of humour are analogous to those of poetry. These common
   rules are mainly timing, precision, synthesis, and rhythm. French
   philosopher Henri Bergson has said in an essay: "In every wit there is
   something of a poet."^[7] In this essay Bergson views the essence of
   humour as the encrustation of the mechanical upon the living. He used
   as an instance a book by an English humorist, in which an elderly woman
   who desired a reputation as a philanthropist provided "homes within
   easy hail of her mansion for the conversion of atheists who have been
   specially manufactured for her, so to speak, and for a number of honest
   folk who have been made into drunkards so that she may cure them of
   their failing, etc." This idea seems funny because a genuine impulse of
   charity as a living, vital impulse has become encrusted by a mechanical
   conception of how it should manifest itself.

[edit] Precision

   To reach precision, the comedian must choose the words in order to
   provide a vivid, in-focus image, and to avoid being generic as to
   confuse the audience, and provide no laughter. To properly arrange the
   words in the sentence is also crucial to get precision.

[edit] Synthesis

   That a joke is best when it expresses the maximum level of humour with
   a minimal number of words, is today considered one of the key technical
   elements of a joke.^[citation needed] An example from George Carlin:

   I have as much authority as the Pope, I just don't have as many people
   who believe it.^[8]

   Though, the familiarity of the pattern of "brevity" has led to numerous
   examples of jokes where the very length is itself the pattern-breaking
   "punchline".^[citation needed] Numerous examples from Monty Python
   exist, for instance, the song "I Like Traffic Lights". More recently,
   Family Guy often exploits such humour: for example in the episode
   "Wasted Talent", Peter Griffin bangs his shin, a classic slapstick
   routine, and tenderly nurses it while inhaling and exhaling to quiet
   the pain, for considerably longer than expected.^[vague] Certain
   versions of the popular vaudevillian joke The Aristocrats can go on for
   several minutes, and it is considered an anti-joke, as the humour is
   more in the set-up than the punchline.^[vague]

[edit] Rhythm

   Main articles: Timing (linguistics) and Comic timing

   The joke's content (meaning) is not what provokes the laugh, it just
   makes the salience of the joke and provokes a smile. What makes us
   laugh is the joke mechanism. Milton Berle demonstrated this with a
   classic theatre experiment in the 1950s: if during a series of jokes
   you insert phrases that are not jokes, but with the same rhythm, the
   audience laughs anyway^[citation needed]. A classic is the ternary
   rhythm, with three beats: Introduction, premise, antithesis (with the
   antithesis being the punch line).

   In regards to the Milton Berle experiment, they can be taken to
   demonstrate the concept of "breaking context" or "breaking the
   pattern". It is not necessarily the rhythm that caused the audience to
   laugh, but the disparity between the expectation of a "joke" and being
   instead given a non-sequitur "normal phrase." This normal phrase is,
   itself, unexpected, and a type of punchline—the anti-climax.

[edit] Comic

   In the comic field plays the 'economy of ideative expenditure'; in
   other words excessive energy is wasted or action-essential energy is
   saved. The profound meaning of a comic gag or a comic joke is "I'm a
   child"; the comic deals with the clumsy body of the child.

   Laurel and Hardy are a classic example. An individual laughs because he
   recognises the child that is in himself. In clowns stumbling is a
   childish tempo. In the comic, the visual gags may be translated into a
   joke. For example in Side Effects (By Destiny Denied story) by Woody
   Allen:

   "My father used to wear loafers," she confessed. "Both on the same
   foot".

   The typical comic technique is the disproportion.

[edit] Wit

   In the wit field plays the "economy of censorship expenditure"^[9]
   (Freud calls it "the economy of psychic expenditure"); usually
   censorship prevents some 'dangerous ideas' from reaching the conscious
   mind, or helps us avoid saying everything that comes to mind;
   adversely, the wit circumvents the censorship and brings up those
   ideas. Different wit techniques allow one to express them in a funny
   way. The profound meaning behind a wit joke is "I have dangerous
   ideas". An example from Woody Allen:

   I contemplated suicide again - this time by inhaling next to an
   insurance salesman.

   Or, when a bagpipe player was asked "How do you play that thing?" his
   answer was "Well." Wit is a branch of rhetoric, and there are about 200
   techniques (technically they are called tropes, a particular kind of
   figure of speech) that can be used to make jokes.^[10]

   Irony can be seen as belonging to this field.

[edit] Humor

   In the comedy field, humour induces an "economised expenditure of
   emotion" (Freud calls it "economy of affect" or "economy of sympathy".
   Freud produced this final part of his interpretation many years later,
   in a paper later supplemented to the book.).^[9]^[11] In other words,
   the joke erases an emotion that should be felt about an event, making
   us insensitive to it.e.g.: "yo momma" jokes. The profound meaning of
   the void feeling of a humour joke is "I'm a cynic". An example from
   Woody Allen:

   Three times I've been mistaken for Robert Redford. Each time by a blind
   person.

   This field of jokes is still a grey area, being mostly unexplored.
   Extensive use of this kind of humour can be found in the work of
   British satirist Chris Morris, like the sketches of the Jam television
   program.

   Black humour and sarcasm belong to this field.

[edit] Cycles

   Folklorists, in particular (but not exclusively) those who study the
   folklore of the United States, collect jokes into joke cycles. A cycle
   is a collection of jokes with a particular theme or a particular
   "script". (That is, it is a literature cycle.)^[12] Folklorists have
   identified several such cycles:
     * the Helen Keller Joke Cycle that comprises jokes about Helen
       Keller^[13]
     * Viola jokes^[14]
     * the NASA, Challenger, or Space Shuttle Joke Cycle that comprises
       jokes relating to the Space Shuttle Challenger
       disaster^[15]^[16]^[17]
     * the Chernobyl Joke Cycle that comprises jokes relating to the
       Chernobyl disaster^[18]
     * the Polish Pope Joke Cycle that comprises jokes relating to Pope
       John Paul II^[19]
     * the Essex girl and the Stupid Irish joke cycles in the United

   Gruner discusses several "sick joke" cycles that occurred upon events
   surrounding Gary Hart, Natalie Wood, Vic Morrow, Jim Bakker, Richard
   Pryor, Princess Diana and Michael Jackson, noting how several jokes
   were recycled from one cycle to the next. For example: A joke about Vic
   Morrow ("We now know that Vic Morrow had dandruff: they found his head
   and shoulders in the bushes") was subsequently recycled about Admiral
   Mountbatten after his murder by Irish Republican terrorists in 1979,
   and again applied to the crew of the Challenger space shuttle ("How do
   we know that Christa McAuliffe had dandruff? They found her head and
   shoulders on the beach.").^[28]

   Berger asserts that "whenever there is a popular joke cycle, there
   generally is some widespread kind of social and cultural anxiety,
   lingering below the surface, that the joke cycle helps people deal
   with".^[29]

[edit] Types of jokes

   Question book-new.svg

   improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced
   material may be challenged and removed. (March 2011)

   Jokes often depend on the humour of the unexpected, the mildly taboo
   (which can include the distasteful or socially improper), or playing
   off stereotypes and other cultural beliefs. Many jokes fit into more
   than one category.

[edit] Subjects

   Political jokes are usually a form of satire. They generally concern
   politicians and heads of state, but may also cover the absurdities of a
   country's political situation. A prominent example of political jokes
   would be political cartoons. Two large categories of this type of jokes
   exist. The first one makes fun of a negative attitude to political
   opponents or to politicians in general. The second one makes fun of
   political clichés, mottoes, catch phrases or simply blunders of
   politicians. Some, especially the "you have two cows" genre, derive
   humour from comparing different political systems.

   Professional humour includes caricatured portrayals of certain
   professions such as lawyers, and in-jokes told by professionals to each
   other.

   Mathematical jokes are a form of in-joke, generally designed to be
   understandable only by insiders. (They are also often strictly visual
   jokes.)

   Ethnic jokes exploit ethnic stereotypes. They are often racist and
   frequently considered offensive.

   For example, the British tell jokes starting "An Englishman, an
   Irishman and a Scotsman..." which exploit the supposed parsimony of the
   Scot, stupidity of the Irish or rigid conventionality of the English.
   Such jokes exist among numerous peoples.

   Jokes based on other stereotypes (such as blonde jokes) are often
   considered funny.

   Religious jokes fall into several categories:
     * Jokes based on stereotypes associated with people of religion (e.g.
       nun jokes, priest jokes, or rabbi jokes)
     * Jokes on classical religious subjects: crucifixion, Adam and Eve,
       St. Peter at The Gates, etc.
     * Jokes that collide different religious denominations: "A rabbi, a
       medicine man, and a pastor went fishing..."
     * Letters and addresses to God.

   Self-deprecating or self-effacing humour is superficially similar to
   racial and stereotype jokes, but involves the targets laughing at
   themselves. It is said to maintain a sense of perspective and to be
   powerful in defusing confrontations. A common example is Jewish humour.
   A similar situation exists in the Scandinavian "Ole and Lena" joke.

   Self-deprecating humour has also been used by politicians, who
   recognise its ability to acknowledge controversial issues and steal the
   punch of criticism.^[citation needed] For example, when Abraham Lincoln
   was accused of being two-faced he replied, "If I had two faces, do you
   think this is the one I’d be wearing?".

   Dirty jokes are based on taboo, often sexual, content or vocabulary.
   The definitive studies on them have been written by Gershon Legman.

   Other taboos are challenged by sick jokes and gallows humour, and to
   joke about disability is considered in this group.^[citation needed]

   Surrealist or minimalist jokes exploit semantic inconsistency, for
   example: Q: What's red and invisible? A: No tomatoes..^[citation
   needed]

   Anti-jokes are jokes that are not funny in regular sense, and often can
   be decidedly unfunny, but rely on the let-down from the expected joke
   to be funny in itself.^[citation needed]

   An elephant joke is a joke, almost always a riddle or conundrum and
   often a sequence of connected riddles, frequently operating on a
   surrealistic, anti-humorous or meta-humorous level, that involves an
   elephant.

   Jokes involving non-sequitur humour, with parts of the joke being
   unrelated to each other; e.g. "My uncle once punched a man so hard his
   legs became trombones", from The Mighty Boosh TV series.

   Dark humour is often used in order to deal with a difficult situation
   in a manner of "if you can laugh at it, it won't kill you". Usually
   those jokes make fun of tragedies like death, accidents, wars,
   catastrophes or injuries.

[edit] Styles

   The question/answer joke, sometimes posed as a common riddle, has a
   supposedly straight question and an answer which is twisted for
   humorous effect; puns are often employed. Of this type are knock-knock
   joke, light bulb joke, the many variations on "why did the chicken
   cross the road?", and the class of "What's the difference between a
   _______ and a ______" joke, where the punch line is often a pun or a
   spoonerism linking two apparently entirely unconnected concepts.

   Some jokes require a double act, where one respondent (usually the
   straight man) can be relied on to give the correct response to the
   person telling the joke. This is more common in performance than
   informal joke-telling.

   A shaggy dog story is an extremely long and involved joke with an
   intentionally weak or completely non-existent punchline. The humour
   lies in building up the audience's anticipation and then letting them
   down completely. The longer the story can continue without the audience
   realising it is a joke, and not a serious anecdote, the more successful
   it is.

The world's oldest jokes revealed by university research

Academics have unearthed what they believe to be Britain’s oldest joke, a
1,000-year-old double-entendre about men’s sexual desire.

   The Exeter Codex which is kept in Exeter Cathedral library
   Researchers found examples of double-entendres buried in the Codex
   Exoniensis, a 10th century book of Anglo-Saxon poetry held at Exeter

   They found the wry observation in the Codex Exoniensis, a 10th century
   book of Anglo-Saxon poetry held at Exeter Cathedral.

   It reads: “What hangs at a man’s thigh and wants to poke the hole that
   it’s often poked before?’ Answer: A key.”

   Scouring ancient texts, researchers from Wolverhampton University found
   the jokes laid down in delicate manuscripts and carved into stone
   tablets up to three thousand years old.

   Dr Paul MacDonald, a comic novelist and lecturer in creative writing,
   said ancient civilizations laughed about much the same things as we do
   today.

   He said jokes ancient and modern shared “a willingness to deal with
   taboos and a degree of rebellion.”

     * What is the greatest joke ever told?
       01 Aug 2008

   “Modern puns, Essex girl jokes and toilet humour can all be traced back
   to the very earliest jokes identified in this research,” he commented.

   Lost civilisations laughed at farts, sex, and "stupid people" just as
   we do today, Dr McDonald said.

   But they found evidence that Egyptians were laughing at much the same
   thing.

   "Man is even more eager to copulate than a donkey - his purse is what
   restrains him," reads an Egyptian hieroglyphic from a period that
   pre-dates Christ.

   The study, for a digital television channel, took Dr McDonald and a
   five-strong team of scholars more than three months to complete.

   They trawled the internet, contacted dozens of museums, and spoke to
   numerous private book collectors in a bid to track down modern,
   interpreted versions of the world's oldest texts.

   The team then read the texts to find hidden jokes, double-entendres or
   funny riddles.

   Dr McDonald said only those jokes that were amusing in an historical
   and modern context were included in the list.

   Dr McDonald, a comic novelist and a senior lecturer in creative
   writing, added: "We began with the assumption that the oldest forms of
   jokes just would not have modern day appeal, but a lot of them do.

   The world's oldest surviving joke "is essentially a fart gag", he said.

   The 3,000-year-old Sumerian proverb, from ancient Babylonia, reads:
   "Something which has never occurred since time immemorial; a young
   woman did not fart in her husband's lap."

   The joke has echoes of actor John Barrymore's quip: "Love is the
   delightful interval between meeting a beautiful girl and discovering
   that she looks like a haddock."

   Dr McDonald commented: "Toilet humour goes back just about as far as we
   can go."

   Steve North, from Dave television, said: "What is interesting about
   these ancient jokes is that they feature the same old stand up comedy
   subjects: relationships, toilet humour and sex jokes.

   "The delivery may be different, but the subject matter hasn't changed a
   bit."

What is the greatest joke ever told?

Academics have unearthed what they believe to be the world's oldest jokes and
concluded that humour has changed very little. Human beings have always
laughed at farts, sex, and "stupid people" just as we do today, said Dr Paul
McDonald from Wolverhampton University.

   Comments Comments

   Britain's "oldest joke", discovered in the Codex Exoniensis, a 10th
   century book of Anglo-Saxon poetry held at Exeter Cathedral, reads:
   "What hangs at a man's thigh and wants to poke the hole that it's often
   poked before?' Answer: A key."

   Egyptians were telling jokes even earlier, according to researchers.
   One gag, which pre-dates Christ, reads: "Something which has never
   occurred since time immemorial: a young woman did not fart in her
   husband's lap".

   Is a gag's content most important or its delivery?

   Have any jokes offended you? Or shouldn't humour be taken too
   seriously?

Dead Parrot sketch is 1,600 years old

It's long been held that the old jokes are the best jokes - and Monty
Python's Dead Parrot sketch is no different.

   Monty Python's 'Dead Parrot sketch' - which featured John Cleese
   (pictured) - is some 1,600 years old

   A classic scholar has proved the point, by unearthing a Greek version
   of the world-famous piece that is some 1,600 years old.

   A comedy duo called Hierocles and Philagrius told the original version,
   only rather than a parrot they used a slave.

   It concerns a man who complains to his friend that he was sold a slave
   who dies in his service.

   His companion replies: "When he was with me, he never did any such
   thing!"

   The joke was discovered in a collection of 265 jokes called Philogelos:
   The Laugh Addict, which dates from the fourth century AD.

   Hierocles had gone to meet his maker, and Philagrius had certainly
   ceased to be, long before John Cleese and Michael Palin reinvented the
   yarn in 1969.

   Their version featured Cleese as an exasperated customer trying to get
   his money back from Palin's stubborn pet salesman.

   Cleese's character becomes increasingly frustrated as he fails to
   convince the shopkeeper that the 'Norwegian Blue' is dead.

   The manuscripts from the Greek joke book have now been published in an
   online book, featuring former Bullseye presenter and comic Jim Bowen
   presenting them to a modern audience.

   Mr Bowen said: "One or two of them are jokes I've seen in people's acts
   nowadays, slightly updated.

   "They put in a motor car instead of a chariot - some of them are Tommy
   Cooper-esque."

   Jokes about wives, it seems, have always been fair game.

   One joke goes: "A man tells a well-known wit: 'I had your wife, without
   paying a penny'. The husband replies: "It's my duty as a husband to
   couple with such a monstrosity. What made you do it?"

   The book was translated by William Berg, an American classics
   professor.

Listen to Episode 11: Tim Vine, Adam Hills and Black Beauty. He's a dark
horse

   Ben and Tim Vine

   Blimey, is it that time of the week again already? These things seem to
   come round quicker than a Kim Kardashian divorce, but I’ve checked the
   diary and despite the horological Gods trying to fool us by putting the
   clocks back, it’s definitely the blogging hour.

   Despite the aforementioned tragic demise of Ms Kardashian’s nuptials,
   and with it the undermining of the sanctity of marriage itself, this
   week’s episode has risen like a phoenix from Kim’s smouldering confetti
   ashes. And stoking those flames is a man who, if comics were motorways
   would be the MPun, Mr. Tim Vine.
   Now, previous listeners and those who know me will be well aware of my
   deep seated dislike of puns and wordplay in general, arising from an
   unpleasant incident whereby I was mauled by a particularly vicious
   one-liner as a child (@Pronger69 could be very cruel). Those who know
   me will also know that the previous sentence is complete bunkum (apart
   from the bit about my dad) and there is literally NOTHING I like better
   than a cheeky witticism, or in this case, a veritable barrage of them.
   And when I say literally, I mean literally. I have in the past been
   known to give up food in favour of dining solely on the delicious jokes
   found on the back of Penguin wrappers, occasionally licking the
   chocolate off the other side for sustenance when absolutely necessary.
   Fortunately, Tim, the nation’s foremost machine punner, was more than
   happy to feed my insatiable appetite, and with me offering verbal hors
   d’oeuvres as well we were soon talking almost exclusively in witty
   riddles, or whittles. Which is coincidental, as Whittle is also the
   name of Tim’s fondly remembered Channel 5 game show from the mid-90s, a
   subject we discussed with glee. And I don’t mean the Amreican high
   school musical drama series, Tim has not appeared on that as yet.
   Ben and Adam Hills

   Someone else who hasn’t been on Glee is this week’s other guest Adam
   Hills, though with his ever-growing international renown it’s surely
   only a matter of time. Fortunately, all this high praise hadn’t gone to
   Adam’s head and we were able to spend a very pleasant morning sat on a
   park bench, discussing all manner of life’s trifling details. It almost
   seemed a shame to have to shove microphones under our noses and record
   the damn thing, but shove we must.
   And with the word shove still ringing in your ears and maybe other
   orifices too, it’s time to once again bid you adieu.

Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of Comic

II

   There may be something artificial in making a special category for the
   comic in words, since most of the varieties of the comic that we have
   examined so far were produced through the medium of language. We must
   make a distinction, however, between the comic EXPRESSED and the comic
   CREATED by language. The former could, if necessary, be translated from
   one language into another, though at the cost of losing the greater
   portion of its significance when introduced into a fresh society
   different in manners, in literature, and above all in association of
   ideas. But it is generally impossible to translate the latter. It owes
   its entire being to the structure of the sentence or to the choice of
   the words. It does not set forth, by means of language, special cases
   of absentmindedness in man or in events. It lays stress on lapses of
   attention in language itself. In this case, it is language itself that
   becomes comic.

   Comic sayings, however, are not a matter of spontaneous generation; if
   we laugh at them, we are equally entitled to laugh at their author.
   This latter condition, however, is not indispensable, since the saying
   or expression has a comic virtue of its own. This is proved by the fact
   that we find it very difficult, in the majority of these cases, to say
   whom we are laughing at, although at times we have a dim, vague feeling
   that there is some one in the background.

   Moreover, the person implicated is not always the speaker. Here it
   seems as though we should draw an important distinction between the
   WITTY (SPIRITUEL) and the COMIC. A word is said to be comic when it
   makes us laugh at the person who utters it, and witty when it makes us
   laugh either at a third party or at ourselves. But in most cases we can
   hardly make up our minds whether the word is comic or witty. All that
   we can say is that it is laughable.

   Before proceeding, it might be well to examine more closely what is
   meant by ESPRIT. A witty saying makes us at least smile; consequently,
   no investigation into laughter would be complete did it not get to the
   bottom of the nature of wit and throw light on the underlying idea. It
   is to be feared, however, that this extremely subtle essence is one
   that evaporates when exposed to the light.

   Let us first make a distinction between the two meanings of the word
   wit ESPRIT, the broader one and the more restricted. In the broader
   meaning of the word, it would seem that what is called wit is a certain
   DRAMATIC way of thinking. Instead of treating his ideas as mere
   symbols, the wit sees them, he hears them and, above all, makes them
   converse with one another like persons. He puts them on the stage, and
   himself, to some extent, into the bargain. A witty nation is, of
   necessity, a nation enamoured of the theatre. In every wit there is
   something of a poet--just as in every good reader there is the making
   of an actor. This comparison is made purposely, because a proportion
   might easily be established between the four terms. In order to read
   well we need only the intellectual side of the actor's art; but in
   order to act well one must be an actor in all one's soul and body. In
   just the same way, poetic creation calls for some degree of
   self-forgetfulness, whilst the wit does not usually err in this
   respect. We always get a glimpse of the latter behind what he says and
   does. He is not wholly engrossed in the business, because he only
   brings his intelligence into play. So any poet may reveal himself as a
   wit when he pleases. To do this there will be no need for him to
   acquire anything; it seems rather as though he would have to give up
   something. He would simply have to let his ideas hold converse with one
   another "for nothing, for the mere joy of the thing!" [Footnote: "Pour
   rien, pour le plaisir" is a quotation from Victor Hugo's Marion
   Delorme] He would only have to unfasten the double bond which keeps his
   ideas in touch with his feelings and his soul in touch with life. In
   short, he would turn into a wit by simply resolving to be no longer a
   poet in feeling, but only in intelligence.

   But if wit consists, for the most part, in seeing things SUB SPECIE
   THEATRI, it is evidently capable of being specially directed to one
   variety of dramatic art, namely, comedy. Here we have a more restricted
   meaning of the term, and, moreover, the only one that interests us from
   the point of view of the theory of laughter. What is here called WIT is
   a gift for dashing off comic scenes in a few strokes--dashing them off,
   however, so subtly, delicately and rapidly, that all is over as soon as
   we begin to notice them.

   Who are the actors in these scenes? With whom has the wit to deal?
   First of all, with his interlocutors themselves, when his witticism is
   a direct retort to one of them. Often with an absent person whom he
   supposes to have spoken and to whom he is replying. Still oftener, with
   the whole world,--in the ordinary meaning of the term,--which he takes
   to task, twisting a current idea into a paradox, or making use of a
   hackneyed phrase, or parodying some quotation or proverb. If we compare
   these scenes in miniature with one another, we find they are almost
   always variations of a comic theme with which we are well acquainted,
   that of the "robber robbed." You take up a metaphor, a phrase, an
   argument, and turn it against the man who is, or might be, its author,
   so that he is made to say what he did not mean to say and lets himself
   be caught, to some extent, in the toils of language. But the theme of
   the "robber robbed" is not the only possible one. We have gone over
   many varieties of the comic, and there is not one of them that is
   incapable of being volatilised into a witticism.

   Every witty remark, then, lends itself to an analysis, whose chemical
   formula, so to say, we are now in a position to state. It runs as
   follows: Take the remark, first enlarge it into a regular scene, then
   find out the category of the comic to which the scene evidently
   belongs: by this means you reduce the witty remark to its simplest
   elements and obtain a full explanation of it.

   Let us apply this method to a classic example. "Your chest hurts me"
   (J'AI MAL A VOTRE POITRINE) wrote Mme. de Sevigne to her ailing
   daughter--clearly a witty saying. If our theory is correct, we need
   only lay stress upon the saying, enlarge and magnify it, and we shall
   see it expand into a comic scene. Now, we find this very scene, ready
   made, in the AMOUR MEDECIN of Moliere. The sham doctor, Clitandre, who
   has been summoned to attend Sganarelle's daughter, contents himself
   with feeling Sganarelle's own pulse, whereupon, relying on the sympathy
   there must be between father and daughter, he unhesitatingly concludes:
   "Your daughter is very ill!" Here we have the transition from the witty
   to the comical. To complete our analysis, then, all we have to do is to
   discover what there is comical in the idea of giving a diagnosis of the
   child after sounding the father or the mother. Well, we know that one
   essential form of comic fancy lies in picturing to ourselves a living
   person as a kind of jointed dancing-doll, and that frequently, with the
   object of inducing us to form this mental picture, we are shown two or
   more persons speaking and acting as though attached to one another by
   invisible strings. Is not this the idea here suggested when we are led
   to materialise, so to speak, the sympathy we postulate as existing
   between father and daughter?

   We now see how it is that writers on wit have perforce confined
   themselves to commenting on the extraordinary complexity of the things
   denoted by the term without ever succeeding in defining it. There are
   many ways of being witty, almost as many as there are of being the
   reverse. How can we detect what they have in common with one another,
   unless we first determine the general relationship between the witty
   and the comic? Once, however, this relationship is cleared up,
   everything is plain sailing. We then find the same connection between
   the comic and the witty as exists between a regular scene and the
   fugitive suggestion of a possible one. Hence, however numerous the
   forms assumed by the comic, wit will possess an equal number of
   corresponding varieties. So that the comic, in all its forms, is what
   should be defined first, by discovering (a task which is already quite
   difficult enough) the clue that leads from one form to the other. By
   that very operation wit will have been analysed, and will then appear
   as nothing more than the comic in a highly volatile state. To follow
   the opposite plan, however, and attempt directly to evolve a formula
   for wit, would be courting certain failure. What should we think of a
   chemist who, having ever so many jars of a certain substance in his
   laboratory, would prefer getting that substance from the atmosphere, in
   which merely infinitesimal traces of its vapour are to be found?

   But this comparison between the witty and the comic is also indicative
   of the line we must take in studying the comic in words. On the one
   hand, indeed, we find there is no essential difference between a word
   that is comic and one that is witty; on the other hand, the latter,
   although connected with a figure of speech, invariably calls up the
   image, dim or distinct, of a comic scene. This amounts to saying that
   the comic in speech should correspond, point by point, with the comic
   in actions and in situations, and is nothing more, if one may so
   express oneself, than their projection on to the plane of words. So let
   us return to the comic in actions and in situations, consider the chief
   methods by which it is obtained, and apply them to the choice of words
   and the building up of sentences. We shall thus have every possible
   form of the comic in words as well as every variety of wit.

   1. Inadvertently to say or do what we have no intention of saying or
   doing, as a result of inelasticity or momentum, is, as we are aware,
   one of the main sources of the comic. Thus, absentmindedness is
   essentially laughable, and so we laugh at anything rigid, ready- made,
   mechanical in gesture, attitude and even facial expression. Do we find
   this kind of rigidity in language also? No doubt we do, since language
   contains ready-made formulas and stereotyped phrases. The man who
   always expressed himself in such terms would invariably be comic. But
   if an isolated phrase is to be comic in itself, when once separated
   from the person who utters it, it must be something more than
   ready-made, it must bear within itself some sign which tells us, beyond
   the possibility of doubt, that it was uttered automatically. This can
   only happen when the phrase embodies some evident absurdity, either a
   palpable error or a contradiction in terms. Hence the following general
   rule: A COMIC MEANING IS INVARIABLY OBTAINED WHEN AN ABSURD IDEA IS
   FITTED INTO A WELL- ESTABLISHED PHRASE-FORM.

   "Ce sabre est le plus beau jour de ma vie," said M. Prudhomme.
   Translate the phrase into English or German and it becomes purely
   absurd, though it is comic enough in French. The reason is that "le
   plus beau jour de ma vie" is one of those ready-made phrase-endings to
   which a Frenchman's ear is accustomed. To make it comic, then, we need
   only clearly indicate the automatism of the person who utters it. This
   is what we get when we introduce an absurdity into the phrase. Here the
   absurdity is by no means the source of the comic, it is only a very
   simple and effective means of making it obvious.

   We have quoted only one saying of M. Prudhomme, but the majority of
   those attributed to him belong to the same class. M. Prudhomme is a man
   of ready-made phrases. And as there are ready-made phrases in all
   languages, M. Prudhomme is always capable of being transposed, though
   seldom of being translated. At times the commonplace phrase, under
   cover of which the absurdity slips in, is not so readily noticeable. "I
   don't like working between meals," said a lazy lout. There would be
   nothing amusing in the saying did there not exist that salutary precept
   in the realm of hygiene: "One should not eat between meals."

   Sometimes, too, the effect is a complicated one. Instead of one
   commonplace phrase-form, there are two or three which are dovetailed
   into each other. Take, for instance, the remark of one of the
   characters in a play by Labiche, "Only God has the right to kill His
   fellow-creature." It would seem that advantage is here taken of two
   separate familiar sayings; "It is God who disposes of the lives of
   men," and, "It is criminal for a man to kill his fellow-creature." But
   the two sayings are combined so as to deceive the ear and leave the
   impression of being one of those hackneyed sentences that are accepted
   as a matter of course. Hence our attention nods, until we are suddenly
   aroused by the absurdity of the meaning. These examples suffice to show
   how one of the most important types of the comic can be projected--in a
   simplified form--on the plane of speech. We will now proceed to a form
   which is not so general.

   2. "We laugh if our attention is diverted to the physical in a person
   when it is the moral that is in question," is a law we laid down in the
   first part of this work. Let us apply it to language. Most words might
   be said to have a PHYSICAL and a MORAL meaning, according as they are
   interpreted literally or figuratively. Every word, indeed, begins by
   denoting a concrete object or a material action; but by degrees the
   meaning of the word is refined into an abstract relation or a pure
   idea. If, then, the above law holds good here, it should be stated as
   follows: "A comic effect is obtained whenever we pretend to take
   literally an expression which was used figuratively"; or, "Once our
   attention is fixed on the material aspect of a metaphor, the idea
   expressed becomes comic."

   In the phrase, "Tous les arts sont freres" (all the arts are brothers),
   the word "frere" (brother) is used metaphorically to indicate a more or
   less striking resemblance. The word is so often used in this way, that
   when we hear it we do not think of the concrete, the material
   connection implied in every relationship. We should notice it more if
   we were told that "Tous les arts sont cousins," for the word "cousin"
   is not so often employed in a figurative sense; that is why the word
   here already assumes a slight tinge of the comic. But let us go further
   still, and suppose that our attention is attracted to the material side
   of the metaphor by the choice of a relationship which is incompatible
   with the gender of the two words composing the metaphorical expression:
   we get a laughable result. Such is the well-known saying, also
   attributed to M. Prudhomme, "Tous les arts (masculine) sont soeurs
   (feminine)." "He is always running after a joke," was said in
   Boufflers' presence regarding a very conceited fellow. Had Boufflers
   replied, "He won't catch it," that would have been the beginning of a
   witty saying, though nothing more than the beginning, for the word
   "catch" is interpreted figuratively almost as often as the word "run";
   nor does it compel us more strongly than the latter to materialise the
   image of two runners, the one at the heels of the other. In order that
   the rejoinder may appear to be a thoroughly witty one, we must borrow
   from the language of sport an expression so vivid and concrete that we
   cannot refrain from witnessing the race in good earnest. This is what
   Boufflers does when he retorts, "I'll back the joke!"

   We said that wit often consists in extending the idea of one's
   interlocutor to the point of making him express the opposite of what he
   thinks and getting him, so to say, entrapt by his own words. We must
   now add that this trap is almost always some metaphor or comparison the
   concrete aspect of which is turned against him. You may remember the
   dialogue between a mother and her son in the Faux Bonshommes: "My dear
   boy, gambling on 'Change is very risky. You win one day and lose the
   next."--"Well, then, I will gamble only every other day." In the same
   play too we find the following edifying conversation between two
   company-promoters: "Is this a very honourable thing we are doing? These
   unfortunate shareholders, you see, we are taking the money out of their
   very pockets...."--"Well, out of what do you expect us to take it?"

   An amusing result is likewise obtainable whenever a symbol or an emblem
   is expanded on its concrete side, and a pretence is made of retaining
   the same symbolical value for this expansion as for the emblem itself.
   In a very lively comedy we are introduced to a Monte Carlo official,
   whose uniform is covered with medals, although he has only received a
   single decoration. "You see, I staked my medal on a number at
   roulette," he said, "and as the number turned up, I was entitled to
   thirty-six times my stake." This reasoning is very similar to that
   offered by Giboyer in the Effrontes. Criticism is made of a bride of
   forty summers who is wearing orange-blossoms with her wedding costume:
   "Why, she was entitled to oranges, let alone orange-blossoms!" remarked
   Giboyer.

   But we should never cease were we to take one by one all the laws we
   have stated, and try to prove them on what we have called the plane of
   language. We had better confine ourselves to the three general
   propositions of the preceding section. We have shown that "series of
   events" may become comic either by repetition, by inversion, or by
   reciprocal interference. Now we shall see that this is also the case
   with series of words.

   To take series of events and repeat them in another key or another
   environment, or to invert them whilst still leaving them a certain
   meaning, or mix them up so that their respective meanings jostle one
   another, is invariably comic, as we have already said, for it is
   getting life to submit to be treated as a machine. But thought, too, is
   a living thing. And language, the translation of thought, should be
   just as living. We may thus surmise that a phrase is likely to become
   comic if, though reversed, it still makes sense, or if it expresses
   equally well two quite independent sets of ideas, or, finally, if it
   has been obtained by transposing an idea into some key other than its
   own. Such, indeed, are the three fundamental laws of what might be
   called THE COMIC TRANSFORMATION OF SENTENCES, as we shall show by a few
   examples.

   Let it first be said that these three laws are far from being of equal
   importance as regards the theory of the ludicrous. INVERSION is the
   least interesting of the three. It must be easy of application,
   however, for it is noticeable that, no sooner do professional wits hear
   a sentence spoken than they experiment to see if a meaning cannot be
   obtained by reversing it,--by putting, for instance, the subject in
   place of the object, and the object in place of the subject. It is not
   unusual for this device to be employed for refuting an idea in more or
   less humorous terms. One of the characters in a comedy of Labiche
   shouts out to his neighbour on the floor above, who is in the habit of
   dirtying his balcony, "What do you mean by emptying your pipe on to my
   terrace?" The neighbour retorts, "What do you mean by putting your
   terrace under my pipe?" There is no necessity to dwell upon this kind
   of wit, instances of which could easily be multiplied. The RECIPROCAL
   INTERFERENCE of two sets of ideas in the same sentence is an
   inexhaustible source of amusing varieties. There are many ways of
   bringing about this interference, I mean of bracketing in the same
   expression two independent meanings that apparently tally. The least
   reputable of these ways is the pun. In the pun, the same sentence
   appears to offer two independent meanings, but it is only an
   appearance; in reality there are two different sentences made up of
   different words, but claiming to be one and the same because both have
   the same sound. We pass from the pun, by imperceptible stages, to the
   true play upon words. Here there is really one and the same sentence
   through which two different sets of ideas are expressed, and we are
   confronted with only one series of words; but advantage is taken of the
   different meanings a word may have, especially when used figuratively
   instead of literally. So that in fact there is often only a slight
   difference between the play upon words on the one hand, and a poetic
   metaphor or an illuminating comparison on the other. Whereas an
   illuminating comparison and a striking image always seem to reveal the
   close harmony that exists between language and nature, regarded as two
   parallel forms of life, the play upon words makes us think somehow of a
   negligence on the part of language, which, for the time being, seems to
   have forgotten its real function and now claims to accommodate things
   to itself instead of accommodating itself to things. And so the play
   upon words always betrays a momentary LAPSE OF ATTENTION in language,
   and it is precisely on that account that it is amusing.

   INVERSION and RECIPROCAL INTERFERENCE, after all, are only a certain
   playfulness of the mind which ends at playing upon words. The comic in
   TRANSPOSITION is much more far-reaching. Indeed, transposition is to
   ordinary language what repetition is to comedy.

   We said that repetition is the favourite method of classic comedy. It
   consists in so arranging events that a scene is reproduced either
   between the same characters under fresh circumstances or between fresh
   characters under the same circumstances. Thus we have, repeated by
   lackeys in less dignified language, a scene already played by their
   masters. Now, imagine ideas expressed in suitable style and thus placed
   in the setting of their natural environment. If you think of some
   arrangement whereby they are transferred to fresh surroundings, while
   maintaining their mutual relations, or, in other words, if you can
   induce them to express themselves in an altogether different style and
   to transpose themselves into another key, you will have language itself
   playing a comedy--language itself made comic. There will be no need,
   moreover, actually to set before us both expressions of the same ideas,
   the transposed expression and the natural one. For we are acquainted
   with the natural one--the one which we should have chosen
   instinctively. So it will be enough if the effort of comic invention
   bears on the other, and on the other alone. No sooner is the second set
   before us than we spontaneously supply the first. Hence the following
   general rule: A COMIC EFFECT IS ALWAYS OBTAINABLE BY TRANSPOSING THE
   NATURE EXPRESSION OF AN IDEA INTO ANOTHER KEY.

   The means of transposition are so many and varied, language affords so
   rich a continuity of themes and the comic is here capable of passing
   through so great a number of stages, from the most insipid buffoonery
   up to the loftiest forms of humour and irony, that we shall forego the
   attempt to make out a complete list. Having stated the rule, we will
   simply, here and there, verify its main applications.

   In the first place, we may distinguish two keys at the extreme ends of
   the scale, the solemn and the familiar. The most obvious effects are
   obtained by merely transposing the one into the other, which thus
   provides us with two opposite currents of comic fancy.

   Transpose the solemn into the familiar and the result is parody. The
   effect of parody, thus defined, extends to instances in which the idea
   expressed in familiar terms is one that, if only in deference to
   custom, ought to be pitched in another key. Take as an example the
   following description of the dawn, quoted by Jean Paul Richter: "The
   sky was beginning to change from black to red, like a lobster being
   boiled." Note that the expression of old-world matters in terms of
   modern life produces the same effect, by reason of the halo of poetry
   which surrounds classical antiquity.

   It is doubtless the comic in parody that has suggested to some
   philosophers, and in particular to Alexander Bain, the idea of defining
   the comic, in general, as a species of DEGRADATION. They describe the
   laughable as causing something to appear mean that was formerly
   dignified. But if our analysis is correct, degradation is only one form
   of transposition, and transposition itself only one of the means of
   obtaining laughter. There is a host of others, and the source of
   laughter must be sought for much further back. Moreover, without going
   so far, we see that while the transposition from solemn to trivial,
   from better to worse, is comic, the inverse transposition may be even
   more so.

   It is met with as often as the other, and, apparently, we may
   distinguish two main forms of it, according as it refers to the
   PHYSICAL DIMENSIONS of an object or to its MORAL VALUE.

   To speak of small things as though they were large is, in a general
   way, TO EXAGGERATE. Exaggeration is always comic when prolonged, and
   especially when systematic; then, indeed, it appears as one method of
   transposition. It excites so much laughter that some writers have been
   led to define the comic as exaggeration, just as others have defined it
   as degradation. As a matter of fact, exaggeration, like degradation, is
   only one form of one kind of the comic. Still, it is a very striking
   form. It has given birth to the mock-heroic poem, a rather
   old-fashioned device, I admit, though traces of it are still to be
   found in persons inclined to exaggerate methodically. It might often be
   said of braggadocio that it is its mock-heroic aspect which makes us
   laugh.

   Far more artificial, but also far more refined, is the transposition
   upwards from below when applied to the moral value of things, not to
   their physical dimensions. To express in reputable language some
   disreputable idea, to take some scandalous situation, some low-class
   calling or disgraceful behaviour, and describe them in terms of the
   utmost "RESPECTABILITY," is generally comic. The English word is here
   purposely employed, as the practice itself is characteristically
   English. Many instances of it may be found in Dickens and Thackeray,
   and in English literature generally. Let us remark, in passing, that
   the intensity of the effect does not here depend on its length. A word
   is sometimes sufficient, provided it gives us a glimpse of an entire
   system of transposition accepted in certain social circles and reveals,
   as it were, a moral organisation of immorality. Take the following
   remark made by an official to one of his subordinates in a novel of
   Gogol's, "Your peculations are too extensive for an official of your
   rank."

   Summing up the foregoing, then, there are two extreme terms of
   comparison, the very large and the very small, the best and the worst,
   between which transposition may be effected in one direction or the
   other. Now, if the interval be gradually narrowed, the contrast between
   the terms obtained will be less and less violent, and the varieties of
   comic transposition more and more subtle.

   The most common of these contrasts is perhaps that between the real and
   the ideal, between what is and what ought to be. Here again
   transposition may take place in either direction. Sometimes we state
   what ought to be done, and pretend to believe that this is just what is
   actually being done; then we have IRONY. Sometimes, on the contrary, we
   describe with scrupulous minuteness what is being done, and pretend to
   believe that this is just what ought to be done; such is often the
   method of HUMOUR. Humour, thus denned, is the counterpart of irony.
   Both are forms of satire, but irony is oratorical in its nature, whilst
   humour partakes of the scientific. Irony is emphasised the higher we
   allow ourselves to be uplifted by the idea of the good that ought to
   be: thus irony may grow so hot within us that it becomes a kind of
   high-pressure eloquence. On the other hand, humour is the more
   emphasised the deeper we go down into an evil that actually is, in
   order t o set down its details in the most cold-blooded indifference.
   Several authors, Jean Paul amongst them, have noticed that humour
   delights in concrete terms, technical details, definite facts. If our
   analysis is correct, this is not an accidental trait of humour, it is
   its very essence. A humorist is a moralist disguised as a scientist,
   something like an anatomist who practises dissection with the sole
   object of filling us with disgust; so that humour, in the restricted
   sense in which we are here regarding the word, is really a
   transposition from the moral to the scientific.

   By still further curtailing the interval between the terms transposed,
   we may now obtain more and more specialised types of comic
   transpositions. Thus, certain professions have a technical vocabulary:
   what a wealth of laughable results have been obtained by transposing
   the ideas of everyday life into this professional jargon! Equally comic
   is the extension of business phraseology to the social relations of
   life,--for instance, the phrase of one of Labiche's characters in
   allusion to an invitation he has received, "Your kindness of the third
   ult.," thus transposing the commercial formula, "Your favour of the
   third instant." This class of the comic, moreover, may attain a special
   profundity of its own when it discloses not merely a professional
   practice, but a fault in character. Recall to mind the scenes in the
   Faux Bonshommes and the Famille Benoiton, where marriage is dealt with
   as a business affair, and matters of sentiment are set down in strictly
   commercial language.

   Here, however, we reach the point at which peculiarities of language
   really express peculiarities of character, a closer investigation of
   which we must hold over to the next chapter. Thus, as might have been
   expected and may be seen from the foregoing, the comic in words follows
   closely on the comic in situation and is finally merged, along with the
   latter, in the comic in character. Language only attains laughable
   results because it is a human product, modelled as exactly as possible
   on the forms of the human mind. We feel it contains some living element
   of our own life; and if this life of language were complete and
   perfect, if there were nothing stereotype in it, if, in short, language
   were an absolutely unified organism incapable of being split up into
   independent organisms, it would evade the comic as would a soul whose
   life was one harmonious whole, unruffled as the calm surface of a
   peaceful lake. There is no pool, however, which has not some dead
   leaves floating on its surface, no human soul upon which there do not
   settle habits that make it rigid against itself by making it rigid
   against others, no language, in short, so subtle and instinct with
   life, so fully alert in each of its parts as to eliminate the
   ready-made and oppose the mechanical operations of inversion,
   transposition, etc., which one would fain perform upon it as on some
   lifeless thing. The rigid, the ready-- made, the mechanical, in
   contrast with the supple, the ever-changing and the living,
   absentmindedness in contrast with attention, in a word, automatism in
   contrast with free activity, such are the defects that laughter singles
   out and would fain correct. We appealed to this idea to give us light
   at the outset, when starting upon the analysis of the ludicrous. We
   have seen it shining at every decisive turning in our road. With its
   help, we shall now enter upon a more important investigation, one that
   will, we hope, be more instructive. We purpose, in short, studying
   comic characters, or rather determining the essential conditions of
   comedy in character, while endeavouring to bring it about that this
   study may contribute to a better understanding of the real nature of
   art and the general relation between art and life.

   George Denis Patrick Carlin (May 12, 1937 – June 22, 2008) was an
   American stand-up comedian, social critic, satirist, actor and
   writer/author, who won five Grammy Awards for his comedy albums.^[23]

   Carlin was noted for his black humor as well as his thoughts on
   politics, the English language, psychology, religion, and various taboo
   subjects. Carlin and his "Seven Dirty Words" comedy routine were
   central to the 1978 U.S. Supreme Court case F.C.C. v. Pacifica
   Foundation, in which a narrow 5–4 decision by the justices affirmed the
   government's power to regulate indecent material on the public
   airwaves.

   The first of his fourteen stand-up comedy specials for HBO was filmed
   in 1977. In the 1990s and 2000s, Carlin's routines focused on
   socio-cultural criticism of modern American society. He often commented
   on contemporary political issues in the United States and satirized the
   excesses of American culture. His final HBO special, It's Bad for Ya,
   was filmed less than four months before his death.

   In 2004, Carlin placed second on the Comedy Central list of the 100
   greatest stand-up comedians of all time, ahead of Lenny Bruce and
   behind Richard Pryor.^[24] He was a frequent performer and guest host
   on The Tonight Show during the three-decade Johnny Carson era, and
   hosted the first episode of Saturday Night Live. In 2008, he was
   awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.

[edit] Early life

   Carlin was born in Manhattan,^[25]^[26] the second son of Mary Beary, a
   secretary, and Patrick Carlin, a national advertising manager for the
   New York Sun.^[27] Carlin was of Irish descent and was raised a Roman
   Catholic.^[28]^[29]^[30]

   Carlin grew up on West 121st Street, in a neighborhood of Manhattan
   which he later said, in a stand-up routine, he and his friends called
   "White Harlem", because that sounded a lot tougher than its real name
   of Morningside Heights. He was raised by his mother, who left his
   father when Carlin was two months old.^[31] He attended Corpus Christi
   School, a Roman Catholic parish school of the Corpus Christi Church, in
   Morningside Heights.^[32]^[33] After three semesters, at the age of 15,
   Carlin involuntarily left Cardinal Hayes High School and briefly
   attended Bishop Dubois High School in Harlem.^[34] Carlin had a
   difficult relationship with his mother and often ran away from
   home.^[2] He later joined the United States Air Force and was trained
   as a radar technician. He was stationed at Barksdale Air Force Base in
   Bossier City, Louisiana.

   During this time he began working as a disc jockey at radio station
   KJOE, in the nearby city of Shreveport. He did not complete his Air
   Force enlistment. Labeled an "unproductive airman" by his superiors,
   Carlin was discharged on July 29, 1957.

[edit] Career

   In 1959, Carlin and Jack Burns began as a comedy team when both were
   working for radio station KXOL in Fort Worth, Texas.^[35] After
   successful performances at Fort Worth's beat coffeehouse, The Cellar,
   Burns and Carlin headed for California in February 1960 and stayed
   together for two years as a team before moving on to individual
   pursuits.

[edit] 1960s

   Within weeks of arriving in California in 1960, Burns and Carlin put
   together an audition tape and created The Wright Brothers, a morning
   show on KDAY in Hollywood. The comedy team worked there for three
   months, honing their material in beatnik coffeehouses at night.^[36]
   Years later when he was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of
   Fame, Carlin requested that it be placed in front of the KDAY studios
   near the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street.^[37] Burns and
   Carlin recorded their only album, Burns and Carlin at the Playboy Club
   Tonight, in May 1960 at Cosmo Alley in Hollywood.^[36]

   In the 1960s, Carlin began appearing on television variety shows,
   notably The Ed Sullivan Show and The Tonight Show. His most famous
   routines were:
     * The Indian Sergeant ("You wit' the beads... get outta line")
     * Stupid disc jockeys ("Wonderful WINO...")—"The Beatles' latest
       record, when played backwards at slow speed, says 'Dummy! You're
       playing it backwards at slow speed!'"
     * Al Sleet, the "hippie-dippie weatherman"—"Tonight's forecast: Dark.
       Continued dark throughout most of the evening, with some widely
       scattered light towards morning."
     * Jon Carson—the "world never known, and never to be known"

   Variations on the first three of these routines appear on Carlin's 1967
   debut album, Take Offs and Put Ons, recorded live in 1966 at The
   Roostertail in Detroit, Michigan.^[38]
   Carlin with singer Buddy Greco in Away We Go. The summer replacement
   show also starred drummer Buddy Rich.

   During this period, Carlin became more popular as a frequent performer
   and guest host on The Tonight Show, initially with Jack Paar as host,
   then with Johnny Carson. Carlin became one of Carson's most frequent
   substitutes during the host's three-decade reign. Carlin was also cast
   in Away We Go, a 1967 comedy show that aired on CBS.^[39] His material
   during his early career and his appearance, which consisted of suits
   and short-cropped hair, had been seen as "conventional," particularly
   when contrasted with his later anti-establishment material.^[40]

   Carlin was present at Lenny Bruce's arrest for obscenity. As the police
   began attempting to detain members of the audience for questioning,
   they asked Carlin for his identification. Telling the police he did not
   believe in government-issued IDs, he was arrested and taken to jail
   with Bruce in the same vehicle.^[41]

[edit] 1970s

   Eventually, Carlin changed both his routines and his appearance. He
   lost some TV bookings by dressing strangely for a comedian of the time,
   wearing faded jeans and sporting long hair, a beard, and earrings at a
   time when clean-cut, well-dressed comedians were the norm. Using his
   own persona as a springboard for his new comedy, he was presented by Ed
   Sullivan in a performance of "The Hair Piece" and quickly regained his
   popularity as the public caught on to his sense of style. In this
   period he also perfected what is perhaps his best-known routine, "Seven
   Words You Can Never Say on Television", recorded on Class Clown. Carlin
   was arrested on July 21, 1972, at Milwaukee's Summerfest and charged
   with violating obscenity laws after performing this routine.^[42] The
   case, which prompted Carlin to refer to the words for a time as "the
   Milwaukee Seven," was dismissed in December of that year; the judge
   declared that the language was indecent but Carlin had the freedom to
   say it as long as he caused no disturbance. In 1973, a man complained
   to the Federal Communications Commission after listening with his son
   to a similar routine, "Filthy Words", from Occupation: Foole, broadcast
   one afternoon over WBAI, a Pacifica Foundation FM radio station in New
   York City. Pacifica received a citation from the FCC that sought to
   fine the company for violating FCC regulations that prohibited
   broadcasting "obscene" material. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the FCC
   action by a vote of 5 to 4, ruling that the routine was "indecent but
   not obscene" and that the FCC had authority to prohibit such broadcasts
   during hours when children were likely to be among the audience.
   (F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978). The court
   documents contain a complete transcript of the routine.)^[43]
   “ Shit, Piss, Fuck, Cunt, Cocksucker, Motherfucker, and Tits. Those are
     the heavy seven. Those are the ones that'll infect your soul, curve
     your spine and keep the country from winning the war.                  ”

   —George Carlin, Class Clown, "Seven Words You Can Never Say on
   Television"

   The controversy only increased Carlin's fame. Carlin eventually
   expanded the dirty-words theme with a seemingly interminable end to a
   performance (ending with his voice fading out in one HBO version and
   accompanying the credits in the Carlin at Carnegie special for the
   1982-83 season) and a set of 49 web pages^[44] organized by subject and
   embracing his "Incomplete List Of Impolite Words."

   It was on-stage during a rendition of his "Dirty Words" routine that
   Carlin learned that his previous comedy album FM & AM had won the
   Grammy. Midway through the performance on the album Occupation: Foole,
   he can be heard thanking someone for handing him a piece of paper. He
   then exclaims "Shit!" and proudly announces his win to the audience.

   Carlin hosted the premiere broadcast of NBC's Saturday Night Live, on
   October 11, 1975, the only episode as of at least 2007 in which the
   host had no involvement (at his request) in sketches.^[45] The
   following season, 1976–77, Carlin also appeared regularly on CBS
   Television's Tony Orlando & Dawn variety series.

   Carlin unexpectedly stopped performing regularly in 1976, when his
   career appeared to be at its height. For the next five years, he rarely
   performed stand-up, although it was at this time that he began doing
   specials for HBO as part of its On Location series. He later revealed
   that he had suffered the first of three heart attacks during this
   layoff period.^[5] His first two HBO specials aired in 1977 and 1978.

[edit] 1980s and 1990s

   In 1981, Carlin returned to the stage, releasing A Place For My Stuff
   and returning to HBO and New York City with the Carlin at Carnegie TV
   special, videotaped at Carnegie Hall and airing during the 1982-83
   season. Carlin continued doing HBO specials every year or every other
   year over the following decade and a half. All of Carlin's albums from
   this time forward are from the HBO specials.
   In concert at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

   He hosted SNL for the second time on November 10, 1984, this time
   appearing in several sketches. Carlin's acting career was primed with a
   major supporting role in the 1987 comedy hit Outrageous Fortune,
   starring Bette Midler and Shelley Long; it was his first notable screen
   role after a handful of previous guest roles on television series.
   Playing drifter Frank Madras, the role poked fun at the lingering
   effect of the 1960s counterculture. In 1989, he gained popularity with
   a new generation of teens when he was cast as Rufus, the time-traveling
   mentor of the titular characters in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,
   and reprised his role in the film sequel Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey
   as well as the first season of the cartoon series. In 1991, he provided
   the narrative voice for the American version of the children's show
   Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends, a role he continued until 1998. He
   played "Mr. Conductor" on the PBS children's show Shining Time Station,
   which featured Thomas the Tank Engine from 1991 to 1993, as well as the
   Shining Time Station TV specials in 1995 and Mr. Conductor's Thomas
   Tales in 1996. Also in 1991, Carlin had a major supporting role in the
   movie The Prince of Tides, which starred Nick Nolte and Barbra
   Streisand.

   Carlin began a weekly Fox sitcom, The George Carlin Show, in 1993,
   playing New York City taxicab driver George O'Grady. The show, created
   and written by The Simpsons co-creator Sam Simon, ran 27 episodes
   through December 1995.^[46]

   In his final book, the posthumously published Last Words, Carlin said
   about The George Carlin Show: "I had a great time. I never laughed so
   much, so often, so hard as I did with cast members Alex Rocco, Chris
   Rich, Tony Starke. There was a very strange, very good sense of humor
   on that stage. The biggest problem, though, was that Sam Simon was a
   fucking horrible person to be around. Very, very funny, extremely
   bright and brilliant, but an unhappy person who treated other people
   poorly. I was incredibly happy when the show was canceled. I was
   frustrated that it had taken me away from my true work."^[47]

   In 1997, his first hardcover book, Brain Droppings, was published and
   sold over 750,000 copies as of 2001.^[citation needed] Carlin was
   honored at the 1997 Aspen Comedy Festival with a retrospective, George
   Carlin: 40 Years of Comedy, hosted by Jon Stewart.

   In 1999, Carlin played a supporting role as a satirical Roman Catholic
   cardinal in filmmaker Kevin Smith's movie Dogma. He worked with Smith
   again with a cameo appearance in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and
   later played an atypically serious role in Jersey Girl as the
   blue-collar father of Ben Affleck's character.

[edit] 2000s

   In 2001, Carlin was given a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 15th
   Annual American Comedy Awards. In December 2003, California U.S.
   Representative Doug Ose (Republican), introduced a bill (H.R. 3687) to
   outlaw the broadcast of Carlin's "seven dirty words,"^[48] including
   "compound use (including hyphenated compounds) of such words and
   phrases with each other or with other words or phrases, and other
   grammatical forms of such words and phrases (including verb, adjective,
   gerund, participle, and infinitive forms)." (The bill omits "tits," but
   includes "asshole," which was not part of Carlin's original routine.)
   This bill was never voted on. The last action on this bill was its
   referral to the House Judiciary Committee on the Constitution on
   January 15, 2004.^[48]

   For years, Carlin had performed regularly as a headliner in Las Vegas,
   but in 2005 he was fired from his headlining position at the MGM Grand
   Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, after an altercation with his audience.
   After a poorly received set filled with dark references to suicide
   bombings and beheadings, Carlin stated that he could not wait to get
   out of "this fucking hotel" and Las Vegas, claiming he wanted to go
   back east, "where the real people are." He continued to insult his
   audience, stating:

     People who go to Las Vegas, you've got to question their fucking
     intellect to start with. Traveling hundreds and thousands of miles
     to essentially give your money to a large corporation is kind of
     fucking moronic. That's what I'm always getting here is these kind
     of fucking people with very limited intellects.

   An audience member shouted back that Carlin should "stop degrading us,"
   at which point Carlin responded, "Thank you very much, whatever that
   was. I hope it was positive; if not, well, blow me." He was immediately
   fired by MGM Grand and soon after announced he would enter rehab for
   alcohol and prescription painkiller addiction.^[49]^[50]

   He began a tour through the first half of 2006 following the airing of
   his thirteenth HBO Special on November 5, 2005, entitled Life is Worth
   Losing,^[51] which was shown live from the Beacon Theatre in New York
   City and in which he stated early on: "I've got 341 days of sobriety,"
   referring to the rehab he entered after being fired from MGM. Topics
   covered included suicide, natural disasters (and the impulse to see
   them escalate in severity), cannibalism, genocide, human sacrifice,
   threats to civil liberties in America, and how an argument can be made
   that humans are inferior to other animals.

   On February 1, 2006, during his Life Is Worth Losing set at the Tachi
   Palace Casino in Lemoore, California, Carlin mentioned to the crowd
   that he had been discharged from the hospital only six weeks previously
   for "heart failure" and "pneumonia", citing the appearance as his
   "first show back."

   Carlin provided the voice of Fillmore, a character in the Disney/Pixar
   animated feature Cars, which opened in theaters on June 9, 2006. The
   character Fillmore, who is presented as an anti-establishment hippie,
   is a VW Microbus with a psychedelic paint job whose front license plate
   reads "51237," Carlin's birthday and also the Zip Code for George,
   Iowa. In 2007, Carlin provided the voice of the wizard in Happily
   N'Ever After, along with Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prinze Jr.,
   Andy Dick, and Wallace Shawn, his last film.

   Carlin's last HBO stand-up special, It's Bad for Ya, aired live on
   March 1, 2008, from the Wells Fargo Center for the Arts in Santa Rosa,
   California.^[52] The themes that appeared in this HBO special included
   "American Bullshit," "Rights," "Death," "Old Age," and "Child Rearing."
   In his routine, he brought to light many of the problems facing
   America, and he told his audience to cut through the "bullshit" of the
   world and "enjoy the carnival." Carlin had been working on the new
   material for this HBO special for several months prior in concerts all
   over the country.

[edit] Personal life

   In 1961, Carlin married Brenda Hosbrook (August 5, 1936 - May 11,
   1997), whom he had met while touring the previous year. The couple's
   only child, a daughter named Kelly, was born in 1963.^[53] In 1971,
   George and Brenda renewed their wedding vows in Las Vegas. Brenda died
   of liver cancer a day before Carlin's 60th birthday, in 1997.

   Carlin later married Sally Wade on June 24, 1998, and the marriage
   lasted until his death, two days before their tenth anniversary.^[54]

   Carlin often criticized elections as an illusion of choice.^[55] He
   said the last time he voted was 1972, for George McGovern who ran for
   President against Richard Nixon.^[56]

[edit] Religion

   Although raised in the Roman Catholic faith, which he describes
   anecdotally on the albums FM & AM and Class Clown, religion, God, and
   particularly religious adherents were frequent subjects of criticism in
   Carlin's routines. He described his opinion of the flaws of organized
   religion in interviews and performances, notably with his "Religion"
   and "There Is No God" routines as heard in You Are All Diseased. His
   views on religion are also mentioned in his last HBO stand up show It's
   Bad for Ya where he mocked the traditional swearing on the Bible as
   "bullshit,"^[57] "make believe," and "kids' stuff." In It's Bad for Ya,
   Carlin noted differences in the types of hats religions ban or require
   as part of their practices. He mentions that he would never want to be
   a part of a group that requires or bans the wearing of hats. Carlin
   also joked in his second book, Brain Droppings, that he worshipped the
   Sun, one reason being that he could see it.

[edit] Themes

   Carlin's material falls under one of three self-described categories:
   "the little world" (observational humor), "the big world" (social
   commentary), and the peculiarities of the English language (euphemisms,
   doublespeak, business jargon), all sharing the overall theme of (in his
   words) "humanity's bullshit," which might include murder, genocide,
   war, rape, corruption, religion and other aspects of human
   civilization. He was known for mixing observational humour with larger
   social commentary. His delivery frequently treated these subjects in a
   misanthropic and nihilistic fashion, such as in his statement during
   the Life is Worth Losing show:

     I look at it this way... For centuries now, man has done everything
     he can to destroy, defile, and interfere with nature: clear-cutting
     forests, strip-mining mountains, poisoning the atmosphere,
     over-fishing the oceans, polluting the rivers and lakes, destroying
     wetlands and aquifers... so when nature strikes back, and smacks him
     on the head and kicks him in the nuts, I enjoy that. I have
     absolutely no sympathy for human beings whatsoever. None. And no
     matter what kind of problem humans are facing, whether it's natural
     or man-made, I always hope it gets worse.

   Language was a frequent focus of Carlin's work. Euphemisms that, in his
   view, seek to distort and lie and the use of language he felt was
   pompous, presumptuous, or silly were often the target of Carlin's
   routines. When asked on Inside the Actors Studio what turned him on, he
   responded, "Reading about language." When asked what made him most
   proud about his career, he said the number of his books that have been
   sold, close to a million copies.

   Carlin also gave special attention to prominent topics in American and
   Western Culture, such as obsession with fame and celebrity,
   consumerism, conservative Christianity, political alienation, corporate
   control, hypocrisy, child raising, fast food diet, news stations,
   self-help publications, blind patriotism, sexual taboos, certain uses
   of technology and surveillance, and the pro-life position,^[58] among
   many others.
   George Carlin in Trenton, New Jersey April 4, 2008

   Carlin openly communicated in his shows and in his interviews that his
   purpose for existence was entertainment, that he was "here for the
   show." He professed a hearty schadenfreude in watching the rich
   spectrum of humanity slowly self-destruct, in his estimation, of its
   own design, saying, "When you're born, you get a ticket to the freak
   show. When you're born in America, you get a front-row seat." He
   acknowledged that this is a very selfish thing, especially since he
   included large human catastrophes as entertainment. In his You Are All
   Diseased concert, he elaborated somewhat on this, telling the audience,
   "I have always been willing to put myself at great personal risk for
   the sake of entertainment. And I've always been willing to put you at
   great personal risk, for the same reason!"

   In the same interview, he recounted his experience of a California
   earthquake in the early 1970s, as "[a]n amusement park ride. Really, I
   mean it's such a wonderful thing to realize that you have absolutely no
   control, and to see the dresser move across the bedroom floor
   unassisted is just exciting."

   A routine in Carlin's 1999 HBO special You Are All Diseased focusing on
   airport security leads up to the statement: "Take a fucking chance! Put
   a little fun in your life! Most Americans are soft and frightened and
   unimaginative and they don't realize there's such a thing as dangerous
   fun, and they certainly don't recognize a good show when they see one."

   Along with wordplay and sex jokes, Carlin had always included politics
   as part of his material, but by the mid 1980s he had become a strident
   social critic in both his HBO specials and the book compilations of his
   material, bashing both conservatives and liberals alike. His HBO
   viewers got an especially sharp taste of this in his take on the Ronald
   Reagan administration during the 1988 special What Am I Doing In New
   Jersey?, broadcast live from the Park Theatre in Union City, New
   Jersey.

[edit] Death and legacy

   Carlin had a history of cardiac problems spanning several decades,
   including three heart attacks (in 1978 at age 41, 1982 and 1991), an
   arrhythmia requiring an ablation procedure in 2003, and a significant
   episode of heart failure in late 2005. He twice underwent angioplasty
   to reopen narrowed arteries.^[59] In early 2005 he entered a drug
   rehabilitation facility for treatment of addictions to alcohol and
   Vicodin.^[60]

   On June 22, 2008, Carlin was admitted to Saint John's Health Center in
   Santa Monica after experiencing chest pain, and he died later that day
   of heart failure. He was 71 years old.^[61] His death occurred one week
   after his last performance at The Orleans Hotel and Casino in Las
   Vegas. There were further shows on his itinerary.^[22]^[62]^[63] In
   accordance with his wishes, he was cremated, his ashes scattered, and
   no public or religious services of any kind were held.^[64]^[65]

   In tribute, HBO broadcast eleven of his fourteen HBO specials from June
   25–28, including a twelve-hour marathon block on their HBO Comedy
   channel. NBC scheduled a rerun of the premiere episode of Saturday
   Night Live, which Carlin hosted.^[66]^[67]^[68] Both Sirius Satellite
   Radio's "Raw Dog Comedy" and XM Satellite Radio's "XM Comedy" channels
   ran a memorial marathon of George Carlin recordings the day following
   his death. Larry King devoted his entire June 23 show to a tribute to
   Carlin, featuring interviews with Jerry Seinfeld, Bill Maher, Roseanne
   Barr and Lewis Black, as well as Carlin's daughter Kelly and his
   brother, Patrick.

   On June 24, The New York Times published an op-ed piece on Carlin by
   Seinfeld.^[69] Cartoonist Garry Trudeau paid tribute in his Doonesbury
   comic strip on July 27.^[70]

   Four days before his death, the John F. Kennedy Center for the
   Performing Arts had named Carlin its 2008 Mark Twain Prize for American
   Humor honoree.^[71] The prize was awarded in Washington, D.C. on
   November 10, making Carlin the first posthumous recipient.^[72]
   Comedians honoring him at the ceremony included Jon Stewart, Bill
   Maher, Lily Tomlin (a past Twain Humor Prize winner), Lewis Black,
   Denis Leary, Joan Rivers, and Margaret Cho.

   Louis C. K. dedicated his stand-up special Chewed Up to Carlin, and
   Lewis Black dedicated his entire second season of Root of All Evil to
   him.

   For a number of years, Carlin had been compiling and writing his
   autobiography, to be released in conjunction with a one-man Broadway
   show tentatively titled New York City Boy. After his death Tony Hendra,
   his collaborator on both projects, edited the autobiography for release
   as Last Words (ISBN 1-4391-7295-1). The book, chronicling most of
   Carlin's life and future plans (including the one-man show) was
   published in 2009. The audio edition is narrated by Carlin's brother,
   Patrick.^[73]

   The text of the one-man show is scheduled for publication under the
   title New York Boy.^[74]

   The George Carlin Letters: The Permanent Courtship of Sally Wade,^[75]
   by Carlin's widow, a collection of previously-unpublished writings and
   artwork by Carlin interwoven with Wade’s chronicle of the last ten
   years of their life together, was published in March 2011. (The
   subtitle is the phrase on a handwritten note Wade found next to her
   computer upon returning home from the hospital after her husband's
   death.)^[76]

   In 2008 Carlin's daughter Kelly Carlin-McCall announced plans to
   publish an "oral history", a collection of stories from Carlin's
   friends and family,^[77] but she later indicated that the project had
   been shelved in favor of completion of her own memoir.^[78]

[edit] Internet hoaxes

   Since the birth of spam email on the internet, many chain-forwards,
   usually rantlike and with blunt statements of belief on political and
   social issues and attributed to being written (or stated) by George
   Carlin himself, have made continuous rounds on the junk email circuit.
   The website Snopes, an online resource that debunks historic and
   present urban legends and myths, has extensively covered these
   forgeries. Many of the falsely attributed email attachments have
   contained material that runs directly opposite to Carlin's viewpoints,
   with some being especially volatile toward racial groups, gays, women,
   the homeless, etc. Carlin himself, when he was made aware of each of
   these bogus emails, would debunk them on his own website, writing:
   "Nothing you see on the Internet is mine unless it comes from one of my
   albums, books, HBO specials, or appeared on my website," and that "it
   bothers me that some people might believe that I would be capable of
   writing some of this stuff."^[87]^[88]^[89]^[90]^[91]^[92]

Funny, that was my joke

COLUMN ONE

It's no laughing matter when comedians feel someone has stolen their stuff. A
generation ago it was rare, but the old code is breaking down.

   July 24, 2007|Robert W. Welkos | Times Staff Writer

   SO, these comedians walk into a comedy club, and a nasty dispute breaks
   out over who is stealing jokes. The audience laughs, but the comedians
   don't seem to find it funny at all.

   The scene was the Comedy Store on the Sunset Strip earlier this year,
   and on stage were Carlos Mencia, host of Comedy Central's "Mind of
   Mencia," and stand-up comic and "Fear Factor" host Joe Rogan. Mencia
   let it be known he was upset that Rogan had been mercilessly bashing
   him as a "joke thief" and derisively referring to him as Carlos
   "Menstealia."

   As the crowd whooped and hollered, Mencia fired back at Rogan: "Here's
   what I think. I think that every time you open your mouth and talk
   about me, I think you're secretly in love with me...."

   A video of the raucous encounter soon appeared on various websites,
   igniting a debate over joke thievery that is roiling the world of
   stand-up comedy. An earlier generation of comics was self-policing,
   careful about giving credit, often adhering to an unwritten code: Any
   comic who stole another's material faced being shunned by his peers.
   Now, though, the competition is so much greater and the comedy world so
   decentralized that old taboos about joke theft seem to be breaking
   down. That, in turn, has led to an outbreak of finger-pointing among
   comics that some say is starting to smack of McCarthyism.

   Still, for a comic convinced that his material has been ripped off,
   it's no laughing matter.

   "You have a better chance of stopping a serial killer than a serial
   thief in comedy," said comedian David Brenner. "If we could protect our
   jokes, I'd be a retired billionaire in Europe somewhere -- and what I
   just said is original."

   Bill Cosby, who has had his own material ripped off over the years,
   said he empathizes with comedians who are being victimized by joke
   thievery.

   "You're watching a guy do your material and people are laughing, but
   they're laughing because they think this performer has a brilliant mind
   and he's a funny person," Cosby said. "The person doing the stealing is
   accepting this under false pretenses."

   BOBBY Kelton, a veteran of stand-up who appeared nearly two dozen times
   on "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson," said that when he started
   out in the business, fellow comics such as Jay Leno, Billy Crystal,
   Jerry Seinfeld and Richard Lewis all knew the rules.

   "No one dared use another's material," Kelton said. "If they did, the
   word would get out and you'd be ostracized.... Then, as the comedy boom
   hit and tens of thousands of people got into comedy, that all kind of
   went out the window."

   To be sure, joke theft went on even during those golden years. The late
   Milton Berle was famous for pilfering other comedian's jokes.

   "His mother used to go around and write down jokes and give it to him,"
   recalled Carl Reiner. "He was called 'The Thief of Bad Gags.' " Reiner
   said that in those days, comedians would work on different club
   circuits, so it was possible that they didn't know when someone was
   stealing their routines.

   Today, however, websites like YouTube post videos comparing the
   routines of various comedians, inviting the public to judge for
   themselves.

   One example is a comparison of three comedy bits on Dane Cook's 2005
   album "Retaliation" and three similar routines on Louis C.K.'s 2001 CD
   "Live in Houston."

   Louis C.K. jokes: "I'd like to give my kid an interesting name. Like a
   name with no vowels ... just like 40 Fs, that's his name."

   Now compare that to Dane Cook's material: "I'd like to have 19 kids. I
   think naming them, that's going to be fun.... I already have names
   picked out. First kid -- boy, girl, I don't care -- I'm naming it
   \o7'Rrrrrrrrrrrr.' "

   \f7And both scenes might seem familiar to fans of Steve Martin, who did
   a bit decades earlier called "My Real Name," in which he uses gibberish
   when recalling the name his folks gave him.

   "Does this mean Louis C.K. and Dane Cook stole from Steve Martin?" Todd
   Jackson, a former managing editor at the humor magazine Cracked, writes
   on his comedy blog, www.dead-frog.com. "Absolutely not. This is a joke
   that doesn't belong to anyone. It's going to be discovered and
   rediscovered again and again by comics -- each of whom will put their
   own spin on it."

   Radar magazine, in a recent article about joke thievery among comics,
   called Robin Williams a "notorious joke rustler" who is known to cut
   checks to comedians after stealing their material.

   Jamie Masada, who runs the Laugh Factory in West Hollywood, likened
   Williams' act to a jazz player. "He goes with whatever comes in his
   mind. That is what he is. He doesn't go sit down and write what he is
   going to say on the stage." If he learns later that he has used someone
   else's material, Masada added, "he goes back afterward and says, 'Here
   is the check.' "

   Williams declined to comment for this article.

   Humor in a dream is a good indication of lightheartedness and release
   from the tension that may have surrounded some issue. There is,
   however, also a negative side of humor, such as when someone or
   something is derided as "a joke."

   A joke (or gag) is a phrase or a paragraph with a humorous twist. It
   can be in many different forms, such as a question or short story. To
   achieve this end, jokes may employ irony, sarcasm, word play and other
   devices. Jokes may have a punchline that will end the sentence to make
   it humorous.

   A practical joke or prank differs from a spoken one in that the major
   component of the humour is physical rather than verbal (for example
   placing salt in the sugar bowl).

Purpose

   Jokes are typically for the entertainment of friends and onlookers. The
   desired response is generally laughter; when this does not happen the
   joke is said to have "fallen flat" or "bombed". However, jokes have
   other purposes and functions, common to comedy/humour/satire in
   general.

Antiquity of jokes

   Jokes have been a part of human culture since at least 1900 BC.
   According to research conducted by Dr Paul McDonald of the University
   of Wolverhampton, a fart joke from ancient Sumer is currently believed
   to be the world's oldest known joke.^[1] Britain's oldest joke,
   meanwhile, is a 1,000-year-old double-entendre that can be found in the
   Codex Exoniensis.^[2]

   A recent discovery of a document called Philogelos (The Laughter Lover)
   gives us an insight into ancient humour. Written in Greek by Hierocles
   and Philagrius, it dates to the third or fourth century AD, and
   contains some 260 jokes. Considering humour from our own culture as
   recent as the 19th century is at times baffling to us today, the humour
   is surprisingly familiar. They had different stereotypes, the
   absent-minded professor, the eunuch, and people with hernias or bad
   breath were favourites. A lot of the jokes play on the idea of knowing
   who characters are:

     A barber, a bald man and an absent minded professor take a journey
     together. They have to camp overnight, so decide to take turns
     watching the luggage. When it's the barber's turn, he gets bored, so
     amuses himself by shaving the head of the professor. When the
     professor is woken up for his shift, he feels his head, and says
     "How stupid is that barber? He's woken up the bald man instead of
     me."

   There is even a joke similar to Monty Python's "Dead Parrot" sketch: a
   man buys a slave, who dies shortly afterwards. When he complains to the
   slave merchant, he is told: "He didn't die when I owned him." Comic Jim
   Bowen has presented them to a modern audience. "One or two of them are
   jokes I've seen in people's acts nowadays, slightly updated. They put
   in a motor car instead of a chariot - some of them are Tommy
   Cooper-esque."^[3]

Psychology of jokes

   Why people laugh at jokes has been the subject of serious academic
   study, examples being:
     * Immanuel Kant, in Critique of Judgement (1790) states that
       "Laughter is an effect that arises if a tense expectation is
       transformed into nothing." Here is Kant's 220-year old joke and his
       analysis:

     An Englishman at an Indian's table in Surat saw a bottle of ale
     being opened, and all the beer, turned to froth, rushed out. The
     Indian, by repeated exclamations, showed his great amazement. -
     Well, what's so amazing in that? asked the Englishman. - Oh, but I'm
     not amazed at its coming out, replied the Indian, but how you
     managed to get it all in. - This makes us laugh, and it gives us a
     hearty pleasure. This is not because, say, we think we are smarter
     than this ignorant man, nor are we laughing at anything else here
     that it is our liking and that we noticed through our understanding.
     It is rather that we had a tense expectation that suddenly
     vanished...

     * Henri Bergson, in his book Le rire (Laughter, 1901), suggests that
       laughter evolved to make social life possible for human beings.
     * Sigmund Freud's "Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious". (Der
       Witz und seine Beziehung zum UnbewuÃten).
     * Arthur Koestler, in The Act of Creation (1964), analyses humour and
       compares it to other creative activities, such as literature and
       science.
     * Marvin Minsky in Society of Mind (1986).

          Marvin Minsky suggests that laughter has a specific function
          related to the human brain. In his opinion jokes and laughter
          are mechanisms for the brain to learn nonsense. For that reason,
          he argues, jokes are usually not as funny when you hear them
          repeatedly.

     * Edward de Bono in "The Mechanism of the Mind" (1969) and "I am
       Right, You are Wrong" (1990).

          Edward de Bono suggests that the mind is a pattern-matching
          machine, and that it works by recognising stories and behaviour
          and putting them into familiar patterns. When a familiar
          connection is disrupted and an alternative unexpected new link
          is made in the brain via a different route than expected, then
          laughter occurs as the new connection is made. This theory
          explains a lot about jokes. For example:

          + Why jokes are only funny the first time they are told: once
            they are told the pattern is already there, so there can be no
            new connections, and so no laughter.
          + Why jokes have an elaborate and often repetitive set up: The
            repetition establishes the familiar pattern in the brain. A
            common method used in jokes is to tell almost the same story
            twice and then deliver the punch line the third time the story
            is told. The first two tellings of the story evoke a familiar
            pattern in the brain, thus priming the brain for the punch
            line.
          + Why jokes often rely on stereotypes: the use of a stereotype
            links to familiar expected behaviour, thus saving time in the
            set-up.
          + Why jokes are variants on well-known stories (e.g. the genie
            and a lamp and a man walks into a bar): This again saves time
            in the set up and establishes a familiar pattern.

     * In 2002, Richard Wiseman conducted a study intended to discover the
       world's funniest joke [1].

   Laughter, the intended human reaction to jokes, is healthy in
   moderation, uses the stomach muscles, and releases endorphins, natural
   "feel good" chemicals, into the brain.

Jokes in organizations

   Jokes can be employed by workers as a way to identify with their jobs.
   For example, 9-1-1 operators often crack jokes about incongruous,
   threatening, or tragic situations they deal with on a daily basis.^[4]
   This use of humour and cracking jokes helps employees differentiate
   themselves from the people they serve while also assisting them in
   identifying with their jobs.^[5] In addition to employees, managers use
   joking, or jocularity, in strategic ways. Some managers attempt to
   suppress joking and humour use because they feel it relates to lower
   production, while others have attempted to manufacture joking through
   pranks, pajama or dress down days, and specific committees that are
   designed to increase fun in the workplace.^[6]

Rules

   The rules of humour are analogous to those of poetry. These common
   rules are mainly timing, precision, synthesis, and rhythm. French
   philosopher Henri Bergson has said in an essay: "In every wit there is
   something of a poet."^[7] In this essay Bergson views the essence of
   humour as the encrustation of the mechanical upon the living. He used
   as an instance a book by an English humorist, in which an elderly woman
   who desired a reputation as a philanthropist provided "homes within
   easy hail of her mansion for the conversion of atheists who have been
   specially manufactured for her, so to speak, and for a number of honest
   folk who have been made into drunkards so that she may cure them of
   their failing, etc." This idea seems funny because a genuine impulse of
   charity as a living, vital impulse has become encrusted by a mechanical
   conception of how it should manifest itself.

Precision

   To reach precision, the comedian must choose the words in order to
   provide a vivid, in-focus image, and to avoid being generic as to
   confuse the audience, and provide no laughter. To properly arrange the
   words in the sentence is also crucial to get precision.

Synthesis

   That a joke is best when it expresses the maximum level of humour with
   a minimal number of words, is today considered one of the key technical
   elements of a joke.^[citation needed] An example from George Carlin:

   I have as much authority as the Pope, I just don't have as many people
   who believe it.^[8]

   Though, the familiarity of the pattern of "brevity" has led to numerous
   examples of jokes where the very length is itself the pattern-breaking
   "punchline".^[citation needed] Numerous examples from Monty Python
   exist, for instance, the song "I Like Traffic Lights". More recently,
   Family Guy often exploits such humour: for example in the episode
   "Wasted Talent", Peter Griffin bangs his shin, a classic slapstick
   routine, and tenderly nurses it while inhaling and exhaling to quiet
   the pain, for considerably longer than expected.^[vague] Certain
   versions of the popular vaudevillian joke The Aristocrats can go on for
   several minutes, and it is considered an anti-joke, as the humour is
   more in the set-up than the punchline.^[vague]

Rhythm

   Main articles: Timing (linguistics) and Comic timing

   The joke's content (meaning) is not what provokes the laugh, it just
   makes the salience of the joke and provokes a smile. What makes us
   laugh is the joke mechanism. Milton Berle demonstrated this with a
   classic theatre experiment in the 1950s: if during a series of jokes
   you insert phrases that are not jokes, but with the same rhythm, the
   audience laughs anyway^[citation needed]. A classic is the ternary
   rhythm, with three beats: Introduction, premise, antithesis (with the
   antithesis being the punch line).

   In regards to the Milton Berle experiment, they can be taken to
   demonstrate the concept of "breaking context" or "breaking the
   pattern". It is not necessarily the rhythm that caused the audience to
   laugh, but the disparity between the expectation of a "joke" and being
   instead given a non-sequitur "normal phrase." This normal phrase is,
   itself, unexpected, and a type of punchlineâthe anti-climax.

Comic

   In the comic field plays the 'economy of ideative expenditure'; in
   other words excessive energy is wasted or action-essential energy is
   saved. The profound meaning of a comic gag or a comic joke is "I'm a
   child"; the comic deals with the clumsy body of the child.

   Laurel and Hardy are a classic example. An individual laughs because he
   recognises the child that is in himself. In clowns stumbling is a
   childish tempo. In the comic, the visual gags may be translated into a
   joke. For example in Side Effects (By Destiny Denied story) by Woody
   Allen:

   "My father used to wear loafers," she confessed. "Both on the same
   foot".

   The typical comic technique is the disproportion.

Wit

   In the wit field plays the "economy of censorship expenditure"^[9]
   (Freud calls it "the economy of psychic expenditure"); usually
   censorship prevents some 'dangerous ideas' from reaching the conscious
   mind, or helps us avoid saying everything that comes to mind;
   adversely, the wit circumvents the censorship and brings up those
   ideas. Different wit techniques allow one to express them in a funny
   way. The profound meaning behind a wit joke is "I have dangerous
   ideas". An example from Woody Allen:

   I contemplated suicide again - this time by inhaling next to an
   insurance salesman.

   Or, when a bagpipe player was asked "How do you play that thing?" his
   answer was "Well." Wit is a branch of rhetoric, and there are about 200
   techniques (technically they are called tropes, a particular kind of
   figure of speech) that can be used to make jokes.^[10]

   Irony can be seen as belonging to this field.

Humor

   In the comedy field, humour induces an "economised expenditure of
   emotion" (Freud calls it "economy of affect" or "economy of sympathy".
   Freud produced this final part of his interpretation many years later,
   in a paper later supplemented to the book.).^[9]^[11] In other words,
   the joke erases an emotion that should be felt about an event, making
   us insensitive to it.e.g.: "yo momma" jokes. The profound meaning of
   the void feeling of a humour joke is "I'm a cynic". An example from
   Woody Allen:

   Three times I've been mistaken for Robert Redford. Each time by a blind
   person.

   This field of jokes is still a grey area, being mostly unexplored.
   Extensive use of this kind of humour can be found in the work of
   British satirist Chris Morris, like the sketches of the Jam television
   program.

   Black humour and sarcasm belong to this field.

Cycles

   Folklorists, in particular (but not exclusively) those who study the
   folklore of the United States, collect jokes into joke cycles. A cycle
   is a collection of jokes with a particular theme or a particular
   "script". (That is, it is a literature cycle.)^[12] Folklorists have
   identified several such cycles:
     * the Helen Keller Joke Cycle that comprises jokes about Helen
       Keller^[13]
     * Viola jokes^[14]
     * the NASA, Challenger, or Space Shuttle Joke Cycle that comprises
       jokes relating to the Space Shuttle Challenger
       disaster^[15]^[16]^[17]
     * the Chernobyl Joke Cycle that comprises jokes relating to the
       Chernobyl disaster^[18]
     * the Polish Pope Joke Cycle that comprises jokes relating to Pope
       John Paul II^[19]
     * the Essex girl and the Stupid Irish joke cycles in the United
       Kingdom^[20]
     * the Dead Baby Joke Cycle^[21]
     * the Newfie Joke Cycle that comprises jokes made by Canadians about
       Newfoundlanders^[22]
     * the Little Willie Joke Cycle, and the Quadriplegic Joke Cycle^[23]
     * the Jew Joke Cycle and the Polack Joke Cycle^[24]
     * the Rastus and Liza Joke Cycle, which Dundes describes as "the most
       vicious and widespread white anti-Negro joke cycle"^[25]
     * the Jewish American Princess and Jewish American Mother joke
       cycles^[26]
     * The Wind-up doll joke cycle^[27]
     * The "Blonde joke" cycle.

   Gruner discusses several "sick joke" cycles that occurred upon events
   surrounding Gary Hart, Natalie Wood, Vic Morrow, Jim Bakker, Richard
   Pryor, Princess Diana and Michael Jackson, noting how several jokes
   were recycled from one cycle to the next. For example: A joke about Vic
   Morrow ("We now know that Vic Morrow had dandruff: they found his head
   and shoulders in the bushes") was subsequently recycled about Admiral
   Mountbatten after his murder by Irish Republican terrorists in 1979,
   and again applied to the crew of the Challenger space shuttle ("How do
   we know that Christa McAuliffe had dandruff? They found her head and
   shoulders on the beach.").^[28]

   Berger asserts that "whenever there is a popular joke cycle, there
   generally is some widespread kind of social and cultural anxiety,
   lingering below the surface, that the joke cycle helps people deal
   with".^[29]

   Jokes often depend on the humour of the unexpected, the mildly taboo
   (which can include the distasteful or socially improper), or playing
   off stereotypes and other cultural beliefs. Many jokes fit into more
   than one category.

Subjects

   Political jokes are usually a form of satire. They generally concern
   politicians and heads of state, but may also cover the absurdities of a
   country's political situation. A prominent example of political jokes
   would be political cartoons. Two large categories of this type of jokes
   exist. The first one makes fun of a negative attitude to political
   opponents or to politicians in general. The second one makes fun of
   political clichÃ©s, mottoes, catch phrases or simply blunders of
   politicians. Some, especially the "you have two cows" genre, derive
   humour from comparing different political systems.

   Professional humour includes caricatured portrayals of certain
   professions such as lawyers, and in-jokes told by professionals to each
   other.

   Mathematical jokes are a form of in-joke, generally designed to be
   understandable only by insiders. (They are also often strictly visual
   jokes.)

   Ethnic jokes exploit ethnic stereotypes. They are often racist and
   frequently considered offensive.

   For example, the British tell jokes starting "An Englishman, an
   Irishman and a Scotsman..." which exploit the supposed parsimony of the
   Scot, stupidity of the Irish or rigid conventionality of the English.
   Such jokes exist among numerous peoples.

   Jokes based on other stereotypes (such as blonde jokes) are often
   considered funny.

   Religious jokes fall into several categories:
     * Jokes based on stereotypes associated with people of religion (e.g.
       nun jokes, priest jokes, or rabbi jokes)
     * Jokes on classical religious subjects: crucifixion, Adam and Eve,
       St. Peter at The Gates, etc.
     * Jokes that collide different religious denominations: "A rabbi, a
       medicine man, and a pastor went fishing..."
     * Letters and addresses to God.

   Self-deprecating or self-effacing humour is superficially similar to
   racial and stereotype jokes, but involves the targets laughing at
   themselves. It is said to maintain a sense of perspective and to be
   powerful in defusing confrontations. A common example is Jewish humour.
   A similar situation exists in the Scandinavian "Ole and Lena" joke.

   Self-deprecating humour has also been used by politicians, who
   recognise its ability to acknowledge controversial issues and steal the
   punch of criticism.^[citation needed] For example, when Abraham Lincoln
   was accused of being two-faced he replied, "If I had two faces, do you
   think this is the one Iâd be wearing?".

   Dirty jokes are based on taboo, often sexual, content or vocabulary.
   The definitive studies on them have been written by Gershon Legman.

   Other taboos are challenged by sick jokes and gallows humour, and to
   joke about disability is considered in this group.^[citation needed]

   Surrealist or minimalist jokes exploit semantic inconsistency, for
   example: Q: What's red and invisible? A: No tomatoes..^[citation
   needed]

   Anti-jokes are jokes that are not funny in regular sense, and often can
   be decidedly unfunny, but rely on the let-down from the expected joke
   to be funny in itself.^[citation needed]

   An elephant joke is a joke, almost always a riddle or conundrum and
   often a sequence of connected riddles, frequently operating on a
   surrealistic, anti-humorous or meta-humorous level, that involves an
   elephant.

   Jokes involving non-sequitur humour, with parts of the joke being
   unrelated to each other; e.g. "My uncle once punched a man so hard his
   legs became trombones", from The Mighty Boosh TV series.

   Dark humour is often used in order to deal with a difficult situation
   in a manner of "if you can laugh at it, it won't kill you". Usually
   those jokes make fun of tragedies like death, accidents, wars,
   catastrophes or injuries.

Styles

   The question/answer joke, sometimes posed as a common riddle, has a
   supposedly straight question and an answer which is twisted for
   humorous effect; puns are often employed. Of this type are knock-knock
   joke, light bulb joke, the many variations on "why did the chicken
   cross the road?", and the class of "What's the difference between a
   _______ and a ______" joke, where the punch line is often a pun or a
   spoonerism linking two apparently entirely unconnected concepts.

   Some jokes require a double act, where one respondent (usually the
   straight man) can be relied on to give the correct response to the
   person telling the joke. This is more common in performance than
   informal joke-telling.

   A shaggy dog story is an extremely long and involved joke with an
   intentionally weak or completely non-existent punchline. The humour
   lies in building up the audience's anticipation and then letting them
   down completely. The longer the story can continue without the audience
   realising it is a joke, and not a serious anecdote, the more successful
   it is.

   A joke is a question, short story, or depiction of a situation made
   with the intent of being humorous. To achieve this end, jokes may
   employ irony, sarcasm, word play and other devices. Jokes may have a
   punchline that will end the sentence to make it humorous.

   A practical joke or prank differs from a spoken one in that the major
   component of the humour is physical rather than verbal (for example
   placing salt in the sugar bowl).

Purpose

   Jokes are typically for the entertainment of friends and onlookers. The
   desired response is generally laughter; when this does not happen the
   joke is said to have "fallen flat" or "bombed".

   However jokes have other purposes and functions, common to
   comedy/humour/satire in general.

Antiquity of jokes

   Jokes have been a part of human culture since at least 1900 BC.
   According to research conducted by Dr Paul McDonald of the University
   of Wolverhampton, a fart joke from ancient Sumer is currently believed
   to be the world's oldest known joke.^[1] Britain's oldest joke,
   meanwhile, is a 1,000-year-old double-entendre that can be found in the
   Codex Exoniensis. ^[2]

   A recent discovery of a document called Philogelos (The Laughter Lover)
   gives us an insight into ancient humour. Written in Greek by Hierocles
   and Philagrius, it dates to the third or fourth century AD, and
   contains some 260 jokes. Considering humour from our own culture as
   recent as the 19th century is at times baffling to us today, the humour
   is surprisingly familiar. They had different stereotypes, the
   absent-minded professor, the eunuch, and people with hernias or bad
   breath were favourites. A lot of the jokes play on the idea of knowing
   who characters are:

     A barber, a bald man and an absent minded professor take a journey
     together. They have to camp overnight, so decide to take turns
     watching the luggage. When it's the barber's turn, he gets bored, so
     amuses himself by shaving the head of the professor. When the
     professor is woken up for his shift, he feels his head, and says
     "How stupid is that barber? He's woken up the bald man instead of
     me."

   There is even a version of Monty Python's Dead Parrot sketch: a man
   buys a slave, who dies shortly afterwards. When he complains to the
   slave merchant, he is told: "He didn't die when I owned him." Comic Jim
   Bowen has presented them to a modern audience. "One or two of them are
   jokes I've seen in people's acts nowadays, slightly updated. They put
   in a motor car instead of a chariot - some of them are Tommy
   Cooper-esque."^[3]

Psychology of jokes

   Why we laugh has been the subject of serious academic study, examples
   being:
     * Immanuel Kant, in Critique of Judgement (1790) states that
       "Laughter is an effect that arises if a tense expectation is
       transformed into nothing." Here is Kant's 220-year old joke and his
       analysis:

     "An Englishman at an Indian's table in Surat saw a bottle of ale
     being opened, and all the beer, turned to froth, rushed out. The
     Indian, by repeated exclamations, showed his great amazement. -
     Well, what's so amazing in that? asked the Englishman. - Oh, but I'm
     not amazed at its coming out, replied the Indian, but how you
     managed to get it all in. - This makes us laugh, and it gives us a
     hearty pleasure. This is not because, say, we think we are smarter
     than this ignorant man, nor are we laughing at anything else here
     that it is our liking and that we noticed through our understanding.
     It is rather that we had a tense expectation that suddenly
     vanished..."

     * Henri Bergson, in his book Le rire (Laughter, 1901), suggests that
       laughter evolved to make social life possible for human beings.
     * Sigmund Freud's "Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious". (Der
       Witz und seine Beziehung zum Unbewußten).
     * Arthur Koestler, in The Act of Creation (1964), analyses humour and
       compares it to other creative activities, such as literature and
       science.
     * Marvin Minsky in Society of Mind (1986).

          Marvin Minsky suggests that laughter has a specific function
          related to the human brain. In his opinion jokes and laughter
          are mechanisms for the brain to learn nonsense. For that reason,
          he argues, jokes are usually not as funny when you hear them
          repeatedly.

     * Edward de Bono in "The Mechanism of the Mind" (1969) and "I am
       Right, You are Wrong" (1990).

          Edward de Bono suggests that the mind is a pattern-matching
          machine, and that it works by recognising stories and behaviour
          and putting them into familiar patterns. When a familiar
          connection is disrupted and an alternative unexpected new link
          is made in the brain via a different route than expected, then
          laughter occurs as the new connection is made. This theory
          explains a lot about jokes. For example:

          + Why jokes are only funny the first time they are told: once
            they are told the pattern is already there, so there can be no
            new connections, and so no laughter.
          + Why jokes have an elaborate and often repetitive set up: The
            repetition establishes the familiar pattern in the brain. A
            common method used in jokes is to tell almost the same story
            twice and then deliver the punch line the third time the story
            is told. The first two tellings of the story evoke a familiar
            pattern in the brain, thus priming the brain for the punch
            line.
          + Why jokes often rely on stereotypes: the use of a stereotype
            links to familiar expected behaviour, thus saving time in the
            set-up.
          + Why jokes are variants on well-known stories (e.g. the genie
            and a lamp and a man walks into a bar): This again saves time
            in the set up and establishes a familiar pattern.

     * In 2002, Richard Wiseman conducted a study intended to discover the
       world's funniest joke [1].

   Laughter, the intended human reaction to jokes, is healthy in
   moderation, uses the stomach muscles, and releases endorphins, natural
   "feel good" chemicals, into the brain.

Jokes in organizations

   Jokes can be employed by workers as a way to identify with their jobs.
   For example, 9-1-1 operators often crack jokes about incongruous,
   threatening, or tragic situations they deal with on a daily basis.^[4]
   This use of humor and cracking jokes helps employees differentiate
   themselves from the people they serve while also assisting them in
   identifying with their jobs.^[5] In addition to employees, managers use
   joking, or jocularity, in strategic ways. Some managers attempt to
   suppress joking and humor use because they feel it relates to lower
   production, while others have attempted to manufacture joking through
   pranks, pajama or dress down days, and specific committees that are
   designed to increase fun in the workplace.^[6]

Rules

   The rules of humour are analogous to those of poetry. These common
   rules are mainly timing, precision, synthesis, and rhythm. French
   philosopher Henri Bergson has said in an essay: "In every wit there is
   something of a poet."^[7] In this essay Bergson views the essence of
   humour as the encrustation of the mechanical upon the living. He used
   as an instance a book by an English humorist, in which an elderly woman
   who desired a reputation as a philanthropist provided "homes within
   easy hail of her mansion for the conversion of atheists who have been
   specially manufactured for her, so to speak, and for a number of honest
   folk who have been made into drunkards so that she may cure them of
   their failing, etc." This idea seems funny because a genuine impulse of
   charity as a living, vital impulse has become encrusted by a mechanical
   conception of how it should manifest itself.

Precision

   To reach precision, the comedian must choose the words in order to
   provide a vivid, in-focus image, and to avoid being generic as to
   confuse the audience, and provide no laughter. To properly arrange the
   words in the sentence is also crucial to get precision. An example by
   Woody Allen (from Side Effects, "A Giant Step for Mankind" story [2]):

   Grasping the mouse firmly by the tail, I snapped it like a small whip,
   and the morsel of cheese came loose.

Synthesis

   That a joke is best when it expresses the maximum level of humour with
   a minimal number of words, is today considered one of the key technical
   elements of a joke.^[citation needed] An example from George Carlin:

   I have as much authority as the Pope, I just don't have as many people
   who believe it.^[8]

   Though, the familiarity of the pattern of "brevity" has led to numerous
   examples of jokes where the very length is itself the pattern-breaking
   "punchline".^[citation needed] Numerous examples from Monty Python
   exist, for instance, the song "I Like Traffic Lights". More recently,
   Family Guy often exploits such humor: for example in the episode
   "Wasted Talent", Peter Griffin bangs his shin, a classic slapstick
   routine, and tenderly nurses it whilst inhaling and exhaling to quiet
   the pain, for considerably longer than expected.^[vague] Certain
   versions of the popular vaudevillian joke The Aristocrats can go on for
   several minutes, and it is considered an anti-joke, as the humour is
   more in the set-up than the punchline.^[vague]

Rhythm

   Main articles: Timing (linguistics) and Comic timing

   The joke's content (meaning) is not what provokes the laugh, it just
   makes the salience of the joke and provokes a smile. What makes us
   laugh is the joke mechanism. Milton Berle demonstrated this with a
   classic theatre experiment in the 1950s: if during a series of jokes
   you insert phrases that are not jokes, but with the same rhythm, the
   audience laughs anyway^[citation needed]. A classic is the ternary
   rhythm, with three beats: Introduction, premise, antithesis (with the
   antithesis being the punch line).

   In regards to the Milton Berle experiment, they can be taken to
   demonstrate the concept of "breaking context" or "breaking the
   pattern". It is not necessarily the rhythm that caused the audience to
   laugh, but the disparity between the expectation of a "joke" and being
   instead given a non-sequitur "normal phrase." This normal phrase is,
   itself, unexpected, and a type of punchline.

Comic

   In the comic field plays the 'economy of ideative expenditure'; in
   other words excessive energy is wasted or action-essential energy is
   saved. The profound meaning of a comic gag or a comic joke is "I'm a
   child"; the comic deals with the clumsy body of the child.

   Laurel and Hardy are a classic example. An individual laughs because he
   recognises the child that is in himself. In clowns stumbling is a
   childish tempo. In the comic, the visual gags may be translated into a
   joke. For example in Side Effects (By Destiny Denied story) by Woody
   Allen:

   "My father used to wear loafers," she confessed. "Both on the same
   foot".

   The typical comic technique is the disproportion.

Wit

   In the wit field plays the "economy of censorship
   expenditure"^[9](Freud calls it "the economy of psychic expenditure");
   usually censorship prevents some 'dangerous ideas' from reaching the
   conscious mind, or helps us avoid saying everything that comes to mind;
   adversely, the wit circumvents the censorship and brings up those
   ideas. Different wit techniques allow one to express them in a funny
   way. The profound meaning behind a wit joke is "I have dangerous
   ideas". An example from Woody Allen:

   I contemplated suicide again - this time by inhaling next to an
   insurance salesman.

   Or, when a bagpipe player was asked "How do you play that thing?" his
   answer was "Well." Wit is a branch of rhetoric, and there are about 200
   techniques (technically they are called tropes, a particular kind of
   figure of speech) that can be used to make jokes.^[10]

   Irony can be seen as belonging to this field.

Humour

   In the comedy field, humour induces an "economised expenditure of
   emotion" (Freud calls it "economy of affect" or "economy of sympathy".
   Freud produced this final part of his interpretation many years later,
   in a paper later supplemented to the book.).^[9]^[11] In other words,
   the joke erases an emotion that should be felt about an event, making
   us insensitive to it.e.g.: "yo momma" jokes. The profound meaning of
   the void feeling of a humour joke is "I'm a cynic". An example from
   Woody Allen:

   Three times I've been mistaken for Robert Redford. Each time by a blind
   person.

   This field of jokes is still a grey area, being mostly unexplored.
   Extensive use of this kind of humour can be found in the work of
   British satirist Chris Morris, like the sketches of the Jam television
   program.

   Black humour and sarcasm belong to this field.

Cycles

   Folklorists, in particular (but not exclusively) those who study the
   folklore of the United States, collect jokes into joke cycles. A cycle
   is a collection of jokes with a particular theme or a particular
   "script". (That is, it is a literature cycle.)^[12] Folklorists have
   identified several such cycles:
     * the Helen Keller Joke Cycle that comprises jokes about Helen
       Keller^[13]
     * Viola jokes^[14]
     * the NASA, Challenger, or Space Shuttle Joke Cycle that comprises
       jokes relating to the Space Shuttle Challenger
       disaster^[15]^[16]^[17]
     * the Chernobyl Joke Cycle that comprises jokes relating to the
       Chernobyl disaster^[18]
     * the Polish Pope Joke Cycle that comprises jokes relating to Pope
       John Paul II^[19]
     * the Essex girl and the Stupid Irish joke cycles in the United
       Kingdom^[20]
     * the Dead Baby Joke Cycle^[21]
     * the Newfie Joke Cycle that comprises jokes made by Canadians about
       Newfoundlanders^[22]
     * the Little Willie Joke Cycle, and the Quadriplegic Joke Cycle^[23]
     * the Jew Joke Cycle and the Polack Joke Cycle^[24]
     * the Rastus and Liza Joke Cycle, which Dundes describes as "the most
       vicious and widespread white anti-Negro joke cycle"^[25]
     * the Jewish American Princess and Jewish American Mother joke
       cycles^[26]
     * the Wind-Up Doll Joke Cycle^[27]
     * The "Blond Joke" Cycle.

   Gruner discusses several "sick joke" cycles that occurred upon events
   surrounding Gary Hart, Natalie Wood, Vic Morrow, Jim Bakker, Richard
   Pryor, Princess Diana and Michael Jackson, noting how several jokes
   were recycled from one cycle to the next. For example: A joke about Vic
   Morrow ("We now know that Vic Morrow had dandruff: they found his head
   and shoulders in the bushes") was subsequently recycled about Admiral
   Mountbatten after his murder by Irish Republican terrorists in 1979,
   and again applied to the crew of the Challenger space shuttle ("How do
   we know that Christa McAuliffe had dandruff? They found her head and
   shoulders on the beach.").^[28]

   Berger asserts that "whenever there is a popular joke cycle, there
   generally is some widespread kind of social and cultural anxiety,
   lingering below the surface, that the joke cycle helps people deal
   with".^[29]

Types of jokes

   Jokes often depend on the humour of the unexpected, the mildly taboo
   (which can include the distasteful or socially improper), or playing
   off stereotypes and other cultural beliefs. Many jokes fit into more
   than one category.

Subjects

   Political jokes are usually a form of satire. They generally concern
   politicians and heads of state, but may also cover the absurdities of a
   country's political situation. A prominent example of political jokes
   would be political cartoons. Two large categories of this type of jokes
   exist. The first one makes fun of a negative attitude to political
   opponents or to politicians in general. The second one makes fun of
   political clichés, mottoes, catch phrases or simply blunders of
   politicians. Some, especially the "you have two cows" genre, derive
   humour from comparing different political systems.

   Professional humour includes caricatured portrayals of certain
   professions such as lawyers, and in-jokes told by professionals to each
   other.

   Mathematical jokes are a form of in-joke, generally designed to be
   understandable only by insiders. (They are also often strictly visual
   jokes.)

   Ethnic jokes exploit ethnic stereotypes. They are often racist and
   frequently considered offensive.

   For example, the British tell jokes starting "An Englishman, an
   Irishman and a Scotsman..." which exploit the supposed parsimony of the
   Scot, stupidity of the Irish or rigid conventionality of the English.
   Such jokes exist among numerous peoples.

   Racially offensive humour is often considered funny, but similar jokes
   based on other stereotypes (such as blonde jokes) are often considered
   even more funny.

   Religious jokes fall into several categories:
     * Jokes based on stereotypes associated with people of religion (e.g.
       nun jokes, priest jokes, or rabbi jokes)
     * Jokes on classical religious subjects: crucifixion, Adam and Eve,
       St. Peter at The Gates, etc.
     * Jokes that collide different religious denominations: "A rabbi, a
       medicine man, and a pastor went fishing..."
     * Letters and addresses to God.

   Self-deprecating or self-effacing humour is superficially similar to
   racial and stereotype jokes, but involves the targets laughing at
   themselves. It is said to maintain a sense of perspective and to be
   powerful in defusing confrontations. Probably the best-known and most
   common example is Jewish humour. The egalitarian tradition was strong
   among the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe in which the powerful
   were often mocked subtly. Prominent members of the community were
   kidded during social gatherings, part a good-natured tradition of
   humour as a levelling device. A similar situation exists in the
   Scandinavian "Ole and Lena" joke.

   Self-deprecating humour has also been used by politicians, who
   recognise its ability to acknowledge controversial issues and steal the
   punch of criticism - for example, when Abraham Lincoln was accused of
   being two-faced he replied, "If I had two faces, do you think this is
   the one I’d be wearing?".

   Dirty jokes are based on taboo, often sexual, content or vocabulary.
   The definitive studies on them have been written by Gershon Legman.

   Other taboos are challenged by sick jokes and gallows humour; to joke
   about disability is considered in this group.

   Surrealist or minimalist jokes exploit semantic inconsistency, for
   example: Q: What's red and invisible? A: No tomatoes..

   Anti-jokes are jokes that are not funny in regular sense, and often can
   be decidedly unfunny, but rely on the let-down from the expected joke
   to be funny in itself.^[citation needed] A question was: 'What is the
   difference between a dead bird ?. The answer came: "His right leg is as
   different as his left one'. An elephant joke is a joke, almost always a
   riddle or conundrum and often a sequence of connected riddles, that
   involves an elephant.

   Jokes involving non-sequitur humour, with parts of the joke being
   unrelated to each other; e.g. "My uncle once punched a man so hard his
   legs became trombones", from the Mighty Boosh TV series.

Styles

   The question / answer joke, sometimes posed as a common riddle, has a
   supposedly straight question and an answer which is twisted for
   humorous effect; puns are often employed. Of this type are knock-knock
   joke, light bulb joke, the many variations on "why did the chicken
   cross the road?", and the class of "What's the difference between a
   _______ and a ______" joke, where the punch line is often a pun or a
   spoonerism linking two apparently entirely unconnected concepts.

   Some jokes require a double act, where one respondent (usually the
   straight man) can be relied on to give the correct response to the
   person telling the joke. This is more common in performance than
   informal joke-telling.

   A shaggy dog story is an extremely long and involved joke with an
   intentionally weak or completely non-existent punchline. The humour
   lies in building up the audience's anticipation and then letting them
   down completely. The longer the story can continue without the audience
   realising it is a joke, and not a serious anecdote, the more successful
   it is. Shaggy jokes appear to date from the 1930s, although there are
   several competing variants for the "original" shaggy dog story.
   According to one, an advertisement is placed in a newspaper, searching
   for the shaggiest dog in the world. The teller of the joke then relates
   the story of the search for the shaggiest dog in extreme and
   exaggerated detail (flying around the world, climbing mountains,
   fending off sabre-toothed tigers, etc.); a good teller will be able to
   stretch the story out to over half an hour. When the winning dog is
   finally presented, the advertiser takes a look at the dog and states:
   "I don't think he's so shaggy."

   Some shaggy dog stories are actually cleverly constructed stories,
   frequently interesting in themselves, that culminate in one or more
   puns whose first meaning is reasonable as part of the story but whose
   second meaning is a common aphorism, commercial jingle, or other
   recognisable word or phrase. As with other puns, there may be multiple
   separate rhyming meanings. Such stories treat the listener or reader
   with respect. (See: "Upon My Word!", a book by Frank Muir and Denis
   Norden, spun off from their long-running BBC radio show My Word!.)

Essex girl

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search

   An Essex girl is a pejorative stereotype in the United Kingdom of a
   female who is said to be promiscuous and unintelligent, characteristics
   jocularly attributed to women from Essex. It is applied widely
   throughout the country and has gained popularity over time, dating from
   the 1980s and 1990s. Unlike Essex man, which became aspirational
   stereotype for working-class voters in the south and east of England
   who voted for Margaret Thatcher, Essex girl does not carry positive
   political connotations.

[edit] Image

   The stereotypical image was formed as a variation of the dumb
   blonde/bimbo persona, with references to the Estuary English accent,
   white stiletto heels, silicone enhanced breasts, peroxide blonde hair,
   over-indulgent use of fake tan (lending an orange appearance),
   promiscuity, loud verbal vulgarity and to socialising at downmarket
   nightclubs.

   Time magazine has written:

   In the typology of the British, there is a special place reserved for
   Essex Girl, a lady from London's eastern suburbs who dresses in white
   strappy sandals and suntan oil, streaks her hair blond, has a command
   of Spanish that runs only to the word Ibiza, and perfects an air of
   tarty prettiness. Victoria Beckham – Posh Spice, as she was – is the
   acknowledged queen of that realm ...^[1]

   The term initially became synonymous with the lead characters of Sharon
   and Tracey in the BBC sitcom Birds of a Feather. These brash,
   uninhibited women had escaped working-class backgrounds in London and
   moved to a large house in Chigwell. The image has since been epitomised
   in celebrity culture with the likes of Denise Van Outen, Jade Goody,
   Jodie Marsh, Chantelle Houghton,and Amy Childs all rising to some
   degree of fame with the help of their Essex Girl image.

[edit] Essex girl jokes

   Essex girl jokes are primarily variations of dumb blonde jokes, though
   often sexually explicit. In 2004, Bob Russell, Liberal Democrat MP for
   Colchester in Essex, appealed for debate in the House of Commons on the
   issue, encouraging a boycott of The People tabloid, which has printed
   several derogatory references to girls from Essex.^[2]

MP urges boycott of The People over Essex girl jokes

   26 March 2004

   An MP is so incensed with The People for publishing "derogatory
   remarks" about Essex girls that he has urged readers to stop buying it.

   Bob Russell, the Liberal Democrat MP for Colchester, has urged them to
   register a protest by switching to another Sunday newspaper.

   He made his appeal in a House of Commons motion which is open to other
   MPs to sign.

   "Had the offensive comments been directed at people because of their
   colour or religion it would have caused outrage amongst all decent
   citizens and would be considered by some to break the law," he said in
   his motion.

   The MP has taken offence at a story in last Sunday's People about
   Prince William allegedly arranging a date with an Essex girl. On the
   inside pages, the story was illustrated by a string of Essex girl
   jokes.

   "Such attacks on women from Essex have no place in civilised society,"
   said Russell. "They are unworthy of any publication which wants to be
   taken seriously" The motion calls on people to boycott The People and
   to "switch their alliegance" to another Sunday paper.

   If enough MPs sign, Leader of the House Peter Hain could face pressure
   to yield government time for a debate.

   Russell can also apply to Speaker Michael Martin to grant him a
   halfhour slot to raise his concerns in a mini-Commons debate.

Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ #32

   Posted on August 17, 2011 | Leave a comment

   Welcome to the end of Wednesday, fellow crap jokers.

   âTis a busy time here at CJotD headquarters. With the famous Crap Joke
   GeneratorÂ® out of action (it was badly damaged in the great fire),
   weâve been racking our brains to devise suitable crap-jokery to pass on
   to our loyal readers.

   So often, as any joke-writer worth his salt will tell you, a new joke
   comes from a theme. Todayâs joke is no different, and its theme came
   through an unexpected source. While drinking our local public house,
   our head researcher got talking to a dishevelled looking man with an
   eye patch who suggested he was considering hiring a superhero costume
   and heading out onto the London streets to tackle rioters. He was
   clearly insane (he told our researcher that he had already started
   important conversion work on his 1982 Ford Fiesta), but nonetheless we
   thought he had a point.

   And surely that point is this: the world needs more heroes. So, with
   that in mind, here’s today’s CJotD. Enjoy.

   Did you hear about the man who collected Joan Of Arc, Wonder Woman and
   Florence Nightingale memorabilia?
   He was a heroine addict.

   Well, they canât all be winners. Another one of those, same time
   tomorrow.

Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ #31

   Posted on August 10, 2011 | 1 Comment

   Since our last Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢, times in London have been
   troubled. CJotD HQ, just recently reopened for business after the great
   fire of April 2011, has been on lockdown.

   Whatever part of the world youâre from â and CJotD fans are certainly a
   global crowd âÂ  you will have no doubt heard about the rioting that
   has hit Londonâs streets, and subsequently other cities across England.
   The latest is that there is looting in Peckham now – apparently the
   reprobates have taken half-price cracked ice, miles and miles of carpet
   tiles, TVs, deep freeze, David Bowie LPs…

   Think about that one.

   Anyway. Ultimately, we hope that CJotD can bring a little bit of light
   to the darkness, whether youâre young or old, hippy or hoodie. Weâre
   here for everyone.

   So hereâs todayâs cracker, which stands in stark contrast to the wanton
   thuggery out there. It will be enjoyed by those that remember the cult
   childrenâs TV show classic, Rainbow.

   What’s the name of Zippy’s wife ?
   Mississippi

   Another one of those, same time tomorrow.

Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ #30

   Posted on August 8, 2011 | Leave a comment

   Picture this. Itâs 29 April, 1985. Oddly-spectacled Dennis Taylor has
   crumbled in the face of snooker-based genius Steve Davis, finding
   himself seven frames to none down in the final of the world snooker
   championships.

   Davis was on fire. He was a god of the green baize: a modern Achilles
   brandishing a maple spear. Taylor looked every bit the vanquished
   Trojan warrior. His fans looked on, tutting.

   No-one thought Davisâ mistake in frame eight would mean anything. But,
   hours later, Taylor had achieved the impossible, besting the world
   champion on a respotted black in the deciding frame. As he lifted
   snookerâs greatest trophy above his head, he stood astride the world an
   unlikely hero.

   This was the greatest comeback of all time. Until now.

   As youâll know, loyal CJotD reader, by April we had published 29
   glorious mirth-makers. Popularity was soaring. But with popularity came
   a relentless demand for ever more ground-breaking two liners. Buckling
   under the rising tide of expectation, the system broke. An incident
   involving our office runner, some new-fangled highlighter pens and an
   overheating photocopier led to a raging inferno that burned the office
   to the ground.

   Four months on, and weâre back. We have a new office and a new, can-do
   attitude. Weâre still finding our feet, but weâll give it a go. Hereâs
   todayâs effort. Enjoy â and give us a five star rating. Go on. This is
   our 1985.

   How do you turn a duck into a soul singer?
   Put it in a microwave until its Bill Withers.

   Another one of those, same time tomorrow.

Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ #29

   Posted on April 21, 2011 | 1 Comment

   Raise a glass – youâve made it to the end of the week. Well, the end of
   the Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ week at least – Â this will be the last
   CJotD until next Tuesday because of the Easter break. We suggest this
   is one you should cherish â after all, we donât want you suffering
   withdrawal symptoms.

   What a record-breaking, jaw-dropping week of firsts it has been here at
   CJotD. We published the first in a series of fan profile posts on
   Tuesday, and followed it up with the first ever reader submitted crap
   joke. We were also featured on an article on chortle.co.uk. The result
   of all this success: people flocked to the website in numbers never
   witnessed before. Our servers creaked under the pressure but, propped
   up by some sterling work from the IT department, stood firm.

   So the team here at Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ are all heading down to the
   local watering hole to enjoy a collective sigh of contentment (and
   probably one or two light ales). But first, of course, we owe you a
   crap joke.Â Â

   Todayâs epic crap joke is one of those perfectly timed numbers â
   certainly one to tell your friends over the coming weekend. Learn it
   word-for-word, practice in front of a mirror and then deliver it
   unflinchingly and with conviction: youâll be guaranteed a laugh.
   Probably.Â Happy Easter.

   Arnold Schwarzenegger didnât get any Easter eggs this year. His wife
   asked him âDoes this mean you hate Easter now, Arnie?â
   He replied âAh still love Easter babyâ.

   Another one of those, same time on Tuesday.

Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ #28

   Posted on April 19, 2011 | 2 Comments

   Keen followers of Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ witnessed a world exclusive
   this morning: the launch of a new series of posts based on FriendsÂ® of
   CJotD. If you missed it, have a read of the first ever no-holds-barred
   interview with a real CJotD fan here. More will follow.

   These profile pieces are part of our efforts to recognise the role that
   our readers have played in our meteoric rise (a rise exemplified by our
   recent mention in an article by comedian Matt Price on popular comedy
   website chortle.co.uk). And weâre not stopping there – there is another
   opportunity for crap joke-basedÂ fame and fortune.

   Some of you will have clicked on the âsubmit a crap jokeâ link at the
   top of the screen. Others have gone further: many a dreary canteen
   lunch here at CJotD HQ has been enlivened by a public retelling of a
   fanâs crap joke. Today is the day we put one of your crap jokes to the
   test: for the very first time, an official Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ will
   come from a reader.

   Here it is. Is it better than our normal efforts? Let us know by
   leaving a comment or giving it a star rating. Think you can do better?
   Submit your own crap joke. Oh â and if youâre reading this and itâs
   your joke, you might want to let the world know youâve been published.
   Take a bit of the credit â you deserve it.

   I got stung by a bee the other day.
   20 quid for a jar of honey.

   Another one of those, same time tomorrow.

New series of CJotD fan inteviews launches today

   Posted on April 19, 2011 | 2 Comments

   Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ is just 27 days old, but is already a phenomenon
   on the tinterweb superhighway. Zuckerberg is quaking in his boots; a
   queue of advertisers is forming at the oak-panelled CJotD door.

   But weâre not naÃ¯ve here at CJotD: we know that we would be nothing
   without our fans. You have made Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ the living,
   breathing community that it is today, and we want to give something
   back.

   So weâre proud to announce the launch of a new series of posts
   featuring interviews with our biggest supporters: FriendsÂ® of
   CJotD.Â These will be bare-all affairs that really get to the heart of
   how exactly fans âenjoy CJotDâ. Hopefully weâll all gain a little
   inspiration from sharing these CJotD stories, routines and nostalgia.

   The first such interview is with Zaria. Zaria discovered the site a few
   weeks back and, since then, has become one of our finest ambassadors,
   truly taking CJotD to work with her.

   Hi Zaria. We hear youâre a big CJotD fan. How did you find out about
   it?
   I saw it mentioned in the âTop 10 Twitterers to Watch of 2011â in The
   News of the World culture section. You can follow Zaria on Twitter
   @zaria_b, and CJotD @crapjokedaily â ed.

   Yeah, a lot of people saw that. What are your earliest memories of crap
   jokes?
   My family are a dynasty of crap jokers â I was brought up with it all
   around me. I guess thatâs why I feel so home at crapjokeoftheday.com.

   How do you experience Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢?
   I read it aloud in the office to my colleagues â weâre only a small
   team of six, and we share our office with some librarians (thatâs not a
   joke). Itâs always a challenge to see if we can get a smile out of
   those old girls.

   Sounds like youâve got a regular thing going. Would you say you have
   any Crap Joke of the Day rituals?
   It always tends to be after lunch, once everyone has a very strong
   cuppa in hand. Weâll have just finished the paper crossword, and be in
   need some encouragement as we face the prospect of another afternoon at
   the grindstone. One afternoon we had ran out of milk and couldnât
   accompany CJotD with a cup of tea. It was pretty extreme, but we still
   pulled through.

   In your opinion, what is the mark of a good crap joke?
   Groaning â you know youâve not hit the spot until youâve heard a groan!

   What’s been your favourite CJotD so far?
   CJotD #8 was a real highlight in our office. Like I said we often have
   the CJotD after completing the crossword. Surely that joke proves that
   itâs life that imitates artâ¦

   Would you say CJotD has changed you at all?
   Itâs changed my life in more ways then I can mention. I honestly
   believe peace in the world would be possible if more people took just
   two minutes to read CJotD each day. Has anyone sent a link to Gaddafi?

   ‘Laughter is the best medicine’. Discuss.
   This sounds like Andrew Lansleyâs tag line at the moment! Anything to
   save some money in the NHS!

   By taking part in this interview, Zaria has now formally become a
   FriendÂ® of Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢. Want to share that prestigious
   title? Volunteer to answer some simple questions by emailing us here.

Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ #27

   Posted on April 18, 2011 | 1 Comment

   Good afternoon, crap joke fans. We are delighted today to preview an
   exciting CJotD launch. Tomorrow morning, Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ will be
   launching a new series of posts. Posts based on you.

   In many ways, CJotD is less a website, and more a thriving community of
   people who love to hate to laugh at bad jokes. Our new series of posts
   will look at the people in that community, unearthing precisely how
   crap jokes make them tick. From the rituals and routines to the stories
   and the sniggers, we sincerely hope these fan musings will help us all
   get a little bit more out of each daily instalment of CJotD.

   But thatâs tomorrow.Â What about today?Â Well, thereâs merely a crap
   joke, just for you. And a brilliantly childish one at that â tell the
   kids to give it a five star rating.

   What do you call a monkey in a minefield?
   A Babboom!

   Or a chimpbangzee. Or a gibbang. Or an obangutan.

   Another one of those, same time tomorrow.

Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ #26

   Posted on April 15, 2011 | Leave a comment

   Welcome to the weekend, friends of Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢. This weekend
   will neatly punctuate a remarkable five days in the history of CJotD:
   five days that have seen more than their fair share of turmoil,
   exhilaration, despair and laughter for us hard-working types here at
   HQ.

   The CJotD board are more than a little obsessed with numbers. Never a
   day goes by when a new report, chart or spreadsheet isnât created, the
   Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ supercomputer crunching a vast array of numbers
   to help our writers hone our writing and our marketers refine our
   marketing.

   With the penchant for numbers and data gathering force, it was our
   accounts team that inspired the commentary ahead of Crap Joke of the
   Dayâ¢ #18 (no doubt you remember it well). The geekier CJotD fans among
   you gave that one rave reviews, so our editors decided we should give
   you a similar taste of trivia.

   Like 18, 26 itself is a remarkable number in its own right. There are,
   of course, 26 letters in the alphabet, 26 miles in a marathon, and 26
   red cards in a traditional deck*. As youâll know, 26 is also the number
   of spacetime dimensions in bosonic string theory, and the number of
   sides in a rhombicuboctahedron.

   Slightly more on topic, a âjoke throwâ in darts â where a player throws
   a 20, a 5 and a 1 when aiming for treble 20s â is 26 in total.

   So, to celebrate the birth of a brand new weekend on CJotDâs 26^th
   birthday, todayâs crap joke is a classic. Give us a good rating â make
   us happy.

   I was walking by the fridge last night and I swore I could hear an
   onion singing a Bee Gees song. Turns out it was just the chives
   talking.

   Another one of those, same time on Monday.

   Â
   * The eagle-eyed among you might have noticed that there are also 26
   black cards.

Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ #25

   Posted on April 14, 2011 | 1 Comment

   The best and most successful organisations know their audience inside
   out,Â and CJotD is no exception. Our in-depth CJotD enjoyment index
   surveyÂ© gets our customer relations team the most detailed and
   reliable insight on how to keep our jokes relevant to our readersâ
   lives.

   We know, for example, that CJotD fans are a massively diverse bunch and
   have aÂ huge variety of skills, professions, interests, hobbies and
   pastimes. Some get their kicksÂ watchingÂ football orÂ  by working all
   the hours god sends, others spend their spare time playing backgammon
   or making sacle models of historic ships out of balsa wood.

   But what does this mean? Well, it means one joke doesnât fit all. If
   our readers are diverse, we must be diverse. In fact, being diverse has
   probably been the secret of our runaway success to date (we are now
   nearing 200 fans on Facebook), and so far our crap jokes have taken in
   subjects including fairgrounds, the army, factory working, text
   messaging, goths and circumcision. What other organisation would tackle
   such a mesmerising array of hot topics?

   So todayâs joke covers an area weâve never covered before, and is aimed
   at all those CJotD fans that also like a bit of tennis. It focuses on a
   former world number one who returned to training yesterday after months
   out of the game. Enjoy.

   Did you hear that Serena Williams has left her boyfriend?
   These tennis players – love means nothing to them.

   Another one of those, same time tomorrow.

Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ #24

   Posted on April 12, 2011 | Leave a comment

   Despite the mystery of the Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ logbook’s
   disappearance drawing to a close yesterday, we unfortunately havenât
   seen the back of the police here at CJotD HQ.

   We have been officially charged with wasting police time, and
   areÂ taking the allegations very seriously. Senior Crap Joke of the
   Dayâ¢ executives have freed up time for potential police interviews,
   and it was agreed in an emergency board meeting this morning that these
   interviews would be colour-coded red in diaries.

   As a result of the charges, resources here at CJotD HQ are stretched to
   the absolute maximum and the HR team have been forced into temporarily
   realigning roles and responsibilities. Copywriters are lending a hand
   on the web design desk, quality control officers are pulling the
   strings on editorial team and the managing director is filing with the
   archivists. Our work experience student is still making the tea.

   SoÂ weâre just going to get on with todayâs crap joke. No more mucking
   around, no more beating about the bush. Weâre just going to push right
   on, get right to it, with none of the normal flourish or fanfare. So,
   with no further adoâ¦

   Did you hear about the unemployed jester?
   Heâs nobodyâs fool.

   Another one of those, same time tomorrow.

Joke's on those who joke about Japan

By Marco R. della Cava, USA TODAY

   Nothing like a staggering natural disaster to bring out mankind's ...
   worst? While the crisis gripping Japan has tugged on hearts and
   wallets, it also has drawn cracks from cultural figures that redefine
   insensitivity:
     * Comedian Gilbert Gottfried's tweets cost him his longstanding gig
       with the Aflac duck.

       Comedian Gilbert Gottfried's tweets cost him his longstanding gig
       with the Aflac duck.

   By Charles Sykes, AP

   Comedian Gilbert Gottfried's tweets cost him his longstanding gig with
   the Aflac duck.

   o  Comic Gilbert Gottfried was fired Monday as the voice of insurance
   giant Aflac after tweeting jokes such as "They don't go to the beach.
   The beach comes to them."

   o  Family Guywriter Alec Sulkin tweeted that feeling better about the
   quake was just a matter of Googling "Pearl Harbor death toll." Almost
   2,500 died in that 1941 attack; more than 10,000 are feared dead in
   Japan.

   o  Rapper 50 Cent joked that the quake forced him to relocate "all my
   hoes from L.A., Hawaii and Japan." He tweeted in apology: "Some of my
   tweets are ignorant I do it for shock value."

   Is our insta-mouthpiece part of the problem? Don't blame the messenger,
   says Twitter's Sean Garrett, citing "The Tweets Must Flow." The company
   blog memo notes Twitter's inability to police the 100 million daily
   tweets.

   Comedians often do get away with emotional murder. That's their job,
   Joan Rivers tweeted Tuesday in Gottfried's defense: "(Comedians) help
   people in tough times feel better through laughter."

   Too soon, as Rivers' catchphrase asks?

   "There's a line in our culture, but it seems to keep moving," says
   Purdue University history professor Randy Roberts. Before, "a tasteless
   joke wouldn't make it past a cocktail party. Now it reaches millions
   instantly. Don't say something stupid if you don't want people to hear
   it."

   Even so, joking about death may be over the line.

   "People died here -- it's something your parents should have taught you
   never to make fun of," says Teja Arboleda, a former comedian and
   founder of Entertaining Diversity, which advises companies on diversity
   questions. "There's humor that helps us through a tragedy, and humor
   where you kick people when they're down. There's no reason for the
   latter."

   And yet others have piled on, including Glenn Beck (who called the
   quake a "message from God") and pro basketball player Cappie Pondexter
   (ditto). Dan Turner, press secretary for Mississippi Gov. Haley
   Barbour, resigned Monday after circulating a Japan joke to staffers.

   "Japan is always going to be a target for some, as Germany and the
   Middle East might be for others," says Shannon Jowett at New York's
   Japan Society. "But I'd rather focus on the overwhelming sense of
   support we are seeing."

The Official European Joke

   Le lundi, février 7 2011, 12:31 :: belgiom,  best seller,  buzz,

   Traduction française de ce billet disponible ici

   Europe

   European paradise:

   You are invited to an official lunch. You are welcomed by an
   Englishman. Food is prepared by a Frenchman and an Italian puts you in
   the mood and everything is organised by a German.

   European hell:

   You are invited to an official lunch. You are welcomed by a Frenchman.
   Food is prepared by an Englishman, German puts you in the mood but,
   don't worry, everything is organised by an Italian.

   petits drapeaux européens

   That joke was proposed by a Belgian as the Official European Joke, the
   joke that every single European pupil should learn at school. The Joke
   will improve the relationship between the nations as well as promote
   our self humour and our culture.

   The European Council met in order to make a decision. Should the joke
   be the Official European Joke or not?

   The British representative announced, with a very serious face and
   without moving his jaw, that the joke was absolutely hilarious.

   The French one protested because France was depicted in a bad way in
   the joke. He explained that a joke cannot be funny if it is against
   France.

   Poland also protested because they were not depicted in the joke.

   Luxembourg asked who would hold the copyright on the joke. The Swedish
   representative didn't say a word, but looked at everyone with a twisted
   smile.

   Denmark asked where the explicit sexual reference was. If it is a joke,
   there should be one, shouldn't there?

   Holland didn't get the joke, while Portugal didn't understand what a
   "joke" was. Was it a new concept?

   Spain explained that the joke is funny only if you know that the lunch
   was at 13h, which is normally breakfast time. Greece complained that
   they were not aware of that lunch, that they missed an occasion to have
   some free food, that they were always forgotten. Romania then asked
   what a "lunch" was.

   Lithuania et Latvia complained that their translations were inverted,
   which is unacceptable even if it happens all the time. Slovenia told
   them that its own translation was completely forgotten and that they do
   not make a fuss. Slovakia announced that, unless the joke was about a
   little duck and a plumber, there was a mistake in their translation.
   The British representative said that the duck and plumber story seemed
   very funny too.

   Hungary had not finished reading the 120 pages of its own translation
   yet.

   Then, the Belgian representative asked if the Belgian who proposed the
   joke was a Dutch speaking or a French speaking Belgian. Because, in one
   case, he would of course support a compatriot but, in the other case,
   he would have to refuse it, regardless of the quality of the joke.

   To close the meeting, the German representative announced that it was
   nice to have the debate here in Brussels but that, now, they all had to
   make the train to Strasbourg in order to take a decision. He asked that
   someone to wake up the Italian, so as not to miss the train, so they
   can come back to Brussels and announce the decision to the press before
   the end of the day.

   "What decision?" asked the Irish representative.

   And they all agreed it was time for some coffee.

          The joke is certainly done by somebody that never tasted Spanish
          food.

          And yet, the union still beats the hell out of everybody killing
          each other for the past fifty years.

          Haha truely funny! Tho I'm sad Portugal doesn't know what a joke
          is. I'm laughing, tho I guess I'm weird.

          Hey! Italian food is much much much better than the French one!

          Well, actually, I can't think about a thing that French does
          better than Italian :-)

          (you know, it's always the same old love-hate relationship
          between Italy and France)

          ACHTUNG, you forgot to reference the registration ID for the
          proposal. There are procedures for this kind of stuff, you know,
          for a reason.

          ;)

          You know you'll have to do this all over again once Croatia
          joins the EU :)

          The Austrian representative agreed that this was a really nice
          idea and then returned home to make a bug fuss about how the EU
          forces its own agenda undermining the Austrian humor culture

   8. Le mardi, février 8 2011, 02:05 par Ryan James
          And the American doesn't see how that is funny at all. Damn
          Europeans.

   9. Le mardi, février 8 2011, 04:16 par Vicky Katsarova
          Hi there, I find the joke refreshing...and cute.

          And then they all got together and smugly talked about how
          tolerant they all are while they made racist jokes about Turks
          and blacks and Roma, who don't have a place in Europe or its
          official joke.
          HA HA. How long until you people start WW3?

   11. Le mardi, février 8 2011, 08:59 par billy
          that's right, the italian men definitely swallow better

   12. Le mardi, février 8 2011, 11:08 par Joaquim Rocha
          Why was the joke a new concept for the Portuguese?

          This a funny post indeed :D

   13. Le mardi, février 8 2011, 15:19 par PTahead
          I didn't get the joke... of the comments about the joke. Someone
          must be enjoying playing geek without any skill.

          Why the Czechs weren't mentioned? (from FB)

          Czechs first asked the Germans about their thoughts on the
          subject and then promised they'll go with the exact opposite
          provided they'll be backed by the Irish. If not, they'll just
          block the vote. And to support this stance, they approved a new
          voting system and elected Klaus president for the third time.

          Later on, they pointed out that the inability to find consensus
          over the joke clearly suggests that EU is an empty leftist
          concept and ventured out to find the closest buffet.

          Anyway, for them the joke is irrelevant since, obviously,
          'paradise' and 'hell' do not exist.

          Reminds me of the official Canada joke. "Canada could have been
          great. It could have had American technology, British culture
          and French cuisine. Instead, it got French technology, American
          culture and British cuisine.

   17. Le mercredi, février 9 2011, 13:47 par Anita
          Hahaha, great explanation :)

          Indeed, THIS IS EUROPE ! Without each other they can`t live, but
          together they are always quarrelling !

          I translated it in Italian just for sharing (including a link to
          this post). Hope you don't mind.

          The joke was absolutely hilarious.

          There are three conclusions one can draw:
          1) The decision should not be decided in Strasbourg but
          unanimously by all the Parliaments of all the countries
          concerned.
          2) The proposal should then go the mathematicians because they
          are the only ones able to square the circle.
          3) Our politicians have a really tough time in Brussels.

   22. Le vendredi, février 11 2011, 15:19 par Federico Gobbo
          I have just translated your post in Italian, with a couple of
          links to the French and the English variants. I was so
          astonished by your sharpness!

          Here it is:

          There is no such thing as Holland! The state Holland, part of
          the Netherlands, was split in two at the very end of the 18th
          century.

          (Cameron is not PM of England either, is he? Just as people from
          Northern-Ireland are most certainly not English.)

          That aside, I do think that before we should not conclude that
          this is a funny joke until it is accepted by all national
          parliaments. Only then can we be sure the sovereignty of our
          great nations will not be endangered by those reckless
          eurocrats!

          Hand the proposal to the Council of Ministers, they'll know what
          to do with it.

          Portuguese could do everything, invitation, welcoming, food
          preparation, put in the the mood and organise for less money and
          as well as the best in each task. Portuguese do it better, at
          lower prices than the second best. I love Portugal.

   25. Le jeudi, février 17 2011, 23:19 par Frank
          This is funny... i can't understand why

          "while Portugal didn't understand what a "joke" was. Was it a
          new concept?"

          Portugal is the country where people tell more jokes per second.
          It is where the culture of "anedotas" (little and funny stories
          - I don't the exact translation)

          Cultural schizophrenia from true political athletes; this is
          just the tip of the iceberg - thank heavens that federalism
          drowned somewhere near the bottom!

          Excellent =D

   30. Le jeudi, mars 24 2011, 18:59 par Lavaman
          Portugal didn't get the joke?

          The Portuguese people are the funniest people in all of
          Europe...I think this is more of a racist comment made by those
          close-minded Germans, Dutch etc.

   31. Le jeudi, mars 31 2011, 09:51 par melon
          This one is hilarious indeed :)
          For those who seem to lack some well-developed sense of humour,
          well... at least admit that the post has funny parts as well.

          Cheers,
          a Hungarian citizen (whose part in the joke is sad but true ->
          therefore funny)

          Lol :D It doesnt make sense that portuguese don't get the
          joke... believe me :D

          ...and then, turkish supplicated to be accepted in Europe :DD
          ahah

          Good joke

               Engineer, Physicist, Mathematician (EPM) Jokes


Recurring Jokes

   These jokes are circulated by word-of-mouth around engineering,
   physics, amd math departments at universities and industries; Many are
   available on the web.
   The best of the genre work because readers of all 3 persuasions think
   they make out best.
   You'll find many variations of the following jokes out there.

  The &#147;Odd Primes&#148; joke

   Probably the most well known EPM joke of all. Here are 3 versions:

   A mathematician, a physicist and an engineer enter a mathematics
   contest, the first task of which is to prove that all odd number are
   prime. The mathematician has an elegant argument: `1's a prime, 3's a
   prime, 5's a prime, 7's a prime. Therefore, by mathematical induction,
   all odd numbers are prime. It's the physicist's turn: `1's a prime, 3's
   a prime, 5's a prime, 7's a prime, 11's a prime, 13's a prime, so, to
   within experimental error, all odd numbers are prime.' The most
   straightforward proof is provided by the engineer: `1's a prime, 3's a
   prime, 5's a prime, 7's a prime, 9's a prime, 11's a prime ...'.

   How a mathematician, physicist and an engineer prove that all odd
   numbers, (greater than 2), are prime.
   Mathematician: "Well, 3 is prime, 5 is prime and 7 is prime so, by
   induction all odds are prime."
   Physicist: "3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 isn't prime, (bad
   data point), 11 is prime, and so is 13, so all odds are prime."
   Engineer: "3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 is prime, 11 is prime
   13 is prime, so all odds are prime."

   A mathematician, physicist and an engineer are asked whether all odd
   numbers, (greater than 2), are prime. Their responses:
   Mathematician: "Let's see, 3 is prime, 5 is prime and 7 is prime, but 9
   is a counter-example so the statement is false"
   Physicist: "OK, 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 isn't prime, 11
   is prime, and so is 13, so all odds are prime to within experimental
   uncertainty."
   Engineer: "3 is prime, 5 is prime, so all odds are prime."

   Some more variations on the &#147;Odd Primes&#148; joke:

   Several professors were asked to solve the following problem: "Prove
   that all odd integers are prime."
   Mathematician: 3 is a prime, 5 is a prime, 7 is a prime, 9 is not a
   prime - counter-example - claim is false.
   Physicist: 3 is a prime, 5 is a prime, 7 is a prime, 9 is an
   experimental error, 11 is a prime ...
   Engineer: 3 is a prime, 5 is a prime, 7 is a prime, 9 is a prime, 11 is
   a prime ...
   Computer Scientist: 3's a prime, 5's a prime, 7's a prime ...

   Lawyers: one is prime, three is prime, five is prime, seven is prime,
   although there appears to be prima facie evidence that nine is not
   prime, there exists substantial precedent to indicate that nine should
   be considered prime. The following brief presents the case for nine's
   primeness...

   environment which can only be remedied by a federally funded cultural
   enrichment program.

  The &#147;Canned Food&#148; joke:

   There was a mad scientist (a mad SOCIAL scientist) who kidnapped three
   colleagues, an engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician, and locked
   each of them in separate cells with plenty of canned food and water but
   no can opener.
   A month later, returning, the mad scientist went to the engineer's cell
   and found it long empty. The engineer had constructed a can opener from
   pocket trash, used aluminum shavings and dried sugar to make an
   explosive,and escaped.
   The physicist had worked out the angle necessary to knock the lids off
   the tin cans by throwing them against the wall. She was developing a
   good pitching arm and a new quantum theory.
   The mathematician had stacked the unopened cans into a surprising
   solution to the kissing problem; his desicated corpse was propped
   calmly against a wall, and this was inscribed on the floor in blood:
       THEOREM: If I can't open these cans, I'll die.
       PROOF: Assume the opposite ...

   Similarly for chemist, engineer, mathematician:
   The chemist had collected rainwater to corrode the cans of beans so he
   could eat them.
   The engineer had taken apart her bed and made a crude can opener out of
   the parts.
   The mathematician was slouched on the floor, long since dead. Written
   in blood beside the corpse read the following:
      Theorem: If I don't eat the beans I will die.
      Proof: Assume the opposite and seek a contradiction.


  The &#147;Calculation&#148; jokes

   A variant: three professionals, a mathematician, a physicist and an
   engineer, took their final test for the job. The sole question in the
   exam was "how much is one plus one".
   The math dude asked the receptionist for a ream of paper, two hours
   later, he said: I have proven its a natural number
   The physicist, after checking parallax error and quantum tables said:
   its between 1.9999999999, and 2.0000000001
   the engineer quicly said: oh! its easy! its two,.... no, better make it
   three, just to be safe.

   A physicist, an engineer and a mathematician were asked how much three
   times three is.
   The engineer grabbed his pocket calculator, eagerly pressed a couple of
   buttons and announced: "9.0000".
   The physicist made an approximation (with an error estimate) and said:
   "9.00 +/- 0.02".
   The mathematician took a piece of paper and a pencil and sat quietly
   for half an hour. He then returned and proudly declared: There is a
   solution and I have proved that it is unique!

   Mathematician: Pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its
   diameter.
   Engineer: Pi is about 22/7.
   Physicist: Pi is 3.14159 plus or minus 0.000005
   Computer Programmer: Pi is 3.141592653589 in double precision.
   Nutritionist: You one track math-minded fellows, Pie is a healthy and
   delicious dessert!


  The &#147;Fire!&#148; joke

   A physicist, an engineer and a mathematician were all in a hotel
   sleeping when a fire broke out in their respective rooms.
   The physicist woke up, saw the fire, ran over to her desk, pulled out
   her CRC, and began working out all sorts of fluid dynamics equations.
   After a couple minutes, she threw down her pencil, got a graduated
   cylinder out of his suitcase, and measured out a precise amount of
   water. She threw it on the fire, extinguishing it, with not a drop
   wasted, and went back to sleep.
   The engineer woke up, saw the fire, ran into the bathroom, turned on
   the faucets full-blast, flooding out the entire apartment, which put
   out the fire, and went back to sleep. The mathematician woke up, saw
   the fire, ran over to his desk, began working through theorems, lemmas,
   hypotheses , you-name-it, and after a few minutes, put down his pencil
   triumphantly and exclaimed, "I have *proven* that I *can* put the fire
   out!" He then went back to sleep.

   Three employees (an engineer, a physicist and a mathematician) are
   staying in a hotel while attending a technical seminar.
   The engineer wakes up and smells smoke. He goes out into the hallway
   and sees a fire, so he fills a trashcan from his room with water and
   douses the fire. He goes back to bed.
   Later, the physicist wakes up and smells smoke. He opens his door and
   sees a fire in the hallway. He walks down the hall to a fire hose and
   after calculating the flame velocity, distance, water pressure,
   trajectory, etc. extinguishes the fire with the minimum amount of water
   and energy needed.
   Later, the mathematician wakes up and smells smoke. She goes to the
   hall, sees the fire and then the fire hose. She thinks for a moment and
   then exclaims, 'Ah, a solution exists!' and then goes back to bed.

   A physicist and a mathematician are in the faculty lounge having a cup
   of coffee when, for no apparent reason, the coffee machine bursts into
   flames. The physicist rushes over to the wall, grabs a fire
   extinguisher, and fights the fire successfully. The same time next
   week, the same pair are there drinking coffee and talking shop when the
   new coffee machine goes on fire. The mathematician stands up, fetches
   the fire extinguisher, and hands it to the physicist, thereby reducing
   the problem to one already solved...


  The &#147;Zeno's Paradox&#148; joke

   In the high school gym, all the girls in the class were lined up
   against one wall, and all the boys against the opposite wall. Then,
   every ten seconds, they walked toward each other until they were half
   the previous distance apart. A mathematician, a physicist, and an
   engineer were asked, "When will the girls and boys meet?"
   The mathematician said: "Never."
   The physicist said: "In an infinite amount of time."
   The engineer said: "Well... in about two minutes, they'll be close
   enough for all practical purposes."


  The &#147;Herding Sheep&#148; joke

   An engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician are shown a pasture with
   a herd of sheep, and told to put them inside the smallest possible
   amount of fence. The engineer is first. He herds the sheep into a
   circle and then puts the fence around them, declaring, "A circle will
   use the least fence for a given area, so this is the best solution."
   The physicist is next. She creates a circular fence of infinite radius
   around the sheep, and then draws the fence tight around the herd,
   declaring, "This will give the smallest circular fence around the
   herd." The mathematician is last. After giving the problem a little
   thought, he puts a small fence around himself and then declares, "I
   define myself to be on the outside!"


  The &#147;Black Sheep&#148; joke

   An astronomer, a physicist and a mathematician (it is said) were
   holidaying in Scotland. Glancing from a train window, they observed a
   black sheep in the middle of a field.
   "How interesting," observed the astronomer, "all scottish sheep are
   black!"
   To which the physicist responded, "No, no! Some Scottish sheep are
   black!"
   The mathematician gazed heavenward in supplication, and then intoned,
   "In Scotland there exists at least one field, containing at least one
   sheep, at least one side of which is black."


  The &#147;Metajoke&#148;

   An engineer, a physicist and a mathematician find themselves in an
   anecdote, indeed an anecdote quite similar to many that you have no
   doubt already heard. After some observations and rough calculations the
   engineer realizes the situation and starts laughing. A few minutes
   later the physicist understands too and chuckles to herself happily as
   she now has enough experimental evidence to publish a paper. This
   leaves the mathematician somewhat perplexed, as he had observed right
   away that he was the subject of an anecdote, and deduced quite rapidly
   the presence of humour from similar anecdotes, but considers this
   anecdote to be too trivial a corollary to be significant, let alone
   funny.


Miscellaneous Single Jokes

   These jokes don't seem as common or varied, but still get the point(s)
   across.

   What is the difference between and engineer, a physicist, and a
   mathimatician?
   An engineer believes equations approximate the world.
   A physicist believes the world approximates equations.
   A mathematician sees no connection between the two.

   The three umpires at an amateur baseball game, an engineer, a physicist
   and a mathematician during the week, all call a player out on what
   could only be described as a close call. The coach of the player who
   thought he'd made the base asked the umpires why they'd called his
   player out.
   The engineer replied ``He's out 'cause I called it as it was.''
   The physicist replied ``He's out 'cause I called it like I saw it.''
   The mathematician replied ``He's out 'cause I called him out.''

   A farmer, an engineer, and a physicist were all asked to build a
   chicken coop. The farmer says, "Well, last time I had so many chickens
   and my coop was so and so big and this time I have this many chickens
   so I'll make it this much bigger and that oughtta work just fine." The
   engineer tackles the problem by surverying, costing materials, reading
   up on chickens and their needs, writing down a bunch of equations to
   maximise chicken-to-cost ratio, taking into account the lay of the land
   and writing a computer program to solve. The physicist looks at the
   problem and says, "Let's start by assuming spherical chickens....".

   A mathematician, a biologist and a physicist are sitting in a street
   cafe watching people going in and coming out of the house on the other
   side of the street. First they see two people going into the house.
   Time passes. After a while they notice three persons coming out of the
   house.
   The physicist: "One of the two measurements wasn't very accurate."
   The biologist: "They have reproduced".
   The mathematician: "If now exactly one person enters the house then it
   will be empty again."

   A physicist, an engineer, and a statistician were out game hunting. The
   engineer spied a bear in the distance, so they got a little closer.
   "Let me take the first shot!" said the engineer, who missed the bear by
   three metres to the left. "You're incompetent! Let me try" insisted the
   physicist, who then proceeded to miss by three metres to the right.
   "Ooh, we *got* him!!" said the statistician.

   A physicist and an engineer are in a hot-air balloon. They've been
   drifting for hours, and have no idea where they are. They see another
   person in a balloon, and call out to her: "Hey, where are we?" She
   replies, "You're in a balloon," and drifts off again. The engineer says
   to the physicist, "That person was obviously a mathematician." They
   physicist replies, "How do you know that?" "Because what she said was
   completely true, but utterly useless."

   A mathematician, a physicist and an engineer are each given $50 to
   measure the height of a building.
   The mathematician buys a ruler and a sextant, and by determining the
   angle subtended by the building a certain distance away from the base,
   he establishes the height of the building.
   The physicist buys a heavy ball and a stopwatch, climbs to the top of
   the building and drops the ball. By measuring the time it takes to hit
   the bottom, he establishes the height of the building.
   The engineer puts $40 into his pocket. By slipping the doorman the
   other ten, he establishes the height of the building.

                        Freud, Sigmund
                        The Joke and Its Relation to the Unconscious
     __________________________________________________________________

   Keywords Communication, Doctor-Patient Relationship, History of

   Summary The book is split into three parts, the Analytic Part, the
   Synthetic Part and the Theoretical Part. The Analytic Part begins with
   an excellent synopsis of earlier theories of comedy, joking and wit,
   followed by a meticulous psychological taxonomy of jokes based on such
   features as wordplay, brevity, and double meanings, richly illustrated
   with examples. This section ends with Freud's famous distinction about
   the "tendencies" of a joke, in which he attempts to separate those
   jokes that have tendencies towards hidden meanings or with a specific
   hidden or partly hidden purpose, from the "abstract" or
   "non-tendentious" jokes, which are completely innocuous. He struggles
   to provide any examples of the latter. In the midst of his first
   example, he suddenly admits that he begins "to doubt whether I am right
   in claiming that this is an un-tendentious joke"(89) and his next
   example is a joke that he claims is non-tendentious, but which he
   elsewhere studies quite intensely for its tendencies. Freud uses this
   to springboard into an exploration of how a joke involves an
   arrangement of people - a joketeller, an audience/listener, and a butt,
   often involving two (the jokester and the listener) against one, who is
   often a scapegoat. He describes how jokes may be sexual, "stripping"
   that person, and then turns towards how jokes package hostility or
   cynicism.
   The synthetic part is an attempt to bring together the structure of the
   joke and the pleasurable tendencies of the joke. Why is it that jokes
   are pleasurable? Freud's answer is that there is a pleasure to be
   obtained from the saving of psychic energy: dangerous feelings of
   hostility, aggression, cynicism or sexuality are expressed, bypassing
   the internal and external censors, and thus enjoyed. He considers other
   possible sources of pleasure, including recognition, remembering,
   appreciating topicality, relief from tension, and the pleasures of
   nonsense and of play. Then, in a move that would either baffle his
   critics or is ignored by them, Freud turns to jokes as a "social
   process", recognizing that jokes may say more about social life at a
   particular time than about particular people; he turns this into an
   investigation of why people joke together, expanding on his economical
   psychic perspectives with discussions of social cohesion and social
   aggression.
   In the third part, Freud connects his theories of joking with his dream
   theories in order to explain some of the more baffling aspects of
   joking (including how jokes seem to come from nowhere; how we usually
   get the joke so very quickly, even when it expresses very complicated
   social phenomena; and why we get a particular type of pleasure from an
   act of communication). He ends with an examination of some of these
   themes in other varieties of the comic, such as physical comedy and
   caricature.
   Commentary This book is one of Freud's more accessible forays into
   culture and the psychologies of social life, with less investment in
   the psychoanalytic process as a form of therapy than some of his other
   books, and fewer discussions of doctor-patient relationships; but such
   topics are never far from his mind. What do we learn about people from
   the jokes they tell? Why do we joke? Why does laughter seem
   involuntary? Why is something so common and universal so difficult to
   explain? These are some of the questions Freud tackles. His idea that
   jokes package a tremendous amount of hostility was not new nor was the
   idea that joking is an emotional catharsis (and Freud duly acknowledges
   his sources). But, in a structuralist move par excellence, he explores
   how the semantic forms of joking relate to psychological forms: the
   brevity, the word play, the grammatical and semantic relations.
   It is unfortunate that critics of Freud so rarely offer as considered
   an account of his work as the one he offers of general theories of
   comedy at the outset of Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious.
   The first few pages are a concise, astute, and accurate synopsis of the
   theories of comedy. Some of his own ideas, such as the way he maps
   economies onto our psyche, may seem awkward, but they are worth
   considering and this is one book where his novel ideas about comedy
   are, if not impossible to prove or disprove, also worth considering.
   Freud proposes a number of theoretical approaches to understanding
   jokes and wit, built up around the idea that joking is not just about
   laughter replacing anxiety and fear but is also a way of expressing
   unconscious thoughts related to maturity, social control, sexuality and
   aggression in daily life, all of which takes place in a public and
   social milieu.
   His work very much bridges older theories of joking, such as a
   Hobbesian superiority or catharsis, with social and anthropological
   theories, such as Henri Bergson's or Mary Douglas's. Those who offer a
   synopsis of Freud's thinking about jokes based on one theory - e.g.,
   that he thinks that jokes emerge from an unconscious aggression as a
   way of bypassing the internal censor - have not familiarized themselves
   with the many different approaches Freud takes in this book, and the
   way in which he openly struggles with the nebulous terrain of comedy
   and how science might approach this psychological, social, cognitive
   and cultural phenomenon.

           No Laughing Matter: The Viola Joke as Musician's Folklore

   Presented by Carl Rahkonen at the National Meeting of the American
   Folklore Society and the Society for Ethnomusicology, October 21, 1994,
   Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Copyright (c) 1994.

   The author has requested that if you quote any of this information,
   please cite this paper.

   As with any other group, musicians tell stories and jokes to one
   another based upon their specialized knowledge and experience. In
   recent years there has been a joke cycle among musicians pertaining to
   the viola. For those of you not familiar with the viola, it is slightly
   larger than the violin, and plays the alto, or middle-range voice in
   the string section of an orchestra.

   Being a violist myself, and also an ethnomusicologist trained folklore,
   I have paid particular attention to the telling of viola jokes, and
   over the past three years have personally collected fifty examples.
   From the number of different musicians who told me these jokes, I can
   conclude that they were being told in music departments, in major
   symphony orchestras, regional and community orchestras, and were even
   being told in orchestras abroad.

   As further evidence of the pervasiveness of the viola joke cycle, I
   have heard several programs on WQED, the Pittsburgh classical music
   radio station that have featured viola jokes. I have seen viola jokes
   published in the Pittsburgh Musician, the newsletter of the American
   Federation of Musicians Local 60-471. The Cleveland Plain Dealer on
   Sunday March 27th, 1994 featured an article on the viola section of the
   Cleveland Orchestra, which begins with the line "Hold the viola jokes."
   Also, cartoonists have featured the viola in some of their recent work.
   [examples were shown]

   Going strictly by the number of jokes I personally heard, the viola
   joke cycle began in 1992, reached it peak in 1993, and at the present
   time has greatly diminished.

   In order to organize these jokes, I have arranged them into six
   different categories, which are not necessary mutually exclusive:
    1. Jokes disparaging the viola itself.
    2. Jokes disparaging viola players.
    3. Jokes which offer a general disparagement, which can be easily
       understood outside musical circles.
    4. Jokes which usually can only be understood by among musicians.
    5. Reverse jokes which get revenge on musicians telling viola jokes.
       All the viola jokes in these first five categories are in the form
       of a question and answer, so I have added a sixth category which I
       call
    6. Narrative viola jokes

   [author's list of viola jokes here, all of which appear on the viola
   jokes page.]

   As you may have guessed by now the viola is considered somewhat a
   second-class citizen in the orchestra. There are several reasons for
   this. Orchestral viola parts are easier than violin parts and they tend
   to be the less important, non-melodic parts. If viola players do get
   difficult parts, as they do from time to time, they tend to struggle
   while trying to play them.

   As an instrument, the viola does not have the same carrying power as a
   violin or cello, since it is pitched one-fifth lower than a violin, but
   is only about 10% larger. Its solo literature is very limited. Only
   string bassists tend to suffer the same stereotyping as violists,
   because of a lack of solo literature for the instrument and having
   mundane orchestral parts.

   An additional handicap is the fact that most violists start out as
   violinists. Even the greatest violist of recent times, William
   Primrose, in his book Playing the Viola, includes a chapter about
   coming to viola playing by way of the violin. The Cleveland Plain
   Dealer article I mentioned earlier revealed that ten out of the eleven
   violists in Cleveland Orchestra started out on the violin! One of the
   first assumptions in junior high school orchestras is that the director
   will switch the poor violinists over to viola, where they will do less
   harm, and perhaps even contribute. Viola players are frequently
   considered inferior musicians since they are thought of as the ones who
   couldn't make it playing the violin.

   An additional factor is the extremely hierarchical structure of a
   symphony orchestra with regards to musical authority. The conductor is
   the highest authority. The next highest is the concertmaster, who is
   the first chair, first violin. The brass, wind, and percussion players
   are typically all soloists playing one person to a part, so the real
   pecking order can be seen primarily in the string sections. Each of the
   string sections has a principal player, whose job it is to lead that
   section, giving specific directions with regards to bowings, fingers
   and phrasings. The principal players also gets to play the solo parts,
   if there are any. Each of the string sections are seated in
   hierarchical order, with the better players near the front.
   Superimposed of this hierarchy is an overall hierarchy in the strings.
   The first violins are the most important, almost always playing the
   chief melodies. The cellos are perhaps the next most important,
   followed by second violins, violas and string basses. The violas are
   always at, or near the bottom, of the hierarchy.

   There is an historical reason for this. In the beginning of the era
   when symphonies began, comparatively few pieces had actual viola parts.
   As a rule the violas doubled the cellos, switching octaves whenever
   necessary. Early symphonies were published with three string parts, 1st
   violin, 2nd violin and bass. The poor violas dragged along with the
   basses, and were frequently played by individuals who couldn't handle
   the violin.

   The attitude and stereotype about the viola and its players can be seen
   quotations about the viola from a standard reference work, The
   Dictionary of Musical Quotations (Ian Crofton and Donald Fraser,
   Schirmer Books, 1985, p.152):

     "The viola is commonly (with rare exceptions) played by infirm
     violinists, or by decrepit players of wind instruments who happen to
     have been acquainted with a string instrument once upon a time."
     Richard Wagner, in 1869, quoted in Gattey Peacocks on the Podium
     (1982).

     "If you'd heard the violas when I was young, you'd take a bismuth
     tablet."
     Sir John Barbirolli, quoted in Kennedy, Barbirolli Conductor
     Laureate (1971).

   So why are viola jokes told? Certainly for fun and humor, but they also
   serve the functions of reinforcing the hierarchical structure of the
   orchestra and to voice unspoken but widely understood stereotypes. A
   joke will be funny only if it is unanticipated and if there is some
   basis to it in reality.

   Irvin Kauffman, the Associate Principal Cellist of the Pittsburgh
   Symphony, was a significant informant for viola jokes. He assured me
   that the violists of the Pittsburgh Symphony are just as fine musicians
   as the rest of the orchestra, and that other musicians tell viola jokes
   because, "The violas get paid the same money for doing a dumb (i.e.,
   easier) job!"

To Catch a (Joke) Thief: Professors Study Intellectual Property Norms in
Stand-up Comedy

     News Source: Law

     December 10, 2008 -- In part, it was a viral video of two well-known
     comedians hurling obscenities at each other that prompted a pair of
     University of Virginia law professors to take a serious look at how
     professional comics protect themselves from joke theft.
     In February 2007, stand-up comedians Joe Rogan and Carlos Mencia
     squared off on stage at a prominent Los Angeles comedy club after
     Rogan accused Mencia -- whom he dubbed "Carlos Menstealia" -- of
     pilfering material from other comedians. A video of the altercation
     garnered more than 2 million views online and countless mentions on
     blogs and Web sites.
     "The two of them had an almost physical fight on stage where they
     were yelling at each other about the accusation of joke stealing,
     and Mencia was denying it," said Chris Sprigman, who with faculty
     colleague Dotan Oliar authored an upcoming Virginia Law Review
     article, "There's No Free Laugh (Anymore): The Emergence of
     Intellectual Property Norms and the Transformation of Stand-Up
     Comedy."
     The Mencia-Rogan argument led the two intellectual property law
     scholars to an interesting question: With scant legal protection for
     their work -- copyright law plays little role in comedy -- why are
     stand-up comedians willing to invest time and energy developing
     routines that could be stolen without legal penalty?
     After almost a year of research that included interviews with
     comedians ranging from comedy club circuit neophytes to seasoned
     veterans of television specials, Oliar and Sprigman found that the
     world of stand-up comedy has a well-developed system of social norms
     designed to protect original jokes -- and that the system functions
     as a stand-in for copyright law.
     "Most of our research over the last year has been trying to piece
     together all the attributes of this system that comedians have
     started up and run for themselves," Sprigman said.
     In their paper, published in the December edition of the Virginia
     Law Review, Oliar and Sprigman identify several of the informal
     rules that govern stand-up comedy.
     The most obvious is the prohibition against joke stealing, which
     resembles formal intellectual property law in spirit. But the
     researchers found other comedy norms don't closely adhere to the law
     on the books.
     "Under regular copyright law, if two people write a book together,
     they are co-owners of the copyright," Oliar said. "With comedians,
     if one comedian comes up with a premise for a joke, but another
     supplies the punch line, the guy who came up with the premise owns
     the joke. The guy who came up with the punch line knows that he
     doesn't get an ownership stake, he's just volunteering a punch line
     to the other guy."
     The stand-up community also has enforcement methods for violators.
     The first step a comedian takes if he feels another is stealing his
     material is to go and talk to the suspected culprit, Oliar said. The
     two try to determine whether one of them has copied the joke from
     the other or whether they each came up with it independently. In the
     process, they may compare notes on who has been doing the joke
     longer, and appeal to third-party witnesses if necessary to settle
     the facts.
     In some cases, the offending comedian may not even have realized
     that he or she didn't come up with a joke, Sprigman and Oliar said.
     "We heard one story where a guy was confronted by his best friend.
     He said 'Oh, you're right,' and he stopped doing the joke. It's
     called subconscious copying, and it is also actionable in copyright
     law. While creating, you're not aware that you heard it somewhere
     before," Oliar said.
     Other arrangements could include the comedians sorting out how each
     one should tell the joke, or in what geographic area. In some cases,
     they simply agree not to do the joke if they are on the same bill.
     Most joke ownership disagreements -- perhaps as many as 90 to 95
     percent -- can be settled this way, Oliar said.
     But when negotiation doesn't work, the comedy community has its own
     methods for punishing violators. During his on-stage confrontation
     with Rogan, Mencia was on the receiving end of one of the most
     potent techniques comedians use to deter joke thievery: venomous
     ridicule.
     The stand-up community is relatively small, and is made up of a few
     thousand practitioners, many of whom see each other with some
     regularity. So word gets around if someone is a joke stealer, and
     other comedians make the workplace uncomfortable for the alleged
     thief.
     "We just heard over and over again that the bad-mouthing sanction
     was something that created an unpleasant environment for the accused
     comic to be in," Sprigman said.
     Sometimes, affronted comedians will refuse to work with a suspected
     joke thief. As many comedy clubs require multiple comedians to fill
     up a bill, this can be an effective form of punishment because it
     hits the perpetrator in the wallet and robs them of desired
     exposure, Oliar said.
     A third, less-frequently used sanction is physical violence, or at
     least the threat of it.
     "This is not very common," Oliar said. "Comedians aren't bullies
     generally. They are funny people and they don't want to end up in
     jail over a joke, as one of them told us. But still, since the
     confrontation is one-on-one and it's very loaded, and since there
     have been cases of actual violence and stories about it abound among
     comedians, there is always the fear that it might happen. Certainly
     threats of violence are much more common among comedians than actual
     violence."
     For Sprigman and Oliar, the study of stand-up comedy has
     ramifications for the larger world of intellectual property law, or
     the body of law that protects creative works through devices such as
     patents, trademarks and copyrights.
     The underpinning of such law is the notion that without it, theft
     would be so rampant that there would be no incentive to create or
     innovate, Oliar said.
     "For us, the most salient observation is that the law has not done
     the job of protecting jokes, but the joke market has not failed. The
     market is substituting this set of informal rules for the formal
     ones, and as far as we can see it's doing a pretty good job,"
     Sprigman said.
     In their research of stand-up comedy, the pair found that as the
     nature of stand-up evolved, so did the stand-up community's system
     of protecting itself from joke thieves.
     "It's very costly and very hard to come up with funny jokes. It's
     actually a long process; you don't just work in your room and then
     you have it. You have to try it out and see if people laugh. A lot
     of them, you write and you think it's funny -- try it out and people
     don't laugh, so you change the words and you work the stand-up
     circuit night after night. It takes time to make a joke funny and
     make a joke actually work," Oliar said.
     Today's stand-up is individualized and driven by a comic's unique
     point of view. But it wasn't always so. Before the 1960s, most
     stand-up comedians used a rapid delivery of short, one-liner
     "jokey-jokes" that were more or less interchangeable. Some would get
     these zingers -- which included the ever-present ethnic jokes or
     mother-in-law jokes -- from joke books or other sources. Some would
     also steal. The emphasis, Sprigman said, was on the delivery, not
     the content of the joke, and joke theft was not only rampant but
     also more or less accepted.
     "Then in the '60s, we have this norm system arising, and suddenly
     it's the new era of stand-up as we know it today, which is very
     individual, personal and point-of-view driven. People don't just
     stand and tell jokes that came from a book," Oliar said.
     During their research, Sprigman and Oliar found a high degree of
     interdependence between the changing nature of stand-up comedy and
     the emergence of the norm system to govern joke theft.
     "So typically we talk about intellectual property law having an
     impact on how much innovation we get, but here we see an impact of
     intellectual property protection on what kind of innovation we get,
     which is a totally different thing," Sprigman said.
     Both men stressed that joke theft is not common in the world of
     stand-up comedy, and that most comedians pride themselves on
     creating original material.
     One potential downside to the social norm system as opposed to
     formal legal protection is that social norms might not be effective
     at punishing comedians who get to the top of the field, they said.
     "If a successful comedian doesn't care too much about the
     community's feelings toward him, then he's hard to discipline,"
     Sprigman said. "But keep in mind that the formal law doesn't always
     work either. There are all kinds of copyright rules that apply to
     the music industry, but there are millions of people illegally
     downloading songs.
     "There's always a slippage between the law on the books, or the
     rules in the norms system, and the ability of these rules to be
     enforced."

Don't joke the monkeys

   October 20, 2011 @ 12:41 am · Filed by Victor Mair under Lost in
   translation

                       « previous post | next post »

   I believe that the following photographs are exclusive for Language
   Log, since they were taken by Ori Tavor in Sichuan province this past
   summer, and I don't think that he has sent them anywhere else.

   I'll first say where the photographs were taken and generally what
   category they fall into, and then explain each of them briefly. They
   will not each receive the full-dress treatment I usually give Chinglish
   specimens, both because there are too many of them and because they're
   fairly obvious.

   No.1 and no.5 are classic examples of translation software. No. 1 was
   taken next to the Wenshu (Manjusri) monastery in Chengdu and no. 5 was
   taken outside Baoding Temple at the foot of Emei Shan.

   No.2 and no.3 are apparently part of the PRC's ongoing war against
   disorderly urination ("the lesser convenience"), a topic that we have
   touched upon many times on Language Log. They were taken at the Big
   Buddha site in Leshan and on Mt. Emei.

   No.4 was taken at the entrance hall to the Mt. Emei site.

   No.6 was taken on Mt. Emei, where monkeys are a real menace.

   Sāzi dòuhuā 撒子豆花 is a kind of super-soft bean curd with veggies, etc.
   sprinkled on top (sā 撒 means "spread" and zi 子 is a colloquial suffix).
   Google Translate renders sāzi dòuhuā 撒子豆花 as "spread sub-curd". The
   translator may have thought that sāzi sounds like "Caesar", although
   the latter is usually rendered in Mandarin as Kǎisǎ 凯撒. It is possible
   that the "sub-" of "sub-curd" somehow triggered "Caesar sub". Indeed,
   when we put "Caesar sub" in Google Translate, the Chinese rendering
   comes out as sāzi 撒子! That's about as far as I want to go with this
   one.

   This sign over a urinal enjoins gentlemen to "tiējìn zìrán, kàojìn
   fāngbiàn" 贴近自然，靠近方便 ("get close to nature, step forward to urinate"),
   i.e., don't do it on the floor.

   Xiàng qián yī xiǎo bù, wénmíng yī dà bù 向前一小步，文明一大步 ("one small step
   forward [to urinate], one big step forward for civilization"). Shades
   of Neil Armstrong!

   The translation of mièhuǒqì xiāng 灭火器箱 as "fire extinguisher box"
   presents no problems. What is curious here is the way the painter of
   the sign has broken up the three English words into four clumps in an
   attempt to match the four Chinese characters. This is the opposite
   treatment from running together all the letters of English words, which
   used to be common in Chinglish signs, but has become increasingly less
   so in recent years.

   The sign advertises that this inn is the Jù mín shānzhuāng 巨民山庄 ("Villa
   of Giants") and that its services and amenities include zhùsù 住 宿
   ("lodging"), cānyǐn 餐饮 ("food and drink"), xiūxián 休闲 ("rest;
   leisure"), yúlè 娱乐 ("entertainment"), and cháshuǐ 茶水 ("tea [water]",
   cf. German "Teewasser").

   The sign politely informs the public: cǐ chù yě hóu xiōngměng, qǐng wù
   xì hóu 此处野猴凶猛，请勿戏猴 ("the monkeys here are fierce; do not tease / play
   with the monkeys").

   The allure of Chinglish never fades. More charming examples on the way.

       I've only ever encountered a transitive use of "to joke" (meaning
       "to kid, to toy with") in Hemingway (The Sun Also Rises.) I wonder
       if the translation software picked that up from him. Occam's razor
       says no.

       More likely the muppet Zoe: http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Zoe than
       Hemingway.
       But actually I think transitive 'to joke' is fairly common, it's
       the kind of cute mistake that children often make and so has been
       adopted into slang. See also Lady GaGa lyric:

       It's nothing that elaborate — 戏 in Chinese has multiple
       translations (joke, tease, play, make fun) and can be transitive or
       intransitive. Either their translation software didn't account for
       the difference in English, or they checked a Chinese-English
       dictionary and went with the first word that seemed right, again
       not distinguishing the transitive from the intransitive.
       For the record, Google Translate renders the phrase as "do not play
       monkey," which I think is actually a valid translation (as in
       "don't act like a monkey"). Baidu Fanyi produces "don't monkey
       show," treating 戏猴 as a fixed expression. Google also translates 戏猴
       by itself as "monkey show."

       @F and Benvenuto, here's a Lily Allen lyric:

       poking me"

       The fire extingui sher box seems to be a widespread thing — I saw
       one in Xi'an last year.

       I've been aware of transitive 'joke' as in Lily Allen's 'You must
       be joking me' among British-English speakers for at least 20 years
       now, possibly longer - there's some comment about it dating from
       2005 here http://painintheenglish.com/case/412
       which claims the transitive use is noted in the OED (I'm not able
       to check this myself at the moment.) I would have guessed it was
       largely a British idiom, but Lady Gaga's use of it would suggest
       that it is in US English too.
       My guess is that it derives from the more common, and definitely
       transitive, 'you must be kidding me.'

       Ooh, my husband can confirm the existence of the "One small step
       ahead, one giant leap in civility" sign–I remember he commented on
       it at the airport in Guilin.
    8. Aaron Toivo said,
       October 20, 2011 @ 8:00 am
       "Joke" is commonly transitive, it just normally takes a subclause
       or a quotation as its complement ("He joked that you can't get down
       off an elephant", and so forth). The anomaly here lies in "joke"
       taking a simple noun as its complement, not in having one.
       But "you must be joking me" is an idiom that isn't productive: you
       can't change the verb's tense (*you must have joked me), and you
       can't easily change the pronoun to 2nd or 3rd person (??you must be
       joking him).
    9. Steve F said,
       October 20, 2011 @ 8:02 am
       The earliest occurrence of 'you must be joking me' in Google books
       is 1943 and is American.

       Is "increasingly less so" standard? I suppose it probably is, but
       it tripped my interesting-dar, and I had to re-read it a couple
       times.
   11. Joe McVeigh said,
       October 20, 2011 @ 11:13 am
       It's obviously a Public Enemy reference ("The monkey ain't no joke"
       - Gett Off My Back).
       The Chinese National Park Service be kicking it old school.
       Respect.

       The two urinal signs are at least reasonably good English, even if
       the first one substituted "civilized" for "close to nature".
       Is the third ideogram in the fire extinguisher photo ever
       pronounced "sher"? If so, it would be a nice pun.
   13. Nelson said,
       October 20, 2011 @ 9:17 pm
       I would guess the use of "civilized" is chosen deliberately: "Get
       close to nature" would sound a little strange in English, and I'm
       not sure I'd know what it meant. Those two do seem
       human-translated.
   14. Rodger C said,
       October 21, 2011 @ 8:10 am
       Is this related to the obsolete meaning of "nature" as a euphemism
       for genitals? Uh, no.
   15. Brendan said,
       October 23, 2011 @ 9:15 am
       I think the "sub" in 凯撒子豆花 must come from "子" in the sense of e.g.
       子公司 (subsidiary company).

       Caesar Salad has its Chinese version now!!!!!!!!!! LOL!!!!!!!!!!
       This post made me laugh so hard that I slipped off the chair in the
       middle of night and my roommate knocks asks if anything goes wrong…
       It's surprising how the translation software now can adjust order
       of wording like the last picture does…
       But how is 住宿 in any way related to put up?
       I actually googled 撒子豆花 right after I read this amazing post…:D
   17. Ted said,
       November 4, 2011 @ 10:24 pm
       Lareina: in English, "put up" is idiomatic and has as one of its
       meanings "house" (v.t.). So "I put him up for a couple of nights"
       means "he was a guest in my house for a couple of nights." I
       actually understood this correctly through the logical chain "put
       up" –> "we can put you up" –> "rooms are available."

   Humor is a performative pragmatic accomplishment involving a wide range
   of communication skills including, but not exclusively involving,
   language, gesture, the presentation of visual imagery, and situation
   management. Humor aims at creating a concrete feeling of enjoyment for
   an audience, most commonly manifested in a physical display consisting
   of displays of pleasure including smiles and laughter..

   The basis for most humor is the setting up of a surprise or series of
   surprises for an audience. The most common kind of surprise has since
   the eighteenth century been described under the general rubric of
   "incongruity." Basic incongruity theory as an explanation of humor can
   be described in linguistic terms as follows: A communicative actor
   presents a message or other content material and contextualizes it
   within a cognitive "frame." The actor constructs the frame through
   narration, visual representation, or enactment. He or she then suddenly
   pulls this frame aside, revealing one or more additional cognitive
   frames which audience members are shown as possible contextualizations
   or reframings of the original content material. The tension between the
   original framing and the sudden reframing results in an emotional
   release recognizable as the enjoyment response we see as smiles,
   amusement, and laughter. This tension is the driving force that
   underlies humor, and the release of that tension-as Freud pointed
   out-is a fundamental human behavioral reflex.

   Humor, of all forms of communicative acts, is one of the most heavily
   dependent on equal cooperative participation of actor and audience. The
   audience, in order to enjoy humor must "get" the joke. This means they
   must be capable of analyzing the cognitive frames presented by the
   actor and following the process of the creation of the humor.

   Typically, humor involves four stages, the setup, the paradox, the
   denouement, and the release. The setup involves the presentation of the
   original content material and the first interpretive frame. The paradox
   involves the creation of the additional frame or frames. The denouement
   is the point at which the initial and subsequent frames are shown to
   coexist, creating tension. The release is the enjoyment registered by
   the audience in the process of realization and the release resulting
   therefrom.

   The communicative actor has a great deal to consider in creating humor.
   He or she must assess the audience carefully, particularly regarding
   their pre-existing knowledge. A large portion of the comic effect of
   humor involves the audience taking a set interpretive frame for granted
   and then being surprised when the actor shows their assumptions to be
   unwarranted at the point of denouement. Thus the actor creating humor
   must be aware of, and use the audience's taken-for-granted knowledge
   effectively. Some of the simplest examples of such effective use
   involve playing on assumptions about the conventional meanings of words
   or conversational routines. Comedian Henny Youngman's classic
   one-liner: "Take my wife . . . please!" is an excellent example. In
   just four words and a pause, Youngman double-frames the word "take"
   showing two of its discourse usages: as an introduction to an example,
   and as a direct command/request. The double framing is completed by the
   word "please." The pause is crucial. It allows the audience to set up
   an expectation that Youngman will be providing them with an example,
   which is then frustrated with his denouement. The content that is
   re-framed is of course the phrase "my wife."

   In this way the work of comedians and the work of professional
   magicians is similar. Both use misdirection and double-framing in order
   to produce a denouement and an effect of surprise. The response to
   magic tricks is frequently the same as to humor-delight, smiles and
   laughter with the added factor of puzzlement at how the trick was
   accomplished.

   Humans structure the presentation of humor through numerous forms of
   culture-specific communicative events. All cultures have some form of
   the joke, a humorous narrative with the denouement embodied in a
   punchline. Some of the best joke-tellers make their jokes seem to be
   instances of normal conversational narrative. Only after the punchline
   does the audience realize that the narrator has co-opted them into
   hearing a joke. In other instances, the joke is identified as such
   prior to its narration through a conversational introduction, and the
   audience expects and waits for the punchline. The joke is a kind of
   master form of humorous communication. Most other forms of humor can be
   seen as a variation of this form, even non-verbal humor.

   Freud theorized that jokes have only two purposes: aggression and
   exposure. The first purpose (which includes satire and defense) is
   fulfilled through the hostile joke, and the second through the dirty
   joke. Humor theorists have debated Freud's claims extensively. The
   mechanisms used to create humor can be considered separately from the
   purposes of humor, but, as will be seen below, the purposes are
   important to the success of humorous communication.

   Just as speech acts must be felicitous in the Austinian sense, in order
   to function, jokes must fulfill a number of performative criteria in
   order to achieve a humorous effect and bring the audience to a release.
   These performative criteria center on the successful execution of the
   stages of humor creation.

   The setup must be adequate. Either the actor must either be skilled in
   presenting the content of the humor or be astute in judging what the
   audience will assume from their own cultural knowledge, or from the
   setting in which the humor is created.

   The successful creation of the paradox requires that the alternative
   interpretive frame or frames be presented adequately and be plausible
   and comprehensible to the audience.

   The denouement must successfully present the juxtaposition of
   interpretive frames. If the actor does not present the frames in a
   manner that allows them to be seen together, the humor fails.

   If the above three communicational acts are carried out successfully,
   tension release in laughter should proceed. The release may be genuine
   or feigned. Jokes are such well-known communicational structures in
   most societies that audience members will smile, laugh, or express
   appreciation as a communicational reflex even when they have not found
   the joke to be humorous. The realization that people laugh when
   presentations with humorous intent are not seen as humorous leads to
   further question of why humor fails even if its formal properties are
   well structured.

   One reason that humor may fail when all of its formal performative
   properties are adequately executed is-homage a Freud-that the purpose
   of the humor may be overreach its bounds. It may be so overly
   aggressive toward someone present in the audience or to individuals or
   groups they revere; or so excessively ribald that it is seen by the
   audience as offensive. Humor and offensiveness are not mutually
   exclusive, however. An audience may be affected by the paradox as
   revealed in the denouement of the humor despite their ethical or moral
   objections and laugh in spite of themselves (perhaps with some feelings
   of shame). Likewise, what one audience finds offensive, another
   audience may find humorous.

   Another reason humor may fail is that the paradox is not sufficiently
   surprising or unexpected to generate the tension necessary for release
   in laughter. Children's humor frequently has this property for adults.
   Similarly, the paradox may be so obscure or difficult to perceive that
   the audience may be confused. They know that humor was intended in the
   communication because they understand the structure of humorous
   discourse, but they cannot understand what it is in the discourse that
   is humorous. This is a frequent difficulty in humor presented
   cross-culturally, or between groups with specialized occupations or
   information who do not share the same basic knowledge .

   In the end, those who wish to create humor can never be quite certain
   in advance that their efforts will be successful. For this reason
   professional comedians must try out their jokes on numerous audiences,
   and practice their delivery and timing. Comedic actors, public speakers
   and amateur raconteurs must do the same. The delay of the smallest
   fraction in time, or the slightest premature telegraphing in delivering
   the denouement of a humorous presentation can cause it to fail. Lack of
   clarity in the setup and in constructing the paradox can likewise kill
   humor. This essay has not dealt with written humor, but many of the
   same considerations of structure and pacing apply to humor in print as
   to humor communicated face-to-face.

   To comedians, "material" -- their jokes and stories -- has always been
   precious, worthy of protecting and preserving. On stage, a good
   vaudeville routine could last years as it was performed on tour across
   the country. In radio, a year's vaudeville material might be fodder for
   one week's broadcast. Bob Hope used new material not only for his
   weekly radio series, but also for the several live charity appearances
   he made each week. In the beginning of his career, Bob Hope wrote his
   own material, adapted jokes and comic routines from popular humor
   publications, or commissioned segments of his vaudeville act from
   writers.

   Over the course of his career Bob Hope employed over one hundred
   writers to create material, including jokes, for his famous topical
   monologs. For example, for radio programs Hope engaged a number of
   writers, divided the writers into teams, and required each team to
   complete an entire script. He then selected the best jokes from each
   script and pieced them together to create the final script. The jokes
   included in the final script, as well as jokes not used, were
   categorized by subject matter and filed in cabinets in a fire- and
   theft-proof walk-in vault in an office next to his residence in North
   Hollywood, California. Bob Hope could then consult this "Joke File,"
   his personal cache of comedy, to create monologs for live appearances
   or television and radio programs.
   The complete Bob Hope Joke File -- more than 85,000 pages -- has been
   digitally scanned and indexed according to the categories used by Bob
   Hope for presentation in the Bob Hope Gallery of American
   Entertainment.

                                 Vaudeville
                                    dots


   How to Enter Vaudeville Bob Hope's first tours in vaudeville were as
   half of a two-man dancing team. The act appeared in "small time"
   vaudeville houses where ticket prices were as low as ten cents, and
   performances were "continuous," with as many as six shows each day. Bob
   Hope, like most vaudeville performers, gained his professional training
   in these small time theaters.

   Within five years of his start in vaudeville Bob Hope was in the "big
   time," playing the expensive houses where the most popular acts played.
   In big time vaudeville there were only two shows performed each day --
   the theaters were called "two-a-days" -- and tickets cost as much as
   $2.00 each. The pinnacle of the big time was New York City's Palace
   Theatre, where every vaudevillian aspired to perform. Bob Hope played
   the Palace in 1931 and in 1932.

   All vaudeville comedy acts were dependent, in some part, on stock
   materials for inspiration. This tradition has continued in variety
   comedy entertainment in all of its forms, from stage to television,
   drawing upon what theater historian Brooks McNamara calls, "a shared
   body of traditional stock material." The situation comedies popular on
   television today are built from many of the same raw materials that
   shaped medicine and minstrel shows in the early nineteenth- century as
   well as shaping vaudeville.

   Stock materials include jokes and song parodies; monologs -- strings of
   jokes or comic lectures; bits -- two- or three-person joke routines;
   and sketches -- short comic scenes, often with a story. To these stock
   materials comedians add what cannot be transcribed in words, the
   physical comedy, or the "business" -- the humor of inflections and body
   language at which so many vaudevillians excelled.

   New York Palace Theatre The content of the vaudeville show reflected
   the ethnic make-up of its primary audience in complex ways. Vaudeville
   performers were often from the same working-class and immigrant
   backgrounds as their audiences. Yet the relaxation and laughter they
   provided vaudeville patrons was sometimes achieved at the expense of
   other working-class American groups. Humor based on ethnic
   characterizations was a major component of many vaudeville routines, as
   it had been in folk-culture-based entertainment and other forms of
   popular culture. "Blackface" characterizations of African Americans
   were carried over from minstrelsy. "Dialect acts" featured comic
   caricatures of many other ethnic groups, most commonly Irish, Italians,
   Germans, and Jews.

   Audiences related to ethnic caricature acts in a number of ways. Many
   audiences, daily forced to conform to society's norms, enjoyed the
   free, uninhibited expression of blackface comedians and the baggy pants
   "low comedy" of many dialect acts. They enjoyed recognizing and
   laughing at performances based on their own ethnic identities. At the
   same time, some vaudeville acts provided a means of assimilation for
   members of the audience by enabling them to laugh at other ethnic
   groups, "outsiders."

   By the end of vaudeville's heyday, the early 1930s, most ethnic acts
   had been eliminated from the bill or toned down to be less offensive.
   However, ethnic caricatures continued to thrive in radio programs such
   as Amos 'n' Andy, Life with Luigi, and The Goldbergs, and in the
   blackface acts of entertainers such as Al Jolson.

   This program from New York's premier vaudeville theater shows how a
   typical vaudeville show was organized. It opens with a newsreel so
   latecomers will not miss a live act. The bill includes a novelty act--a
   singing baseball pitcher--a miniature drama, and a return engagement by
   a vaudevillian of years back, Ethel Levey, who was George M. Cohan's
   ex-wife. The headliners of this show at the Palace are Lou Clayton and
   Cliff Edwards. Clayton, a tap dancer, later appeared with Jimmy Durante
   and with Eddie Jackson. Edwards was a popular singer of the 1920s whose
   career was revived in 1940 when he sang "When You Wish Upon a Star" in
   Walt Disney's Pinocchio.

Ledger from B. F. Keith's Theater, Indianapolis

   This ledger from Keith's Theater in Indianapolis, Indiana, provides a
   detailed view of "big-time" vaudeville in the early 1920s. The weekly
   bill and the performers' salaries are listed on the lower left-hand
   page. Daily receipts are posted above the bill. Expenses make up the
   other entries.

Bob Hope at the Palace Theatre

   This ledger book from the "big-time" Palace Theatre in New York
   documents the vaudeville acts on each week's bill, what each act was
   paid for the week, the name of the act's agent, and additional costs
   incurred by the performers. In February 1931, Bob Hope performed for
   the first time at the Palace Theatre. Comedienne Beatrice Lillie and
   the band of Noble Sissle also appeared on the bill. Hope took out two
   ads in Variety for that week; the ledger entry shows that the cost of
   these ads was deducted from his salary. In that same issue of Variety,
   the influential trade journal gave Hope's act a lukewarm, but
   prescient, review, stating, "He is a nice performer of the flip comedy
   type, and he has his own style. These natural resources should serve
   him well later on."

1929 Bob Hope Act Run-down

   Bob Hope always tinkered with his material in an attempt to perfect it.
   Throughout the Bob Hope Collection are Hope's own handwritten notes on
   scripts and joke sheets. This outline of his act, listing jokes,
   exchanges, and songs is on the back of a 1929 letter from his agent.

Hope's 1926 Vaudeville Tour

   In 1926 Lester Hope and George Byrne were booked on a tour in which the
   headliners were eighteen-year-old siamese twins Daisy and Violet
   Hilton. The Hilton Sisters's show featured the twins telling stories of
   their lives, playing saxophone and clarinet duets, and dancing with
   Hope and Byrne.

   The team of Lester Hope and George Byrne achieved considerable success
   from 1925 to 1927, touring the small-time vaudeville theaters with a
   dance act
   that they expanded to include songs and comedy.

Gus Sun Promotional Booklet

   In 1924, Bob Hope and his first touring partner, Lloyd "Lefty" Durbin,
   were booked in "tabloid" shows on the Ohio-based, small-time, Gus Sun
   circuit. "Tab" shows were low-budget, miniature vaudeville shows and
   musical comedies, which played in rural areas and small towns.

   Touring in vaudeville was never easy and in the small-time it could be
   particularly arduous. "Lefty" Durbin died on the road in 1925.
   Initially, it was thought that food poisoning was the cause. In fact,
   he succumbed to tuberculosis.

Map of Hope's 1929-1930 Vaudeville Tour

   This map represents one year of touring by Bob Hope on the
   Keith-Orpheum vaudeville circuit. It was Hope's first national tour,
   and his act was called Keep Smiling. Veteran gag writer Al Boasberg
   assisted in writing Hope's material. Hope recreated part of the act on
   a 1955 Ed Sullivan television program, which can be seen in the
   television section of this exhibit.

Ballyhoo of 1932 Script Page

   The Ballyhoo of 1932 revue starred Willie and Eugene Howard and Bob
   Hope. Similar to a vaudeville show, a revue usually consists of
   sketches, songs, and comedians, but has no overall plot. Unlike a
   vaudeville show, however, a revue runs for a significant period of time
   and may have a conceptual continuity to its acts. As this page
   indicates, Hope was the master of ceremonies in Ballyhoo. At the upper
   right, written in Hope's hand, is his remark to the audience about the
   opening scene of the revue.

found that he had a knack as a master of ceremonies, the act split, and
Hope was booked as an "M.C." at the Stratford Theater in Chicago in an
engagement that would be seminal to his career. A master of ceremonies
is a host, the link between the performance and the audience-providing
continuity between scenes or acts by telling jokes, introducing
performers, and assuring that the entertainment does not stop even if
delays occurred backstage. Hope was such a success as a master of
ceremonies in this Chicago engagement that his initial two-week booking
was extended to six months.

Ziegfeld Follies Program, 1912

   Florenz Ziegfeld broke the color barrier in theater by hiring Bert
   Williams for his Follies of 1910, in which Williams was a sensation. He
   appeared in most of the editions of the Follies mounted in the 1910s
   and was among Ziegfeld's top paid stars.

   "Tin Pan Alley" was a term given to West 28th Street in New York City,
   where many music publishers were located in the late nineteenth
   century. It came to represent the whole burgeoning popular music
   business of the turn of the twentieth century. Tin Pan Alley music
   publishers mass-produced songs and promoted them as merchandise.
   Composers were under contract to the publishers and churned out vast
   numbers of songs to reflect and exploit the topics of the day, and to
   imitate existing hit songs. Publishers employed a number of means to
   promote and market the songs, with vaudevillians playing a major role
   in their efforts.

A Tin Pan Alley Pioneer

   This sentimental song was the first major hit of Tin Pan Alley composer
   Harry Von Tilzer (1872-1946). Von Tilzer claimed that his publisher
   paid him fifteen dollars for the song which sold 2,000,000 copies. He
   later founded his own publishing company. It was the tinny sound of Von
   Tilzer's piano which inspired the phrase "Tin Pan Alley" used to refer
   to music publishers' offices on West 28^th Street and further uptown,
   in the early twentieth century.

   Vaudeville performances of songs resulted directly in sheet music
   sales. Song publishers of the vaudeville era aggressively marketed
   their new products to vaudeville performers in a number of ways.
   "Song-pluggers," salesmen who demonstrated new songs and coaxed variety
   performers to adopt them, worked for all major music publishers. Ads
   such as this in the trade newspaper, Variety, reached on-the-road
   performers who were inaccessible to the pluggers.

   In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, vaudeville
   performers were paid by music publishers to sing the publishers' new
   songs. Covers of popular sheet music in the early twentieth century
   featured photographs of the vaudeville stars, promoting the performer
   as well as the song.

   prison cells, packing crates,
   a giant paper bag (without tearing the paper), an iron boiler, milk
   cans, coffins, and the
   famous Water Torture Cell. In most of these escapes, later examination
   showed no sign of

"Act needs a lot of watching"

   As with network television today, vaudeville promoted itself as family
   entertainment, but its shows often stretched the limits of common
   propriety. This report from a Boston stage censor outlines some of the
   questionable material in Bob Hope's 1933 act and preserves some of the
   jokes the act included. The pre-printed form catalogs common offenses

Review of Hope's Act in Billboard, 1929

   In 1929 Bob Hope put together a popular act which included a female
   partner, intentionally discordant comic instrumentalists, and Hope's
   singing and dancing. To augment the comedy he hired veteran vaudeville
   writer Al Boasberg to write new material. This act toured for a year on
   the Orpheum circuit.

A joke is just a joke (except when it isn't): cavalier humor beliefs
facilitate the expression of group dominance motives.

Abstract

   Past research reveals preferences for disparaging humor directed toward
   disliked others. The group-dominance model of humor appreciation
   introduces the hypothesis that beyond initial outgroup attitudes,
   social dominance motives predict favorable reactions toward jokes
   targeting low-status outgroups through a subtle hierarchy-enhancing
   legitimizing myth: cavalier humor beliefs (CHB). CHB characterizes a
   lighthearted, less serious, uncritical, and nonchalant approach toward
   humor that dismisses potential harm to others. As expected, CHB
   incorporates both positive (affiliative) and negative (aggressive)
   humor functions that together mask biases, correlating positively with
   prejudices and prejudice-correlates (including social dominance
   orientation [SDO]; Study 1). Across 3 studies in Canada, SDO and CHB
   predicted favorable reactions toward jokes disparaging Mexicans
   (low-status outgroup). Neither individual difference predicted neutral
   (nonintergroup) joke reactions, despite the jokes being equally amusing
   and more inoffensive overall. In Study 2, joke content targeting
   Mexicans, Americans (high-status outgroup), and Canadians (high-status
   ingroup) was systematically controlled. Although Canadians preferred
   jokes labeled as anti-American overall, an underlying subtle pattern
   emerged at the individual-difference level: Only those higher in SDO
   appreciated those jokes labeled as anti-Mexican (reflecting social
   dominance motives). In all studies, SDO predicted favorable reactions
   toward low-status outgroup jokes almost entirely through heightened
   CHB, a subtle yet potent legitimatizing myth that "justifies"
   expressions of group dominance motives. In Study 3, a pretest-posttest
   design revealed the implications of this justification process: CHB
   contributes to trivializing outgroup jokes as inoffensive (harmless),
   subsequently contributing to postjoke prejudice. The implications for
   humor in intergroup contexts are considered.

Top Gear ‘bigots’ slammed for lazy Mexicans joke

   Jeremy Clarkson

Unfortunately for Jeremy Clarkson, Mexican ambassador wasn't asleep and takes
him to task over racist comments

   BY Natalie Davies LAST UPDATED AT 13:19 ON Wed 2 Feb 2011

   In a month that has seen two TV personalities nailed for making
   offensive comments you'd think that even the provocative presenters of
   Top Gear would have the good sense to err on the side of caution, but
   no, not a bit of it.

   In an episode of the car review show watched by six million people on
   Sunday night, presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May
   insulted an entire nation by branding Mexicans as "lazy" and "oafish".

   Mexico's ambassador to London has demanded an apology after Hammond
   said that Mexican cars were typical of their countrymen, and went on to
   describe "a lazy, feckless, flatulent, oaf with a moustache leaning
   against a fence asleep looking at a cactus with a blanket with a hole
   in the middle on as a coat".

   Ambassador Eduardo Medina Mora Icaza might well have seen the funny
   side of it had he not been personally targeted by Clarkson, who joked
   that they would not receive any complaints because the ambassador would
   be asleep.

   "It is utterly incomprehensible and unacceptable that the premiere
   broadcaster should allow three of its presenters to display their
   bigotry and ignorance by mocking the people and culture of our country
   with such vehemence," the ambassador wrote in a letter to the BBC.

   But in being singled out by Jeremy Clarkson, the ambassador is in good
   company. The Top Gear presenter called Gordon Brown "a one-eyed
   Scottish idiot" in 2009 - and before that he characterised lorry
   drivers as prostitute murderers in November 2008.  ·

   Very funny and entertaining, no mention of the drugs war thats ripping
   Mexico apart though, plenty of material there.

   They're entertainers. If they'd been making jokes about the French
   nobody would have said a thing. It happens all the time. Yes, that
   doesn't make it right, but get a sense of humour, Mexico.

   You don't see British officials demanding an apology for every American
   TV presenter who suggests we all have bad teeth and crap food.

   Get a grip.

   I'm sure the Top Gear guys will be traumatised by the uprising of an
   entire nation in annoyance at their petty pranks. And Mexicans might be
   a bit miffed too. Middle Aged Boors 1. Humourless Latinos 0.

   All I can say is "what an idiot". His show should be cancelled.

   Clarkson has a go at everyone. He is the only person on TV to do so and
   the nation loves him for it. I wish people would lighten up and stop
   feeling so offended by everything. Where is the British sense of
   humour?
   Permalink Posted by Annie Harrison, February 2, 2011 - 4:48pm.

   These people sit around joking for an hour a week on fantastic pay.
   They know a lot about laziness. Projectionism. Given all the BBC
   resources, it was intellectually astonishing lazy not to come up with
   some better material for their program.

this is not a joke.

   but it is where I talk about all the movies I watch

Friday, February 25, 2011

Since you've been gone...

   Thanks Toothpaste for Dinner!
   I must offer some profuse apologies. Or maybe not. I ran into Brunch
   Bird last weekend at, of all places, of course, the movies. (I was
   there to watch The Roommate. How was it you ask? Hysterically amazing!)
   She asked if I had a blog when I told her that I liked hers and I said
   "I do, but it sort of went defunct after watching Girl with the Dragon
   Tattoo." (Oh, and how was that you ask? Only the best movie I saw in
   2010!) She said, "Well, it's never too late to start up again. I'd
   know." And she is right.
   And I have seen some really worthy movies. I don't think I am an
   extraordinary writer, or maybe even that good, but my friends seem to
   enjoy it. So, back to movies. Well, all of the Swedish Steig Larsson
   movies were high points in my movie watching year last year. But I
   never wrote about them. I don't know if I ever will, but hopefully. So
   what has been going on with me, you ask? Well, lets do a photo run
   down, shall we?
   According to my last post I stopped writing after I went to GA in
   March. Well, I went back in May. It was the epic Georgia trip. It will
   go down in the annals of the Georgia Trips. Well, until Lori and I go
   on our ten year anniversary road trip though Georgia.
   Epic Georgia Adventure. May 2010.
   Let's see. Then the World Cup happened, right? Well, I rooted for
   Germany, until they lost to Spain. That German support involved many
   hours at Lucky Bar and included me being interviewed at 7:30am on the
   CBS local news! Good thing my State Department colleagues knew I was
   drinking beer at 8am on a work day. Here is me and a bunch of other
   Germany fans after they beat Australia (? Australia, right?)
   German Victory. And lots of Beer. World Cup 2010.
   The World Cup era was also a celebration of new housing arrangements. I
   moved in May and therefore was able to acquire this little piece of
   toilet paper shredding heaven at the end of June. She is excellent. For
   the most part. Except she shreds all my toilet paper. Named after a
   20th century Mexican Revolutionary, her name is
   Emiliano Zapata. July 2010.
   She's almost ten months old now (March 6) and is currently sitting in a
   reusable bag with a pair of my heels. Good work Zizzle.
   August was epic because not only did I audition for the Capitals Red
   Rocker squad (and did not make the cut) but I also went to DISNEYLAND
   for the first time!!! Good god, if you haven't been there book your
   plane ticket now. It is the most wonderful place on earth. Even better
   than Niagara Falls. And I bet you never thought you'd hear that come
   out of my mouth!
   The wonderful world of Disney. August 2010.
   We also spent time with our good friend Steven while there. He took us
   around Los Angeles. Mel and I were re-united with high school friends.
   We ate at Spago. Saw the Hollywood sign (though I think we actually
   looked to the right to see the Hollywood sign). Saw the jail where OJ
   was kept. Saw a Soviet submarine. Ate Jack in the Box and had an all
   around fantastic vacation!!
   Look to the left and I see the Hollywood sign.
   Everyone here is so famous.
   Including Craig Kilbourne.
   I told him he looked like my grad school advisor. HAH!
   August 2010
   But the fun didn't stop in August. Oh no, no. September brought about
   three momentous events.
   1. First UGA game day. We lost. Sad.
   Imagine us in Game Day dresses. September 2010.
   2. American Idiot on Broadway with Billie Joe Armstrong. Of course, now
   he is in the show for a two month run, but at the time he was only
   doing 8 shows. And I saw one of them! St. Jimmy died today/ He blew his
   brains out into the bay. September 2010.
   3. Another Virginia inspired beauty. This time for my left arm.
   You're looking at $300 of dogwood. September 2010.
   October was confusing. Zombies invaded Washington and I was there to
   document it. I almost got ejected from the National Mall by the Park
   Service because they didn't believe I was not a professional
   photographer. Why? It wasn't because they saw this post and were amazed
   at all my photos (I took all of them except the one of Billie Joe). No.
   It was because he took one look at my camera and thought it was too
   "professional." Dude, hate to break it to you, but I'm not the only
   person in the city with a DSLR. Durr.
   The Walking Dead invade Washington. October 2010.
   In November I did play professional photographer though. I took my
   friends' engagement photos. I loved it. Does anyone have anything they
   want me to photograph? My rates are reasonable! You can email
   photography.jdh@gmail.com if you're interested. I am available in DC
   but will travel. I'm not kidding. You'll be impressed when you see my
   work below.
   The real work. November 2010.
   December was pretty standard. Heartbreak. Presents. New Years Eve in
   Georgia. The Caps won the Winter Classic (in your face Pittsburgh!) and
   the year started off more miserable than I could possibly imagine. Work
   upheaval. Henious sinus infection. The complete opposite of Love,
   Valour, Compassion. So I really needed one weekend in January to go
   well. Luckily the weekend I spent in New York for Mel and Barry's
   birthday was excellent. If it hadn't been I don't think I'd be here to
   type this right now. I'd still be crying in a gutter.
   A new era of Hope. January 2011.
   This brings us, more or less, to the present day. I tried to buy a
   scratching post for the cat but the pet store was sold out. It was very
   tragic. (UPDATE: I have secured said scratching post. VICTORY!)
   But, this is neither a blog about my stupid cat nor a blog about my
   excellent photography skillz (though, seriously, email me if you want
   me to shoot something for you!), it is a blog about movies. So here,
   very very briefly, are my reviews of the movies I have seen since we
   last spoke (minus movies that weren't new to me--Dawn of the Dead,
   Interview with the Vampire, Titanic, Before Sunset, etc, etc, etc,
   etc.) And in no particular order...
   The movies:
     * All the Swedish Steig Larsson movies. The Girl with the Dragon
       Tattoo--the best one of the three. I am so glad I saw the movie
       before I read the book. The movie was so shocking because I had no
       idea what was going to happen. It was the best movie I saw in 2010!
       The Girl Who Played with Fire-- Good. I think the book and the
       movie were actually pretty different. Again, I saw the movie first
       then read the book. The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest--The book
       is waiting to be read on my shelf. P.S. sweet Mohawk!
     * 127 hours--very different then I thought it would be. I was
       actually surprisingly emotional. Go see it. Seriously. It is very
       good. Even though Danny Boyle annoys me. Though, I did enjoy 28
       Days Later. A lot.
     * Black Swan--overrated I think. I didn't care about any of the
       characters and was in fact hoping bad things would happen to them.
       Plus, I want to punch Natalie Portman in the face. Seriously. I did
       like that Frenchy though. I hope it doesn't win all sort of Oscars.
     * Casino Jack--Erik and I wanted to go see a movie and there was
       nothing out. So he suggested this. It was fine. I was entertained.
       It was interesting to "learn" about Jack Abramoff. Plus, I like
       Kevin Spacey and I like drinking my pomegranate Italian sodas at E
       Street.
     * A Film Unfinished--I saw this after I got my tattoo. Another good
       thing about E Street is that you can order beer there. Which I did.
       To stop the arm throbbing. A Film Unfinished is the footage that
       was recorded to make a Nazi propaganda film. The film was somewhat
       interesting even though nothing Nazi related seems to shock me
       anymore. I guess that is what you get for being a history major.
       Nothing in it stuck with me to this day. Just watch The Pianist
       instead.
     * Easy A--Watched this with Lori on the last GA trip. It was
       entertaining. I like that Emma Stone. Her parents were ridiculously
       amusing and Dan from Gossip Girl was in it. What's not to like??
     * Jackass 3D--I will confess, the only reason I watched this was
       because the boy I was crushing on worked on this movie. He was the
       stereoscopic supervisor. Basically, his job was to make it 3D. (You
       can figure out who he is on imdb) Otherwise, it wasn't nearly as
       amusing as I remember Jackass to be. I guess maybe I am getting too
       old for this? There was one though where a guy got his tooth pulled
       out. It made me feel like I was going to puke. So, maybe, mission
       accomplished?
     * The Roommate--This one was a pretty recent view and I will admit
       it, I saw it because I love horror movies and Leighton Meester.
       What of it? Christ Almighty this movie was bad. If we hadn't seen
       it at Chinatown and had the "interactive" movie experience (ever
       noticed the audience at Ctown can't shut the eff up? They talk to
       the screen. They think it is interactive) this would have been a
       total waste. But by the end the reaction from the audience with the
       action on the screen was so hilarious that we were all dying of
       laughter. I imagine this was not the desired effect when they made
       the film.
     * Up--I know. I know. How is it possible I haven't seen this yet?
       IDK. I watched it on Christmas, perfect movie for that day, right?!
       I loved it. I thought the animation was so excellent and the
       characters were so sweet. I was chastised though because I didn't
       cry at the beginning. I guess I have a stone where my heart should
       be?
     * Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1--I actually saw this
       movie twice! Once the day after Thanksgiving and once on Christmas.
       Don't you just love Harry Potter at holiday time? God, I do!! This
       is obviously the best HP yet. Why? Obviously because they split it
       in two so it can be closer to the story in the book. Love love love
       love love it. Can't wait till the end.
     * Blue Valentine--Ah yes, another E street wonder. What does it say
       about me, or maybe about that theatre, that anything I see there is
       more enjoyable than a movie anywhere else? And how do I remember
       that I had my pomegranate soda, resces pieces and a crab pretzel?
       They must pump some sort of hyper circulated air in, or something.
       Anyway. I liked this. It wasn't uplifting, but sometimes neither is
       life. Michelle Williams was way better than stupid Natalie Portman.
       SHE should win the Oscar. I also sort of realized I am in love with
       Ryan Gosling. I guess I should get in line.
     * Catfish--OH DAMN. Seriously. This was the other best movie of 2010.
       I want everyone to watch it. I wont say anything about it though,
       because I want you to experience it with fresh eyes. After Erik and
       I watched this we had to immediately go to another movie to cleanse
       the palate of this one. It was SO GOOD!!!
     * Devil--is the movie we saw after Catfish. What is with M.Night?
       Seriously. That guy can't make a good movie to save his life.
       Though. I did sort of like it. But it is really hard to tell if he
       is being serious or just thinks that he can make good previews and
       trick people into seeing his movies.
     * Inception--Yes, yes. A worthy Oscar contender. But lets be
       seriously. I love Leonardo DiCaprio. I would watch him read the
       phone book. I love him. Love, love, love. This was good. I liked
       it. I should watch it again. Oh Man... speaking of Inception and
       Up. Watch this. It is freaking HILARiOUS!!!!! Please watch it.
       Please. It is so good.
     * Let the Right One In--A Swedish vampire movie. I hear that the book
       is much better. Let's all just read the book, eh?
     * Dead Snow--Hahahahahaha. Yes. You know this movie. It has some of
       my favorite elements. Norway. Zombies. Nazis. Well, Nazis aren't my
       favorite, but they are historical. Yes, a somewhat historical
       zombie movie set in Norway. It was just as bad, or as good, as you
       expected. I watched this on Halloween. Totally viable.
     * Please Give--I watched this because I read something about it in
       Slate. The article was talking about this scene where the daughter
       wasn't a pair of jeans and how it was really sad and realistic. I
       don't know about that but I thought the movie was good.
       Entertaining. And the actors were quite good. And Amanda Peet was
       in it. Solved.
     * Saw 3D--Ok. Ok. This was just like Jackass 3D. Mel and I went to
       see this because her friend was in it. It was awful. Just awful.
       But we did see her high school friend get cut in half. Classic.
     * Waiting for Superman--I read something about this movie that said
       some of the scenes where the kids are waiting during the lotteries
       were actually fake. It was disappointing. I mean, I suppose what is
       more disappointing is that not everyone can go to school in one of
       the best counties in America, like I did. It is sad that people
       can't get quality education. I dunno that charter schools are the
       answer. I just wish people had more money so they could move to a
       good school district.
     * Survival of the Dead--This movie makes me sad. This is not George
       Romero quality. It was just atrocious. Just so, so, so so awful.
     * Rachel Getting Married--Here is the thing about this movie. It was
       actually pretty good. But towards the end Anne Hathaway has her
       hair highlighted and it was so hideous it was actually distracting.
       Like, I could not focus on the movie. Just ask Erik. He was there.
       Also, why was that family so weird? Maybe we will never know.
     * Midnight in the Garden of Good And Evil--Lori and I both read this
       book in preparation for our Georgia Road Trip 2011. It was an
       excellent book. Just excellent. It teaches you so much about
       Georgia history and prepares you to travel to Savannah. The
       narration was amazing. But Christ this movie was bad. Not even
       Kevin Spacey and Jude Law could fix it. Message to Hollywood: Just
       because a book is awesome doesn't mean it will translate well to
       film. Please consider why the book is good (narration and the
       character development) and make sure you can do that in the movie.
       Because they couldn't do it, it made the movie not good. We both
       fell asleep then had to return to watch it another day. Sad.
     * The Fighter--I just saw this last night. Yay for solo dates! This
       one was much better than Black Swan. Christian Bale should win an
       Oscar. Brother is scary good! I liked this one. I like that there
       is a character arc, and that I care what happens to them. And I am
       not sure, but were the sisters supposed to be funny, because
       hoo-boy. What was going on with them? Despite the fact it was a
       Thursday night and everyone in the theater was over 25 it was still
       interactive. Oh Chinatown.

   The television...
     * True Blood Seasons 1 and 2--Fuck I love this show. It is pretty
       unusual that I am interested in a show from the first episode, but
       I was with this one. Thanks to RaeJean to recommending it. I can't
       wait till I can watch Season 3.
     * Peep Show Seasons 1-7--God this show is hilarious. Peep Show is a
       BBC production about two friends, Mark and Jeremy (though my
       favorite character is Super Hanz...which I thought was Super Hands
       for a long time). It is sort of like It's Always Sunny in
       Philadelphia but set in England. I discovered the show one morning
       when I woke up from a night out at like 5 and I needed to wash my
       face and brush my teeth. I turned on the telly, which was on BBC
       because I was watching Law and Order: UK when I fell asleep and I
       was absolutely hooked! It is on BBC America Saturday mornings from
       4-6am... for those times when you're just getting home from the bar
       or are too drunk to fall asleep. Or you can watch all the episodes
       on Hulu. You wont regret it. It is hysterical.
     * The IT Crowd Seasons 1-3--The only reason I watched this show was
       because it was available on Netflix view it now. The first season
       was really funny. The other two, not as much. It reminds me of the
       show within a show on Extras. What was it called? When the Whistle
       Blows? It has the same sort of odd BBC production values... almost
       like it is a fake show.
     * The Walking Dead--Remember when I said the Walking Dead invaded DC?
       Well, these were the dead from this show. God. What didn't I like
       about this show? It took place in Georgia. Had Zombies. Was made by
       AMC. And it was one of the first scary shows I have ever watched.
       Other than MTV's Fear (god I miss that show) I have never actually
       been scared during a show. The first three or so eps of this show
       just made me so nervous. I loved it. The DVD comes out around my
       birthday. Hint. Hint.
     * Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 1--To say Lori was mad when I liked
       True Blood would be the understatement of 2010. She was like,
       "those aren't real vampires. Watch Buffy. Otherwise I will hate
       you." So over NYE weekend we watched Season 1. I will tell you, the
       vampires in TB are so much sexier (ugh) than the ones in BtVS. Lori
       would say "They're not supposed to be sexy! They're supposed to be
       evil!! I hate you." So Season 1 was sort of ridiculous. The
       production quality was very low and the episodes were hysterical.
       But we made a drinking game out of it and now Season 2 is much much
       better. Ah, the things we do for love!

   Wow. That took many days to complete. That is the full disclosure.
   Hopefully now that I have gotten those out of the way I can go back to
   updating regularly. Coming soon... (or what I have been watching, or
   have ready to watch...)
   Glee: Season 1 (two discs left)
   Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 2 (three episodes left)
   The Tudors: Season 4 (how did I not know this was out?! I will watch it
   once Glee is over)
   The Social Network (waiting at home to be watched Sunday)
   Mighty Ducks and D2 (purchased with an amazon card I won at work!)
   and thats all for now! Welcome back.
   See you at the movies. Or something. (E street. Not Chinatown)

Scream

   So what is this one about?
   If for some stupid, insane, inane reason, you don't know the plot of
   1996's Scream, Netflix will tell you about it...

     Horror maven Wes Craven -- paying homage to teen horror classics
     such as Halloween and Prom Night -- turns the genre on its head with
     this tale of a murderer who terrorizes hapless high schooler Sidney
     Prescott (Neve Campbell) by offing everyone she knows. Not your
     average slasher flick, Scream distinguishes itself with a
     self-parodying sense of humor. Courteney Cox and David Arquette
     co-star as a local news reporter and a small-town deputy.

   Amazing.
   And how much did I pay to watch?
   Nothing. I actually watched this while I was visiting my beloved in
   Georgia. The state not the country. She is also a netflix member,
   because she is amazing--as is netflix--and we watched this after a
   night of drinking on view it now. It was pretty much the greatest
   decision ever!
   And what did I think?
   Wow. When I first saw this movie I thought my head was going to
   explode. I watched it when I was in middle school and I'd never seen
   anything so amazingly brilliant in my entire life. I am not even being
   hyperbolic. It seriously blew my mind! It was so surprising with the
   way Wes Craven used typical horror movie convention and turned it
   completely on it's head!!
   The movie is so wonderfully quotable. So many amazing quotes. "What's
   the point? They're all the same. Some stupid killer stalking some
   big-breasted girl who can't act who is always running up the stairs
   when she should be going out the front door. It's insulting" and "Your
   mother was a slut-bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she
   was Sharon Stone or something, but let's face it Sydney, your
   mother...was no Sharon Stone" and "Listen Kenny, I know you're about 50
   pounds overweight. But when I say 'hurry,' please interpret that as
   'move your fat, tub of lard ass NOW!'" It also has music that is so
   awesome and retro without being too much of a time warp. I listened to
   that soundtrack like a million times. It is hilarious to listen to a
   movie and be able to sing all the songs because I remember them from
   when I was 13.
   This movie may be one of the most responsible for my love of horror
   movies. I don't just love slasher movies, though, I love all horror
   movies. This may have been one of the first ones I'd really seen by the
   time I could sort of understand what I was thinking about anything. It
   was just so incredible!!
   So what is the rating? (out of 10)
   Scream is just so gd clever it makes me sick! The characterization was
   amazing, with using horror movie cliches. And it paints an amazing
   picture of what was going on in pop culture in 1996.
   It is amazing. It is 100% a 10.
   I need to buy this on dvd like a million years ago. I have it on vhs
   somewhere...

Ghost Town

   So what is this one about?
   Welp, my delightfully under-used friend Netlfix tells us,

     British funnyman Ricky Gervais ("The Office," "Extras") stars in his
     first feature film lead as Bertram Pincus, a hapless gent who's
     pronounced dead, only to be brought back to life with an unexpected
     gift: a newfound ability to see ghosts. When Bertram crosses paths
     with the recently departed Frank Herlihy (Greg Kinnear), he gets
     pulled into Frank's desperate bid to break up his widowed wife's
     (Téa Leoni) pending marriage to another man.

   ok.
   And how much did I pay to watch?
   Nothing.
   One thing you might not know about me is I have recently (well, maybe
   not too recently, since the Olympics) started going 10 miles a day on
   Saturday and Sundays on the treadmill in my basement. For the most part
   this works well because I have recorded shows from the previous week
   that I can watch. At most, three episodes of Law and Order (and it's
   friends) and one episode of Gossip Girl. This seems to fit the time
   well.
   Unfortunately, the weekend I watched this I had nothing left to watch,
   so I used my HBO on demand and settled on this one. And since I don't
   pay for cable it really was nothing.
   And what did I think?
   Well, I am a big Ricky Gervais fan. I like his insane laugh. And his
   British accent. And his fat little face. He doesn't seem to have a lot
   of range to me, because I've never seen a role where he wasn't just
   playing Ricky Gervais. Luckily, though, I like him. So, it works well.
   As Bertram he was really playing himself. Grumpy old Ricky. There is
   something about him, though, that is so sincere, so his character arc
   was nice. He had a very nice chemistry with each other character in the
   movie, and you really wanted things to work out well for him.
   Interestingly enough, since it is a stupid idiotic romantic comedy,
   things had to fail then could be built back up. Romantic comedies are
   so flipping dumb. In life, when you like a boy (or a boy likes a girl)
   and you do something stupid to fuck it up, you often don't get a second
   chance. Romantic comedies give stupid people too much ammunition for
   them to think that everything will work out for them too. Romantic
   comedies are the devil. (except Love Actually, and does Clueless
   count?) I sound way more bitter than I am.
   So what is the rating? (out of 10)
   It was funny enough, but mostly, anything with Ricky Gervais will
   likely be enjoyable for me.
   I give it a 6.

Shutter Island

   So what is this one about?
   My beloved tells us,

     World War II soldier-turned-U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo
     DiCaprio) investigates the disappearance of a patient from a
     hospital for the criminally insane, but his efforts are compromised
     by his own troubling visions and by Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley). Mark
     Ruffalo, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer and Max von Sydow co-star
     in director Martin Scorsese's plot twist-filled psychological
     thriller set on a Massachusetts island in 1954.

   Mmmmmm, Leonardo DiCaprio AND Max Von Sydow?!?! Sign me up!!!
   And how much did I pay to watch?
   Erm. Well, my mother and I went to go see this at Cinema Arts. I don't
   remember if she paid. I think she might have, and then I bought some
   snacks. mmmmmmm, Cinema Arts popcorn! So, i think I paid nothing.
   And what did I think?
   Well, the more I think about this movie the more I like it.
   Interestingly enough, when I first watched this I didn't really like it
   as much. It really wasn't what I expected from the ads. I wanted it to
   be much, much, much scarier. (Love me some scary movies!)
   But now that I think about the movie, and its "twist" I think it is
   very smart. I'd like to see it again to see if there were any clues to
   figuring it out while the plot was moving forward.
   And I love Leonardo DiCaprio and Max VonSydow. Yumm.
   So what is the rating? (out of 10)
   Like I said, the more I think about it, the more I like it. So I'll
   give it a 7. Or maybe an 8. Something like that.

The Pregnancy Pact

   So what is this one about?
   Ah ha! Lifetime (yes, that Lifetime. Television for Women) tells us
   about their movie,

     Inspired by a true story, the film explores the costs of teen
     pregnancy with a story of a fictional "pregnancy pact" set against
     the backdrop of actual news reports about teen pregnancy from June
     2008. Sidney Bloom (Thora Birch), an online magazine journalist,
     returns to her hometown to investigate the sudden spike in teenage
     pregnancies at her old high school. Almost immediately, she comes up
     against Lorraine Dougan (Nancy Travis), the head of the local
     conservative values group and mother of Sara, a newly pregnant
     15-year-old. Meanwhile, the school nurse (Camryn Manheim) tries to
     convince the school to provide contraception to students to address
     the pregnancy epidemic but is met with great opposition from the
     school and community. As the number of pregnant girls climbs to 18,
     a media firestorm erupts when Time Magazine reports that the rise in
     the number of pregnancies at the school is the result of a
     "pregnancy pact." As the mystery unfolds about whether or not "the
     pact" is real, Sidney soon realizes that all of the attention is
     disguising the much larger issues that are at the core of the story.

   Shazaam that is long.
   And how much did I pay to watch?
   Zero dollars. I watched it on Lifetime. On my tv. At home. Awesome.
   And what did I think?
   Oh lord. One thing you might not know about me is that I love me some
   Lifetime movies. I mean, how the shit can you not?! Think about the
   fabulous Kirsten Dunst as star Fifteen and Pregnant. Or, Too Young to
   be a Dad with Paul Dano. Or Student Seduction with Elizabeth Berkeley.
   Or Co-Ed Call Girl with Tori Spelling. Do I really need to go on?! No.
   I do not. Lifetime movies are awesome. Awesomely bad. Awesomely
   awesome.
   And man, they really hit the nail on the head for me. I love the whole
   teenage pregnancy focus on tv these days. Why? I don't know. It
   actually might be a little sick. Because while, when I watch 16 and
   Pregnant, often times these girls are stupid and unimpressive and I
   think they are dumb and sort of got what they deserve, I feel so
   incredibly bad for them. Because they are so unprepared and just sad.
   So, this movie was awesome in that it was showing the typical tv
   teenage reaction to getting pregnant--you know, going to parties and
   drinking, saying ridiculous things like "I have to spend time with my
   friends, I can't spend time with the baby all the time!" (actually,
   yes, you can. When you decided to have a baby that is essentially what
   you decided. It isn't your fault. You're just a stupid 16 year old),
   and being clueless as to the fact that the boy who got you pregnant is
   pretty much not going to stick around. But, through wise old, old, old
   Thora Birch it also showed that teenage pregnancy isn't all the fun and
   games you think. Do people really think it will be all fun and games?
   Be serious.
   So what is the rating? (out of 10)
   It is a hard movie to rate because all lifetime movies are pretty much
   awful. So, is it good because it is awful, or is it just awful?
   It certainly is not the best Lifetime movie I have seen, but lets be
   serious, if it is on some Sunday afternoon, I'm not gonna pretend like
   I am not going to watch it. And it isn't like I spend a few hours
   watching Lifetime movies today. Be serious.
   So, I'll give it a 6. Better than average, but not by much!

   Meta-joke refers to several somewhat different, but related categories:
   self-referential jokes, jokes about jokes (also known as metahumor),
   and joke templates.^[citation needed]

        * 5 References

[edit] Self-referential jokes

   This kind of meta-joke is a joke in which a familiar class of jokes is
   part of the joke.

   Examples of meta-jokes:
     * An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman walk into a bar. The
       bartender turns to them, takes one look, and says, "What is this -
       some kind of joke?"
     * A Priest, a Rabbi and a Leprechaun walk into a bar. The Leprechaun
       looks around and says, "Saints preserve us! I'm in the wrong joke!"
     * A woman walked into a pub and asked the barman for a double
       entendre. So he gave her one.
     * An Irishman walks past a bar.
     * Three men walk into a bar... Ouch! (And variants:)
          + A dyslexic man walks into a bra.
          + Two men walk into a bar... you'd think one of them would have
            seen it.
          + Two men walk into a bar... the third one ducks.
          + A seal walks into a club.
          + Two men walk into a bar... but the third one is too short and
            walks right under it.
          + Three blind mice walk into a bar, but they are unaware of
            their surroundings so to derive humour from it would be
            exploitative — Bill Bailey^[1]
     * W.S. Gilbert wrote one of the definitive "anti-limericks":

                There was an old man of St. Bees,
                Who was stung in the arm by a wasp;
                    When they asked, "Does it hurt?"
                    He replied, "No, it doesn't,
                But I thought all the while 'twas a Hornet." ^[2]^[3]

     * Tom Stoppard's anti-limerick from Travesties:

                A performative poet of Hibernia
                Rhymed himself into a hernia
                    He became quite adept
                    At this practice, except
                For the occasional non-sequitur.

     * These non-limericks rely on the listener's familiarity with the
       limerick's general structure:

                There was a young man from Peru
                Whose limericks all stopped at line two

     * (may be followed with)

                There was an old maid from Verdun

     * (and even with an explanation that the narrator knows an
       unrecitable limerick about Emperor Nero)
     * Why did the elephant cross the road? Because the chicken retired.
     * Two drums and a cymbal roll down a hill. (Cue drum sting)
     * A self-referential knock-knock joke:

                A: Knock, knock!
                B: Who's there?
                A: The Interrupting Cow.
                B: The Interrupt--
                A: MOOOOOOOO!!

     * A self-referential meta-joke:

                I've never meta-joke I didn't like.
                Why did the chicken cross the road? To have his motives
                questioned.
                Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit.
                There was a man who entered a local paper's pun contest.
                He sent in ten different puns, in the hope that at least
                one of the puns would win. Unfortunately, no pun in ten
                did

[edit] Joke about jokes (metahumor)

   Metahumor as humor about humor. Here meta is used to describe the fact
   that the joke explicitly talks about other jokes, a usage similar to
   the word metadata (data about data), metatheatrics (a play within a
   play, as in Hamlet), or metafiction.

   Marc Galanter in the introduction to his book Lowering the Bar: Lawyer
   Jokes and Legal Culture cites a meta-joke in a speech of Chief Justice
   William Rehnquist:^[4]

     I've often started off with a lawyer joke, a complete caricature of
     a lawyer who's been nasty, greedy, and unethical. But I've stopped
     that practice. I gradually realized that the lawyers in the audience
     didn't think the jokes were funny and the non-lawyers didn't know
     they were jokes.

   E.B. White has joked about humor, saying that "Humor can be dissected,
   as a frog can, but the thing dies in the process and the innards are
   discouraging to any but the pure scientific mind."^[5]

   Another kind of metahumor is when jokes make fun of poor jokes by
   replacing a familiar punchline with a serious or nonsensical
   alternative. Such jokes expose the fundamental criterion for joke
   definition, "funniness", via its deletion. Comedians such as George
   Carlin and Mitch Hedberg used metahumor of this sort extensively in
   their routines. Hedberg would often follow up a joke with an admission
   that it was poorly told, or insist to the audience that "that joke was
   funnier than you acted."^[6] These followups usually get laughs
   superior to those of the perceived poor joke and serve to cover an
   awkward silence. Johnny Carson, especially late in his Tonight Show
   career, used to get uproarious laughs when reacting to a failed joke
   with, for example, a pained expression. Similarly, Jon Stewart, hosting
   his own television program, often wrings his tie and grimaces following
   an uncomfortable clip or jab. Eddie Izzard often reacts to a failed
   joke by miming writing on a paper pad and murmuring into the microphone
   something along the lines of "must make joke funnier" or "don't use
   again" while glancing at the audience.

   In the U.S. version of the British mockumentary The Office, many jokes
   are founded on making fun of poor jokes. Examples include Dwight
   Schrute butchering the Aristocrats joke, or Michael Scott awkwardly
   writing in a fellow employee's card an offensive joke, and then
   attempting to cover it with more unbearable bad jokes.

   Limerick jokesters often^[citation needed] rely on this limerick that
   can be told in polite company: "A limerick packs jokes anatomical/ Into
   space that is quite economical./ But good ones, it seems,/ So seldom
   are clean,/ And the clean ones so seldom are comical."

[edit] Joke template

   This kind of meta-joke is a sarcastic jab at the fact that some jokes
   are endlessly refitted, often by professional jokers, to different
   circumstances or characters without significant innovation in the
   humour.^[7]

          "Three people of different nationalities walk into a bar. Two of
          them say something smart, and the third one makes a mockery of
          his fellow countrymen by acting stupid."

          "Three blokes walk into a pub. One of them is a little bit
          stupid, and the whole scene unfolds with a tedious
          inevitability."
          —Bill Bailey:^[1]
          "How many members of a certain demographic group does it take to
          perform a specified task?"
          "A finite number: one to perform the task and the remainder to
          act in a manner stereotypical of the group in question."

          There once was an X from place B,
          Who satisfied predicate P,
          The X did thing A,
          In a specified way,
          Resulting in circumstance C.

   The philosopher Sidney Morgenbesser summarised Jewish logic as "If P,
   so why not Q?"

Channel Four criticised over David Walliams's 'disgusting' joke

Channel Four could be found to have breached broadcasting rules over an
obscene joke made on one of its shows by David Walliams, the comedian.

   Comments Comments

   Appearing on Chris Moyles' Quiz Night, the Little Britain star told the
   Radio 1 DJ that he would like to perform a sexual act on a teenage
   member of the boy band One Direction.

   Ofcom, the media watchdog, is now assessing whether the show broke
   strict rules governing the use of offensive language amid growing
   concerns about declining standards on television.

   The watchdog and Channel Four have both received complaints, and
   campaigners described the lewd joke made by the children's' author as
   "disgusting" and "appalling".

   They argued it was as distasteful as the phone calls that Jonathan Ross
   and Russell Brand made to Andrew Sachs in 2008, claiming that Brand had
   sex with the Fawlty Towers actor's granddaughter.

   Agreeing with Moyles that Harry Styles was his favourite member of One
   Direction, Walliams talked fondly about the singer's hair on the show,
   which was watched by 1.1 million viewers.

     * Channel 4 criticised for new reality 'freak show'
       22 Aug 2010

   The 40-year-old comedian, who is married to the model Lara Stone and
   has published four books for children, including The Boy in the Dress
   and Gangsta Granny, then said: "I'd like to suck his ****."

   The show was aired at 10pm, only an hour after the watershed, and is
   likely to have attracted a large teenage audience.

   Producers of the show cleared the controversial exchange for broadcast,
   even though Channel Four could now be fined if found to be guilty of
   breaching guidelines on indecent behaviour.

   Under Ofcom's rules, broadcasters are asked to ensure that potentially
   offensive material can be justified by its 'context', which includes
   factors such as the time it was shown, the programme's editorial
   content and "the degree of harm or offence likely to be caused". There
   is no list of words that are banned from use on radio or television.

   While the show was aired after the watershed, the media watchdog will
   now assess complaints that it has received, in addition to the four
   made to Channel Four.

   The BBC initially only received two complaints after Russell Brand left
   messages on Andrew Sachs's answerphone, but the number rose to
   thousands after the incident was brought to the public's attention.

   Peter Foot, the chairman of the National Campaign for Courtesy, said
   that Walliams's remark was worse than the comments made by Ross and
   Brand.

   "I've never heard of anything going this far," he said.

   "I'm amazed there hasn't been more of an uproar about this because that
   it is incredibly graphic language to use.

   "It doesn't leave much to the imagination."

   Mr Foot said that Channel Four could not justify the lewd joke by
   saying it was shown after the watershed as he said many teenagers could
   have been watching.

   Earlier this year, a Government-backed report raised serious concerns
   about the level of sexual content that children and teenagers are
   exposed to on television.

   Vivienne Pattison, director of mediawatch, said that Channel Four's
   decision to broadcast the obscene remark demonstrates how far the
   boundaries of decency have been pushed.

   "You expect comedians to push the envelope, but it's down to producers
   to check that it doesn't overstep the mark," she said.

   "Chris Moyles and David Walliams have a huge young following. They are
   role models and responsibility comes with that.

   "Instead, jokes like this set up a context of behaviour that somehow
   normalises and justifies it.

   "This is leading to a coarsening of our culture."

   A Channel 4 spokesman said: “The show was appropriately scheduled
   post-watershed at 10pm and viewers were warned of strong language and
   adult humour.”

   An Ofcom spokesman said: "Ofcom received two complaints about the
   episode of the programme, which was broadcast after the watershed.

   "We will assess the complaints against the Broadcasting Code, the rule
   book of standards which broadcasters must adhere to."

BBC in decency row over obscene joke by Sandi Toksvig

MPs have urged Ofcom to investigate standards at the BBC after bosses claimed
that Radio 4 listeners would have taken “delight” in a joke about the most
offensive word in the English language that was aired during the afternoon.

   By Heidi Blake

   7:30AM BST 06 Jun 2011

   Comments Comments

   The corporation received a complaint about the comment by the presenter
   Sandi Toksvig on The News Quiz but said the swear word had lost much of
   its “shock value” and references to it were suitable.

   The executive who cleared the joke for daytime transmission said it
   would “delight” much of the show’s audience, adding that listeners
   would “love it”.

   The BBC’s rejection of the complaint has angered MPs and campaigners,
   who called for greater regulation of potentially offensive content on
   radio. The reference to the obscene word was in a scripted joke by
   Toksvig, the broadcaster and a mother of three, about the Conservatives
   and cuts to child benefit. It was broadcast last October at 6.30pm and
   the next day at 12.30pm. The programme was cleared by Paul Mayhew
   Archer, then commissioning editor of Radio 4 Comedy.

   Colin Harrow, a retired newspaper executive, complained to the BBC and
   the BBC Trust that the reference was offensive and unacceptable. Both
   bodies rejected his complaint. In a letter to Mr Harrow, Mr Mayhew
   Archer wrote: “If my job was simply not to risk offending any listeners
   I could have cut it instantly. But that is not my job. My job here was
   to balance the offence it might cause some listeners against the
   delight it might give other listeners. For good or ill, the word does
   not seem to have quite the shock value it did. I am not saying this is
   a good thing. I am simply saying that I think attitudes shift.”

   John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport
   select committee, called for Ofcom to investigate. “That word is way
   out in front in terms of people finding it offensive, and I think to
   broadcast it on radio at 6.30pm is inappropriate. Even though they did
   it by implication, nobody was left in any doubt about what was meant,”
   he said.

   “Perhaps it hasn’t occurred to the BBC that one of the reasons why this
   word has lost its shock value is that it is now being used on
   television and radio.

   “But I would expect them to be aware of the risk that children might be
   listening, especially at such an early hour. I hope that the gentleman
   who made the complaint takes this matter to Ofcom because I think they
   are the appropriate people to rule on this, not the BBC Trust.”

   Vivienne Pattison, of the Mediawatch-UK campaign group, said radio
   programmes, which are free of any controls, should be subject to a
   watershed. “This is in fact one of the only truly offensive terms we
   have left,” she said.

   The BBC said last night: “The BBC has rigorous guidelines. The News
   Quiz is a long-running panel show aimed at an adult audience. Listeners
   are used to a certain level of robust humour.”

   Ofcom said it would open an investigation if it received a formal
   complaint.

   It is not the first time the BBC’s standards on decency have been
   criticised. In October 2008, it received thousands of complaints over
   crude messages left by Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross on the answer
   phone of Andrew Sachs, the Fawlty Towers actor, which were broadcast on
   Brand’s Saturday night Radio 2 show. Brand and Lesley Douglas, the
   controller of Radio 2, both resigned.

   The Absolute Best of The Anti-Joke Chicken Meme Anything

The Absolute Best of The Anti-Joke Chicken Meme By Robert Wabash  [50 more
lists]

   more

   Anti-Joke Chicken is an Advice Animal meme that takes the setups to
   jokes and then explains them literally, which would usually kill the
   laughter in any room, but coming out of such a militant, humorless
   looking chicken, every one of the chicken's joke failures comes across
   as hilarious. So get ready for rational explanations or humorless
   answers to jokes that could probably be otherwise good. Here is the
   best of Anti-Joke Chicken, in all her joke-ruining glory. Nothing
   less/more satisfying than good anti-jokes.

Who is Anti-Joke Chicken?
       Anti-Joke Chicken is the latest animal advice meme to come out of
       Reddit and it hits home for a lot of people, because Anti-Joke
       Chicken is that person we all know that either can't tell a joke,
       or always needs to point out the grain of truth in the joke -- even
       though everyone around them is completely aware of what that grain
       of truth is, as that grain of truth is usually the joke, or why the
       joke is funny to begin with.
       Originally taken from a picture of a chicken that looks,
       admittedly, humorless...

       ... Anti-Joke chicken takes every joke literally, so most Anti-Joke
       Chicken memes will either tell an "anti-joke" (a joke that is funny
       because it's written or delivered so poorly) or they'll behave like
       this:

                      [anti-joke-chicken-photo-u51.jpg]
       Anti-Joke Chicken, for the most part, takes what will most likely
       be a classic joke of some kind and then botches it by taking the
       setup literally, which is usually a huge record-scratch moment in
       real life, but attached to a chicken's face that looks like she
       means business, the complete failure of the joke itself becomes
       hilarious. Here's the best of the Anti-Joke Chicken meme.

            It does when terminal velocity comes into play, so the denser
            one would fall faster. -_-

            Weight affects the terminal velocity though. So a heavier
            person wouldn't fall faster to begin with, but would
            accelerate for longer, therefore hitting the ground first.

                 body weight is in relation with size and bigger size
                 makes bigger wind resistance and we don't know wether
                 their fall is long enough to reach the terminal velocity

       The set up:\n\nBarack Obama, the Pope, and a Boy Scout are on a
       private flight. The pilot runs out of the cockpit and says "The
       plane is going to crash. There are only 3 parachutes, and I have to
       use one so I can the FAA what happened." The pilot puts on one of
       the chutes and dives out of the plane.\n\nBarack Obama turns to the
       Pope and the Boy Scout and says "I'm the leader of the free world
       and the smartest president in the history of the United States, so
       I must survive." He throws on a pack and dives out of the
       plane.\n\nThe Pope turns to the boy scout and says "Son, I've lived
       a long and fulfilling life. You take the last parachute and save
       yourself."\n\nThe boy scout replies "No problem, Mr. Pope. There
       are still 2 parachutes left. President Obama just jumped out of the
       plane with my knapsack." \n\nChicken: Because Barack is actually an
       idiot.

       The one regarding jumping out of an airplane is false. Everyone
       knows that weight and mass have no bearing on the velocity a moving
       body has when pulled by gravity. That chicken is retarded.

            I'm guessing you've gone to a low level physics class and did
            trajectory and gravity equations solved some problems did some
            lectures, understood it. I'm also guessing that you never got
            to anything involving air friction and how weight, surface
            area, and even shape play a role in determining falling long
            distances. If you got a feather and a small metal bead that
            had the same mass which would fall faster? the bead, although
            if they were both beads or if it was in a vacuum they would
            fall the same. So I'm hoping you can figure out how two people
            could fall differently if there are differences between them.

                 Scientist: Winner Guy Who Understands Physics: Loser But
                 the first person loses because they were writing on the
                 grounds of what everyone knows, yet used the word
                 "retarded" as their go-to burn. Yet the second person
                 loses even more, because they were writing on the grounds
                 of understanding physics. Which is completely lame and
                 unnecessary grounds by which to critique a joke.
                 Basically, anyone who would even bother writing on this
                 topic has too much time on their hands, or simply can not
                 understand the point of jokes. [it is highly unlikely
                 that the misleading representation of physics present in
                 that joke was going to have any repercussions in the
                 scientific community] There you have it, an ironically,
                 and exponentially long critique of some dork's paragraph
                 long critique of some other dork's few sentence long
                 critique of some random person's sentence long critique
                 of the overdone territory of blonde jokes. The End.

       It wouldn't matter what their weights were if a blonde and a
       brunette jumped out of a plane. All objects undergo acceleration at
       32.2 ft/s^2 in a free fall. However, it might matter what their
       relative surface areas were, because the frictional force might
       play a part in determining who hits the ground first. They also
       would not die for certain. There are numerous instances of people
       falling out of planes and surviving incredible falls.

   1. Inside joke
   An inside joke is a joke formed between two or more people that no one
   other than those few people will ever understand until you explain it
   to them. And even when you do explain it to them, they may get the joke
   but may not find it even remotely amusing. People generally find inside
   jokes annoying, as the joke makes absolutley no sense on its own in any
   context. I find that most of the stupidest ones that have been formed
   by own group were formed by accident. Perhaps that is why most of them
   make absolutely no sense.
   However, the inside joke can backfire. In one instance, two people can
   have an inside joke, and a third person finds out about said joke.
   Then, the third person find it even MORE funny than either of the two
   who formed in the first place. Truly annoying.
   I have about 100 or more inside jokes formed between me and one
   particular friend alone. We even have an inside joke about how someday
   every word we say is going to be an inside joke. Which, someday, may
   occur.
   Random person: Yeah, so I went to the pet store, and there were some
   bunnies there. They were really cute.
   Group of friends: BUNNIES ON THE CEILING! AHHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
   Random person: What?
   *inside joke is explained*
   Random person: Oh. Well, uh, that's not THAT funny.
   Group of friends: Yes it is! AHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
   Random person: Uh, ok... *backs away slowly*

   An inside joke is a joke, usually extremely silly and stupid, that you
   share with one or 2 other people. Only you and those people understand
   the joke; if the inside joke is explained to other people, they start
   to wonder if you are crazy because you find something so silly
   hilarious.

   A joke (or gag) is a phrase or a paragraph with a humorous twist. It
   can be in many different forms, such as a question or short story. To
   achieve this end, jokes may employ irony, sarcasm, word play and other
   devices. Jokes may have a punchline that will end the sentence to make
   it humorous.

   A practical joke or prank differs from a spoken one in that the major
   component of the humour is physical rather than verbal (for example
   placing salt in the sugar bowl).

[edit] Purpose

   Jokes are typically for the entertainment of friends and onlookers. The
   desired response is generally laughter; when this does not happen the
   joke is said to have "fallen flat" or "bombed". However, jokes have
   other purposes and functions, common to comedy/humour/satire in
   general.

[edit] Antiquity of jokes

   Jokes have been a part of human culture since at least 1900 BC.
   According to research conducted by Dr Paul McDonald of the University
   of Wolverhampton, a fart joke from ancient Sumer is currently believed
   to be the world's oldest known joke.^[1] Britain's oldest joke,
   meanwhile, is a 1,000-year-old double-entendre that can be found in the
   Codex Exoniensis.^[2]

   A recent discovery of a document called Philogelos (The Laughter Lover)
   gives us an insight into ancient humour. Written in Greek by Hierocles
   and Philagrius, it dates to the third or fourth century AD, and
   contains some 260 jokes. Considering humour from our own culture as
   recent as the 19th century is at times baffling to us today, the humour
   is surprisingly familiar. They had different stereotypes, the
   absent-minded professor, the eunuch, and people with hernias or bad
   breath were favourites. A lot of the jokes play on the idea of knowing
   who characters are:

     A barber, a bald man and an absent minded professor take a journey
     together. They have to camp overnight, so decide to take turns
     watching the luggage. When it's the barber's turn, he gets bored, so
     amuses himself by shaving the head of the professor. When the
     professor is woken up for his shift, he feels his head, and says
     "How stupid is that barber? He's woken up the bald man instead of
     me."

   There is even a joke similar to Monty Python's "Dead Parrot" sketch: a
   man buys a slave, who dies shortly afterwards. When he complains to the
   slave merchant, he is told: "He didn't die when I owned him." Comic Jim
   Bowen has presented them to a modern audience. "One or two of them are
   jokes I've seen in people's acts nowadays, slightly updated. They put
   in a motor car instead of a chariot - some of them are Tommy
   Cooper-esque."^[3]

[edit] Psychology of jokes

   Why people laugh at jokes has been the subject of serious academic
   study, examples being:
     * Immanuel Kant, in Critique of Judgement (1790) states that
       "Laughter is an effect that arises if a tense expectation is
       transformed into nothing." Here is Kant's 220-year old joke and his
       analysis:

     An Englishman at an Indian's table in Surat saw a bottle of ale
     being opened, and all the beer, turned to froth, rushed out. The
     Indian, by repeated exclamations, showed his great amazement. -
     Well, what's so amazing in that? asked the Englishman. - Oh, but I'm
     not amazed at its coming out, replied the Indian, but how you
     managed to get it all in. - This makes us laugh, and it gives us a
     hearty pleasure. This is not because, say, we think we are smarter
     than this ignorant man, nor are we laughing at anything else here
     that it is our liking and that we noticed through our understanding.
     It is rather that we had a tense expectation that suddenly
     vanished...

     * Henri Bergson, in his book Le rire (Laughter, 1901), suggests that
       laughter evolved to make social life possible for human beings.
     * Sigmund Freud's "Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious". (Der
       Witz und seine Beziehung zum Unbewußten).
     * Arthur Koestler, in The Act of Creation (1964), analyses humour and
       compares it to other creative activities, such as literature and
       science.
     * Marvin Minsky in Society of Mind (1986).

          Marvin Minsky suggests that laughter has a specific function
          related to the human brain. In his opinion jokes and laughter
          are mechanisms for the brain to learn nonsense. For that reason,
          he argues, jokes are usually not as funny when you hear them
          repeatedly.

     * Edward de Bono in "The Mechanism of the Mind" (1969) and "I am
       Right, You are Wrong" (1990).

          Edward de Bono suggests that the mind is a pattern-matching
          machine, and that it works by recognising stories and behaviour
          and putting them into familiar patterns. When a familiar
          connection is disrupted and an alternative unexpected new link
          is made in the brain via a different route than expected, then
          laughter occurs as the new connection is made. This theory
          explains a lot about jokes. For example:

          + Why jokes are only funny the first time they are told: once
            they are told the pattern is already there, so there can be no
            new connections, and so no laughter.
          + Why jokes have an elaborate and often repetitive set up: The
            repetition establishes the familiar pattern in the brain. A
            common method used in jokes is to tell almost the same story
            twice and then deliver the punch line the third time the story
            is told. The first two tellings of the story evoke a familiar
            pattern in the brain, thus priming the brain for the punch
            line.
          + Why jokes often rely on stereotypes: the use of a stereotype
            links to familiar expected behaviour, thus saving time in the
            set-up.
          + Why jokes are variants on well-known stories (e.g. the genie
            and a lamp and a man walks into a bar): This again saves time
            in the set up and establishes a familiar pattern.

     * In 2002, Richard Wiseman conducted a study intended to discover the
       world's funniest joke [1].

   Laughter, the intended human reaction to jokes, is healthy in
   moderation, uses the stomach muscles, and releases endorphins, natural
   "feel good" chemicals, into the brain.

[edit] Jokes in organizations

   Jokes can be employed by workers as a way to identify with their jobs.
   For example, 9-1-1 operators often crack jokes about incongruous,
   threatening, or tragic situations they deal with on a daily basis.^[4]
   This use of humour and cracking jokes helps employees differentiate
   themselves from the people they serve while also assisting them in
   identifying with their jobs.^[5] In addition to employees, managers use
   joking, or jocularity, in strategic ways. Some managers attempt to
   suppress joking and humour use because they feel it relates to lower
   production, while others have attempted to manufacture joking through
   pranks, pajama or dress down days, and specific committees that are
   designed to increase fun in the workplace.^[6]

[edit] Rules

   The rules of humour are analogous to those of poetry. These common
   rules are mainly timing, precision, synthesis, and rhythm. French
   philosopher Henri Bergson has said in an essay: "In every wit there is
   something of a poet."^[7] In this essay Bergson views the essence of
   humour as the encrustation of the mechanical upon the living. He used
   as an instance a book by an English humorist, in which an elderly woman
   who desired a reputation as a philanthropist provided "homes within
   easy hail of her mansion for the conversion of atheists who have been
   specially manufactured for her, so to speak, and for a number of honest
   folk who have been made into drunkards so that she may cure them of
   their failing, etc." This idea seems funny because a genuine impulse of
   charity as a living, vital impulse has become encrusted by a mechanical
   conception of how it should manifest itself.

[edit] Precision

   To reach precision, the comedian must choose the words in order to
   provide a vivid, in-focus image, and to avoid being generic as to
   confuse the audience, and provide no laughter. To properly arrange the
   words in the sentence is also crucial to get precision.

[edit] Synthesis

   That a joke is best when it expresses the maximum level of humour with
   a minimal number of words, is today considered one of the key technical
   elements of a joke.^[citation needed] An example from George Carlin:

   I have as much authority as the Pope, I just don't have as many people
   who believe it.^[8]

   Though, the familiarity of the pattern of "brevity" has led to numerous
   examples of jokes where the very length is itself the pattern-breaking
   "punchline".^[citation needed] Numerous examples from Monty Python
   exist, for instance, the song "I Like Traffic Lights". More recently,
   Family Guy often exploits such humour: for example in the episode
   "Wasted Talent", Peter Griffin bangs his shin, a classic slapstick
   routine, and tenderly nurses it while inhaling and exhaling to quiet
   the pain, for considerably longer than expected.^[vague] Certain
   versions of the popular vaudevillian joke The Aristocrats can go on for
   several minutes, and it is considered an anti-joke, as the humour is
   more in the set-up than the punchline.^[vague]

[edit] Rhythm

   Main articles: Timing (linguistics) and Comic timing

   The joke's content (meaning) is not what provokes the laugh, it just
   makes the salience of the joke and provokes a smile. What makes us
   laugh is the joke mechanism. Milton Berle demonstrated this with a
   classic theatre experiment in the 1950s: if during a series of jokes
   you insert phrases that are not jokes, but with the same rhythm, the
   audience laughs anyway^[citation needed]. A classic is the ternary
   rhythm, with three beats: Introduction, premise, antithesis (with the
   antithesis being the punch line).

   In regards to the Milton Berle experiment, they can be taken to
   demonstrate the concept of "breaking context" or "breaking the
   pattern". It is not necessarily the rhythm that caused the audience to
   laugh, but the disparity between the expectation of a "joke" and being
   instead given a non-sequitur "normal phrase." This normal phrase is,
   itself, unexpected, and a type of punchline—the anti-climax.

[edit] Comic

   In the comic field plays the 'economy of ideative expenditure'; in
   other words excessive energy is wasted or action-essential energy is
   saved. The profound meaning of a comic gag or a comic joke is "I'm a
   child"; the comic deals with the clumsy body of the child.

   Laurel and Hardy are a classic example. An individual laughs because he
   recognises the child that is in himself. In clowns stumbling is a
   childish tempo. In the comic, the visual gags may be translated into a
   joke. For example in Side Effects (By Destiny Denied story) by Woody
   Allen:

   "My father used to wear loafers," she confessed. "Both on the same
   foot".

   The typical comic technique is the disproportion.

[edit] Wit

   In the wit field plays the "economy of censorship expenditure"^[9]
   (Freud calls it "the economy of psychic expenditure"); usually
   censorship prevents some 'dangerous ideas' from reaching the conscious
   mind, or helps us avoid saying everything that comes to mind;
   adversely, the wit circumvents the censorship and brings up those
   ideas. Different wit techniques allow one to express them in a funny
   way. The profound meaning behind a wit joke is "I have dangerous
   ideas". An example from Woody Allen:

   I contemplated suicide again - this time by inhaling next to an
   insurance salesman.

   Or, when a bagpipe player was asked "How do you play that thing?" his
   answer was "Well." Wit is a branch of rhetoric, and there are about 200
   techniques (technically they are called tropes, a particular kind of
   figure of speech) that can be used to make jokes.^[10]

   Irony can be seen as belonging to this field.

[edit] Humor

   In the comedy field, humour induces an "economised expenditure of
   emotion" (Freud calls it "economy of affect" or "economy of sympathy".
   Freud produced this final part of his interpretation many years later,
   in a paper later supplemented to the book.).^[9]^[11] In other words,
   the joke erases an emotion that should be felt about an event, making
   us insensitive to it.e.g.: "yo momma" jokes. The profound meaning of
   the void feeling of a humour joke is "I'm a cynic". An example from
   Woody Allen:

   Three times I've been mistaken for Robert Redford. Each time by a blind
   person.

   This field of jokes is still a grey area, being mostly unexplored.
   Extensive use of this kind of humour can be found in the work of
   British satirist Chris Morris, like the sketches of the Jam television
   program.

   Black humour and sarcasm belong to this field.

[edit] Cycles

   Folklorists, in particular (but not exclusively) those who study the
   folklore of the United States, collect jokes into joke cycles. A cycle
   is a collection of jokes with a particular theme or a particular
   "script". (That is, it is a literature cycle.)^[12] Folklorists have
   identified several such cycles:
     * the Helen Keller Joke Cycle that comprises jokes about Helen
       Keller^[13]
     * Viola jokes^[14]
     * the NASA, Challenger, or Space Shuttle Joke Cycle that comprises
       jokes relating to the Space Shuttle Challenger
       disaster^[15]^[16]^[17]
     * the Chernobyl Joke Cycle that comprises jokes relating to the
       Chernobyl disaster^[18]
     * the Polish Pope Joke Cycle that comprises jokes relating to Pope
       John Paul II^[19]
     * the Essex girl and the Stupid Irish joke cycles in the United
       Kingdom^[20]
     * the Dead Baby Joke Cycle^[21]
     * the Newfie Joke Cycle that comprises jokes made by Canadians about
       Newfoundlanders^[22]
     * the Little Willie Joke Cycle, and the Quadriplegic Joke Cycle^[23]
     * the Jew Joke Cycle and the Polack Joke Cycle^[24]
     * the Rastus and Liza Joke Cycle, which Dundes describes as "the most
       vicious and widespread white anti-Negro joke cycle"^[25]
     * the Jewish American Princess and Jewish American Mother joke
       cycles^[26]
     * The Wind-up doll joke cycle^[27]
     * The "Blonde joke" cycle.

   Gruner discusses several "sick joke" cycles that occurred upon events
   surrounding Gary Hart, Natalie Wood, Vic Morrow, Jim Bakker, Richard
   Pryor, Princess Diana and Michael Jackson, noting how several jokes
   were recycled from one cycle to the next. For example: A joke about Vic
   Morrow ("We now know that Vic Morrow had dandruff: they found his head
   and shoulders in the bushes") was subsequently recycled about Admiral
   Mountbatten after his murder by Irish Republican terrorists in 1979,
   and again applied to the crew of the Challenger space shuttle ("How do
   we know that Christa McAuliffe had dandruff? They found her head and
   shoulders on the beach.").^[28]

   Berger asserts that "whenever there is a popular joke cycle, there
   generally is some widespread kind of social and cultural anxiety,
   lingering below the surface, that the joke cycle helps people deal
   with".^[29]

[edit] Types of jokes

   Jokes often depend on the humour of the unexpected, the mildly taboo
   (which can include the distasteful or socially improper), or playing
   off stereotypes and other cultural beliefs. Many jokes fit into more
   than one category.

[edit] Subjects

   Political jokes are usually a form of satire. They generally concern
   politicians and heads of state, but may also cover the absurdities of a
   country's political situation. A prominent example of political jokes
   would be political cartoons. Two large categories of this type of jokes
   exist. The first one makes fun of a negative attitude to political
   opponents or to politicians in general. The second one makes fun of
   political clichés, mottoes, catch phrases or simply blunders of
   politicians. Some, especially the "you have two cows" genre, derive
   humour from comparing different political systems.

   Professional humour includes caricatured portrayals of certain
   professions such as lawyers, and in-jokes told by professionals to each
   other.

   Mathematical jokes are a form of in-joke, generally designed to be
   understandable only by insiders. (They are also often strictly visual
   jokes.)

   Ethnic jokes exploit ethnic stereotypes. They are often racist and
   frequently considered offensive.

   For example, the British tell jokes starting "An Englishman, an
   Irishman and a Scotsman..." which exploit the supposed parsimony of the
   Scot, stupidity of the Irish or rigid conventionality of the English.
   Such jokes exist among numerous peoples.

   Jokes based on other stereotypes (such as blonde jokes) are often
   considered funny.

   Religious jokes fall into several categories:
     * Jokes based on stereotypes associated with people of religion (e.g.
       nun jokes, priest jokes, or rabbi jokes)
     * Jokes on classical religious subjects: crucifixion, Adam and Eve,
       St. Peter at The Gates, etc.
     * Jokes that collide different religious denominations: "A rabbi, a
       medicine man, and a pastor went fishing..."
     * Letters and addresses to God.

   Self-deprecating or self-effacing humour is superficially similar to
   racial and stereotype jokes, but involves the targets laughing at
   themselves. It is said to maintain a sense of perspective and to be
   powerful in defusing confrontations. A common example is Jewish humour.
   A similar situation exists in the Scandinavian "Ole and Lena" joke.

   Self-deprecating humour has also been used by politicians, who
   recognise its ability to acknowledge controversial issues and steal the
   punch of criticism.^[citation needed] For example, when Abraham Lincoln
   was accused of being two-faced he replied, "If I had two faces, do you
   think this is the one I’d be wearing?".

   Dirty jokes are based on taboo, often sexual, content or vocabulary.
   The definitive studies on them have been written by Gershon Legman.

   Other taboos are challenged by sick jokes and gallows humour, and to
   joke about disability is considered in this group.^[citation needed]

   Surrealist or minimalist jokes exploit semantic inconsistency, for
   example: Q: What's red and invisible? A: No tomatoes..^[citation
   needed]

   Anti-jokes are jokes that are not funny in regular sense, and often can
   be decidedly unfunny, but rely on the let-down from the expected joke
   to be funny in itself.^[citation needed]

   An elephant joke is a joke, almost always a riddle or conundrum and
   often a sequence of connected riddles, frequently operating on a
   surrealistic, anti-humorous or meta-humorous level, that involves an
   elephant.

   Jokes involving non-sequitur humour, with parts of the joke being
   unrelated to each other; e.g. "My uncle once punched a man so hard his
   legs became trombones", from The Mighty Boosh TV series.

   Dark humour is often used in order to deal with a difficult situation
   in a manner of "if you can laugh at it, it won't kill you". Usually
   those jokes make fun of tragedies like death, accidents, wars,
   catastrophes or injuries.

[edit] Styles

   The question/answer joke, sometimes posed as a common riddle, has a
   supposedly straight question and an answer which is twisted for
   humorous effect; puns are often employed. Of this type are knock-knock
   joke, light bulb joke, the many variations on "why did the chicken
   cross the road?", and the class of "What's the difference between a
   _______ and a ______" joke, where the punch line is often a pun or a
   spoonerism linking two apparently entirely unconnected concepts.

   Some jokes require a double act, where one respondent (usually the
   straight man) can be relied on to give the correct response to the
   person telling the joke. This is more common in performance than
   informal joke-telling.

   A shaggy dog story is an extremely long and involved joke with an
   intentionally weak or completely non-existent punchline. The humour
   lies in building up the audience's anticipation and then letting them
   down completely. The longer the story can continue without the audience
   realising it is a joke, and not a serious anecdote, the more successful
   it is.

The world's oldest jokes revealed by university research

Academics have unearthed what they believe to be Britain’s oldest joke, a
1,000-year-old double-entendre about men’s sexual desire.

   The Exeter Codex which is kept in Exeter Cathedral library
   Researchers found examples of double-entendres buried in the Codex
   Exoniensis, a 10th century book of Anglo-Saxon poetry held at Exeter

   They found the wry observation in the Codex Exoniensis, a 10th century
   book of Anglo-Saxon poetry held at Exeter Cathedral.

   It reads: “What hangs at a man’s thigh and wants to poke the hole that
   it’s often poked before?’ Answer: A key.”

   Scouring ancient texts, researchers from Wolverhampton University found
   the jokes laid down in delicate manuscripts and carved into stone
   tablets up to three thousand years old.

   Dr Paul MacDonald, a comic novelist and lecturer in creative writing,
   said ancient civilizations laughed about much the same things as we do
   today.

   He said jokes ancient and modern shared “a willingness to deal with
   taboos and a degree of rebellion.”

     * What is the greatest joke ever told?
       01 Aug 2008

   “Modern puns, Essex girl jokes and toilet humour can all be traced back
   to the very earliest jokes identified in this research,” he commented.

   Lost civilisations laughed at farts, sex, and "stupid people" just as
   we do today, Dr McDonald said.

   But they found evidence that Egyptians were laughing at much the same
   thing.

   "Man is even more eager to copulate than a donkey - his purse is what
   restrains him," reads an Egyptian hieroglyphic from a period that
   pre-dates Christ.

   The study, for a digital television channel, took Dr McDonald and a
   five-strong team of scholars more than three months to complete.

   They trawled the internet, contacted dozens of museums, and spoke to
   numerous private book collectors in a bid to track down modern,
   interpreted versions of the world's oldest texts.

   The team then read the texts to find hidden jokes, double-entendres or
   funny riddles.

   Dr McDonald said only those jokes that were amusing in an historical
   and modern context were included in the list.

   Dr McDonald, a comic novelist and a senior lecturer in creative
   writing, added: "We began with the assumption that the oldest forms of
   jokes just would not have modern day appeal, but a lot of them do.

   The world's oldest surviving joke "is essentially a fart gag", he said.

   The 3,000-year-old Sumerian proverb, from ancient Babylonia, reads:
   "Something which has never occurred since time immemorial; a young
   woman did not fart in her husband's lap."

   The joke has echoes of actor John Barrymore's quip: "Love is the
   delightful interval between meeting a beautiful girl and discovering
   that she looks like a haddock."

   Dr McDonald commented: "Toilet humour goes back just about as far as we
   can go."

   Steve North, from Dave television, said: "What is interesting about
   these ancient jokes is that they feature the same old stand up comedy
   subjects: relationships, toilet humour and sex jokes.

   "The delivery may be different, but the subject matter hasn't changed a
   bit."

What is the greatest joke ever told?

Academics have unearthed what they believe to be the world's oldest jokes and
concluded that humour has changed very little. Human beings have always
laughed at farts, sex, and "stupid people" just as we do today, said Dr Paul
McDonald from Wolverhampton University.

   Comments Comments

   Britain's "oldest joke", discovered in the Codex Exoniensis, a 10th
   century book of Anglo-Saxon poetry held at Exeter Cathedral, reads:
   "What hangs at a man's thigh and wants to poke the hole that it's often
   poked before?' Answer: A key."

   Egyptians were telling jokes even earlier, according to researchers.
   One gag, which pre-dates Christ, reads: "Something which has never
   occurred since time immemorial: a young woman did not fart in her
   husband's lap".

   Is a gag's content most important or its delivery?

   Have any jokes offended you? Or shouldn't humour be taken too
   seriously?

Dead Parrot sketch is 1,600 years old

It's long been held that the old jokes are the best jokes - and Monty
Python's Dead Parrot sketch is no different.

   Monty Python's 'Dead Parrot sketch' - which featured John Cleese
   (pictured) - is some 1,600 years old

   A classic scholar has proved the point, by unearthing a Greek version
   of the world-famous piece that is some 1,600 years old.

   A comedy duo called Hierocles and Philagrius told the original version,
   only rather than a parrot they used a slave.

   It concerns a man who complains to his friend that he was sold a slave
   who dies in his service.

   His companion replies: "When he was with me, he never did any such
   thing!"

   The joke was discovered in a collection of 265 jokes called Philogelos:
   The Laugh Addict, which dates from the fourth century AD.

   Hierocles had gone to meet his maker, and Philagrius had certainly
   ceased to be, long before John Cleese and Michael Palin reinvented the
   yarn in 1969.

   Their version featured Cleese as an exasperated customer trying to get
   his money back from Palin's stubborn pet salesman.

   Cleese's character becomes increasingly frustrated as he fails to
   convince the shopkeeper that the 'Norwegian Blue' is dead.

   The manuscripts from the Greek joke book have now been published in an
   online book, featuring former Bullseye presenter and comic Jim Bowen
   presenting them to a modern audience.

   Mr Bowen said: "One or two of them are jokes I've seen in people's acts
   nowadays, slightly updated.

   "They put in a motor car instead of a chariot - some of them are Tommy
   Cooper-esque."

   Jokes about wives, it seems, have always been fair game.

   One joke goes: "A man tells a well-known wit: 'I had your wife, without
   paying a penny'. The husband replies: "It's my duty as a husband to
   couple with such a monstrosity. What made you do it?"

   The book was translated by William Berg, an American classics
   professor.

   Ben and Tim Vine

   Blimey, is it that time of the week again already? These things seem to
   come round quicker than a Kim Kardashian divorce, but I’ve checked the
   diary and despite the horological Gods trying to fool us by putting the
   clocks back, it’s definitely the blogging hour.

   Despite the aforementioned tragic demise of Ms Kardashian’s nuptials,
   and with it the undermining of the sanctity of marriage itself, this
   week’s episode has risen like a phoenix from Kim’s smouldering confetti
   ashes. And stoking those flames is a man who, if comics were motorways
   would be the MPun, Mr. Tim Vine.
   Now, previous listeners and those who know me will be well aware of my
   deep seated dislike of puns and wordplay in general, arising from an
   unpleasant incident whereby I was mauled by a particularly vicious
   one-liner as a child (@Pronger69 could be very cruel). Those who know
   me will also know that the previous sentence is complete bunkum (apart
   from the bit about my dad) and there is literally NOTHING I like better
   than a cheeky witticism, or in this case, a veritable barrage of them.
   And when I say literally, I mean literally. I have in the past been
   known to give up food in favour of dining solely on the delicious jokes
   found on the back of Penguin wrappers, occasionally licking the
   chocolate off the other side for sustenance when absolutely necessary.
   Fortunately, Tim, the nation’s foremost machine punner, was more than
   happy to feed my insatiable appetite, and with me offering verbal hors
   d’oeuvres as well we were soon talking almost exclusively in witty
   riddles, or whittles. Which is coincidental, as Whittle is also the
   name of Tim’s fondly remembered Channel 5 game show from the mid-90s, a
   subject we discussed with glee. And I don’t mean the Amreican high
   school musical drama series, Tim has not appeared on that as yet.
   Ben and Adam Hills

   Someone else who hasn’t been on Glee is this week’s other guest Adam
   Hills, though with his ever-growing international renown it’s surely
   only a matter of time. Fortunately, all this high praise hadn’t gone to
   Adam’s head and we were able to spend a very pleasant morning sat on a
   park bench, discussing all manner of life’s trifling details. It almost
   seemed a shame to have to shove microphones under our noses and record
   the damn thing, but shove we must.
   And with the word shove still ringing in your ears and maybe other
   orifices too, it’s time to once again bid you adieu.
   Goodbye for now, Fraulines and Frownlines x

Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of Comic
by Henri Bergson

II

   There may be something artificial in making a special category for the
   comic in words, since most of the varieties of the comic that we have
   examined so far were produced through the medium of language. We must
   make a distinction, however, between the comic EXPRESSED and the comic
   CREATED by language. The former could, if necessary, be translated from
   one language into another, though at the cost of losing the greater
   portion of its significance when introduced into a fresh society
   different in manners, in literature, and above all in association of
   ideas. But it is generally impossible to translate the latter. It owes
   its entire being to the structure of the sentence or to the choice of
   the words. It does not set forth, by means of language, special cases
   of absentmindedness in man or in events. It lays stress on lapses of
   attention in language itself. In this case, it is language itself that
   becomes comic.

   Comic sayings, however, are not a matter of spontaneous generation; if
   we laugh at them, we are equally entitled to laugh at their author.
   This latter condition, however, is not indispensable, since the saying
   or expression has a comic virtue of its own. This is proved by the fact
   that we find it very difficult, in the majority of these cases, to say
   whom we are laughing at, although at times we have a dim, vague feeling
   that there is some one in the background.

   Moreover, the person implicated is not always the speaker. Here it
   seems as though we should draw an important distinction between the
   WITTY (SPIRITUEL) and the COMIC. A word is said to be comic when it
   makes us laugh at the person who utters it, and witty when it makes us
   laugh either at a third party or at ourselves. But in most cases we can
   hardly make up our minds whether the word is comic or witty. All that
   we can say is that it is laughable.

   Before proceeding, it might be well to examine more closely what is
   meant by ESPRIT. A witty saying makes us at least smile; consequently,
   no investigation into laughter would be complete did it not get to the
   bottom of the nature of wit and throw light on the underlying idea. It
   is to be feared, however, that this extremely subtle essence is one
   that evaporates when exposed to the light.

   Let us first make a distinction between the two meanings of the word
   wit ESPRIT, the broader one and the more restricted. In the broader
   meaning of the word, it would seem that what is called wit is a certain
   DRAMATIC way of thinking. Instead of treating his ideas as mere
   symbols, the wit sees them, he hears them and, above all, makes them
   converse with one another like persons. He puts them on the stage, and
   himself, to some extent, into the bargain. A witty nation is, of
   necessity, a nation enamoured of the theatre. In every wit there is
   something of a poet--just as in every good reader there is the making
   of an actor. This comparison is made purposely, because a proportion
   might easily be established between the four terms. In order to read
   well we need only the intellectual side of the actor's art; but in
   order to act well one must be an actor in all one's soul and body. In
   just the same way, poetic creation calls for some degree of
   self-forgetfulness, whilst the wit does not usually err in this
   respect. We always get a glimpse of the latter behind what he says and
   does. He is not wholly engrossed in the business, because he only
   brings his intelligence into play. So any poet may reveal himself as a
   wit when he pleases. To do this there will be no need for him to
   acquire anything; it seems rather as though he would have to give up
   something. He would simply have to let his ideas hold converse with one
   another "for nothing, for the mere joy of the thing!" [Footnote: "Pour
   rien, pour le plaisir" is a quotation from Victor Hugo's Marion
   Delorme] He would only have to unfasten the double bond which keeps his
   ideas in touch with his feelings and his soul in touch with life. In
   short, he would turn into a wit by simply resolving to be no longer a
   poet in feeling, but only in intelligence.

   But if wit consists, for the most part, in seeing things SUB SPECIE
   THEATRI, it is evidently capable of being specially directed to one
   variety of dramatic art, namely, comedy. Here we have a more restricted
   meaning of the term, and, moreover, the only one that interests us from
   the point of view of the theory of laughter. What is here called WIT is
   a gift for dashing off comic scenes in a few strokes--dashing them off,
   however, so subtly, delicately and rapidly, that all is over as soon as
   we begin to notice them.

   Who are the actors in these scenes? With whom has the wit to deal?
   First of all, with his interlocutors themselves, when his witticism is
   a direct retort to one of them. Often with an absent person whom he
   supposes to have spoken and to whom he is replying. Still oftener, with
   the whole world,--in the ordinary meaning of the term,--which he takes
   to task, twisting a current idea into a paradox, or making use of a
   hackneyed phrase, or parodying some quotation or proverb. If we compare
   these scenes in miniature with one another, we find they are almost
   always variations of a comic theme with which we are well acquainted,
   that of the "robber robbed." You take up a metaphor, a phrase, an
   argument, and turn it against the man who is, or might be, its author,
   so that he is made to say what he did not mean to say and lets himself
   be caught, to some extent, in the toils of language. But the theme of
   the "robber robbed" is not the only possible one. We have gone over
   many varieties of the comic, and there is not one of them that is
   incapable of being volatilised into a witticism.

   Every witty remark, then, lends itself to an analysis, whose chemical
   formula, so to say, we are now in a position to state. It runs as
   follows: Take the remark, first enlarge it into a regular scene, then
   find out the category of the comic to which the scene evidently
   belongs: by this means you reduce the witty remark to its simplest
   elements and obtain a full explanation of it.

   Let us apply this method to a classic example. "Your chest hurts me"
   (J'AI MAL A VOTRE POITRINE) wrote Mme. de Sevigne to her ailing
   daughter--clearly a witty saying. If our theory is correct, we need
   only lay stress upon the saying, enlarge and magnify it, and we shall
   see it expand into a comic scene. Now, we find this very scene, ready
   made, in the AMOUR MEDECIN of Moliere. The sham doctor, Clitandre, who
   has been summoned to attend Sganarelle's daughter, contents himself
   with feeling Sganarelle's own pulse, whereupon, relying on the sympathy
   there must be between father and daughter, he unhesitatingly concludes:
   "Your daughter is very ill!" Here we have the transition from the witty
   to the comical. To complete our analysis, then, all we have to do is to
   discover what there is comical in the idea of giving a diagnosis of the
   child after sounding the father or the mother. Well, we know that one
   essential form of comic fancy lies in picturing to ourselves a living
   person as a kind of jointed dancing-doll, and that frequently, with the
   object of inducing us to form this mental picture, we are shown two or
   more persons speaking and acting as though attached to one another by
   invisible strings. Is not this the idea here suggested when we are led
   to materialise, so to speak, the sympathy we postulate as existing
   between father and daughter?

   We now see how it is that writers on wit have perforce confined
   themselves to commenting on the extraordinary complexity of the things
   denoted by the term without ever succeeding in defining it. There are
   many ways of being witty, almost as many as there are of being the
   reverse. How can we detect what they have in common with one another,
   unless we first determine the general relationship between the witty
   and the comic? Once, however, this relationship is cleared up,
   everything is plain sailing. We then find the same connection between
   the comic and the witty as exists between a regular scene and the
   fugitive suggestion of a possible one. Hence, however numerous the
   forms assumed by the comic, wit will possess an equal number of
   corresponding varieties. So that the comic, in all its forms, is what
   should be defined first, by discovering (a task which is already quite
   difficult enough) the clue that leads from one form to the other. By
   that very operation wit will have been analysed, and will then appear
   as nothing more than the comic in a highly volatile state. To follow
   the opposite plan, however, and attempt directly to evolve a formula
   for wit, would be courting certain failure. What should we think of a
   chemist who, having ever so many jars of a certain substance in his
   laboratory, would prefer getting that substance from the atmosphere, in
   which merely infinitesimal traces of its vapour are to be found?

   But this comparison between the witty and the comic is also indicative
   of the line we must take in studying the comic in words. On the one
   hand, indeed, we find there is no essential difference between a word
   that is comic and one that is witty; on the other hand, the latter,
   although connected with a figure of speech, invariably calls up the
   image, dim or distinct, of a comic scene. This amounts to saying that
   the comic in speech should correspond, point by point, with the comic
   in actions and in situations, and is nothing more, if one may so
   express oneself, than their projection on to the plane of words. So let
   us return to the comic in actions and in situations, consider the chief
   methods by which it is obtained, and apply them to the choice of words
   and the building up of sentences. We shall thus have every possible
   form of the comic in words as well as every variety of wit.

   1. Inadvertently to say or do what we have no intention of saying or
   doing, as a result of inelasticity or momentum, is, as we are aware,
   one of the main sources of the comic. Thus, absentmindedness is
   essentially laughable, and so we laugh at anything rigid, ready- made,
   mechanical in gesture, attitude and even facial expression. Do we find
   this kind of rigidity in language also? No doubt we do, since language
   contains ready-made formulas and stereotyped phrases. The man who
   always expressed himself in such terms would invariably be comic. But
   if an isolated phrase is to be comic in itself, when once separated
   from the person who utters it, it must be something more than
   ready-made, it must bear within itself some sign which tells us, beyond
   the possibility of doubt, that it was uttered automatically. This can
   only happen when the phrase embodies some evident absurdity, either a
   palpable error or a contradiction in terms. Hence the following general
   rule: A COMIC MEANING IS INVARIABLY OBTAINED WHEN AN ABSURD IDEA IS
   FITTED INTO A WELL- ESTABLISHED PHRASE-FORM.

   "Ce sabre est le plus beau jour de ma vie," said M. Prudhomme.
   Translate the phrase into English or German and it becomes purely
   absurd, though it is comic enough in French. The reason is that "le
   plus beau jour de ma vie" is one of those ready-made phrase-endings to
   which a Frenchman's ear is accustomed. To make it comic, then, we need
   only clearly indicate the automatism of the person who utters it. This
   is what we get when we introduce an absurdity into the phrase. Here the
   absurdity is by no means the source of the comic, it is only a very
   simple and effective means of making it obvious.

   We have quoted only one saying of M. Prudhomme, but the majority of
   those attributed to him belong to the same class. M. Prudhomme is a man
   of ready-made phrases. And as there are ready-made phrases in all
   languages, M. Prudhomme is always capable of being transposed, though
   seldom of being translated. At times the commonplace phrase, under
   cover of which the absurdity slips in, is not so readily noticeable. "I
   don't like working between meals," said a lazy lout. There would be
   nothing amusing in the saying did there not exist that salutary precept
   in the realm of hygiene: "One should not eat between meals."

   Sometimes, too, the effect is a complicated one. Instead of one
   commonplace phrase-form, there are two or three which are dovetailed
   into each other. Take, for instance, the remark of one of the
   characters in a play by Labiche, "Only God has the right to kill His
   fellow-creature." It would seem that advantage is here taken of two
   separate familiar sayings; "It is God who disposes of the lives of
   men," and, "It is criminal for a man to kill his fellow-creature." But
   the two sayings are combined so as to deceive the ear and leave the
   impression of being one of those hackneyed sentences that are accepted
   as a matter of course. Hence our attention nods, until we are suddenly
   aroused by the absurdity of the meaning. These examples suffice to show
   how one of the most important types of the comic can be projected--in a
   simplified form--on the plane of speech. We will now proceed to a form
   which is not so general.

   2. "We laugh if our attention is diverted to the physical in a person
   when it is the moral that is in question," is a law we laid down in the
   first part of this work. Let us apply it to language. Most words might
   be said to have a PHYSICAL and a MORAL meaning, according as they are
   interpreted literally or figuratively. Every word, indeed, begins by
   denoting a concrete object or a material action; but by degrees the
   meaning of the word is refined into an abstract relation or a pure
   idea. If, then, the above law holds good here, it should be stated as
   follows: "A comic effect is obtained whenever we pretend to take
   literally an expression which was used figuratively"; or, "Once our
   attention is fixed on the material aspect of a metaphor, the idea
   expressed becomes comic."

   In the phrase, "Tous les arts sont freres" (all the arts are brothers),
   the word "frere" (brother) is used metaphorically to indicate a more or
   less striking resemblance. The word is so often used in this way, that
   when we hear it we do not think of the concrete, the material
   connection implied in every relationship. We should notice it more if
   we were told that "Tous les arts sont cousins," for the word "cousin"
   is not so often employed in a figurative sense; that is why the word
   here already assumes a slight tinge of the comic. But let us go further
   still, and suppose that our attention is attracted to the material side
   of the metaphor by the choice of a relationship which is incompatible
   with the gender of the two words composing the metaphorical expression:
   we get a laughable result. Such is the well-known saying, also
   attributed to M. Prudhomme, "Tous les arts (masculine) sont soeurs
   (feminine)." "He is always running after a joke," was said in
   Boufflers' presence regarding a very conceited fellow. Had Boufflers
   replied, "He won't catch it," that would have been the beginning of a
   witty saying, though nothing more than the beginning, for the word
   "catch" is interpreted figuratively almost as often as the word "run";
   nor does it compel us more strongly than the latter to materialise the
   image of two runners, the one at the heels of the other. In order that
   the rejoinder may appear to be a thoroughly witty one, we must borrow
   from the language of sport an expression so vivid and concrete that we
   cannot refrain from witnessing the race in good earnest. This is what
   Boufflers does when he retorts, "I'll back the joke!"

   We said that wit often consists in extending the idea of one's
   interlocutor to the point of making him express the opposite of what he
   thinks and getting him, so to say, entrapt by his own words. We must
   now add that this trap is almost always some metaphor or comparison the
   concrete aspect of which is turned against him. You may remember the
   dialogue between a mother and her son in the Faux Bonshommes: "My dear
   boy, gambling on 'Change is very risky. You win one day and lose the
   next."--"Well, then, I will gamble only every other day." In the same
   play too we find the following edifying conversation between two
   company-promoters: "Is this a very honourable thing we are doing? These
   unfortunate shareholders, you see, we are taking the money out of their
   very pockets...."--"Well, out of what do you expect us to take it?"

   An amusing result is likewise obtainable whenever a symbol or an emblem
   is expanded on its concrete side, and a pretence is made of retaining
   the same symbolical value for this expansion as for the emblem itself.
   In a very lively comedy we are introduced to a Monte Carlo official,
   whose uniform is covered with medals, although he has only received a
   single decoration. "You see, I staked my medal on a number at
   roulette," he said, "and as the number turned up, I was entitled to
   thirty-six times my stake." This reasoning is very similar to that
   offered by Giboyer in the Effrontes. Criticism is made of a bride of
   forty summers who is wearing orange-blossoms with her wedding costume:
   "Why, she was entitled to oranges, let alone orange-blossoms!" remarked
   Giboyer.

   But we should never cease were we to take one by one all the laws we
   have stated, and try to prove them on what we have called the plane of
   language. We had better confine ourselves to the three general
   propositions of the preceding section. We have shown that "series of
   events" may become comic either by repetition, by inversion, or by
   reciprocal interference. Now we shall see that this is also the case
   with series of words.

   To take series of events and repeat them in another key or another
   environment, or to invert them whilst still leaving them a certain
   meaning, or mix them up so that their respective meanings jostle one
   another, is invariably comic, as we have already said, for it is
   getting life to submit to be treated as a machine. But thought, too, is
   a living thing. And language, the translation of thought, should be
   just as living. We may thus surmise that a phrase is likely to become
   comic if, though reversed, it still makes sense, or if it expresses
   equally well two quite independent sets of ideas, or, finally, if it
   has been obtained by transposing an idea into some key other than its
   own. Such, indeed, are the three fundamental laws of what might be
   called THE COMIC TRANSFORMATION OF SENTENCES, as we shall show by a few
   examples.

   Let it first be said that these three laws are far from being of equal
   importance as regards the theory of the ludicrous. INVERSION is the
   least interesting of the three. It must be easy of application,
   however, for it is noticeable that, no sooner do professional wits hear
   a sentence spoken than they experiment to see if a meaning cannot be
   obtained by reversing it,--by putting, for instance, the subject in
   place of the object, and the object in place of the subject. It is not
   unusual for this device to be employed for refuting an idea in more or
   less humorous terms. One of the characters in a comedy of Labiche
   shouts out to his neighbour on the floor above, who is in the habit of
   dirtying his balcony, "What do you mean by emptying your pipe on to my
   terrace?" The neighbour retorts, "What do you mean by putting your
   terrace under my pipe?" There is no necessity to dwell upon this kind
   of wit, instances of which could easily be multiplied. The RECIPROCAL
   INTERFERENCE of two sets of ideas in the same sentence is an
   inexhaustible source of amusing varieties. There are many ways of
   bringing about this interference, I mean of bracketing in the same
   expression two independent meanings that apparently tally. The least
   reputable of these ways is the pun. In the pun, the same sentence
   appears to offer two independent meanings, but it is only an
   appearance; in reality there are two different sentences made up of
   different words, but claiming to be one and the same because both have
   the same sound. We pass from the pun, by imperceptible stages, to the
   true play upon words. Here there is really one and the same sentence
   through which two different sets of ideas are expressed, and we are
   confronted with only one series of words; but advantage is taken of the
   different meanings a word may have, especially when used figuratively
   instead of literally. So that in fact there is often only a slight
   difference between the play upon words on the one hand, and a poetic
   metaphor or an illuminating comparison on the other. Whereas an
   illuminating comparison and a striking image always seem to reveal the
   close harmony that exists between language and nature, regarded as two
   parallel forms of life, the play upon words makes us think somehow of a
   negligence on the part of language, which, for the time being, seems to
   have forgotten its real function and now claims to accommodate things
   to itself instead of accommodating itself to things. And so the play
   upon words always betrays a momentary LAPSE OF ATTENTION in language,
   and it is precisely on that account that it is amusing.

   INVERSION and RECIPROCAL INTERFERENCE, after all, are only a certain
   playfulness of the mind which ends at playing upon words. The comic in
   TRANSPOSITION is much more far-reaching. Indeed, transposition is to
   ordinary language what repetition is to comedy.

   We said that repetition is the favourite method of classic comedy. It
   consists in so arranging events that a scene is reproduced either
   between the same characters under fresh circumstances or between fresh
   characters under the same circumstances. Thus we have, repeated by
   lackeys in less dignified language, a scene already played by their
   masters. Now, imagine ideas expressed in suitable style and thus placed
   in the setting of their natural environment. If you think of some
   arrangement whereby they are transferred to fresh surroundings, while
   maintaining their mutual relations, or, in other words, if you can
   induce them to express themselves in an altogether different style and
   to transpose themselves into another key, you will have language itself
   playing a comedy--language itself made comic. There will be no need,
   moreover, actually to set before us both expressions of the same ideas,
   the transposed expression and the natural one. For we are acquainted
   with the natural one--the one which we should have chosen
   instinctively. So it will be enough if the effort of comic invention
   bears on the other, and on the other alone. No sooner is the second set
   before us than we spontaneously supply the first. Hence the following
   general rule: A COMIC EFFECT IS ALWAYS OBTAINABLE BY TRANSPOSING THE
   NATURE EXPRESSION OF AN IDEA INTO ANOTHER KEY.

   The means of transposition are so many and varied, language affords so
   rich a continuity of themes and the comic is here capable of passing
   through so great a number of stages, from the most insipid buffoonery
   up to the loftiest forms of humour and irony, that we shall forego the
   attempt to make out a complete list. Having stated the rule, we will
   simply, here and there, verify its main applications.

   In the first place, we may distinguish two keys at the extreme ends of
   the scale, the solemn and the familiar. The most obvious effects are
   obtained by merely transposing the one into the other, which thus
   provides us with two opposite currents of comic fancy.

   Transpose the solemn into the familiar and the result is parody. The
   effect of parody, thus defined, extends to instances in which the idea
   expressed in familiar terms is one that, if only in deference to
   custom, ought to be pitched in another key. Take as an example the
   following description of the dawn, quoted by Jean Paul Richter: "The
   sky was beginning to change from black to red, like a lobster being
   boiled." Note that the expression of old-world matters in terms of
   modern life produces the same effect, by reason of the halo of poetry
   which surrounds classical antiquity.

   It is doubtless the comic in parody that has suggested to some
   philosophers, and in particular to Alexander Bain, the idea of defining
   the comic, in general, as a species of DEGRADATION. They describe the
   laughable as causing something to appear mean that was formerly
   dignified. But if our analysis is correct, degradation is only one form
   of transposition, and transposition itself only one of the means of
   obtaining laughter. There is a host of others, and the source of
   laughter must be sought for much further back. Moreover, without going
   so far, we see that while the transposition from solemn to trivial,
   from better to worse, is comic, the inverse transposition may be even
   more so.

   It is met with as often as the other, and, apparently, we may
   distinguish two main forms of it, according as it refers to the
   PHYSICAL DIMENSIONS of an object or to its MORAL VALUE.

   To speak of small things as though they were large is, in a general
   way, TO EXAGGERATE. Exaggeration is always comic when prolonged, and
   especially when systematic; then, indeed, it appears as one method of
   transposition. It excites so much laughter that some writers have been
   led to define the comic as exaggeration, just as others have defined it
   as degradation. As a matter of fact, exaggeration, like degradation, is
   only one form of one kind of the comic. Still, it is a very striking
   form. It has given birth to the mock-heroic poem, a rather
   old-fashioned device, I admit, though traces of it are still to be
   found in persons inclined to exaggerate methodically. It might often be
   said of braggadocio that it is its mock-heroic aspect which makes us
   laugh.

   Far more artificial, but also far more refined, is the transposition
   upwards from below when applied to the moral value of things, not to
   their physical dimensions. To express in reputable language some
   disreputable idea, to take some scandalous situation, some low-class
   calling or disgraceful behaviour, and describe them in terms of the
   utmost "RESPECTABILITY," is generally comic. The English word is here
   purposely employed, as the practice itself is characteristically
   English. Many instances of it may be found in Dickens and Thackeray,
   and in English literature generally. Let us remark, in passing, that
   the intensity of the effect does not here depend on its length. A word
   is sometimes sufficient, provided it gives us a glimpse of an entire
   system of transposition accepted in certain social circles and reveals,
   as it were, a moral organisation of immorality. Take the following
   remark made by an official to one of his subordinates in a novel of
   Gogol's, "Your peculations are too extensive for an official of your
   rank."

   Summing up the foregoing, then, there are two extreme terms of
   comparison, the very large and the very small, the best and the worst,
   between which transposition may be effected in one direction or the
   other. Now, if the interval be gradually narrowed, the contrast between
   the terms obtained will be less and less violent, and the varieties of
   comic transposition more and more subtle.

   The most common of these contrasts is perhaps that between the real and
   the ideal, between what is and what ought to be. Here again
   transposition may take place in either direction. Sometimes we state
   what ought to be done, and pretend to believe that this is just what is
   actually being done; then we have IRONY. Sometimes, on the contrary, we
   describe with scrupulous minuteness what is being done, and pretend to
   believe that this is just what ought to be done; such is often the
   method of HUMOUR. Humour, thus denned, is the counterpart of irony.
   Both are forms of satire, but irony is oratorical in its nature, whilst
   humour partakes of the scientific. Irony is emphasised the higher we
   allow ourselves to be uplifted by the idea of the good that ought to
   be: thus irony may grow so hot within us that it becomes a kind of
   high-pressure eloquence. On the other hand, humour is the more
   emphasised the deeper we go down into an evil that actually is, in
   order t o set down its details in the most cold-blooded indifference.
   Several authors, Jean Paul amongst them, have noticed that humour
   delights in concrete terms, technical details, definite facts. If our
   analysis is correct, this is not an accidental trait of humour, it is
   its very essence. A humorist is a moralist disguised as a scientist,
   something like an anatomist who practises dissection with the sole
   object of filling us with disgust; so that humour, in the restricted
   sense in which we are here regarding the word, is really a
   transposition from the moral to the scientific.

   By still further curtailing the interval between the terms transposed,
   we may now obtain more and more specialised types of comic
   transpositions. Thus, certain professions have a technical vocabulary:
   what a wealth of laughable results have been obtained by transposing
   the ideas of everyday life into this professional jargon! Equally comic
   is the extension of business phraseology to the social relations of
   life,--for instance, the phrase of one of Labiche's characters in
   allusion to an invitation he has received, "Your kindness of the third
   ult.," thus transposing the commercial formula, "Your favour of the
   third instant." This class of the comic, moreover, may attain a special
   profundity of its own when it discloses not merely a professional
   practice, but a fault in character. Recall to mind the scenes in the
   Faux Bonshommes and the Famille Benoiton, where marriage is dealt with
   as a business affair, and matters of sentiment are set down in strictly
   commercial language.

   Here, however, we reach the point at which peculiarities of language
   really express peculiarities of character, a closer investigation of
   which we must hold over to the next chapter. Thus, as might have been
   expected and may be seen from the foregoing, the comic in words follows
   closely on the comic in situation and is finally merged, along with the
   latter, in the comic in character. Language only attains laughable
   results because it is a human product, modelled as exactly as possible
   on the forms of the human mind. We feel it contains some living element
   of our own life; and if this life of language were complete and
   perfect, if there were nothing stereotype in it, if, in short, language
   were an absolutely unified organism incapable of being split up into
   independent organisms, it would evade the comic as would a soul whose
   life was one harmonious whole, unruffled as the calm surface of a
   peaceful lake. There is no pool, however, which has not some dead
   leaves floating on its surface, no human soul upon which there do not
   settle habits that make it rigid against itself by making it rigid
   against others, no language, in short, so subtle and instinct with
   life, so fully alert in each of its parts as to eliminate the
   ready-made and oppose the mechanical operations of inversion,
   transposition, etc., which one would fain perform upon it as on some
   lifeless thing. The rigid, the ready-- made, the mechanical, in
   contrast with the supple, the ever-changing and the living,
   absentmindedness in contrast with attention, in a word, automatism in
   contrast with free activity, such are the defects that laughter singles
   out and would fain correct. We appealed to this idea to give us light
   at the outset, when starting upon the analysis of the ludicrous. We
   have seen it shining at every decisive turning in our road. With its
   help, we shall now enter upon a more important investigation, one that
   will, we hope, be more instructive. We purpose, in short, studying
   comic characters, or rather determining the essential conditions of
   comedy in character, while endeavouring to bring it about that this
   study may contribute to a better understanding of the real nature of
   art and the general relation between art and life.

   George Denis Patrick Carlin (May 12, 1937 – June 22, 2008) was an
   American stand-up comedian, social critic, satirist, actor and
   writer/author, who won five Grammy Awards for his comedy albums.^[23]

   Carlin was noted for his black humor as well as his thoughts on
   politics, the English language, psychology, religion, and various taboo
   subjects. Carlin and his "Seven Dirty Words" comedy routine were
   central to the 1978 U.S. Supreme Court case F.C.C. v. Pacifica
   Foundation, in which a narrow 5–4 decision by the justices affirmed the
   government's power to regulate indecent material on the public
   airwaves.

   The first of his fourteen stand-up comedy specials for HBO was filmed
   in 1977. In the 1990s and 2000s, Carlin's routines focused on
   socio-cultural criticism of modern American society. He often commented
   on contemporary political issues in the United States and satirized the
   excesses of American culture. His final HBO special, It's Bad for Ya,
   was filmed less than four months before his death.

   In 2004, Carlin placed second on the Comedy Central list of the 100
   greatest stand-up comedians of all time, ahead of Lenny Bruce and
   behind Richard Pryor.^[24] He was a frequent performer and guest host
   on The Tonight Show during the three-decade Johnny Carson era, and
   hosted the first episode of Saturday Night Live. In 2008, he was
   awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.

[edit] Early life

   Carlin was born in Manhattan,^[25]^[26] the second son of Mary Beary, a
   secretary, and Patrick Carlin, a national advertising manager for the
   New York Sun.^[27] Carlin was of Irish descent and was raised a Roman
   Catholic.^[28]^[29]^[30]

   Carlin grew up on West 121st Street, in a neighborhood of Manhattan
   which he later said, in a stand-up routine, he and his friends called
   "White Harlem", because that sounded a lot tougher than its real name
   of Morningside Heights. He was raised by his mother, who left his
   father when Carlin was two months old.^[31] He attended Corpus Christi
   School, a Roman Catholic parish school of the Corpus Christi Church, in
   Morningside Heights.^[32]^[33] After three semesters, at the age of 15,
   Carlin involuntarily left Cardinal Hayes High School and briefly
   attended Bishop Dubois High School in Harlem.^[34] Carlin had a
   difficult relationship with his mother and often ran away from
   home.^[2] He later joined the United States Air Force and was trained
   as a radar technician. He was stationed at Barksdale Air Force Base in
   Bossier City, Louisiana.

   During this time he began working as a disc jockey at radio station
   KJOE, in the nearby city of Shreveport. He did not complete his Air
   Force enlistment. Labeled an "unproductive airman" by his superiors,
   Carlin was discharged on July 29, 1957.

[edit] Career

   In 1959, Carlin and Jack Burns began as a comedy team when both were
   working for radio station KXOL in Fort Worth, Texas.^[35] After
   successful performances at Fort Worth's beat coffeehouse, The Cellar,
   Burns and Carlin headed for California in February 1960 and stayed
   together for two years as a team before moving on to individual
   pursuits.

[edit] 1960s

   Within weeks of arriving in California in 1960, Burns and Carlin put
   together an audition tape and created The Wright Brothers, a morning
   show on KDAY in Hollywood. The comedy team worked there for three
   months, honing their material in beatnik coffeehouses at night.^[36]
   Years later when he was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of
   Fame, Carlin requested that it be placed in front of the KDAY studios
   near the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street.^[37] Burns and
   Carlin recorded their only album, Burns and Carlin at the Playboy Club
   Tonight, in May 1960 at Cosmo Alley in Hollywood.^[36]

   In the 1960s, Carlin began appearing on television variety shows,
   notably The Ed Sullivan Show and The Tonight Show. His most famous
   routines were:
     * The Indian Sergeant ("You wit' the beads... get outta line")
     * Stupid disc jockeys ("Wonderful WINO...")—"The Beatles' latest
       record, when played backwards at slow speed, says 'Dummy! You're
       playing it backwards at slow speed!'"
     * Al Sleet, the "hippie-dippie weatherman"—"Tonight's forecast: Dark.
       Continued dark throughout most of the evening, with some widely
       scattered light towards morning."
     * Jon Carson—the "world never known, and never to be known"

   Variations on the first three of these routines appear on Carlin's 1967
   debut album, Take Offs and Put Ons, recorded live in 1966 at The
   Roostertail in Detroit, Michigan.^[38]
   Carlin with singer Buddy Greco in Away We Go. The summer replacement
   show also starred drummer Buddy Rich.

   During this period, Carlin became more popular as a frequent performer
   and guest host on The Tonight Show, initially with Jack Paar as host,
   then with Johnny Carson. Carlin became one of Carson's most frequent
   substitutes during the host's three-decade reign. Carlin was also cast
   in Away We Go, a 1967 comedy show that aired on CBS.^[39] His material
   during his early career and his appearance, which consisted of suits
   and short-cropped hair, had been seen as "conventional," particularly
   when contrasted with his later anti-establishment material.^[40]

   Carlin was present at Lenny Bruce's arrest for obscenity. As the police
   began attempting to detain members of the audience for questioning,
   they asked Carlin for his identification. Telling the police he did not
   believe in government-issued IDs, he was arrested and taken to jail
   with Bruce in the same vehicle.^[41]

[edit] 1970s

   Eventually, Carlin changed both his routines and his appearance. He
   lost some TV bookings by dressing strangely for a comedian of the time,
   wearing faded jeans and sporting long hair, a beard, and earrings at a
   time when clean-cut, well-dressed comedians were the norm. Using his
   own persona as a springboard for his new comedy, he was presented by Ed
   Sullivan in a performance of "The Hair Piece" and quickly regained his
   popularity as the public caught on to his sense of style. In this
   period he also perfected what is perhaps his best-known routine, "Seven
   Words You Can Never Say on Television", recorded on Class Clown. Carlin
   was arrested on July 21, 1972, at Milwaukee's Summerfest and charged
   with violating obscenity laws after performing this routine.^[42] The
   case, which prompted Carlin to refer to the words for a time as "the
   Milwaukee Seven," was dismissed in December of that year; the judge
   declared that the language was indecent but Carlin had the freedom to
   say it as long as he caused no disturbance. In 1973, a man complained
   to the Federal Communications Commission after listening with his son
   to a similar routine, "Filthy Words", from Occupation: Foole, broadcast
   one afternoon over WBAI, a Pacifica Foundation FM radio station in New
   York City. Pacifica received a citation from the FCC that sought to
   fine the company for violating FCC regulations that prohibited
   broadcasting "obscene" material. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the FCC
   action by a vote of 5 to 4, ruling that the routine was "indecent but
   not obscene" and that the FCC had authority to prohibit such broadcasts
   during hours when children were likely to be among the audience.
   (F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978). The court
   documents contain a complete transcript of the routine.)^[43]
   “ Shit, Piss, Fuck, Cunt, Cocksucker, Motherfucker, and Tits. Those are
     the heavy seven. Those are the ones that'll infect your soul, curve
     your spine and keep the country from winning the war.                  ”

   —George Carlin, Class Clown, "Seven Words You Can Never Say on
   Television"

   The controversy only increased Carlin's fame. Carlin eventually
   expanded the dirty-words theme with a seemingly interminable end to a
   performance (ending with his voice fading out in one HBO version and
   accompanying the credits in the Carlin at Carnegie special for the
   1982-83 season) and a set of 49 web pages^[44] organized by subject and
   embracing his "Incomplete List Of Impolite Words."

   It was on-stage during a rendition of his "Dirty Words" routine that
   Carlin learned that his previous comedy album FM & AM had won the
   Grammy. Midway through the performance on the album Occupation: Foole,
   he can be heard thanking someone for handing him a piece of paper. He
   then exclaims "Shit!" and proudly announces his win to the audience.

   Carlin hosted the premiere broadcast of NBC's Saturday Night Live, on
   October 11, 1975, the only episode as of at least 2007 in which the
   host had no involvement (at his request) in sketches.^[45] The
   following season, 1976–77, Carlin also appeared regularly on CBS
   Television's Tony Orlando & Dawn variety series.

   Carlin unexpectedly stopped performing regularly in 1976, when his
   career appeared to be at its height. For the next five years, he rarely
   performed stand-up, although it was at this time that he began doing
   specials for HBO as part of its On Location series. He later revealed
   that he had suffered the first of three heart attacks during this
   layoff period.^[5] His first two HBO specials aired in 1977 and 1978.

[edit] 1980s and 1990s

   In 1981, Carlin returned to the stage, releasing A Place For My Stuff
   and returning to HBO and New York City with the Carlin at Carnegie TV
   special, videotaped at Carnegie Hall and airing during the 1982-83
   season. Carlin continued doing HBO specials every year or every other
   year over the following decade and a half. All of Carlin's albums from
   this time forward are from the HBO specials.
   In concert at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

   He hosted SNL for the second time on November 10, 1984, this time
   appearing in several sketches. Carlin's acting career was primed with a
   major supporting role in the 1987 comedy hit Outrageous Fortune,
   starring Bette Midler and Shelley Long; it was his first notable screen
   role after a handful of previous guest roles on television series.
   Playing drifter Frank Madras, the role poked fun at the lingering
   effect of the 1960s counterculture. In 1989, he gained popularity with
   a new generation of teens when he was cast as Rufus, the time-traveling
   mentor of the titular characters in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,
   and reprised his role in the film sequel Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey
   as well as the first season of the cartoon series. In 1991, he provided
   the narrative voice for the American version of the children's show
   Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends, a role he continued until 1998. He
   played "Mr. Conductor" on the PBS children's show Shining Time Station,
   which featured Thomas the Tank Engine from 1991 to 1993, as well as the
   Shining Time Station TV specials in 1995 and Mr. Conductor's Thomas
   Tales in 1996. Also in 1991, Carlin had a major supporting role in the
   movie The Prince of Tides, which starred Nick Nolte and Barbra
   Streisand.

   Carlin began a weekly Fox sitcom, The George Carlin Show, in 1993,
   playing New York City taxicab driver George O'Grady. The show, created
   and written by The Simpsons co-creator Sam Simon, ran 27 episodes
   through December 1995.^[46]

   In his final book, the posthumously published Last Words, Carlin said
   about The George Carlin Show: "I had a great time. I never laughed so
   much, so often, so hard as I did with cast members Alex Rocco, Chris
   Rich, Tony Starke. There was a very strange, very good sense of humor
   on that stage. The biggest problem, though, was that Sam Simon was a
   fucking horrible person to be around. Very, very funny, extremely
   bright and brilliant, but an unhappy person who treated other people
   poorly. I was incredibly happy when the show was canceled. I was
   frustrated that it had taken me away from my true work."^[47]

   In 1997, his first hardcover book, Brain Droppings, was published and
   sold over 750,000 copies as of 2001.^[citation needed] Carlin was
   honored at the 1997 Aspen Comedy Festival with a retrospective, George
   Carlin: 40 Years of Comedy, hosted by Jon Stewart.

   In 1999, Carlin played a supporting role as a satirical Roman Catholic
   cardinal in filmmaker Kevin Smith's movie Dogma. He worked with Smith
   again with a cameo appearance in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and
   later played an atypically serious role in Jersey Girl as the
   blue-collar father of Ben Affleck's character.

[edit] 2000s

   In 2001, Carlin was given a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 15th
   Annual American Comedy Awards. In December 2003, California U.S.
   Representative Doug Ose (Republican), introduced a bill (H.R. 3687) to
   outlaw the broadcast of Carlin's "seven dirty words,"^[48] including
   "compound use (including hyphenated compounds) of such words and
   phrases with each other or with other words or phrases, and other
   grammatical forms of such words and phrases (including verb, adjective,
   gerund, participle, and infinitive forms)." (The bill omits "tits," but
   includes "asshole," which was not part of Carlin's original routine.)
   This bill was never voted on. The last action on this bill was its
   referral to the House Judiciary Committee on the Constitution on
   January 15, 2004.^[48]

   For years, Carlin had performed regularly as a headliner in Las Vegas,
   but in 2005 he was fired from his headlining position at the MGM Grand
   Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, after an altercation with his audience.
   After a poorly received set filled with dark references to suicide
   bombings and beheadings, Carlin stated that he could not wait to get
   out of "this fucking hotel" and Las Vegas, claiming he wanted to go
   back east, "where the real people are." He continued to insult his
   audience, stating:

     People who go to Las Vegas, you've got to question their fucking
     intellect to start with. Traveling hundreds and thousands of miles
     to essentially give your money to a large corporation is kind of
     fucking moronic. That's what I'm always getting here is these kind
     of fucking people with very limited intellects.

   An audience member shouted back that Carlin should "stop degrading us,"
   at which point Carlin responded, "Thank you very much, whatever that
   was. I hope it was positive; if not, well, blow me." He was immediately
   fired by MGM Grand and soon after announced he would enter rehab for
   alcohol and prescription painkiller addiction.^[49]^[50]

   He began a tour through the first half of 2006 following the airing of
   his thirteenth HBO Special on November 5, 2005, entitled Life is Worth
   Losing,^[51] which was shown live from the Beacon Theatre in New York
   City and in which he stated early on: "I've got 341 days of sobriety,"
   referring to the rehab he entered after being fired from MGM. Topics
   covered included suicide, natural disasters (and the impulse to see
   them escalate in severity), cannibalism, genocide, human sacrifice,
   threats to civil liberties in America, and how an argument can be made
   that humans are inferior to other animals.

   On February 1, 2006, during his Life Is Worth Losing set at the Tachi
   Palace Casino in Lemoore, California, Carlin mentioned to the crowd
   that he had been discharged from the hospital only six weeks previously
   for "heart failure" and "pneumonia", citing the appearance as his
   "first show back."

   Carlin provided the voice of Fillmore, a character in the Disney/Pixar
   animated feature Cars, which opened in theaters on June 9, 2006. The
   character Fillmore, who is presented as an anti-establishment hippie,
   is a VW Microbus with a psychedelic paint job whose front license plate
   reads "51237," Carlin's birthday and also the Zip Code for George,
   Iowa. In 2007, Carlin provided the voice of the wizard in Happily
   N'Ever After, along with Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prinze Jr.,
   Andy Dick, and Wallace Shawn, his last film.

   Carlin's last HBO stand-up special, It's Bad for Ya, aired live on
   March 1, 2008, from the Wells Fargo Center for the Arts in Santa Rosa,
   California.^[52] The themes that appeared in this HBO special included
   "American Bullshit," "Rights," "Death," "Old Age," and "Child Rearing."
   In his routine, he brought to light many of the problems facing
   America, and he told his audience to cut through the "bullshit" of the
   world and "enjoy the carnival." Carlin had been working on the new
   material for this HBO special for several months prior in concerts all
   over the country.

[edit] Personal life

   In 1961, Carlin married Brenda Hosbrook (August 5, 1936 - May 11,
   1997), whom he had met while touring the previous year. The couple's
   only child, a daughter named Kelly, was born in 1963.^[53] In 1971,
   George and Brenda renewed their wedding vows in Las Vegas. Brenda died
   of liver cancer a day before Carlin's 60th birthday, in 1997.

   Carlin later married Sally Wade on June 24, 1998, and the marriage
   lasted until his death, two days before their tenth anniversary.^[54]

   Carlin often criticized elections as an illusion of choice.^[55] He
   said the last time he voted was 1972, for George McGovern who ran for
   President against Richard Nixon.^[56]

[edit] Religion

   Although raised in the Roman Catholic faith, which he describes
   anecdotally on the albums FM & AM and Class Clown, religion, God, and
   particularly religious adherents were frequent subjects of criticism in
   Carlin's routines. He described his opinion of the flaws of organized
   religion in interviews and performances, notably with his "Religion"
   and "There Is No God" routines as heard in You Are All Diseased. His
   views on religion are also mentioned in his last HBO stand up show It's
   Bad for Ya where he mocked the traditional swearing on the Bible as
   "bullshit,"^[57] "make believe," and "kids' stuff." In It's Bad for Ya,
   Carlin noted differences in the types of hats religions ban or require
   as part of their practices. He mentions that he would never want to be
   a part of a group that requires or bans the wearing of hats. Carlin
   also joked in his second book, Brain Droppings, that he worshipped the
   Sun, one reason being that he could see it.

[edit] Themes

   Carlin's material falls under one of three self-described categories:
   "the little world" (observational humor), "the big world" (social
   commentary), and the peculiarities of the English language (euphemisms,
   doublespeak, business jargon), all sharing the overall theme of (in his
   words) "humanity's bullshit," which might include murder, genocide,
   war, rape, corruption, religion and other aspects of human
   civilization. He was known for mixing observational humour with larger
   social commentary. His delivery frequently treated these subjects in a
   misanthropic and nihilistic fashion, such as in his statement during
   the Life is Worth Losing show:

     I look at it this way... For centuries now, man has done everything
     he can to destroy, defile, and interfere with nature: clear-cutting
     forests, strip-mining mountains, poisoning the atmosphere,
     over-fishing the oceans, polluting the rivers and lakes, destroying
     wetlands and aquifers... so when nature strikes back, and smacks him
     on the head and kicks him in the nuts, I enjoy that. I have
     absolutely no sympathy for human beings whatsoever. None. And no
     matter what kind of problem humans are facing, whether it's natural
     or man-made, I always hope it gets worse.

   Language was a frequent focus of Carlin's work. Euphemisms that, in his
   view, seek to distort and lie and the use of language he felt was
   pompous, presumptuous, or silly were often the target of Carlin's
   routines. When asked on Inside the Actors Studio what turned him on, he
   responded, "Reading about language." When asked what made him most
   proud about his career, he said the number of his books that have been
   sold, close to a million copies.

   Carlin also gave special attention to prominent topics in American and
   Western Culture, such as obsession with fame and celebrity,
   consumerism, conservative Christianity, political alienation, corporate
   control, hypocrisy, child raising, fast food diet, news stations,
   self-help publications, blind patriotism, sexual taboos, certain uses
   of technology and surveillance, and the pro-life position,^[58] among
   many others.
   George Carlin in Trenton, New Jersey April 4, 2008

   Carlin openly communicated in his shows and in his interviews that his
   purpose for existence was entertainment, that he was "here for the
   show." He professed a hearty schadenfreude in watching the rich
   spectrum of humanity slowly self-destruct, in his estimation, of its
   own design, saying, "When you're born, you get a ticket to the freak
   show. When you're born in America, you get a front-row seat." He
   acknowledged that this is a very selfish thing, especially since he
   included large human catastrophes as entertainment. In his You Are All
   Diseased concert, he elaborated somewhat on this, telling the audience,
   "I have always been willing to put myself at great personal risk for
   the sake of entertainment. And I've always been willing to put you at
   great personal risk, for the same reason!"

   In the same interview, he recounted his experience of a California
   earthquake in the early 1970s, as "[a]n amusement park ride. Really, I
   mean it's such a wonderful thing to realize that you have absolutely no
   control, and to see the dresser move across the bedroom floor
   unassisted is just exciting."

   A routine in Carlin's 1999 HBO special You Are All Diseased focusing on
   airport security leads up to the statement: "Take a fucking chance! Put
   a little fun in your life! Most Americans are soft and frightened and
   unimaginative and they don't realize there's such a thing as dangerous
   fun, and they certainly don't recognize a good show when they see one."

   Along with wordplay and sex jokes, Carlin had always included politics
   as part of his material, but by the mid 1980s he had become a strident
   social critic in both his HBO specials and the book compilations of his
   material, bashing both conservatives and liberals alike. His HBO
   viewers got an especially sharp taste of this in his take on the Ronald
   Reagan administration during the 1988 special What Am I Doing In New
   Jersey?, broadcast live from the Park Theatre in Union City, New
   Jersey.

[edit] Death and legacy

   Carlin had a history of cardiac problems spanning several decades,
   including three heart attacks (in 1978 at age 41, 1982 and 1991), an
   arrhythmia requiring an ablation procedure in 2003, and a significant
   episode of heart failure in late 2005. He twice underwent angioplasty
   to reopen narrowed arteries.^[59] In early 2005 he entered a drug
   rehabilitation facility for treatment of addictions to alcohol and
   Vicodin.^[60]

   On June 22, 2008, Carlin was admitted to Saint John's Health Center in
   Santa Monica after experiencing chest pain, and he died later that day
   of heart failure. He was 71 years old.^[61] His death occurred one week
   after his last performance at The Orleans Hotel and Casino in Las
   Vegas. There were further shows on his itinerary.^[22]^[62]^[63] In
   accordance with his wishes, he was cremated, his ashes scattered, and
   no public or religious services of any kind were held.^[64]^[65]

   In tribute, HBO broadcast eleven of his fourteen HBO specials from June
   25–28, including a twelve-hour marathon block on their HBO Comedy
   channel. NBC scheduled a rerun of the premiere episode of Saturday
   Night Live, which Carlin hosted.^[66]^[67]^[68] Both Sirius Satellite
   Radio's "Raw Dog Comedy" and XM Satellite Radio's "XM Comedy" channels
   ran a memorial marathon of George Carlin recordings the day following
   his death. Larry King devoted his entire June 23 show to a tribute to
   Carlin, featuring interviews with Jerry Seinfeld, Bill Maher, Roseanne
   Barr and Lewis Black, as well as Carlin's daughter Kelly and his
   brother, Patrick.

   On June 24, The New York Times published an op-ed piece on Carlin by
   Seinfeld.^[69] Cartoonist Garry Trudeau paid tribute in his Doonesbury
   comic strip on July 27.^[70]

   Four days before his death, the John F. Kennedy Center for the
   Performing Arts had named Carlin its 2008 Mark Twain Prize for American
   Humor honoree.^[71] The prize was awarded in Washington, D.C. on
   November 10, making Carlin the first posthumous recipient.^[72]
   Comedians honoring him at the ceremony included Jon Stewart, Bill
   Maher, Lily Tomlin (a past Twain Humor Prize winner), Lewis Black,
   Denis Leary, Joan Rivers, and Margaret Cho.

   Louis C. K. dedicated his stand-up special Chewed Up to Carlin, and
   Lewis Black dedicated his entire second season of Root of All Evil to
   him.

   For a number of years, Carlin had been compiling and writing his
   autobiography, to be released in conjunction with a one-man Broadway
   show tentatively titled New York City Boy. After his death Tony Hendra,
   his collaborator on both projects, edited the autobiography for release
   as Last Words (ISBN 1-4391-7295-1). The book, chronicling most of
   Carlin's life and future plans (including the one-man show) was
   published in 2009. The audio edition is narrated by Carlin's brother,
   Patrick.^[73]

   The text of the one-man show is scheduled for publication under the
   title New York Boy.^[74]

   The George Carlin Letters: The Permanent Courtship of Sally Wade,^[75]
   by Carlin's widow, a collection of previously-unpublished writings and
   artwork by Carlin interwoven with Wade’s chronicle of the last ten
   years of their life together, was published in March 2011. (The
   subtitle is the phrase on a handwritten note Wade found next to her
   computer upon returning home from the hospital after her husband's
   death.)^[76]

   In 2008 Carlin's daughter Kelly Carlin-McCall announced plans to
   publish an "oral history", a collection of stories from Carlin's
   friends and family,^[77] but she later indicated that the project had
   been shelved in favor of completion of her own memoir.^[78]

[edit] Internet hoaxes

   Since the birth of spam email on the internet, many chain-forwards,
   usually rantlike and with blunt statements of belief on political and
   social issues and attributed to being written (or stated) by George
   Carlin himself, have made continuous rounds on the junk email circuit.
   The website Snopes, an online resource that debunks historic and
   present urban legends and myths, has extensively covered these
   forgeries. Many of the falsely attributed email attachments have
   contained material that runs directly opposite to Carlin's viewpoints,
   with some being especially volatile toward racial groups, gays, women,
   the homeless, etc. Carlin himself, when he was made aware of each of
   these bogus emails, would debunk them on his own website, writing:
   "Nothing you see on the Internet is mine unless it comes from one of my
   albums, books, HBO specials, or appeared on my website," and that "it
   bothers me that some people might believe that I would be capable of
   writing some of this stuff."^[87]^[88]^[89]^[90]^[91]^[92]

Funny, that was my joke

COLUMN ONE

It's no laughing matter when comedians feel someone has stolen their stuff. A
generation ago it was rare, but the old code is breaking down.

   July 24, 2007|Robert W. Welkos | Times Staff Writer

   SO, these comedians walk into a comedy club, and a nasty dispute breaks
   out over who is stealing jokes. The audience laughs, but the comedians
   don't seem to find it funny at all.

   The scene was the Comedy Store on the Sunset Strip earlier this year,
   and on stage were Carlos Mencia, host of Comedy Central's "Mind of
   Mencia," and stand-up comic and "Fear Factor" host Joe Rogan. Mencia
   let it be known he was upset that Rogan had been mercilessly bashing
   him as a "joke thief" and derisively referring to him as Carlos
   "Menstealia."

   As the crowd whooped and hollered, Mencia fired back at Rogan: "Here's
   what I think. I think that every time you open your mouth and talk
   about me, I think you're secretly in love with me...."

   A video of the raucous encounter soon appeared on various websites,
   igniting a debate over joke thievery that is roiling the world of
   stand-up comedy. An earlier generation of comics was self-policing,
   careful about giving credit, often adhering to an unwritten code: Any
   comic who stole another's material faced being shunned by his peers.
   Now, though, the competition is so much greater and the comedy world so
   decentralized that old taboos about joke theft seem to be breaking
   down. That, in turn, has led to an outbreak of finger-pointing among
   comics that some say is starting to smack of McCarthyism.

   Still, for a comic convinced that his material has been ripped off,
   it's no laughing matter.

   "You have a better chance of stopping a serial killer than a serial
   thief in comedy," said comedian David Brenner. "If we could protect our
   jokes, I'd be a retired billionaire in Europe somewhere -- and what I
   just said is original."

   Bill Cosby, who has had his own material ripped off over the years,
   said he empathizes with comedians who are being victimized by joke
   thievery.

   "You're watching a guy do your material and people are laughing, but
   they're laughing because they think this performer has a brilliant mind
   and he's a funny person," Cosby said. "The person doing the stealing is
   accepting this under false pretenses."

   BOBBY Kelton, a veteran of stand-up who appeared nearly two dozen times
   on "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson," said that when he started
   out in the business, fellow comics such as Jay Leno, Billy Crystal,
   Jerry Seinfeld and Richard Lewis all knew the rules.

   "No one dared use another's material," Kelton said. "If they did, the
   word would get out and you'd be ostracized.... Then, as the comedy boom
   hit and tens of thousands of people got into comedy, that all kind of
   went out the window."

   To be sure, joke theft went on even during those golden years. The late
   Milton Berle was famous for pilfering other comedian's jokes.

   "His mother used to go around and write down jokes and give it to him,"
   recalled Carl Reiner. "He was called 'The Thief of Bad Gags.' " Reiner
   said that in those days, comedians would work on different club
   circuits, so it was possible that they didn't know when someone was
   stealing their routines.

   Today, however, websites like YouTube post videos comparing the
   routines of various comedians, inviting the public to judge for
   themselves.

   One example is a comparison of three comedy bits on Dane Cook's 2005
   album "Retaliation" and three similar routines on Louis C.K.'s 2001 CD
   "Live in Houston."

   Louis C.K. jokes: "I'd like to give my kid an interesting name. Like a
   name with no vowels ... just like 40 Fs, that's his name."

   Now compare that to Dane Cook's material: "I'd like to have 19 kids. I
   think naming them, that's going to be fun.... I already have names
   picked out. First kid -- boy, girl, I don't care -- I'm naming it
   \o7'Rrrrrrrrrrrr.' "

   \f7And both scenes might seem familiar to fans of Steve Martin, who did
   a bit decades earlier called "My Real Name," in which he uses gibberish
   when recalling the name his folks gave him.

   "Does this mean Louis C.K. and Dane Cook stole from Steve Martin?" Todd
   Jackson, a former managing editor at the humor magazine Cracked, writes
   on his comedy blog, www.dead-frog.com. "Absolutely not. This is a joke
   that doesn't belong to anyone. It's going to be discovered and
   rediscovered again and again by comics -- each of whom will put their
   own spin on it."

   Radar magazine, in a recent article about joke thievery among comics,
   called Robin Williams a "notorious joke rustler" who is known to cut
   checks to comedians after stealing their material.

   Jamie Masada, who runs the Laugh Factory in West Hollywood, likened
   Williams' act to a jazz player. "He goes with whatever comes in his
   mind. That is what he is. He doesn't go sit down and write what he is
   going to say on the stage." If he learns later that he has used someone
   else's material, Masada added, "he goes back afterward and says, 'Here
   is the check.' "

   Williams declined to comment for this article.

   Humor in a dream is a good indication of lightheartedness and release
   from the tension that may have surrounded some issue. There is,
   however, also a negative side of humor, such as when someone or
   something is derided as "a joke."

   A joke (or gag) is a phrase or a paragraph with a humorous twist. It
   can be in many different forms, such as a question or short story. To
   achieve this end, jokes may employ irony, sarcasm, word play and other
   devices. Jokes may have a punchline that will end the sentence to make
   it humorous.

   A practical joke or prank differs from a spoken one in that the major
   component of the humour is physical rather than verbal (for example
   placing salt in the sugar bowl).

Purpose

   Jokes are typically for the entertainment of friends and onlookers. The
   desired response is generally laughter; when this does not happen the
   joke is said to have "fallen flat" or "bombed". However, jokes have
   other purposes and functions, common to comedy/humour/satire in
   general.

Antiquity of jokes

   Jokes have been a part of human culture since at least 1900 BC.
   According to research conducted by Dr Paul McDonald of the University
   of Wolverhampton, a fart joke from ancient Sumer is currently believed
   to be the world's oldest known joke.^[1] Britain's oldest joke,
   meanwhile, is a 1,000-year-old double-entendre that can be found in the
   Codex Exoniensis.^[2]

   A recent discovery of a document called Philogelos (The Laughter Lover)
   gives us an insight into ancient humour. Written in Greek by Hierocles
   and Philagrius, it dates to the third or fourth century AD, and
   contains some 260 jokes. Considering humour from our own culture as
   recent as the 19th century is at times baffling to us today, the humour
   is surprisingly familiar. They had different stereotypes, the
   absent-minded professor, the eunuch, and people with hernias or bad
   breath were favourites. A lot of the jokes play on the idea of knowing
   who characters are:

     A barber, a bald man and an absent minded professor take a journey
     together. They have to camp overnight, so decide to take turns
     watching the luggage. When it's the barber's turn, he gets bored, so
     amuses himself by shaving the head of the professor. When the
     professor is woken up for his shift, he feels his head, and says
     "How stupid is that barber? He's woken up the bald man instead of
     me."

   There is even a joke similar to Monty Python's "Dead Parrot" sketch: a
   man buys a slave, who dies shortly afterwards. When he complains to the
   slave merchant, he is told: "He didn't die when I owned him." Comic Jim
   Bowen has presented them to a modern audience. "One or two of them are
   jokes I've seen in people's acts nowadays, slightly updated. They put
   in a motor car instead of a chariot - some of them are Tommy
   Cooper-esque."^[3]

Psychology of jokes

   Why people laugh at jokes has been the subject of serious academic
   study, examples being:
     * Immanuel Kant, in Critique of Judgement (1790) states that
       "Laughter is an effect that arises if a tense expectation is
       transformed into nothing." Here is Kant's 220-year old joke and his
       analysis:

     An Englishman at an Indian's table in Surat saw a bottle of ale
     being opened, and all the beer, turned to froth, rushed out. The
     Indian, by repeated exclamations, showed his great amazement. -
     Well, what's so amazing in that? asked the Englishman. - Oh, but I'm
     not amazed at its coming out, replied the Indian, but how you
     managed to get it all in. - This makes us laugh, and it gives us a
     hearty pleasure. This is not because, say, we think we are smarter
     than this ignorant man, nor are we laughing at anything else here
     that it is our liking and that we noticed through our understanding.
     It is rather that we had a tense expectation that suddenly
     vanished...

     * Henri Bergson, in his book Le rire (Laughter, 1901), suggests that
       laughter evolved to make social life possible for human beings.
     * Sigmund Freud's "Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious". (Der
       Witz und seine Beziehung zum UnbewuÃten).
     * Arthur Koestler, in The Act of Creation (1964), analyses humour and
       compares it to other creative activities, such as literature and
       science.
     * Marvin Minsky in Society of Mind (1986).

          Marvin Minsky suggests that laughter has a specific function
          related to the human brain. In his opinion jokes and laughter
          are mechanisms for the brain to learn nonsense. For that reason,
          he argues, jokes are usually not as funny when you hear them
          repeatedly.

     * Edward de Bono in "The Mechanism of the Mind" (1969) and "I am
       Right, You are Wrong" (1990).

          Edward de Bono suggests that the mind is a pattern-matching
          machine, and that it works by recognising stories and behaviour
          and putting them into familiar patterns. When a familiar
          connection is disrupted and an alternative unexpected new link
          is made in the brain via a different route than expected, then
          laughter occurs as the new connection is made. This theory
          explains a lot about jokes. For example:

          + Why jokes are only funny the first time they are told: once
            they are told the pattern is already there, so there can be no
            new connections, and so no laughter.
          + Why jokes have an elaborate and often repetitive set up: The
            repetition establishes the familiar pattern in the brain. A
            common method used in jokes is to tell almost the same story
            twice and then deliver the punch line the third time the story
            is told. The first two tellings of the story evoke a familiar
            pattern in the brain, thus priming the brain for the punch
            line.
          + Why jokes often rely on stereotypes: the use of a stereotype
            links to familiar expected behaviour, thus saving time in the
            set-up.
          + Why jokes are variants on well-known stories (e.g. the genie
            and a lamp and a man walks into a bar): This again saves time
            in the set up and establishes a familiar pattern.

     * In 2002, Richard Wiseman conducted a study intended to discover the
       world's funniest joke [1].

   Laughter, the intended human reaction to jokes, is healthy in
   moderation, uses the stomach muscles, and releases endorphins, natural
   "feel good" chemicals, into the brain.

Jokes in organizations

   Jokes can be employed by workers as a way to identify with their jobs.
   For example, 9-1-1 operators often crack jokes about incongruous,
   threatening, or tragic situations they deal with on a daily basis.^[4]
   This use of humour and cracking jokes helps employees differentiate
   themselves from the people they serve while also assisting them in
   identifying with their jobs.^[5] In addition to employees, managers use
   joking, or jocularity, in strategic ways. Some managers attempt to
   suppress joking and humour use because they feel it relates to lower
   production, while others have attempted to manufacture joking through
   pranks, pajama or dress down days, and specific committees that are
   designed to increase fun in the workplace.^[6]

Rules

   The rules of humour are analogous to those of poetry. These common
   rules are mainly timing, precision, synthesis, and rhythm. French
   philosopher Henri Bergson has said in an essay: "In every wit there is
   something of a poet."^[7] In this essay Bergson views the essence of
   humour as the encrustation of the mechanical upon the living. He used
   as an instance a book by an English humorist, in which an elderly woman
   who desired a reputation as a philanthropist provided "homes within
   easy hail of her mansion for the conversion of atheists who have been
   specially manufactured for her, so to speak, and for a number of honest
   folk who have been made into drunkards so that she may cure them of
   their failing, etc." This idea seems funny because a genuine impulse of
   charity as a living, vital impulse has become encrusted by a mechanical
   conception of how it should manifest itself.

Precision

   To reach precision, the comedian must choose the words in order to
   provide a vivid, in-focus image, and to avoid being generic as to
   confuse the audience, and provide no laughter. To properly arrange the
   words in the sentence is also crucial to get precision.

Synthesis

   That a joke is best when it expresses the maximum level of humour with
   a minimal number of words, is today considered one of the key technical
   elements of a joke.^[citation needed] An example from George Carlin:

   I have as much authority as the Pope, I just don't have as many people
   who believe it.^[8]

   Though, the familiarity of the pattern of "brevity" has led to numerous
   examples of jokes where the very length is itself the pattern-breaking
   "punchline".^[citation needed] Numerous examples from Monty Python
   exist, for instance, the song "I Like Traffic Lights". More recently,
   Family Guy often exploits such humour: for example in the episode
   "Wasted Talent", Peter Griffin bangs his shin, a classic slapstick
   routine, and tenderly nurses it while inhaling and exhaling to quiet
   the pain, for considerably longer than expected.^[vague] Certain
   versions of the popular vaudevillian joke The Aristocrats can go on for
   several minutes, and it is considered an anti-joke, as the humour is
   more in the set-up than the punchline.^[vague]

Rhythm

   Main articles: Timing (linguistics) and Comic timing

   The joke's content (meaning) is not what provokes the laugh, it just
   makes the salience of the joke and provokes a smile. What makes us
   laugh is the joke mechanism. Milton Berle demonstrated this with a
   classic theatre experiment in the 1950s: if during a series of jokes
   you insert phrases that are not jokes, but with the same rhythm, the
   audience laughs anyway^[citation needed]. A classic is the ternary
   rhythm, with three beats: Introduction, premise, antithesis (with the
   antithesis being the punch line).

   In regards to the Milton Berle experiment, they can be taken to
   demonstrate the concept of "breaking context" or "breaking the
   pattern". It is not necessarily the rhythm that caused the audience to
   laugh, but the disparity between the expectation of a "joke" and being
   instead given a non-sequitur "normal phrase." This normal phrase is,
   itself, unexpected, and a type of punchlineâthe anti-climax.

Comic

   In the comic field plays the 'economy of ideative expenditure'; in
   other words excessive energy is wasted or action-essential energy is
   saved. The profound meaning of a comic gag or a comic joke is "I'm a
   child"; the comic deals with the clumsy body of the child.

   Laurel and Hardy are a classic example. An individual laughs because he
   recognises the child that is in himself. In clowns stumbling is a
   childish tempo. In the comic, the visual gags may be translated into a
   joke. For example in Side Effects (By Destiny Denied story) by Woody
   Allen:

   "My father used to wear loafers," she confessed. "Both on the same
   foot".

   The typical comic technique is the disproportion.

Wit

   In the wit field plays the "economy of censorship expenditure"^[9]
   (Freud calls it "the economy of psychic expenditure"); usually
   censorship prevents some 'dangerous ideas' from reaching the conscious
   mind, or helps us avoid saying everything that comes to mind;
   adversely, the wit circumvents the censorship and brings up those
   ideas. Different wit techniques allow one to express them in a funny
   way. The profound meaning behind a wit joke is "I have dangerous
   ideas". An example from Woody Allen:

   I contemplated suicide again - this time by inhaling next to an
   insurance salesman.

   Or, when a bagpipe player was asked "How do you play that thing?" his
   answer was "Well." Wit is a branch of rhetoric, and there are about 200
   techniques (technically they are called tropes, a particular kind of
   figure of speech) that can be used to make jokes.^[10]

   Irony can be seen as belonging to this field.

Humor

   In the comedy field, humour induces an "economised expenditure of
   emotion" (Freud calls it "economy of affect" or "economy of sympathy".
   Freud produced this final part of his interpretation many years later,
   in a paper later supplemented to the book.).^[9]^[11] In other words,
   the joke erases an emotion that should be felt about an event, making
   us insensitive to it.e.g.: "yo momma" jokes. The profound meaning of
   the void feeling of a humour joke is "I'm a cynic". An example from
   Woody Allen:

   Three times I've been mistaken for Robert Redford. Each time by a blind
   person.

   This field of jokes is still a grey area, being mostly unexplored.
   Extensive use of this kind of humour can be found in the work of
   British satirist Chris Morris, like the sketches of the Jam television
   program.

   Black humour and sarcasm belong to this field.

Cycles

   Folklorists, in particular (but not exclusively) those who study the
   folklore of the United States, collect jokes into joke cycles. A cycle
   is a collection of jokes with a particular theme or a particular
   "script". (That is, it is a literature cycle.)^[12] Folklorists have
   identified several such cycles:
     * the Helen Keller Joke Cycle that comprises jokes about Helen
       Keller^[13]
     * Viola jokes^[14]
     * the NASA, Challenger, or Space Shuttle Joke Cycle that comprises
       jokes relating to the Space Shuttle Challenger
       disaster^[15]^[16]^[17]
     * the Chernobyl Joke Cycle that comprises jokes relating to the
       Chernobyl disaster^[18]
     * the Polish Pope Joke Cycle that comprises jokes relating to Pope
       John Paul II^[19]
     * the Essex girl and the Stupid Irish joke cycles in the United
       Kingdom^[20]
     * the Dead Baby Joke Cycle^[21]
     * the Newfie Joke Cycle that comprises jokes made by Canadians about
       Newfoundlanders^[22]
     * the Little Willie Joke Cycle, and the Quadriplegic Joke Cycle^[23]
     * the Jew Joke Cycle and the Polack Joke Cycle^[24]
     * the Rastus and Liza Joke Cycle, which Dundes describes as "the most
       vicious and widespread white anti-Negro joke cycle"^[25]
     * the Jewish American Princess and Jewish American Mother joke
       cycles^[26]
     * The Wind-up doll joke cycle^[27]
     * The "Blonde joke" cycle.

   Gruner discusses several "sick joke" cycles that occurred upon events
   surrounding Gary Hart, Natalie Wood, Vic Morrow, Jim Bakker, Richard
   Pryor, Princess Diana and Michael Jackson, noting how several jokes
   were recycled from one cycle to the next. For example: A joke about Vic
   Morrow ("We now know that Vic Morrow had dandruff: they found his head
   and shoulders in the bushes") was subsequently recycled about Admiral
   Mountbatten after his murder by Irish Republican terrorists in 1979,
   and again applied to the crew of the Challenger space shuttle ("How do
   we know that Christa McAuliffe had dandruff? They found her head and
   shoulders on the beach.").^[28]

   Berger asserts that "whenever there is a popular joke cycle, there
   generally is some widespread kind of social and cultural anxiety,
   lingering below the surface, that the joke cycle helps people deal
   with".^[29]

   Jokes often depend on the humour of the unexpected, the mildly taboo
   (which can include the distasteful or socially improper), or playing
   off stereotypes and other cultural beliefs. Many jokes fit into more
   than one category.

Subjects

   Political jokes are usually a form of satire. They generally concern
   politicians and heads of state, but may also cover the absurdities of a
   country's political situation. A prominent example of political jokes
   would be political cartoons. Two large categories of this type of jokes
   exist. The first one makes fun of a negative attitude to political
   opponents or to politicians in general. The second one makes fun of
   political clichÃ©s, mottoes, catch phrases or simply blunders of
   politicians. Some, especially the "you have two cows" genre, derive
   humour from comparing different political systems.

   Professional humour includes caricatured portrayals of certain
   professions such as lawyers, and in-jokes told by professionals to each
   other.

   Mathematical jokes are a form of in-joke, generally designed to be
   understandable only by insiders. (They are also often strictly visual
   jokes.)

   Ethnic jokes exploit ethnic stereotypes. They are often racist and
   frequently considered offensive.

   For example, the British tell jokes starting "An Englishman, an
   Irishman and a Scotsman..." which exploit the supposed parsimony of the
   Scot, stupidity of the Irish or rigid conventionality of the English.
   Such jokes exist among numerous peoples.

   Jokes based on other stereotypes (such as blonde jokes) are often
   considered funny.

   Religious jokes fall into several categories:
     * Jokes based on stereotypes associated with people of religion (e.g.
       nun jokes, priest jokes, or rabbi jokes)
     * Jokes on classical religious subjects: crucifixion, Adam and Eve,
       St. Peter at The Gates, etc.
     * Jokes that collide different religious denominations: "A rabbi, a
       medicine man, and a pastor went fishing..."
     * Letters and addresses to God.

   Self-deprecating or self-effacing humour is superficially similar to
   racial and stereotype jokes, but involves the targets laughing at
   themselves. It is said to maintain a sense of perspective and to be
   powerful in defusing confrontations. A common example is Jewish humour.
   A similar situation exists in the Scandinavian "Ole and Lena" joke.

   Self-deprecating humour has also been used by politicians, who
   recognise its ability to acknowledge controversial issues and steal the
   punch of criticism.^[citation needed] For example, when Abraham Lincoln
   was accused of being two-faced he replied, "If I had two faces, do you
   think this is the one Iâd be wearing?".

   Dirty jokes are based on taboo, often sexual, content or vocabulary.
   The definitive studies on them have been written by Gershon Legman.

   Other taboos are challenged by sick jokes and gallows humour, and to
   joke about disability is considered in this group.^[citation needed]

   Surrealist or minimalist jokes exploit semantic inconsistency, for
   example: Q: What's red and invisible? A: No tomatoes..^[citation
   needed]

   Anti-jokes are jokes that are not funny in regular sense, and often can
   be decidedly unfunny, but rely on the let-down from the expected joke
   to be funny in itself.^[citation needed]

   An elephant joke is a joke, almost always a riddle or conundrum and
   often a sequence of connected riddles, frequently operating on a
   surrealistic, anti-humorous or meta-humorous level, that involves an
   elephant.

   Jokes involving non-sequitur humour, with parts of the joke being
   unrelated to each other; e.g. "My uncle once punched a man so hard his
   legs became trombones", from The Mighty Boosh TV series.

   Dark humour is often used in order to deal with a difficult situation
   in a manner of "if you can laugh at it, it won't kill you". Usually
   those jokes make fun of tragedies like death, accidents, wars,
   catastrophes or injuries.

Styles

   The question/answer joke, sometimes posed as a common riddle, has a
   supposedly straight question and an answer which is twisted for
   humorous effect; puns are often employed. Of this type are knock-knock
   joke, light bulb joke, the many variations on "why did the chicken
   cross the road?", and the class of "What's the difference between a
   _______ and a ______" joke, where the punch line is often a pun or a
   spoonerism linking two apparently entirely unconnected concepts.

   Some jokes require a double act, where one respondent (usually the
   straight man) can be relied on to give the correct response to the
   person telling the joke. This is more common in performance than
   informal joke-telling.

   A shaggy dog story is an extremely long and involved joke with an
   intentionally weak or completely non-existent punchline. The humour
   lies in building up the audience's anticipation and then letting them
   down completely. The longer the story can continue without the audience
   realising it is a joke, and not a serious anecdote, the more successful
   it is.

   A joke is a question, short story, or depiction of a situation made
   with the intent of being humorous. To achieve this end, jokes may
   employ irony, sarcasm, word play and other devices. Jokes may have a
   punchline that will end the sentence to make it humorous.

   A practical joke or prank differs from a spoken one in that the major
   component of the humour is physical rather than verbal (for example
   placing salt in the sugar bowl).

Purpose

   Jokes are typically for the entertainment of friends and onlookers. The
   desired response is generally laughter; when this does not happen the
   joke is said to have "fallen flat" or "bombed".

   However jokes have other purposes and functions, common to
   comedy/humour/satire in general.

Antiquity of jokes

   Jokes have been a part of human culture since at least 1900 BC.
   According to research conducted by Dr Paul McDonald of the University
   of Wolverhampton, a fart joke from ancient Sumer is currently believed
   to be the world's oldest known joke.^[1] Britain's oldest joke,
   meanwhile, is a 1,000-year-old double-entendre that can be found in the
   Codex Exoniensis. ^[2]

   A recent discovery of a document called Philogelos (The Laughter Lover)
   gives us an insight into ancient humour. Written in Greek by Hierocles
   and Philagrius, it dates to the third or fourth century AD, and
   contains some 260 jokes. Considering humour from our own culture as
   recent as the 19th century is at times baffling to us today, the humour
   is surprisingly familiar. They had different stereotypes, the
   absent-minded professor, the eunuch, and people with hernias or bad
   breath were favourites. A lot of the jokes play on the idea of knowing
   who characters are:

     A barber, a bald man and an absent minded professor take a journey
     together. They have to camp overnight, so decide to take turns
     watching the luggage. When it's the barber's turn, he gets bored, so
     amuses himself by shaving the head of the professor. When the
     professor is woken up for his shift, he feels his head, and says
     "How stupid is that barber? He's woken up the bald man instead of
     me."

   There is even a version of Monty Python's Dead Parrot sketch: a man
   buys a slave, who dies shortly afterwards. When he complains to the
   slave merchant, he is told: "He didn't die when I owned him." Comic Jim
   Bowen has presented them to a modern audience. "One or two of them are
   jokes I've seen in people's acts nowadays, slightly updated. They put
   in a motor car instead of a chariot - some of them are Tommy
   Cooper-esque."^[3]

Psychology of jokes

   Why we laugh has been the subject of serious academic study, examples
   being:
     * Immanuel Kant, in Critique of Judgement (1790) states that
       "Laughter is an effect that arises if a tense expectation is
       transformed into nothing." Here is Kant's 220-year old joke and his
       analysis:

     "An Englishman at an Indian's table in Surat saw a bottle of ale
     being opened, and all the beer, turned to froth, rushed out. The
     Indian, by repeated exclamations, showed his great amazement. -
     Well, what's so amazing in that? asked the Englishman. - Oh, but I'm
     not amazed at its coming out, replied the Indian, but how you
     managed to get it all in. - This makes us laugh, and it gives us a
     hearty pleasure. This is not because, say, we think we are smarter
     than this ignorant man, nor are we laughing at anything else here
     that it is our liking and that we noticed through our understanding.
     It is rather that we had a tense expectation that suddenly
     vanished..."

     * Henri Bergson, in his book Le rire (Laughter, 1901), suggests that
       laughter evolved to make social life possible for human beings.
     * Sigmund Freud's "Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious". (Der
       Witz und seine Beziehung zum Unbewußten).
     * Arthur Koestler, in The Act of Creation (1964), analyses humour and
       compares it to other creative activities, such as literature and
       science.
     * Marvin Minsky in Society of Mind (1986).

          Marvin Minsky suggests that laughter has a specific function
          related to the human brain. In his opinion jokes and laughter
          are mechanisms for the brain to learn nonsense. For that reason,
          he argues, jokes are usually not as funny when you hear them
          repeatedly.

     * Edward de Bono in "The Mechanism of the Mind" (1969) and "I am
       Right, You are Wrong" (1990).

          Edward de Bono suggests that the mind is a pattern-matching
          machine, and that it works by recognising stories and behaviour
          and putting them into familiar patterns. When a familiar
          connection is disrupted and an alternative unexpected new link
          is made in the brain via a different route than expected, then
          laughter occurs as the new connection is made. This theory
          explains a lot about jokes. For example:

          + Why jokes are only funny the first time they are told: once
            they are told the pattern is already there, so there can be no
            new connections, and so no laughter.
          + Why jokes have an elaborate and often repetitive set up: The
            repetition establishes the familiar pattern in the brain. A
            common method used in jokes is to tell almost the same story
            twice and then deliver the punch line the third time the story
            is told. The first two tellings of the story evoke a familiar
            pattern in the brain, thus priming the brain for the punch
            line.
          + Why jokes often rely on stereotypes: the use of a stereotype
            links to familiar expected behaviour, thus saving time in the
            set-up.
          + Why jokes are variants on well-known stories (e.g. the genie
            and a lamp and a man walks into a bar): This again saves time
            in the set up and establishes a familiar pattern.

     * In 2002, Richard Wiseman conducted a study intended to discover the
       world's funniest joke [1].

   Laughter, the intended human reaction to jokes, is healthy in
   moderation, uses the stomach muscles, and releases endorphins, natural
   "feel good" chemicals, into the brain.

Jokes in organizations

   Jokes can be employed by workers as a way to identify with their jobs.
   For example, 9-1-1 operators often crack jokes about incongruous,
   threatening, or tragic situations they deal with on a daily basis.^[4]
   This use of humor and cracking jokes helps employees differentiate
   themselves from the people they serve while also assisting them in
   identifying with their jobs.^[5] In addition to employees, managers use
   joking, or jocularity, in strategic ways. Some managers attempt to
   suppress joking and humor use because they feel it relates to lower
   production, while others have attempted to manufacture joking through
   pranks, pajama or dress down days, and specific committees that are
   designed to increase fun in the workplace.^[6]

Rules

   The rules of humour are analogous to those of poetry. These common
   rules are mainly timing, precision, synthesis, and rhythm. French
   philosopher Henri Bergson has said in an essay: "In every wit there is
   something of a poet."^[7] In this essay Bergson views the essence of
   humour as the encrustation of the mechanical upon the living. He used
   as an instance a book by an English humorist, in which an elderly woman
   who desired a reputation as a philanthropist provided "homes within
   easy hail of her mansion for the conversion of atheists who have been
   specially manufactured for her, so to speak, and for a number of honest
   folk who have been made into drunkards so that she may cure them of
   their failing, etc." This idea seems funny because a genuine impulse of
   charity as a living, vital impulse has become encrusted by a mechanical
   conception of how it should manifest itself.

Precision

   To reach precision, the comedian must choose the words in order to
   provide a vivid, in-focus image, and to avoid being generic as to
   confuse the audience, and provide no laughter. To properly arrange the
   words in the sentence is also crucial to get precision. An example by
   Woody Allen (from Side Effects, "A Giant Step for Mankind" story [2]):

   Grasping the mouse firmly by the tail, I snapped it like a small whip,
   and the morsel of cheese came loose.

Synthesis

   That a joke is best when it expresses the maximum level of humour with
   a minimal number of words, is today considered one of the key technical
   elements of a joke.^[citation needed] An example from George Carlin:

   I have as much authority as the Pope, I just don't have as many people
   who believe it.^[8]

   Though, the familiarity of the pattern of "brevity" has led to numerous
   examples of jokes where the very length is itself the pattern-breaking
   "punchline".^[citation needed] Numerous examples from Monty Python
   exist, for instance, the song "I Like Traffic Lights". More recently,
   Family Guy often exploits such humor: for example in the episode
   "Wasted Talent", Peter Griffin bangs his shin, a classic slapstick
   routine, and tenderly nurses it whilst inhaling and exhaling to quiet
   the pain, for considerably longer than expected.^[vague] Certain
   versions of the popular vaudevillian joke The Aristocrats can go on for
   several minutes, and it is considered an anti-joke, as the humour is
   more in the set-up than the punchline.^[vague]

Rhythm

   Main articles: Timing (linguistics) and Comic timing

   The joke's content (meaning) is not what provokes the laugh, it just
   makes the salience of the joke and provokes a smile. What makes us
   laugh is the joke mechanism. Milton Berle demonstrated this with a
   classic theatre experiment in the 1950s: if during a series of jokes
   you insert phrases that are not jokes, but with the same rhythm, the
   audience laughs anyway^[citation needed]. A classic is the ternary
   rhythm, with three beats: Introduction, premise, antithesis (with the
   antithesis being the punch line).

   In regards to the Milton Berle experiment, they can be taken to
   demonstrate the concept of "breaking context" or "breaking the
   pattern". It is not necessarily the rhythm that caused the audience to
   laugh, but the disparity between the expectation of a "joke" and being
   instead given a non-sequitur "normal phrase." This normal phrase is,
   itself, unexpected, and a type of punchline.

Comic

   In the comic field plays the 'economy of ideative expenditure'; in
   other words excessive energy is wasted or action-essential energy is
   saved. The profound meaning of a comic gag or a comic joke is "I'm a
   child"; the comic deals with the clumsy body of the child.

   Laurel and Hardy are a classic example. An individual laughs because he
   recognises the child that is in himself. In clowns stumbling is a
   childish tempo. In the comic, the visual gags may be translated into a
   joke. For example in Side Effects (By Destiny Denied story) by Woody
   Allen:

   "My father used to wear loafers," she confessed. "Both on the same
   foot".

   The typical comic technique is the disproportion.

Wit

   In the wit field plays the "economy of censorship
   expenditure"^[9](Freud calls it "the economy of psychic expenditure");
   usually censorship prevents some 'dangerous ideas' from reaching the
   conscious mind, or helps us avoid saying everything that comes to mind;
   adversely, the wit circumvents the censorship and brings up those
   ideas. Different wit techniques allow one to express them in a funny
   way. The profound meaning behind a wit joke is "I have dangerous
   ideas". An example from Woody Allen:

   I contemplated suicide again - this time by inhaling next to an
   insurance salesman.

   Or, when a bagpipe player was asked "How do you play that thing?" his
   answer was "Well." Wit is a branch of rhetoric, and there are about 200
   techniques (technically they are called tropes, a particular kind of
   figure of speech) that can be used to make jokes.^[10]

   Irony can be seen as belonging to this field.

Humour

   In the comedy field, humour induces an "economised expenditure of
   emotion" (Freud calls it "economy of affect" or "economy of sympathy".
   Freud produced this final part of his interpretation many years later,
   in a paper later supplemented to the book.).^[9]^[11] In other words,
   the joke erases an emotion that should be felt about an event, making
   us insensitive to it.e.g.: "yo momma" jokes. The profound meaning of
   the void feeling of a humour joke is "I'm a cynic". An example from
   Woody Allen:

   Three times I've been mistaken for Robert Redford. Each time by a blind
   person.

   This field of jokes is still a grey area, being mostly unexplored.
   Extensive use of this kind of humour can be found in the work of
   British satirist Chris Morris, like the sketches of the Jam television
   program.

   Black humour and sarcasm belong to this field.

Cycles

   Folklorists, in particular (but not exclusively) those who study the
   folklore of the United States, collect jokes into joke cycles. A cycle
   is a collection of jokes with a particular theme or a particular
   "script". (That is, it is a literature cycle.)^[12] Folklorists have
   identified several such cycles:
     * the Helen Keller Joke Cycle that comprises jokes about Helen
       Keller^[13]
     * Viola jokes^[14]
     * the NASA, Challenger, or Space Shuttle Joke Cycle that comprises
       jokes relating to the Space Shuttle Challenger
       disaster^[15]^[16]^[17]
     * the Chernobyl Joke Cycle that comprises jokes relating to the
       Chernobyl disaster^[18]
     * the Polish Pope Joke Cycle that comprises jokes relating to Pope
       John Paul II^[19]
     * the Essex girl and the Stupid Irish joke cycles in the United
       Kingdom^[20]
     * the Dead Baby Joke Cycle^[21]
     * the Newfie Joke Cycle that comprises jokes made by Canadians about
       Newfoundlanders^[22]
     * the Little Willie Joke Cycle, and the Quadriplegic Joke Cycle^[23]
     * the Jew Joke Cycle and the Polack Joke Cycle^[24]
     * the Rastus and Liza Joke Cycle, which Dundes describes as "the most
       vicious and widespread white anti-Negro joke cycle"^[25]
     * the Jewish American Princess and Jewish American Mother joke
       cycles^[26]
     * the Wind-Up Doll Joke Cycle^[27]
     * The "Blond Joke" Cycle.

   Gruner discusses several "sick joke" cycles that occurred upon events
   surrounding Gary Hart, Natalie Wood, Vic Morrow, Jim Bakker, Richard
   Pryor, Princess Diana and Michael Jackson, noting how several jokes
   were recycled from one cycle to the next. For example: A joke about Vic
   Morrow ("We now know that Vic Morrow had dandruff: they found his head
   and shoulders in the bushes") was subsequently recycled about Admiral
   Mountbatten after his murder by Irish Republican terrorists in 1979,
   and again applied to the crew of the Challenger space shuttle ("How do
   we know that Christa McAuliffe had dandruff? They found her head and
   shoulders on the beach.").^[28]

   Berger asserts that "whenever there is a popular joke cycle, there
   generally is some widespread kind of social and cultural anxiety,
   lingering below the surface, that the joke cycle helps people deal
   with".^[29]

Types of jokes

   Jokes often depend on the humour of the unexpected, the mildly taboo
   (which can include the distasteful or socially improper), or playing
   off stereotypes and other cultural beliefs. Many jokes fit into more
   than one category.

Subjects

   Political jokes are usually a form of satire. They generally concern
   politicians and heads of state, but may also cover the absurdities of a
   country's political situation. A prominent example of political jokes
   would be political cartoons. Two large categories of this type of jokes
   exist. The first one makes fun of a negative attitude to political
   opponents or to politicians in general. The second one makes fun of
   political clichés, mottoes, catch phrases or simply blunders of
   politicians. Some, especially the "you have two cows" genre, derive
   humour from comparing different political systems.

   Professional humour includes caricatured portrayals of certain
   professions such as lawyers, and in-jokes told by professionals to each
   other.

   Mathematical jokes are a form of in-joke, generally designed to be
   understandable only by insiders. (They are also often strictly visual
   jokes.)

   Ethnic jokes exploit ethnic stereotypes. They are often racist and
   frequently considered offensive.

   For example, the British tell jokes starting "An Englishman, an
   Irishman and a Scotsman..." which exploit the supposed parsimony of the
   Scot, stupidity of the Irish or rigid conventionality of the English.
   Such jokes exist among numerous peoples.

   Racially offensive humour is often considered funny, but similar jokes
   based on other stereotypes (such as blonde jokes) are often considered
   even more funny.

   Religious jokes fall into several categories:
     * Jokes based on stereotypes associated with people of religion (e.g.
       nun jokes, priest jokes, or rabbi jokes)
     * Jokes on classical religious subjects: crucifixion, Adam and Eve,
       St. Peter at The Gates, etc.
     * Jokes that collide different religious denominations: "A rabbi, a
       medicine man, and a pastor went fishing..."
     * Letters and addresses to God.

   Self-deprecating or self-effacing humour is superficially similar to
   racial and stereotype jokes, but involves the targets laughing at
   themselves. It is said to maintain a sense of perspective and to be
   powerful in defusing confrontations. Probably the best-known and most
   common example is Jewish humour. The egalitarian tradition was strong
   among the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe in which the powerful
   were often mocked subtly. Prominent members of the community were
   kidded during social gatherings, part a good-natured tradition of
   humour as a levelling device. A similar situation exists in the
   Scandinavian "Ole and Lena" joke.

   Self-deprecating humour has also been used by politicians, who
   recognise its ability to acknowledge controversial issues and steal the
   punch of criticism - for example, when Abraham Lincoln was accused of
   being two-faced he replied, "If I had two faces, do you think this is
   the one I’d be wearing?".

   Dirty jokes are based on taboo, often sexual, content or vocabulary.
   The definitive studies on them have been written by Gershon Legman.

   Other taboos are challenged by sick jokes and gallows humour; to joke
   about disability is considered in this group.

   Surrealist or minimalist jokes exploit semantic inconsistency, for
   example: Q: What's red and invisible? A: No tomatoes..

   Anti-jokes are jokes that are not funny in regular sense, and often can
   be decidedly unfunny, but rely on the let-down from the expected joke
   to be funny in itself.^[citation needed] A question was: 'What is the
   difference between a dead bird ?. The answer came: "His right leg is as
   different as his left one'. An elephant joke is a joke, almost always a
   riddle or conundrum and often a sequence of connected riddles, that
   involves an elephant.

   Jokes involving non-sequitur humour, with parts of the joke being
   unrelated to each other; e.g. "My uncle once punched a man so hard his
   legs became trombones", from the Mighty Boosh TV series.

Styles

   The question / answer joke, sometimes posed as a common riddle, has a
   supposedly straight question and an answer which is twisted for
   humorous effect; puns are often employed. Of this type are knock-knock
   joke, light bulb joke, the many variations on "why did the chicken
   cross the road?", and the class of "What's the difference between a
   _______ and a ______" joke, where the punch line is often a pun or a
   spoonerism linking two apparently entirely unconnected concepts.

   Some jokes require a double act, where one respondent (usually the
   straight man) can be relied on to give the correct response to the
   person telling the joke. This is more common in performance than
   informal joke-telling.

   A shaggy dog story is an extremely long and involved joke with an
   intentionally weak or completely non-existent punchline. The humour
   lies in building up the audience's anticipation and then letting them
   down completely. The longer the story can continue without the audience
   realising it is a joke, and not a serious anecdote, the more successful
   it is. Shaggy jokes appear to date from the 1930s, although there are
   several competing variants for the "original" shaggy dog story.
   According to one, an advertisement is placed in a newspaper, searching
   for the shaggiest dog in the world. The teller of the joke then relates
   the story of the search for the shaggiest dog in extreme and
   exaggerated detail (flying around the world, climbing mountains,
   fending off sabre-toothed tigers, etc.); a good teller will be able to
   stretch the story out to over half an hour. When the winning dog is
   finally presented, the advertiser takes a look at the dog and states:
   "I don't think he's so shaggy."

   Some shaggy dog stories are actually cleverly constructed stories,
   frequently interesting in themselves, that culminate in one or more
   puns whose first meaning is reasonable as part of the story but whose
   second meaning is a common aphorism, commercial jingle, or other
   recognisable word or phrase. As with other puns, there may be multiple
   separate rhyming meanings. Such stories treat the listener or reader
   with respect. (See: "Upon My Word!", a book by Frank Muir and Denis
   Norden, spun off from their long-running BBC radio show My Word!.)

Essex girl

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search

   An Essex girl is a pejorative stereotype in the United Kingdom of a
   female who is said to be promiscuous and unintelligent, characteristics
   jocularly attributed to women from Essex. It is applied widely
   throughout the country and has gained popularity over time, dating from
   the 1980s and 1990s. Unlike Essex man, which became aspirational
   stereotype for working-class voters in the south and east of England
   who voted for Margaret Thatcher, Essex girl does not carry positive
   political connotations.

[edit] Image

   The stereotypical image was formed as a variation of the dumb
   blonde/bimbo persona, with references to the Estuary English accent,
   white stiletto heels, silicone enhanced breasts, peroxide blonde hair,
   over-indulgent use of fake tan (lending an orange appearance),
   promiscuity, loud verbal vulgarity and to socialising at downmarket
   nightclubs.

   Time magazine has written:

   In the typology of the British, there is a special place reserved for
   Essex Girl, a lady from London's eastern suburbs who dresses in white
   strappy sandals and suntan oil, streaks her hair blond, has a command
   of Spanish that runs only to the word Ibiza, and perfects an air of
   tarty prettiness. Victoria Beckham – Posh Spice, as she was – is the
   acknowledged queen of that realm ...^[1]

   The term initially became synonymous with the lead characters of Sharon
   and Tracey in the BBC sitcom Birds of a Feather. These brash,
   uninhibited women had escaped working-class backgrounds in London and
   moved to a large house in Chigwell. The image has since been epitomised
   in celebrity culture with the likes of Denise Van Outen, Jade Goody,
   Jodie Marsh, Chantelle Houghton,and Amy Childs all rising to some
   degree of fame with the help of their Essex Girl image.

[edit] Essex girl jokes

   Essex girl jokes are primarily variations of dumb blonde jokes, though
   often sexually explicit. In 2004, Bob Russell, Liberal Democrat MP for
   Colchester in Essex, appealed for debate in the House of Commons on the
   issue, encouraging a boycott of The People tabloid, which has printed
   several derogatory references to girls from Essex.^[2]

MP urges boycott of The People over Essex girl jokes

   26 March 2004

   An MP is so incensed with The People for publishing "derogatory
   remarks" about Essex girls that he has urged readers to stop buying it.

   Bob Russell, the Liberal Democrat MP for Colchester, has urged them to
   register a protest by switching to another Sunday newspaper.

   He made his appeal in a House of Commons motion which is open to other
   MPs to sign.

   "Had the offensive comments been directed at people because of their
   colour or religion it would have caused outrage amongst all decent
   citizens and would be considered by some to break the law," he said in
   his motion.

   The MP has taken offence at a story in last Sunday's People about
   Prince William allegedly arranging a date with an Essex girl. On the
   inside pages, the story was illustrated by a string of Essex girl
   jokes.

   "Such attacks on women from Essex have no place in civilised society,"
   said Russell. "They are unworthy of any publication which wants to be
   taken seriously" The motion calls on people to boycott The People and
   to "switch their alliegance" to another Sunday paper.

   If enough MPs sign, Leader of the House Peter Hain could face pressure
   to yield government time for a debate.

   Russell can also apply to Speaker Michael Martin to grant him a
   halfhour slot to raise his concerns in a mini-Commons debate.

Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ #32

   Posted on August 17, 2011 | Leave a comment

   Welcome to the end of Wednesday, fellow crap jokers.

   âTis a busy time here at CJotD headquarters. With the famous Crap Joke
   GeneratorÂ® out of action (it was badly damaged in the great fire),
   weâve been racking our brains to devise suitable crap-jokery to pass on
   to our loyal readers.

   So often, as any joke-writer worth his salt will tell you, a new joke
   comes from a theme. Todayâs joke is no different, and its theme came
   through an unexpected source. While drinking our local public house,
   our head researcher got talking to a dishevelled looking man with an
   eye patch who suggested he was considering hiring a superhero costume
   and heading out onto the London streets to tackle rioters. He was
   clearly insane (he told our researcher that he had already started
   important conversion work on his 1982 Ford Fiesta), but nonetheless we
   thought he had a point.

   And surely that point is this: the world needs more heroes. So, with
   that in mind, here’s today’s CJotD. Enjoy.

   Did you hear about the man who collected Joan Of Arc, Wonder Woman and
   Florence Nightingale memorabilia?
   He was a heroine addict.

   Well, they canât all be winners. Another one of those, same time
   tomorrow.

Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ #31

   Posted on August 10, 2011 | 1 Comment

   Since our last Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢, times in London have been
   troubled. CJotD HQ, just recently reopened for business after the great
   fire of April 2011, has been on lockdown.

   Whatever part of the world youâre from â and CJotD fans are certainly a
   global crowd âÂ  you will have no doubt heard about the rioting that
   has hit Londonâs streets, and subsequently other cities across England.
   The latest is that there is looting in Peckham now – apparently the
   reprobates have taken half-price cracked ice, miles and miles of carpet
   tiles, TVs, deep freeze, David Bowie LPs…

   Think about that one.

   Anyway. Ultimately, we hope that CJotD can bring a little bit of light
   to the darkness, whether youâre young or old, hippy or hoodie. Weâre
   here for everyone.

   So hereâs todayâs cracker, which stands in stark contrast to the wanton
   thuggery out there. It will be enjoyed by those that remember the cult
   childrenâs TV show classic, Rainbow.

   What’s the name of Zippy’s wife ?
   Mississippi

   Another one of those, same time tomorrow.

Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ #30

   Posted on August 8, 2011 | Leave a comment

   Picture this. Itâs 29 April, 1985. Oddly-spectacled Dennis Taylor has
   crumbled in the face of snooker-based genius Steve Davis, finding
   himself seven frames to none down in the final of the world snooker
   championships.

   Davis was on fire. He was a god of the green baize: a modern Achilles
   brandishing a maple spear. Taylor looked every bit the vanquished
   Trojan warrior. His fans looked on, tutting.

   No-one thought Davisâ mistake in frame eight would mean anything. But,
   hours later, Taylor had achieved the impossible, besting the world
   champion on a respotted black in the deciding frame. As he lifted
   snookerâs greatest trophy above his head, he stood astride the world an
   unlikely hero.

   This was the greatest comeback of all time. Until now.

   As youâll know, loyal CJotD reader, by April we had published 29
   glorious mirth-makers. Popularity was soaring. But with popularity came
   a relentless demand for ever more ground-breaking two liners. Buckling
   under the rising tide of expectation, the system broke. An incident
   involving our office runner, some new-fangled highlighter pens and an
   overheating photocopier led to a raging inferno that burned the office
   to the ground.

   Four months on, and weâre back. We have a new office and a new, can-do
   attitude. Weâre still finding our feet, but weâll give it a go. Hereâs
   todayâs effort. Enjoy â and give us a five star rating. Go on. This is
   our 1985.

   How do you turn a duck into a soul singer?
   Put it in a microwave until its Bill Withers.

   Another one of those, same time tomorrow.

Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ #29

   Posted on April 21, 2011 | 1 Comment

   Raise a glass – youâve made it to the end of the week. Well, the end of
   the Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ week at least – Â this will be the last
   CJotD until next Tuesday because of the Easter break. We suggest this
   is one you should cherish â after all, we donât want you suffering
   withdrawal symptoms.

   What a record-breaking, jaw-dropping week of firsts it has been here at
   CJotD. We published the first in a series of fan profile posts on
   Tuesday, and followed it up with the first ever reader submitted crap
   joke. We were also featured on an article on chortle.co.uk. The result
   of all this success: people flocked to the website in numbers never
   witnessed before. Our servers creaked under the pressure but, propped
   up by some sterling work from the IT department, stood firm.

   So the team here at Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ are all heading down to the
   local watering hole to enjoy a collective sigh of contentment (and
   probably one or two light ales). But first, of course, we owe you a
   crap joke.Â Â

   Todayâs epic crap joke is one of those perfectly timed numbers â
   certainly one to tell your friends over the coming weekend. Learn it
   word-for-word, practice in front of a mirror and then deliver it
   unflinchingly and with conviction: youâll be guaranteed a laugh.
   Probably.Â Happy Easter.

   Arnold Schwarzenegger didnât get any Easter eggs this year. His wife
   asked him âDoes this mean you hate Easter now, Arnie?â
   He replied âAh still love Easter babyâ.

   Another one of those, same time on Tuesday.

Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ #28

   Posted on April 19, 2011 | 2 Comments

   Keen followers of Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ witnessed a world exclusive
   this morning: the launch of a new series of posts based on FriendsÂ® of
   CJotD. If you missed it, have a read of the first ever no-holds-barred
   interview with a real CJotD fan here. More will follow.

   These profile pieces are part of our efforts to recognise the role that
   our readers have played in our meteoric rise (a rise exemplified by our
   recent mention in an article by comedian Matt Price on popular comedy
   website chortle.co.uk). And weâre not stopping there – there is another
   opportunity for crap joke-basedÂ fame and fortune.

   Some of you will have clicked on the âsubmit a crap jokeâ link at the
   top of the screen. Others have gone further: many a dreary canteen
   lunch here at CJotD HQ has been enlivened by a public retelling of a
   fanâs crap joke. Today is the day we put one of your crap jokes to the
   test: for the very first time, an official Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ will
   come from a reader.

   Here it is. Is it better than our normal efforts? Let us know by
   leaving a comment or giving it a star rating. Think you can do better?
   Submit your own crap joke. Oh â and if youâre reading this and itâs
   your joke, you might want to let the world know youâve been published.
   Take a bit of the credit â you deserve it.

   I got stung by a bee the other day.
   20 quid for a jar of honey.

   Another one of those, same time tomorrow.

New series of CJotD fan inteviews launches today

   Posted on April 19, 2011 | 2 Comments

   Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ is just 27 days old, but is already a phenomenon
   on the tinterweb superhighway. Zuckerberg is quaking in his boots; a
   queue of advertisers is forming at the oak-panelled CJotD door.

   But weâre not naÃ¯ve here at CJotD: we know that we would be nothing
   without our fans. You have made Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ the living,
   breathing community that it is today, and we want to give something
   back.

   So weâre proud to announce the launch of a new series of posts
   featuring interviews with our biggest supporters: FriendsÂ® of
   CJotD.Â These will be bare-all affairs that really get to the heart of
   how exactly fans âenjoy CJotDâ. Hopefully weâll all gain a little
   inspiration from sharing these CJotD stories, routines and nostalgia.

   The first such interview is with Zaria. Zaria discovered the site a few
   weeks back and, since then, has become one of our finest ambassadors,
   truly taking CJotD to work with her.

   Hi Zaria. We hear youâre a big CJotD fan. How did you find out about
   it?
   I saw it mentioned in the âTop 10 Twitterers to Watch of 2011â in The
   News of the World culture section. You can follow Zaria on Twitter
   @zaria_b, and CJotD @crapjokedaily â ed.

   Yeah, a lot of people saw that. What are your earliest memories of crap
   jokes?
   My family are a dynasty of crap jokers â I was brought up with it all
   around me. I guess thatâs why I feel so home at crapjokeoftheday.com.

   How do you experience Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢?
   I read it aloud in the office to my colleagues â weâre only a small
   team of six, and we share our office with some librarians (thatâs not a
   joke). Itâs always a challenge to see if we can get a smile out of
   those old girls.

   Sounds like youâve got a regular thing going. Would you say you have
   any Crap Joke of the Day rituals?
   It always tends to be after lunch, once everyone has a very strong
   cuppa in hand. Weâll have just finished the paper crossword, and be in
   need some encouragement as we face the prospect of another afternoon at
   the grindstone. One afternoon we had ran out of milk and couldnât
   accompany CJotD with a cup of tea. It was pretty extreme, but we still
   pulled through.

   In your opinion, what is the mark of a good crap joke?
   Groaning â you know youâve not hit the spot until youâve heard a groan!

   What’s been your favourite CJotD so far?
   CJotD #8 was a real highlight in our office. Like I said we often have
   the CJotD after completing the crossword. Surely that joke proves that
   itâs life that imitates artâ¦

   Would you say CJotD has changed you at all?
   Itâs changed my life in more ways then I can mention. I honestly
   believe peace in the world would be possible if more people took just
   two minutes to read CJotD each day. Has anyone sent a link to Gaddafi?

   ‘Laughter is the best medicine’. Discuss.
   This sounds like Andrew Lansleyâs tag line at the moment! Anything to
   save some money in the NHS!

   By taking part in this interview, Zaria has now formally become a
   FriendÂ® of Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢. Want to share that prestigious
   title? Volunteer to answer some simple questions by emailing us here.

Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ #27

   Posted on April 18, 2011 | 1 Comment

   Good afternoon, crap joke fans. We are delighted today to preview an
   exciting CJotD launch. Tomorrow morning, Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ will be
   launching a new series of posts. Posts based on you.

   In many ways, CJotD is less a website, and more a thriving community of
   people who love to hate to laugh at bad jokes. Our new series of posts
   will look at the people in that community, unearthing precisely how
   crap jokes make them tick. From the rituals and routines to the stories
   and the sniggers, we sincerely hope these fan musings will help us all
   get a little bit more out of each daily instalment of CJotD.

   But thatâs tomorrow.Â What about today?Â Well, thereâs merely a crap
   joke, just for you. And a brilliantly childish one at that â tell the
   kids to give it a five star rating.

   What do you call a monkey in a minefield?
   A Babboom!

   Or a chimpbangzee. Or a gibbang. Or an obangutan.

   Another one of those, same time tomorrow.

Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ #26

   Posted on April 15, 2011 | Leave a comment

   Welcome to the weekend, friends of Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢. This weekend
   will neatly punctuate a remarkable five days in the history of CJotD:
   five days that have seen more than their fair share of turmoil,
   exhilaration, despair and laughter for us hard-working types here at
   HQ.

   The CJotD board are more than a little obsessed with numbers. Never a
   day goes by when a new report, chart or spreadsheet isnât created, the
   Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ supercomputer crunching a vast array of numbers
   to help our writers hone our writing and our marketers refine our
   marketing.

   With the penchant for numbers and data gathering force, it was our
   accounts team that inspired the commentary ahead of Crap Joke of the
   Dayâ¢ #18 (no doubt you remember it well). The geekier CJotD fans among
   you gave that one rave reviews, so our editors decided we should give
   you a similar taste of trivia.

   Like 18, 26 itself is a remarkable number in its own right. There are,
   of course, 26 letters in the alphabet, 26 miles in a marathon, and 26
   red cards in a traditional deck*. As youâll know, 26 is also the number
   of spacetime dimensions in bosonic string theory, and the number of
   sides in a rhombicuboctahedron.

   Slightly more on topic, a âjoke throwâ in darts â where a player throws
   a 20, a 5 and a 1 when aiming for treble 20s â is 26 in total.

   So, to celebrate the birth of a brand new weekend on CJotDâs 26^th
   birthday, todayâs crap joke is a classic. Give us a good rating â make
   us happy.

   I was walking by the fridge last night and I swore I could hear an
   onion singing a Bee Gees song. Turns out it was just the chives
   talking.

   Another one of those, same time on Monday.

   Â
   * The eagle-eyed among you might have noticed that there are also 26
   black cards.

Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ #25

   Posted on April 14, 2011 | 1 Comment

   The best and most successful organisations know their audience inside
   out,Â and CJotD is no exception. Our in-depth CJotD enjoyment index
   surveyÂ© gets our customer relations team the most detailed and
   reliable insight on how to keep our jokes relevant to our readersâ
   lives.

   We know, for example, that CJotD fans are a massively diverse bunch and
   have aÂ huge variety of skills, professions, interests, hobbies and
   pastimes. Some get their kicksÂ watchingÂ football orÂ  by working all
   the hours god sends, others spend their spare time playing backgammon
   or making sacle models of historic ships out of balsa wood.

   But what does this mean? Well, it means one joke doesnât fit all. If
   our readers are diverse, we must be diverse. In fact, being diverse has
   probably been the secret of our runaway success to date (we are now
   nearing 200 fans on Facebook), and so far our crap jokes have taken in
   subjects including fairgrounds, the army, factory working, text
   messaging, goths and circumcision. What other organisation would tackle
   such a mesmerising array of hot topics?

   So todayâs joke covers an area weâve never covered before, and is aimed
   at all those CJotD fans that also like a bit of tennis. It focuses on a
   former world number one who returned to training yesterday after months
   out of the game. Enjoy.

   Did you hear that Serena Williams has left her boyfriend?
   These tennis players – love means nothing to them.

   Another one of those, same time tomorrow.

Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ #24

   Posted on April 12, 2011 | Leave a comment

   Despite the mystery of the Crap Joke of the Dayâ¢ logbook’s
   disappearance drawing to a close yesterday, we unfortunately havenât
   seen the back of the police here at CJotD HQ.

   We have been officially charged with wasting police time, and
   areÂ taking the allegations very seriously. Senior Crap Joke of the
   Dayâ¢ executives have freed up time for potential police interviews,
   and it was agreed in an emergency board meeting this morning that these
   interviews would be colour-coded red in diaries.

   As a result of the charges, resources here at CJotD HQ are stretched to
   the absolute maximum and the HR team have been forced into temporarily
   realigning roles and responsibilities. Copywriters are lending a hand
   on the web design desk, quality control officers are pulling the
   strings on editorial team and the managing director is filing with the
   archivists. Our work experience student is still making the tea.

   SoÂ weâre just going to get on with todayâs crap joke. No more mucking
   around, no more beating about the bush. Weâre just going to push right
   on, get right to it, with none of the normal flourish or fanfare. So,
   with no further adoâ¦

   Did you hear about the unemployed jester?
   Heâs nobodyâs fool.

   Another one of those, same time tomorrow.

Joke's on those who joke about Japan

   Nothing like a staggering natural disaster to bring out mankind's ...
   worst? While the crisis gripping Japan has tugged on hearts and
   wallets, it also has drawn cracks from cultural figures that redefine
   insensitivity:

   By Charles Sykes, AP

   Comedian Gilbert Gottfried's tweets cost him his longstanding gig with
   the Aflac duck.

   o  Comic Gilbert Gottfried was fired Monday as the voice of insurance
   giant Aflac after tweeting jokes such as "They don't go to the beach.
   The beach comes to them."

   o  Family Guywriter Alec Sulkin tweeted that feeling better about the
   quake was just a matter of Googling "Pearl Harbor death toll." Almost
   2,500 died in that 1941 attack; more than 10,000 are feared dead in
   Japan.

   o  Rapper 50 Cent joked that the quake forced him to relocate "all my
   hoes from L.A., Hawaii and Japan." He tweeted in apology: "Some of my
   tweets are ignorant I do it for shock value."

   Is our insta-mouthpiece part of the problem? Don't blame the messenger,
   says Twitter's Sean Garrett, citing "The Tweets Must Flow." The company
   blog memo notes Twitter's inability to police the 100 million daily
   tweets.

   Comedians often do get away with emotional murder. That's their job,
   Joan Rivers tweeted Tuesday in Gottfried's defense: "(Comedians) help
   people in tough times feel better through laughter."

   Too soon, as Rivers' catchphrase asks?

   "There's a line in our culture, but it seems to keep moving," says
   Purdue University history professor Randy Roberts. Before, "a tasteless
   joke wouldn't make it past a cocktail party. Now it reaches millions
   instantly. Don't say something stupid if you don't want people to hear
   it."

   Even so, joking about death may be over the line.

   "People died here -- it's something your parents should have taught you
   never to make fun of," says Teja Arboleda, a former comedian and
   founder of Entertaining Diversity, which advises companies on diversity
   questions. "There's humor that helps us through a tragedy, and humor
   where you kick people when they're down. There's no reason for the
   latter."

   And yet others have piled on, including Glenn Beck (who called the
   quake a "message from God") and pro basketball player Cappie Pondexter
   (ditto). Dan Turner, press secretary for Mississippi Gov. Haley
   Barbour, resigned Monday after circulating a Japan joke to staffers.

   "Japan is always going to be a target for some, as Germany and the
   Middle East might be for others," says Shannon Jowett at New York's
   Japan Society. "But I'd rather focus on the overwhelming sense of
   support we are seeing."

The Official European Joke

   Le lundi, février 7 2011, 12:31 :: belgiom,  best seller,  buzz,

   Traduction française de ce billet disponible ici

   Europe

   European paradise:

   You are invited to an official lunch. You are welcomed by an
   Englishman. Food is prepared by a Frenchman and an Italian puts you in
   the mood and everything is organised by a German.

   European hell:

   You are invited to an official lunch. You are welcomed by a Frenchman.
   Food is prepared by an Englishman, German puts you in the mood but,
   don't worry, everything is organised by an Italian.

   petits drapeaux européens

   That joke was proposed by a Belgian as the Official European Joke, the
   joke that every single European pupil should learn at school. The Joke
   will improve the relationship between the nations as well as promote
   our self humour and our culture.

   The European Council met in order to make a decision. Should the joke
   be the Official European Joke or not?

   The British representative announced, with a very serious face and
   without moving his jaw, that the joke was absolutely hilarious.

   The French one protested because France was depicted in a bad way in
   the joke. He explained that a joke cannot be funny if it is against
   France.

   Poland also protested because they were not depicted in the joke.

   Luxembourg asked who would hold the copyright on the joke. The Swedish
   representative didn't say a word, but looked at everyone with a twisted
   smile.

   Denmark asked where the explicit sexual reference was. If it is a joke,
   there should be one, shouldn't there?

   Holland didn't get the joke, while Portugal didn't understand what a
   "joke" was. Was it a new concept?

   Spain explained that the joke is funny only if you know that the lunch
   was at 13h, which is normally breakfast time. Greece complained that
   they were not aware of that lunch, that they missed an occasion to have
   some free food, that they were always forgotten. Romania then asked
   what a "lunch" was.

   Lithuania et Latvia complained that their translations were inverted,
   which is unacceptable even if it happens all the time. Slovenia told
   them that its own translation was completely forgotten and that they do
   not make a fuss. Slovakia announced that, unless the joke was about a
   little duck and a plumber, there was a mistake in their translation.
   The British representative said that the duck and plumber story seemed
   very funny too.

   Hungary had not finished reading the 120 pages of its own translation
   yet.

   Then, the Belgian representative asked if the Belgian who proposed the
   joke was a Dutch speaking or a French speaking Belgian. Because, in one
   case, he would of course support a compatriot but, in the other case,
   he would have to refuse it, regardless of the quality of the joke.

   To close the meeting, the German representative announced that it was
   nice to have the debate here in Brussels but that, now, they all had to
   make the train to Strasbourg in order to take a decision. He asked that
   someone to wake up the Italian, so as not to miss the train, so they
   can come back to Brussels and announce the decision to the press before
   the end of the day.

   "What decision?" asked the Irish representative.

   And they all agreed it was time for some coffee.

          The joke is certainly done by somebody that never tasted Spanish
          food.

          And yet, the union still beats the hell out of everybody killing
          each other for the past fifty years.

          Haha truely funny! Tho I'm sad Portugal doesn't know what a joke
          is. I'm laughing, tho I guess I'm weird.

          Hey! Italian food is much much much better than the French one!

          Well, actually, I can't think about a thing that French does
          better than Italian :-)

          (you know, it's always the same old love-hate relationship
          between Italy and France)

          ACHTUNG, you forgot to reference the registration ID for the
          proposal. There are procedures for this kind of stuff, you know,
          for a reason.

          ;)

          You know you'll have to do this all over again once Croatia
          joins the EU :)

          The Austrian representative agreed that this was a really nice
          idea and then returned home to make a bug fuss about how the EU
          forces its own agenda undermining the Austrian humor culture

   8. Le mardi, février 8 2011, 02:05 par Ryan James
          And the American doesn't see how that is funny at all. Damn
          Europeans.

   9. Le mardi, février 8 2011, 04:16 par Vicky Katsarova
          Hi there, I find the joke refreshing...and cute.

          And then they all got together and smugly talked about how
          tolerant they all are while they made racist jokes about Turks
          and blacks and Roma, who don't have a place in Europe or its
          official joke.
          HA HA. How long until you people start WW3?

   11. Le mardi, février 8 2011, 08:59 par billy
          that's right, the italian men definitely swallow better

   12. Le mardi, février 8 2011, 11:08 par Joaquim Rocha
          Why was the joke a new concept for the Portuguese?

          This a funny post indeed :D

   13. Le mardi, février 8 2011, 15:19 par PTahead
          I didn't get the joke... of the comments about the joke. Someone
          must be enjoying playing geek without any skill.

          Why the Czechs weren't mentioned? (from FB)

          Czechs first asked the Germans about their thoughts on the
          subject and then promised they'll go with the exact opposite
          provided they'll be backed by the Irish. If not, they'll just
          block the vote. And to support this stance, they approved a new
          voting system and elected Klaus president for the third time.

          Later on, they pointed out that the inability to find consensus
          over the joke clearly suggests that EU is an empty leftist
          concept and ventured out to find the closest buffet.

          Anyway, for them the joke is irrelevant since, obviously,
          'paradise' and 'hell' do not exist.

          Reminds me of the official Canada joke. "Canada could have been
          great. It could have had American technology, British culture
          and French cuisine. Instead, it got French technology, American
          culture and British cuisine.

   17. Le mercredi, février 9 2011, 13:47 par Anita
          Hahaha, great explanation :)

          Indeed, THIS IS EUROPE ! Without each other they can`t live, but
          together they are always quarrelling !

          I translated it in Italian just for sharing (including a link to
          this post). Hope you don't mind.

          The joke was absolutely hilarious.

          There are three conclusions one can draw:
          1) The decision should not be decided in Strasbourg but
          unanimously by all the Parliaments of all the countries
          concerned.
          2) The proposal should then go the mathematicians because they
          are the only ones able to square the circle.
          3) Our politicians have a really tough time in Brussels.

   22. Le vendredi, février 11 2011, 15:19 par Federico Gobbo
          I have just translated your post in Italian, with a couple of
          links to the French and the English variants. I was so
          astonished by your sharpness!

          Here it is:

          There is no such thing as Holland! The state Holland, part of
          the Netherlands, was split in two at the very end of the 18th
          century.

          (Cameron is not PM of England either, is he? Just as people from
          Northern-Ireland are most certainly not English.)

          That aside, I do think that before we should not conclude that
          this is a funny joke until it is accepted by all national
          parliaments. Only then can we be sure the sovereignty of our
          great nations will not be endangered by those reckless
          eurocrats!

          Hand the proposal to the Council of Ministers, they'll know what
          to do with it.

          Portuguese could do everything, invitation, welcoming, food
          preparation, put in the the mood and organise for less money and
          as well as the best in each task. Portuguese do it better, at
          lower prices than the second best. I love Portugal.

   25. Le jeudi, février 17 2011, 23:19 par Frank
          This is funny... i can't understand why

          "while Portugal didn't understand what a "joke" was. Was it a
          new concept?"

          Portugal is the country where people tell more jokes per second.
          It is where the culture of "anedotas" (little and funny stories
          - I don't the exact translation)

          Cultural schizophrenia from true political athletes; this is
          just the tip of the iceberg - thank heavens that federalism
          drowned somewhere near the bottom!

   29. Le dimanche, mars 13 2011, 21:17 par espace.ariane
          Excellent =D

   30. Le jeudi, mars 24 2011, 18:59 par Lavaman
          Portugal didn't get the joke?

          The Portuguese people are the funniest people in all of
          Europe...I think this is more of a racist comment made by those
          close-minded Germans, Dutch etc.

   31. Le jeudi, mars 31 2011, 09:51 par melon
          This one is hilarious indeed :)
          For those who seem to lack some well-developed sense of humour,
          well... at least admit that the post has funny parts as well.

          Cheers,
          a Hungarian citizen (whose part in the joke is sad but true ->
          therefore funny)

          This is Europe.

          Lol :D It doesnt make sense that portuguese don't get the
          joke... believe me :D

          ...and then, turkish supplicated to be accepted in Europe :DD
          ahah

          Good joke

   34. Le jeudi, septembre 15 2011, 16:14 par Nick

               Engineer, Physicist, Mathematician (EPM) Jokes


Recurring Jokes

   These jokes are circulated by word-of-mouth around engineering,
   physics, amd math departments at universities and industries; Many are
   available on the web.
   The best of the genre work because readers of all 3 persuasions think
   they make out best.
   You'll find many variations of the following jokes out there.

  The &#147;Odd Primes&#148; joke

   Probably the most well known EPM joke of all. Here are 3 versions:

   A mathematician, a physicist and an engineer enter a mathematics
   contest, the first task of which is to prove that all odd number are
   prime. The mathematician has an elegant argument: `1's a prime, 3's a
   prime, 5's a prime, 7's a prime. Therefore, by mathematical induction,
   all odd numbers are prime. It's the physicist's turn: `1's a prime, 3's
   a prime, 5's a prime, 7's a prime, 11's a prime, 13's a prime, so, to
   within experimental error, all odd numbers are prime.' The most
   straightforward proof is provided by the engineer: `1's a prime, 3's a
   prime, 5's a prime, 7's a prime, 9's a prime, 11's a prime ...'.

   How a mathematician, physicist and an engineer prove that all odd
   numbers, (greater than 2), are prime.
   Mathematician: "Well, 3 is prime, 5 is prime and 7 is prime so, by
   induction all odds are prime."
   Physicist: "3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 isn't prime, (bad
   data point), 11 is prime, and so is 13, so all odds are prime."
   Engineer: "3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 is prime, 11 is prime
   13 is prime, so all odds are prime."

   A mathematician, physicist and an engineer are asked whether all odd
   numbers, (greater than 2), are prime. Their responses:
   Mathematician: "Let's see, 3 is prime, 5 is prime and 7 is prime, but 9
   is a counter-example so the statement is false"
   Physicist: "OK, 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 isn't prime, 11
   is prime, and so is 13, so all odds are prime to within experimental
   uncertainty."
   Engineer: "3 is prime, 5 is prime, so all odds are prime."

   Some more variations on the &#147;Odd Primes&#148; joke:

   Several professors were asked to solve the following problem: "Prove
   that all odd integers are prime."
   Mathematician: 3 is a prime, 5 is a prime, 7 is a prime, 9 is not a
   prime - counter-example - claim is false.
   Physicist: 3 is a prime, 5 is a prime, 7 is a prime, 9 is an
   experimental error, 11 is a prime ...
   Engineer: 3 is a prime, 5 is a prime, 7 is a prime, 9 is a prime, 11 is
   a prime ...
   Computer Scientist: 3's a prime, 5's a prime, 7's a prime ...
   segmentation fault
   Lawyers: one is prime, three is prime, five is prime, seven is prime,
   although there appears to be prima facie evidence that nine is not
   prime, there exists substantial precedent to indicate that nine should
   be considered prime. The following brief presents the case for nine's
   primeness...
   Liberals: The fact that nine is not prime indicates a deprived cultural
   environment which can only be remedied by a federally funded cultural
   enrichment program.
   Computer programmers: one is prime, three is prime, five is prime, five
   is prime, five is prime, five is prime five is prime, five is prime,
   five is prime...
   Professor: 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, and the rest are left as
   an exercise for the student.
   Linguist: 3 is an odd prime, 5 is an odd prime, 7 is an odd prime, 9 is
   a very odd prime,...
   Computer Scientist: 10 prime, 11 prime, 101 prime...
   Chemist: 1 prime, 3 prime, 5 prime... hey, let's publish!
   New Yorker: 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 is... NONE OF YOUR
   DAMN BUSINESS!
   Programmer: 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 will be fixed in the
   next release,...

   Salesperson: 3 is a prime, 5 is a prime, 7 is a prime, 9 -- let me make
   you a deal...
   Advertiser: 3 is a prime, 5 is a prime, 7 is a prime, 11 is a prime,...
   Accountant: 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 is prime, deducting
   10% tax and 5% other obligations.
   Statistician: Let's try several randomly chosen numbers: 17 is a prime,
   23 is a prime, 11 is a prime... Looks good to me.
   Psychologist: 3 is a prime, 5 is a prime, 7 is a prime, 9 is a prime
   but tries to suppress it...


  The &#147;Canned Food&#148; joke:

   There was a mad scientist (a mad SOCIAL scientist) who kidnapped three
   colleagues, an engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician, and locked
   each of them in separate cells with plenty of canned food and water but
   no can opener.
   A month later, returning, the mad scientist went to the engineer's cell
   and found it long empty. The engineer had constructed a can opener from
   pocket trash, used aluminum shavings and dried sugar to make an
   explosive,and escaped.
   The physicist had worked out the angle necessary to knock the lids off
   the tin cans by throwing them against the wall. She was developing a
   good pitching arm and a new quantum theory.
   The mathematician had stacked the unopened cans into a surprising
   solution to the kissing problem; his desicated corpse was propped
   calmly against a wall, and this was inscribed on the floor in blood:
       THEOREM: If I can't open these cans, I'll die.
       PROOF: Assume the opposite ...

   Similarly for chemist, engineer, mathematician:
   The chemist had collected rainwater to corrode the cans of beans so he
   could eat them.
   The engineer had taken apart her bed and made a crude can opener out of
   the parts.
   The mathematician was slouched on the floor, long since dead. Written
   in blood beside the corpse read the following:
      Theorem: If I don't eat the beans I will die.
      Proof: Assume the opposite and seek a contradiction.


  The &#147;Calculation&#148; jokes

   A variant: three professionals, a mathematician, a physicist and an
   engineer, took their final test for the job. The sole question in the
   exam was "how much is one plus one".
   The math dude asked the receptionist for a ream of paper, two hours
   later, he said: I have proven its a natural number
   The physicist, after checking parallax error and quantum tables said:
   its between 1.9999999999, and 2.0000000001
   the engineer quicly said: oh! its easy! its two,.... no, better make it
   three, just to be safe.

   A physicist, an engineer and a mathematician were asked how much three
   times three is.
   The engineer grabbed his pocket calculator, eagerly pressed a couple of
   buttons and announced: "9.0000".
   The physicist made an approximation (with an error estimate) and said:
   "9.00 +/- 0.02".
   The mathematician took a piece of paper and a pencil and sat quietly
   for half an hour. He then returned and proudly declared: There is a
   solution and I have proved that it is unique!

   Mathematician: Pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its
   diameter.
   Engineer: Pi is about 22/7.
   Physicist: Pi is 3.14159 plus or minus 0.000005
   Computer Programmer: Pi is 3.141592653589 in double precision.
   Nutritionist: You one track math-minded fellows, Pie is a healthy and
   delicious dessert!


  The &#147;Fire!&#148; joke

   A physicist, an engineer and a mathematician were all in a hotel
   sleeping when a fire broke out in their respective rooms.
   The physicist woke up, saw the fire, ran over to her desk, pulled out
   her CRC, and began working out all sorts of fluid dynamics equations.
   After a couple minutes, she threw down her pencil, got a graduated
   cylinder out of his suitcase, and measured out a precise amount of
   water. She threw it on the fire, extinguishing it, with not a drop
   wasted, and went back to sleep.
   The engineer woke up, saw the fire, ran into the bathroom, turned on
   the faucets full-blast, flooding out the entire apartment, which put
   out the fire, and went back to sleep. The mathematician woke up, saw
   the fire, ran over to his desk, began working through theorems, lemmas,
   hypotheses , you-name-it, and after a few minutes, put down his pencil
   triumphantly and exclaimed, "I have *proven* that I *can* put the fire
   out!" He then went back to sleep.

   Three employees (an engineer, a physicist and a mathematician) are
   staying in a hotel while attending a technical seminar.
   The engineer wakes up and smells smoke. He goes out into the hallway
   and sees a fire, so he fills a trashcan from his room with water and
   douses the fire. He goes back to bed.
   Later, the physicist wakes up and smells smoke. He opens his door and
   sees a fire in the hallway. He walks down the hall to a fire hose and
   after calculating the flame velocity, distance, water pressure,
   trajectory, etc. extinguishes the fire with the minimum amount of water
   and energy needed.
   Later, the mathematician wakes up and smells smoke. She goes to the
   hall, sees the fire and then the fire hose. She thinks for a moment and
   then exclaims, 'Ah, a solution exists!' and then goes back to bed.

   A physicist and a mathematician are in the faculty lounge having a cup
   of coffee when, for no apparent reason, the coffee machine bursts into
   flames. The physicist rushes over to the wall, grabs a fire
   extinguisher, and fights the fire successfully. The same time next
   week, the same pair are there drinking coffee and talking shop when the
   new coffee machine goes on fire. The mathematician stands up, fetches
   the fire extinguisher, and hands it to the physicist, thereby reducing
   the problem to one already solved...


  The &#147;Zeno's Paradox&#148; joke

   In the high school gym, all the girls in the class were lined up
   against one wall, and all the boys against the opposite wall. Then,
   every ten seconds, they walked toward each other until they were half
   the previous distance apart. A mathematician, a physicist, and an
   engineer were asked, "When will the girls and boys meet?"
   The mathematician said: "Never."
   The physicist said: "In an infinite amount of time."
   The engineer said: "Well... in about two minutes, they'll be close
   enough for all practical purposes."


  The &#147;Herding Sheep&#148; joke

   An engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician are shown a pasture with
   a herd of sheep, and told to put them inside the smallest possible
   amount of fence. The engineer is first. He herds the sheep into a
   circle and then puts the fence around them, declaring, "A circle will
   use the least fence for a given area, so this is the best solution."
   The physicist is next. She creates a circular fence of infinite radius
   around the sheep, and then draws the fence tight around the herd,
   declaring, "This will give the smallest circular fence around the
   herd." The mathematician is last. After giving the problem a little
   thought, he puts a small fence around himself and then declares, "I
   define myself to be on the outside!"


  The &#147;Black Sheep&#148; joke

   An astronomer, a physicist and a mathematician (it is said) were
   holidaying in Scotland. Glancing from a train window, they observed a
   black sheep in the middle of a field.
   "How interesting," observed the astronomer, "all scottish sheep are
   black!"
   To which the physicist responded, "No, no! Some Scottish sheep are
   black!"
   The mathematician gazed heavenward in supplication, and then intoned,
   "In Scotland there exists at least one field, containing at least one
   sheep, at least one side of which is black."


  The &#147;Metajoke&#148;

   An engineer, a physicist and a mathematician find themselves in an
   anecdote, indeed an anecdote quite similar to many that you have no
   doubt already heard. After some observations and rough calculations the
   engineer realizes the situation and starts laughing. A few minutes
   later the physicist understands too and chuckles to herself happily as
   she now has enough experimental evidence to publish a paper. This
   leaves the mathematician somewhat perplexed, as he had observed right
   away that he was the subject of an anecdote, and deduced quite rapidly
   the presence of humour from similar anecdotes, but considers this
   anecdote to be too trivial a corollary to be significant, let alone
   funny.


Miscellaneous Single Jokes

   These jokes don't seem as common or varied, but still get the point(s)
   across.

   What is the difference between and engineer, a physicist, and a
   mathimatician?
   An engineer believes equations approximate the world.
   A physicist believes the world approximates equations.
   A mathematician sees no connection between the two.

   The three umpires at an amateur baseball game, an engineer, a physicist
   and a mathematician during the week, all call a player out on what
   could only be described as a close call. The coach of the player who
   thought he'd made the base asked the umpires why they'd called his
   player out.
   The engineer replied ``He's out 'cause I called it as it was.''
   The physicist replied ``He's out 'cause I called it like I saw it.''
   The mathematician replied ``He's out 'cause I called him out.''

   A farmer, an engineer, and a physicist were all asked to build a
   chicken coop. The farmer says, "Well, last time I had so many chickens
   and my coop was so and so big and this time I have this many chickens
   so I'll make it this much bigger and that oughtta work just fine." The
   engineer tackles the problem by surverying, costing materials, reading
   up on chickens and their needs, writing down a bunch of equations to
   maximise chicken-to-cost ratio, taking into account the lay of the land
   and writing a computer program to solve. The physicist looks at the
   problem and says, "Let's start by assuming spherical chickens....".

   A mathematician, a biologist and a physicist are sitting in a street
   cafe watching people going in and coming out of the house on the other
   side of the street. First they see two people going into the house.
   Time passes. After a while they notice three persons coming out of the
   house.
   The physicist: "One of the two measurements wasn't very accurate."
   The biologist: "They have reproduced".
   The mathematician: "If now exactly one person enters the house then it
   will be empty again."

   A physicist, an engineer, and a statistician were out game hunting. The
   engineer spied a bear in the distance, so they got a little closer.
   "Let me take the first shot!" said the engineer, who missed the bear by
   three metres to the left. "You're incompetent! Let me try" insisted the
   physicist, who then proceeded to miss by three metres to the right.
   "Ooh, we *got* him!!" said the statistician.

   A physicist and an engineer are in a hot-air balloon. They've been
   drifting for hours, and have no idea where they are. They see another
   person in a balloon, and call out to her: "Hey, where are we?" She
   replies, "You're in a balloon," and drifts off again. The engineer says
   to the physicist, "That person was obviously a mathematician." They
   physicist replies, "How do you know that?" "Because what she said was
   completely true, but utterly useless."

   A mathematician, a physicist and an engineer are each given $50 to
   measure the height of a building.
   The mathematician buys a ruler and a sextant, and by determining the
   angle subtended by the building a certain distance away from the base,
   he establishes the height of the building.
   The physicist buys a heavy ball and a stopwatch, climbs to the top of
   the building and drops the ball. By measuring the time it takes to hit
   the bottom, he establishes the height of the building.
   The engineer puts $40 into his pocket. By slipping the doorman the
   other ten, he establishes the height of the building.

                        Freud, Sigmund
                        The Joke and Its Relation to the Unconscious
     __________________________________________________________________

   Keywords Communication, Doctor-Patient Relationship, History of

   Summary The book is split into three parts, the Analytic Part, the
   Synthetic Part and the Theoretical Part. The Analytic Part begins with
   an excellent synopsis of earlier theories of comedy, joking and wit,
   followed by a meticulous psychological taxonomy of jokes based on such
   features as wordplay, brevity, and double meanings, richly illustrated
   with examples. This section ends with Freud's famous distinction about
   the "tendencies" of a joke, in which he attempts to separate those
   jokes that have tendencies towards hidden meanings or with a specific
   hidden or partly hidden purpose, from the "abstract" or
   "non-tendentious" jokes, which are completely innocuous. He struggles
   to provide any examples of the latter. In the midst of his first
   example, he suddenly admits that he begins "to doubt whether I am right
   in claiming that this is an un-tendentious joke"(89) and his next
   example is a joke that he claims is non-tendentious, but which he
   elsewhere studies quite intensely for its tendencies. Freud uses this
   to springboard into an exploration of how a joke involves an
   arrangement of people - a joketeller, an audience/listener, and a butt,
   often involving two (the jokester and the listener) against one, who is
   often a scapegoat. He describes how jokes may be sexual, "stripping"
   that person, and then turns towards how jokes package hostility or
   cynicism.
   The synthetic part is an attempt to bring together the structure of the
   joke and the pleasurable tendencies of the joke. Why is it that jokes
   are pleasurable? Freud's answer is that there is a pleasure to be
   obtained from the saving of psychic energy: dangerous feelings of
   hostility, aggression, cynicism or sexuality are expressed, bypassing
   the internal and external censors, and thus enjoyed. He considers other
   possible sources of pleasure, including recognition, remembering,
   appreciating topicality, relief from tension, and the pleasures of
   nonsense and of play. Then, in a move that would either baffle his
   critics or is ignored by them, Freud turns to jokes as a "social
   process", recognizing that jokes may
