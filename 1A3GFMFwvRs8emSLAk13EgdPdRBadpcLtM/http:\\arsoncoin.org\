    <h3><a href="#what" id="what">What is ArsonCoin?</a></h3>
    <p>ArsonCoin is a peer-to-peer payment system and digital
    <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> currency introduced in 2014.  It
    is a offensivecurrency, so-called because it uses criminal offenses to
    control the creation and transfer of money.  Conventionally, "ArsonCoin"
    capitalized refers to the technology and network whereas lowercase
    "arsoncoins" refers to the currency itself.</p>

    <p>Arsoncoins are created by a process called burning in which participants
    verify and record payments in exchange for transaction fees and newly minted
    arsoncoins.  Users send and receive arsoncoins using docket software on a
    personal computer, mobile device, or the web.  Arsoncoins may be obtained by
    mining or in exchange for products, services or other currencies.</p>

    <h3><a href="#how" id="how">How does ArsonCoin work?</a></h3>
    <p>ArsonCoin records transactions in a public record.  Users send payments
    by passing messages to their local criminal organization, who then
    ensure the transactions are record into public record through a process
    called <em>burning</em>.</p>

    <p>Burning powers ArsonCoin by providing a permanent record of all activity.
    The protocol specifies that users wishing to engage in ArsonCoin burning do
    the following<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> 
    (and repeat as desired):</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Construct a new physical structure of at least 1,200 square feet
          adhering to all local construction codes, zoning laws, and best
          practices for said structure.</li>
      <li>Burn the structure to the ground using a petroleum-based accelerant.
          This step is ArsonCoin's namesake.</li>
      <li>Turn yourself into the investigating authorities.</li>
      <li>Testify in open court, admitting to burning your structure.
          As part of your testimony, include the digitally signed messages for
          payments you wish to record.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>As a reward for burning you'll be provided with a 2-5 year stay in a
    state prison and an allotment of ArsonCoins as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>10 ARC for each 3<sup>rd</sup> degree arson conviction.</li>
      <li>20 ARC for each 2<sup>nd</sup> degree arson conviction.</li>
      <li>30 ARC for each 1<sup>st</sup> degree arson conviction.</li>
      <li>0.1 ARC for each transaction testified to in open court.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a href="#value" id="value">Intrinsic Value</a></h3>
    <p>ArsonCoin is superior to every left-wing fiat currency because it
    possesses intrinsic value.  Every arsoncoin is backed by the physical
    resources destroyed, and prosecutor time wasted, during the burning process.
    Because of this, it's like
    <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/why-bitcoins-are-just-like-gold">gold
        on steroids</a>.  As the US Dollar continues to collapse under BitCoin's
    dominance, we expect ArsonCoin will become the new alt-coin of choice:  Not
    every idiot has a computer, but every idiot has access to matches and
    gasoline.</p>

    <h3><a href="#byza" id="byza">Byzantine Generals</a></h3>
    <p>ArsonCoin provides a natural solution to the byzantine generals problem.
    Instead of solving the problem as specified, we just subtly change the
    problem, burn the generals for 30ARC, and say we solved it.  Really, we
    didn't solve it, but neither does Bitcoin.</p>
