<p><b>please build a haskell to perl compiler</b></p>
<p>The <a href="http://fay-lang.org/">Fay compiler</a> is a simple way to build fairly
comprehensible javascript code from Haskell source.</p>

<p>It occurs to me that it should be rather easy to modify Fay to emit perl
code rather than javascript. This would allow contributing things like
plugins to various perl programs, without writing perl.</p>

<p>Of course, the same idea could probably be used to compile Haskell to other
languages like python, but perl seems particularly well suited as a second
Fay target, since javascript and it have quite similar syntax and similar
support for features like closures which Fay relies on.</p>

<p>I do not have time to work on this idea myself. It would be a good project
for a beginning Haskell programmer. You probably don't even need to fully
understand monads to do it! Essentially, look at
<a href="https://github.com/faylang/fay/wiki/Generated-code">Fay output examples</a>,
translate them from javascript to perl, and then much of the code changes
in Fay would probably be in simple string generation code.</p>

<p><b>DIY crowdfunding and bitcoin</b></p>
<p>Well, my <a href="https://campaign.joeyh.name/">git-annex crowdfunding campaign</a> is
half way to its August 15th conclusion. So far it's raised more than five times
what I hoped it would. I wish I could say I'm like some canny NASA engineer
who intentionally sets low expectations for their Mars rover, but in
both the previous kickstarter and this campaign I've really had no idea how
far it'd go. I'm glad that I'll be working on
<a href="https://git-annex.branchable.com/">git-annex</a> for another year.</p>

<p>I was particularly unsure if it'd be successful to move off Kickstarter.
During the git-annex assistant Kickstarter campaign, I saw many small
contributions from people who learned of it due to it being a successfully
funded project, a staff pick, etc. Losing that easy network effect is a
gamble.</p>

<p>So far I've had only half the number of contributors that I got on
Kickstarter. I've basically missed out entirely on the $5 level casual
contributors. On the other hand, my backers have generally been more
generous (and some have been <em>exceedingly</em> generous). And I've avoided
rewards that will cost much money, so I may end up in the same ballpark
funding level in the end!</p>

<p>Incidentially, I'm really enjoying getting in
touch to let people know when
<a href="http://source.git-annex.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=commitdiff;h=ebd778c519376d78b2e2e98c97c13e4cbe1748c0">I</a>

There's still time to <a href="https://campaign.joeyh.name/">sponsor one of your own</a> ;)</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>

<p>I also was curious to experiment with Bitcoin in this campaign.
Partly because Paypal isn't available everywhere internationally, and takes
really obnoxious percentages of transactions (though probably not as bad
as Kickstarter taking its percentage followed by Amazon payments taking its
percentage..) and partly because there seem to be interesting possibilities for
supporting free software with Bitcoin. (Especially if any of the
microtransactions on top of Bitcoin take off.)</p>

<p>So far 5% of backers have used Bitcoin. It's been quite strange to actually
have significant amounts of bitcoins in my wallet.
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg781/i_am_matt_mullenweg_cofounder_of_wordpress_18_of/cbeev5a">Wordpress</a>
has had 94 bitcoin payments over 9 months since starting accepting them.
I've had 47 payments in the two weeks my campaign has run so far. Wow!</p>

<p>Most of the bitcoin payments have come in via Coinbase (a few people have
found my <a href="bitcoin:1F5Dke8Wd3Y92EAwiv1LSoT9hDDnqGYdR4">direct
payment address</a>), but of those very few were using bitcoin purchased on
Coinbase. Most are probably transfers of bitcoin they already had, or
perhaps bitcoin purchased on other sites.</p>

<p>The one technical issue I've had with using bitcoin is that Coinbase
has not provided details about who sent most of the donations. Probably
some of them are intentionally anonymous, but I suspect Coinbase's interface
to claim incoming bitcoin transactions failed for some of them.
(If you donated bitcoin and want to actually get a reward, please email me.)</p>

<p>By the way, I'm converting most of the bitcoins back to USD pretty quickly.
I'm not interested in speculating on currency exchange rates with money
that has been donated so I can accomplish a particular task..</p>

<h2>DIY</h2>

<p>I put up the <a href="https://campaign.joeyh.name/">campaign website</a> without any
means in place to handle updating it. This is because I never automate
anything until I've done it at least 10 times by hand. ;) After the first
trickle of donations became a flood, I quickly realized I needed at least
something to handle keeping the numbers straight.</p>

<p>What I whipped up in an hour of coding is a system where I enter incoming
payments into a <a href="http://hledger.org/">hledger</a> file and a small haskell
program parses that and writes out various files that are included into the
website. Amusingly the percentage calculation and display code was copied
from git-annex, so part of git-annex is helping run its own fundraising
campaign. The campaign video is itself hosted in a public git-annex
repository, come to think of it.</p>

<p>The rest of the site is built using ikiwiki. Given that it's hosted at
Branchable, this is a high level of dogfooding and DIY. There are certianly
better crowdfunding platforms, but all I miss in this one is automated
transaction entry. And I have total flexability, double entry accounting,
and a powerful static website generator that handled being on the top of
Hacker News without a sweat. Oh, and some money. What's not to like?</p><p class="syndicated"><a href="http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/DIY_crowdfunding_and_bitcoin/">Syndicated 2013-08-02 06:22:09  from see shy jo</a></p></div>

<p><b>git-annex as a podcatcher</b></p>
<p>As a Sunday diversion, I wrote
<a href="http://source.git-annex.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=blob;f=Command/ImportFeed.hs">150 lines of code</a>
and turned git-annex into a podcatcher!</p>

<p>I've been using hpodder, a podcatcher written in Haskell. But John Goerzen
hasn't had time to maintain it, and it fell out of Debian a while ago.
John suggested I maintain it, but I have not found the time, and it'd be
another mass of code for me to learn and worry about.</p>

<p>Also, hpodder has some misfeatures common to the "podcatcher" genre:</p>

<ul><li>It has some kind of database of feeds and what files have been downloaded
from them. And this requires an interface around adding feeds, removing
feeds, changing urls, etc.</li>
<li>Due to it using a database, there's no particularly good way to run it on
the same feeds on multiple computers and sync the results in some way.</li>
<li>It doesn't use <code>git annex addurl</code> to register the url where a file came
from, so when I check files in with git-annex after the fact they're
missing that useful metadata and I can't just <code>git annex get</code> them
to re-download them from the podcast.</li>
</ul><p>So, here's a <a href="http://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/downloading_podcasts/">rethink of the podcatcher genre</a>:</p>

<pre>
  <code>cd annex; git annex importfeed http://url/to/podcast http://another/podcast
</code>
</pre>

<p>There is no database of feeds at all. Although of course you can check a
list of them right into the same git repository, next to the files it adds.
git-annex already keeps track of urls associated with content, so it reuses
that to know which urls it's already downloaded. So when you're done with a
podcast file and delete it, it won't download it again.</p>

<p>This is a podcatcher that doesn't need to actually download podcast files!
With <code>--fast</code>, it only records the existence of files in git,
so <code>git annex get</code> will download them from the web (or perhaps from
a nearer location that git-annex knows about).</p>

<p>Took just 3 hours to write, and that's including full control over
the filenames it uses (<code>--template='${feedtitle)/${itemtitle}${extension}'</code>),
and automatic resuming of interrupted downloads. Most of what I needed
was already available in git-annex's utility libraries or Hackage.</p>

<p>Technically, the only part of this that was hard <em>at all</em> was efficiently
querying the git repository for a list of all known urls. I found a
pretty fast way to do it, but might add a local cache file later on.</p><p class="syndicated"><a href="http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/git-annex_as_a_podcatcher/">Syndicated 2013-07-28 21:03:02  from see shy jo</a></p></div>

<p><b>guesting on GitMinutes</b></p>
<p>Last Friday, I spent and hour and a half clamping a landline phone to the
side of my head, while also wearing a headset. I was recording an interview
on the <a href="http://www.gitminutes.com/">GitMinutes podcast</a> about git-annex.</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://joeyh.name/blog/./pics/2mics.jpg">
    <img src="http://joeyh.name/blog/./entry/guesting_on_GitMinutes/400x-2mics.jpg" width="400" height="404" class="img"/></a>
</p>

<p>I've been listening to GitMinutes for a while, ever since I heard git-annex
was mentioned on it. Actually, I think it's come up in 4 or 5 interviews on
the podcast. Most notably with core git dev Peff King, who had some
interesting things to say, for sure. I responded to that in my
interview, and we covered quite a wide amount of stuff in reasonable depth
in just over an hour. Thomas is quite a good host and great at drawing
stuff out, and it's nice to not need to worry about going into too much
technical depth. (Although I didn't get a chance to explain the automatic
union merging used to maintain the <code>git-annex</code> branch.)</p>

<p>This is the first podcast I've been in, and I've always worried about audio
quality if I was in one. That is, I'd want it to be really good, and
probably end up annoying the host. ;) For this one, we settled on using my
land line call, which went through some Skype thing to get the Europe, and
mixing in a local recording I made with a not too great headset. I think
the result is pretty good, considering.</p>

<p>You can listen to the whole thing here, if you dare! (1 hour 8 minutes)

Initial goal reached in a mere seven hours. I will be developing git-annex
fulltime for at least the next three months! Gone to stretch goal.</p>

<p><b>New git-annex crowdfunding campaign</b></p>
<p>Having reached the end of my Kickstarter funded year working on the
git-annex assistant, I've decided to try one more crowdfunding campaign, to
see if I can get funded to work on it a little while longer. I went back
and forth on this for a while. The Kickstarter funded development was
extremely successful (one of the most productive years of my life). I
certianly want to work on git-annex more, and have lots more stuff to do,
particularly around security and encryption. On the other hand,
it's hard to frame ongoing development as a normal Kickstarter campaign
to start something new.</p>

<p>Anyway, I've decided to go ahead and try it, and not do it through
Kickstarter this time. So I have my own website set up and accepting
donations, and hopefully I'll make enough to spend a few more months
working on git-annex.</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://campaign.joeyh.name/">campaign.joeyh.name</a>
</p>

<p>... And if not, I'll probably spend a few months working on git-annex part
time, while looking for paying work with the rest of my time.</p>

<p>By the way, I'm taking payments in both US Dollars (via Paypal) and Bitcoin
(via Coinbase). Can't wait to see how this works out!</p><p class="syndicated"><a href="http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/New_git-annex_crowdfunding_campaign/">Syndicated 2013-07-14 23:50:43  from see shy jo</a></p></div>

<p><b>git annex and my mom</b></p>
<p>[I'm encouraging <a href="http://git-annex.branchable.com/">git-annex</a> users to
<a href="http://git-annex.branchable.com/design/assistant/blog/day_288__success_stories/">post their success stories</a>,
and this one is my own.]</p>

<p>I set up git-annex on my mom's and sisters' computers a couple of months
ago. I noticed this was the first software I've written that I didn't
have to really explain how to use. All I told them was, put files in this
folder, and the rest of us will be able to see them. Don't put anything too big
in there, or anything you don't want others to see.</p>

<p>I paired the computers using XMPP, and set up an encrypted transfer repository
using a free account rsync.net gave me for beta testing. I also added a
repository on my server, which made things more robust. (XMPP has
since improved, but it's still a good idea to have a git repository to
suppliment XMPP.) I also have two removable drives that are used to back up
our files.</p>

<p>This was all set up using the webapp. And adding a computer takes just a couple
of minutes that way. I set it up at my sister's in a spare moment during
a visit, and it all just worked.</p>

<p>Our shared git annex contains a couple of hundred files, and is a couple of
gigabytes in size. And growing pretty fast as we find things we want to share.
Mostly photos and videos so far but I won't be surprised to find poems and
books pop up in there from the family's poets and authors. And
it'll grow further as I add people who've so far been left out.</p>

<p>Coming home from a week at the beach with my grand nephew and niece,
was the first time I really used git-annex without thinking about it.
Collapsed on a hotel bed, I plugged in my camera and loaded in the trip's
photos. Only to see the hotel wifi cost extra. Urk, no! Later, in the lobby,
I found an open wifi network, and watched it automatically sync up.</p>
