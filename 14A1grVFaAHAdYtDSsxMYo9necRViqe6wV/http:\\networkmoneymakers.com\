Posted by David Newman on April 8th, 2014 It seems a long time ago that Bitbillions began with little fanfare and struggled in it’s quest to build up a solid foundation of Founder memberships. Although the struggle as never truely abated GBBG Bitbillions is in a very solid position as it approaches 100,000 members. It should achieve the milestone near the end of April or in the first half of May 2014. This is a very significant milestone that should not be taken lightly. Although the majority of members are free, there is currently 7,500 paid memberships and over 1,200 paying members on the earning sources.
What does this mean for GBBG Bitbillions?
Well first and foremost it means they are moving toward their target of 6,715 Co-Founder positions. There is currently 2,679 co-founder positions left. Once they have sold the company will move into the Matrix Stage. This will be a very exciting time for members as it marks the beginning of monthly revenue sharing. This will be the payday for all the points members have been earning.
It was mentioned in my last post that GBBG Bitbillions made their 4th earning source Preservation of Wealth. GBBG is already making some income from this. They plan to make some marketing materials to help members with their recruiting methods. They have already designed some banners like the one below. There is also plans to specific webinars for Preservation of Wealth. The belief is that many members can begin to make some good money from this earning source alone. There is already members that have earned commissions even in this early stage.
Bitfeud, Mybitcoinrewards and Iwantacar all have continued to grow. Now with over 66,000 members in the earning sources traffic continues to grow. Recent advertising on the websites will mean incoming revenues will continue to grow as well. It is all looking very good for GBBG members.
So what is next for GBBG Bitbillions?
Development on 3rd party client software continues. It was hoped it would already be released but GBBG want to make sure they have the most secure developments available. They will not release something that will not make the company look good. SO they are making sure everything is perfect. When this software is released it will be branded as made by GBBG (not owned). This will send a message to all the non-believers that GBBG is a company to be taken notice of. They are here to stay and are going to make an impact.
Do not miss out on this opportunity. Co-Founder positions are selling and they will never again be offered once they are gone. So if you haven’t taken the plunge and joined yet do it now.

GBBG BitBillions Passes 70,000 Memberships
Posted by David Newman on March 3rd, 2014 As GBBG Bitbillions closes in on one year since first showing up online, milestones are being passed and growth continues to be consistant. At the time of writing the total GBBG membership is above 70,000 with activations on Mybitcoinrewards, Iwantacar and Bitfeud all pushing up well over 10,000
Co-founder positions recently passed the founder positions and is now over half way filled. This means it is now on the down hill run towards getting the matrix developed. Remember that once the co-founder positions are sold and the matrix is built, members will begin earning revenue share. Although it is likely that the amounts will begin small, they are likely to increase from that point forward. As more people realize that GBBG is a real company that s not going to scam them and will reward them for their efforts it is expected that membership growth will begin to rapidly increase speed.
Right now the key is selling the remaining co-founder positions. That is the milestone that will trigger the next phase of the business.
So what makes GBBG Bitbillions different from other programs? It may seem obvious but a compensation plan that does not overcompensate is a big part of it. The biggest problem with most programs is that they have compensation plans that are unsustainable. This is commonly what is known as a ponzi. With those sorts of compensation models the money coming in has to increase to sustain the money going out. When it doesn’t it crashes. GBBG Bitbillions is much different. It compensates based on actual revenue. If nothing comes in then nothing goes out. This is what is regarded as a sustainable compensation plan and can continue indefinitely.
The down side of a real compensation plan is members do not make unrealistic and quick returns. Why is that a bad thing? Well the funny thing about that is that it is not a bad thing, just that members see it as being bad. Too many people are looking for a quick buck with little to no effort to earn it. That is an unrealistic expectation but many people that have been led on by scams believe it is possible. So the reason a real compensation has a down side is that people want more. They see they will not earn big money quickly and do not join because of it.
The up side is obvious. Being sustainable members will earn for the long term instead of short term. An ongoing increasing income is achievable for those that build a business. Sure it will take longer to get to the stage of making the big bucks but when you do it will not suddenly disappear.
If you are after quick returns you will probably not get them here. If you are after a growing long term business then this is one to get involved with.

GBBG BitBillions Passes 20K Members
Posted by David Newman on November 18th, 2013 Some thought it would not get anywhere but GBBG Bitbillions has really made some remarkable progress in the last couple of months. The 20,000 member milestone was passed yesterday but it is co-founders that are really needed to move the company forward. Currently there is 321 co-founders with the matrix set to be set once all 6715 co founder positions are sold. Each position is $30 so that seems a long way off. Now that BitBillions has released earning sources and paid it’s first monthly referral commission payments there should be more faith in the company.
Big things are happening with the release of GBBG-Ware. This is the newest addition to the GBBG portfolio of websites. GBBG-Ware is a software development hub which will have a specialist area for bitcoin projects. Already it has secured it’s first contract worth tens of thousands of dollars. This one site may be a huge earner for the GBBG parent company and the members that will get revenue share.
Over 20 bitcoins ($8K USD) were paid out in commissions for the November commission payments. The top earner received over $3K of it. This is just the start with much bigger things coming and the revenue share has not yet begun.
If you have sat on the fence now is the time to have a serious look. GBBG is coming of age and the future looks very bright.

BitBillions – How to Earn with it
Posted by David Newman on October 22nd, 2013 There seems to be some confusion as to how to earn and who earns with BitBillions.
Here is how it all works:
Commissions Commissions will be distributed on 15th of each month with the first starting in November 2013. This will include all commissions from all programs owned by GBBG. Currently that is BitBillions, BitFeud, My Bitcoin Rewards and I Want A Car websites. Because the matrix will not be implemented until all of the co-founder positions are taken, the matrix pool commissions will accumulate until then. The commissions for the parent site GBBG Bitbillions are split up into 6 pools. They are the Upgrade Comp Pool, Founders Pool, Co-Founders Pool, Members Pool, Matrix Pool and Direct Ref Pool. A description of each follows further down in the post.
Transparency Page
The amounts available for distribution are on the transparency page of each site. The Bitbillions transparency page lists all the revenue share amounts. The individual earning centers like BitFeud, My Bitcoin Rewards and the I Want a Car websites have the amounts applicable to their programs. It also includes the accounting method which is a breakdown of how all the money is distributed.
Commission Pools
All commissions are paid in bitcoin so it is important that you have your bitcoin wallet details filled in your account area. If you don’t you will not be able to receive your commissions.
Upgrade Comp Pool
The upgrade Comp Pool is basically a referral commission pool. If you have anyone that joins or upgrades to a co-founder position you will earn $12 worth of bitcoin for each one. You could also upgrade a position under you and get the commission effectively giving you a big discount on your position. The commission that you have earned is shown on the Earnings – Referral Upgrades Tab in your member area.
Founders Pool – 10% revenue share
Founder members will earn their share in proportion with the number of points they have generated from the projects. That means that if a Founder or any other member does not participate and earn any points then they WILL NOT earn anything from the Founder Pool, the Co-Founder pool or the Members pool. That is why it is important to participate.
Example: If there is 100,000 points and there is $1000 to distribute each point would be worth $0.01. Likewise if there was $1 million to distribute each point would be worth $10. So the more points you generate the bigger your part of the share you will receive.
Co-Founders Pool – 10% revenue share
The co-founders pool works in the same way as the founders pool. Founders and co-founders both share in this pool.
Members Pool – 30% revenue share
The members pool works in the same way as the Founders and co-founders pool except all members that have generated points share in proportion to the points they have generated.
Matrix Pool
The matrix pool, when implemented, will pay members the equivalent of 7% of each of the members in their matrix earnings. That means if someone in your matix earns $100, you would earn $7. This commission is not dependant on you earning points, so members that have built up a downline could earn without participating in the programs, making it truely passive.
Example: A full matrix is 3,279 members so this could be hugely profitable. For example with a full matrix if each member on average earned $10 then you would get 7% of $32,790 which is $2295 a month.
Direct Referral Pool
The direct referral pool enables you to earn even if the member sponsored is outside your matrix. You will earn an additional 7% of what that member earned, similar to the Matrix Pool.
Example: You have 10 referrals that earned on average $10 each (total $100). You would earn $7 in Direct Referral Pool.
Note:
The matrix will not be built until all the co-founder positions are taken. Bcause of that the bitcoin accumulated for distribution will continue to accumulate until such time as the matrix is set. It is the only commission that will be delayed.
Another important thing to remember is to join the earning centers, even if just as a free member so you can earn points. The more points you get, the more revenue share you will get.

BitBillions is the Real Thing
Posted by David Newman on October 6th, 2013 When GBBG Bitbillions began there was a lot of questions that sprung up. Mainly due to the secretive nature it portrayed. There were skeptics saying it would disappear within a month. Others were saying there would never be anything more than the site itself, no development would be made. This did not help with promotion and growth was slow.
The original goal was to have 50,000 founder members in the first few months, that didn’t happen. Persistance and some special offers later ensued before Founder positions were closed off to further purchase. So with 3285 Founder members you can no longer get one…unless you buy a position from someone that has one already. This is something that will be possible in future as BitBillions plans to make a marketpace for members to be able to sell their positions if they so choose.
While all this was happening there was talk about upcoming revenue producing projects. Roll the clock forward a couple of months to where we are now. Bitbillions has now released the Dream Car Project. This is a site where participants can win a car. There is several levels members can be involved at ranging from free to $9 a month. The various levels allow members a greater chance to earn entries. The significance of now having a revenue producing project should not be underestimated. Although at this stage there is not a huge following, it is a start and gives credibility to the whole concept.
Now with things starting to move, those that got involved early need to get motivated to promote. The site has proven it is for real but now needs the growth to fulfill its potential. GBBG Bitbillions has now released co-founder positions for $30 each. These positions will entitle their owners to share in revenue for the 2nd pool of 10% of company revenue in addition to the main revenue share. The first 10% is for Founders only who also share in all other pools.
The matrix is going to be released once the co-founder positions are filled. Right now at time of writing there is 6685 co-founder positions to fill. This is a key figure, once it is fulfilled there will not be any more made available…ever.
Why would you bother getting a co-founder position? Is it a risk? Will it be worthwhile? These are questions people are asking and here are the answers as I see them.
The co-founder positions will give you exclusive revenue share additional to what free GBBG members will get. Over time this could end up becoming substantial. Because you will not be able to get more positions in the future you only have this one opportunity to get them. This will mean that with success the positions will become quite valuable.
Co-Founder positions will be placed before free positions into the matrix. This means more revenue from the matrix commissions.
What is the downside? Well it costs $30…It is a one time cost so really that is not much of a downside for something that may be worth a whole lot more in the future.
Is it worth it…simple answer YES.
Get your co-founder position while you can

Tagvillage Ressurection
Posted by David Newman on July 11th, 2013 Have you seen the rise in activity regarding tagvillage? Did you think they would ever release the Ad Platform? Did you think they were dead and burried? Well guess what…tagvillage is about to push the Ad Platform out of demo mode and start making some money. tagvillage is back!
Many people wrote tagvillage off months ago but now it is starting to gain momentum. It started facing problems in the middle of 2012 when they were hit with a very well organised fraud setup. This effectively stole all of tagvillages money. Despite this tagvillage continued to develop the site at a reduced pace, in the words of tagvillage CEO David Ruebush
We used to have 12 full time developers and a support staff as well. When 100% of our money was stolen from all of us (members included), it really hurt. We had to scale back operations dramatically. We survived though. Development and testing takes a TON of time when you go from 12 programmers down to 1. Bug fixing is even harder.
Another part that suffered from losing the money was marketing. Once again the CEO commented on facebook about it
When tagvillage had a full budget and bank account, we had an aggressive marketing plan. When 100% of our money was stolen from us, we had to make changes. Our marketing plan right now is for me to personally call and work with publishers and advertisers. As we grow, we will set aside funds for marketing and advertising. We are doing what we can with what we have. It is going to be slow and small at first. But we will take each step one at a time.
2013 Tagvillage Recovers
A lot has changed in 2013. Plans have been set but had to be adjusted. Deadlines have not been met but still tagvillage has survived. Not only has it survived it has now made it to the stage that the Ad Platform is ready. Right now it is in a final week of demo mode. What that means is that it is live on the site but money is not being taken from advertisers and commissions are not being paid to publishers and tag traders yet. Once it moves out of demo mode things should progressively get better.
The biggest issue the members have had is withdrawals. In October withdrawals were stopped due to the money that was stolen. It was hoped that they would be able to resume as soon as possible. Unfortunately with less trading leading to less money coming in, the delay in the Ad Platform being finished and lack of any capital coming in, tagvillage had to leave withdrawals closed.
With pressure on there was every chance that tagvillage would fold. There was one good thing that came out of the issues, new fraud detection systems that tagvillage developed. David Ruebush explained it like this;
I hope we can get trading back up where it used to be. I will do everything I can to gain your trust back in our little company. It was devastating when we realized all your money had been stolen from us. Most of our inside management and ownership actually pushed for us to file bankruptcy and shut down. I did not agree. I feel we owe it to our members to live through this. I know someone out there is holding all our member’s money. They are evil losers who stole our funds. However, they did not steal our passion. They did not take away our ability or our potential. We survived. We have a better system now. We can move forward. Yesterday, our system detected 2 fraudulent credit card charges at 5:01 AM. We froze the accounts immediately and began working to find the truth (was it theft or real). At 6:34 PM I personally spoke with a 22 year old college student in New York who was in tears. She couldn’t pay her rent or electricity bill because a loser somewhere in the world had stolen her identity and ripped off all her money from her bank. tagvillage detected it and reported it immediately to PayPal. Her bank was astonished when WE reported it to them BEFORE her. We got her refund to her immediately. Other businesses where the loser thief used her card may take up to 60 days to get her refunded. We had her money back to her in 12 hours. Our anti-theft system is amazing. We were forced to build this because some losers stole all our money (and yours) back in 2012 in a very complex fraud system. So, while they stole our money, they ignited a fire inside of me to overcome, win, and build a better system. Now, it is time to sell and get all our money back and bunches more!
So the question is now what happens? tagvillage have had to adjust plans trying to do the best for the members as well as ensuring that the company can continue to operate. To this end in January it was announced about the changes coming in April. Bonus Credits being introduced and the restart (see post here). This was necessary to do and actually returned a full amount of credits to members. Although this helped a lot it still did not solve the biggest issue, there was still more credits in the system with no money to back it up (due to the stolen money). This meant that there was no way to be able to implement withdrawals without seriously limiting them. A new plan was needed and the initial idea was to freeze members credits so that all new credits were able to be withdrawn. Some members that were made aware of this voiced that they would prefer to be able to use the credits to trade. It was found that this was a viable option and in August that is what will happen.
The big benefit for all members is that they will be able to withdraw, without limits, any regular credits they have. The way it will work as described by the CEO;
Your existing Credit balance will be converted into Trade-Only Credits on the 1st of August. Then, as we can afford to do so, we will convert them back to normal credits over time. It is the best solution we could come up with to get this system restarted and growing again. This allows tagvillage to be 100% payout ready for new members. It also allows tagvillage to be able to payout all advertising commissions for all members. In addition, it allows us to make full payouts to existing members when they sell their Tags to members who have regular credits. The money that you have in your account was stolen from you by the people that conducted a massive credit card theft on our company. So, the only way we can overcome this is to recoup it over time from operational profits. I truly wish I had some way to find the band of thieves that stole your money and recover it for you, but I cannot. The only thing I can do is to stay fully engaged and committed to working every day for you. I am calling on advertisers and publishers now every day. We are making some sales every day. It won’t be long before we are getting things moving forward better and better each day. Then, we will make your accounts whole again. I assure you I will work tirelessly until we overcome this. A band of thieves stole your money from you in a very complex credit card fraud ring. Even though they did much harm to you, I will work tirelessly to make your tagvillage investment whole and profitable. I promise you that.
Can tagvillage really get Publishers and Advertisers?
That is going to determine the success or failure. The Ad Platform is a great product, although it does not have all the great features yet, and it will be attractive to both Publishers and Advertisers. The key will be marketing it to get them joining so revenue can grow. This will in turn mean that the tag traders have trading credits converted to regular credits faster which they can withdraw. Marketing is the key.
We need funds. We had our entire financial situation destroyed last year with the credit card theft. So, we are rebuilding. However, I will tell you we are already gaining publishers and advertisers. And, we have several waiting in the wings as soon as we pull out of demo mode. There are just a few glitches left in the system which we expect to resolve this week. Then, it is 100% sell sell sell. I actually have come up with a good way to contact publishers and advertisers. I have been using it now for a few weeks and it works well. I plan to host a webinar soon and show TagTraders how they can get publishers and advertisers to join and target their Tags…
Along with withdrawals there has been news about the Millionaire Club and Founders Profit Pool. Although both will not begin in the short term they are still there and will provide members that took part with rewards that they deserve.
This is probably the best time for people to join tagvillage. The bad times have passed and now the future looks bright. There is still work to be done and it will not be super fast growth. Instead it should be expected to start slow and gradually build up. Members should take advantage of the opportunities they are presented with. Now is the time you should check out tagvillage again.

Tagvillage CEO Interview
Posted by David Newman on June 13th, 2013 I recently conducted an interview with Tagvillage CEO David Ruebush. We went through a lot of questions that members wanted answers to. Questions related to withdrawals, the Ad Platform, the website, Millionaires Club, Founders Profit Pool, Partnerships and more. A lot of great info came out of the interview with all the questions being answered in a full and meaningful way. All members should listen to the interview as it will give you a lot of information about what has been happening over the last few months and what will happen over the next few.
I also have a MP3 version for people that cannot view the video
Overall despite a lot of setbacks Tagvillage has come through and is closer than ever to delivering the Ad Platform. Once it does it will be a big change to everything, progress, capital, revenue. There is a lot to look forward to and members should be reinvigorated after listening to the interview.
Share this page with your members so they can listen to the interview as well.

BitBillions Special Offer
Posted by David Newman on May 29th, 2013 BitBillions is still in early days with just over a month till the official launch. Since the prelaunch began Bitbillions set Founder positions to be priced at the rate of 1 bitcoin value. In turn bitcoin enjoyed a rapid rise in value. this made the cost of Bitbillions Founder positions less affordable for many. A promotion selling founder memberships at 1/2 BTC followed then later the Founder positions were set at a price equivalent to $50.
Although the founder positions have been selling every day it appears to be slow growth and probably not as much as they would like. Right now there is a special promotion letting you get a founder position for just $30. This is the cheapest it has been available since bitcoins were valued that when prelaunch began.
In the last two days Bitbillions had webinars with insiders discussing the business. Unfortunately I was unavailable when they were on but I have heard there was some good discussion.
Why should you get a Bitbillions Founder position?
With so many opportunities out there it is easy to ask this question. Bitbillions is not yet proven as the revenue sharing does not begin till after the official launch in July. I am sure that many people will wait till then before deciding whether to take part or not, so is there any advantage to taking the plunge now. The simple answer is yes.
There is a couple of things to consider here. The most important is the way the compensation plan is structured. There is two main parts, the Monthly Revenue Share and the Monthly Matrix Bonus.
BitBillions Monthly Revenue Share The revenue share is made up of 6 pools depending on where your position is placed. The first 5,000 positions earn from all of the pools revenue share. Positions 5,001 to 25,000 will miss out on just the first pool. At this stage we wont worry about the other pools because these two pools are the ones currently filling.
The first 5,000 positions alone for the first pool share in 10% of the profits. Because of the way the pools are structured, increasing revenues would mean increasing revenue share for each position in all except the last pool. The positions in the pools will be determined taking into account when a member joined but placing Founder positions first.
This is very important! Founder positions will be placed in the matrix first when it is set in July. This means all Free and Reserve positions will be leap-frogged by Founder positions.
Right now if you get a Founder position you would jump ahead of more than 4700 non-founder positions! Most importantly you will be in the first revenue pool with a top 5000 position and that is not the only benefit.
BitBillions Monthly Matrix Bonus
Many programs are based on a matrix but I have never seen one that works like this one. Instead of earning from monthly fees or purchases you earn from company revenues based on 7% of what the positions under you on the matrix earned. I think this may confuse many but let me simplify it for you.
If you have 10 people in your matrix and they each earned $100 from the monthly revenue share you would earn 7% of (10 x 100) or 7% of 1000 which gives you a monthly Matrix Bonus of $70. There is going to be points given for people using the applications so not everyone will get the same revenue share.
Obviously if you have more people in your matrix that means more potential bonus for you. That is no different to any other program and because it is company forced matrix you may even get some members forced into your matrix. Especially when the matrix is set in July many Founder positions will have that happen. Like I mentioned right now a founder member jumps over 4700 non founders. All of those will be going under founders somewhere in the matrix.
So you have a choice, you can do nothing and watch, but miss out on getting a early position.
You can get a free position and be last placed in the matrix
You can get a reserve position and be placed in after founder positions
You can take advantage of the founder positions and guarantee yourself to be in all the revenue pools.

If you are interested in leading and managing GBBG, you may apply for membership in the Founders VIP Club. Membership is open to ALL Founder members. You will be required to submit an application along with an additional donation of a minimum of $250 (USD) in Bitcoins or equivalent value. You agree you are freely donating to the development and advancement of the organization and not expecting anything in return. Applicants may begin the process by sending an email to bitbillions@gmail.com with ‘Founders VIP Club Application’ in the body and your member ID number in the subject line.
Additional Note
Members of the Founders VIP Club will have direct access to the engineers and developers of our software. You will interact directly with them in design, development, testing, and other aspects. You do NOT need to be technically skilled, but we will hope to gather marketing and usefulness feedback from you. Members who display utmost trust and ability may also be asked to assist in day-to-day operations, such as processing incoming donations, referral rewards, etc. In addition, ONLY the members of the Founders VIP Club will meet and interact with the inside leaders and originators of GBBG.

BitBillions How to Sign Up
Posted by David Newman on March 3rd, 2013 BitBillions now has an improved process for signing members up. Previously people would have to email bitbillions before receiving a member ID. Now they get it with just the click of a button on the website. They then need to send an email in to apply for membership.
There is an Alert for members to take note of.
This is the ONLY time you will EVER receive this membership identification number and password! We NEVER re-issue or send this information to you by email. Write this information down! Copy and paste this information and save it to a file! It is your responsibility to guard and protect your details for life. Safely store a copy where ONLY YOU can access this information. If you lose this information, you will NOT be able to restore it. Do NOT email us or ask any other member to help you recover these details. Misplacing this information shall immediately result in forfeiture of membership and assets (such as revenue share) distributed to the bearer of this information. Guard this information as if it were gold bullion. The bearer of these details is automatically considered the owner, therefore, if you allow another person to take this information from you, they will have permission to take your funds, assets, and access to our technology. The person in possession of this information also possesses all membership rights. This is the most important information you will EVER have, guard and protect it at all costs. We suggest you keep copies of this information in a few places.
While this is a very new opportunity it seems that it has not yet really taken hold. The first 5000 positions will get the biggest benefit. Right now there are plenty of these positions available. This is a great time for people to signup and get involved at low cost to a program that will pay them for years into the future.
THE DOUBTERS
Part of the reason this has not yet taken off is people that think there is nothing behind this website. They think it is just a scam. Actually it is quite funny as some of the people that think that are the same ones that will put money into programs that pay 2% daily then wonder why they crash. If you study the compensation plan here you will see that it is fully sustainable. Money is only shared when the business is making revenue. By doing that they have to make money. This is your guarantee that they will not crash. If no money is made, no money is distributed. Pretty simple concept and it is how all businesses should operate.
CAN IT SUCCEED?
As with any new program time will tell. The product will be very important and BitBilions are looking to make many products in many areas. I suspect the first products will be the more simple ones and more progressive ones will come later. Once products are released many people will start joining and it is the people that took the chance early that will benefit most. Especially those that get in the first 5000 positions. The type of technology they are dealing with is new and already establishing itself. This is a great time to be building this before others realize how easy it will be to do. Yes this can succeed, provided it gets support from the people.
HOW MUCH CAN I REALLY MAKE?
This is tough to say and depends on a few things. If you are someone that will refer a lot of people, then you will make some good commissions just from that alone. It will also help in building your matrix. Remembering you only earn from the matrix if the members in it are earning since you get 7% of what they have earned from revenue share. Really there is no way to say how much you could earn. If BitBillions grows big and starts making millions of dollars revenue then you could earn a big amount of money. If it starts to grow huge then that big amount of money will start becoming life changing amounts. To get it you don’t have to do a lot either, just join, donate and then when the software is out, use it.
HOW DO I JOIN?
As mentioned the process is much easier now. You need to have an affiliate link to get through to the signup page. If you haven’t got one click the one below;
After clicking the affiliate link you will be taken to the site.
Go through all the pages until you get to one that says Exclusive Membership At the bottom of the page click on I accept the GBBA Agreement
The next page gives you the Launch Process and at the bottom click on Sign Me Up
You will then have a membership number and password generated for you which will look like
Member ID Number (username) 14A1grVFaAHAdYtDSsxMYo9necRViqe6wV
Password FudjHeEWdFXv
You then need to submit membership application by inserting your email then clicking Join Now
You will receive an email which will give you options to make your donation. First you will need to create a wallet to receive bitcoins (for your commissions). Several options are suggested. You then can either send a bitcoin to your membership ID (which goes to the company and proves you sent it). The alternative is to send a donation via GoFundMe on the page http://www.gofundme.com/bitbillions You will receive an email saying your application for Founder has been accepted, or if you send less that bitcoin equivalent through GFM it will say that you have a reserved position. You will also get login details that you can use to access the member area on the site. You can get your referral link there.
One last thing you need to make sure of is that you send your public address from your wallet so that the commissions can be sent to you.
Once you have that setup you can invite others and earn commissions from that. The more referrals you have the more share you will get later from the matrix revenue share bonus.
