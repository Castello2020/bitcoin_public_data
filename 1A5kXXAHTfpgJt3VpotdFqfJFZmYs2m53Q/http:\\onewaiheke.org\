<p>School holidays are with us again and small children are everywhere. Some noisy, some quiet, but all with demands. Lots of demands. Food, treats, toys, stimulation, you name it. Children need LOTS of stuff and demand it the only way they can. With endless repetition and the threat of tears and copious quantities of mucus and noise if their requirements are not instantly met. It’s horrible, but it’s part of growing up.</p>
<p>“Oh God,” you’re all thinking, “That beer bloke is going on about kids again. What does he know about it? He doesn’t even have any!” </p>
<p>Well bear with me because that is NOT where I’m headed with this. I know you all love your offspring. You give them names and dress them up in little clothes and so on and that’s lovely I’m sure. But its ADULTS I want to look at today. Adults that employ the tactics of toddlers because somehow the world has bent out of shape enough to make them think they can get away with it. </p>
<p>I was drawn to this subject by a curious article that appeared on the net yesterday. You can find the link here; </p>
<p>http://news.distractify.com/culture/craigslist-surveillance-restaurant/?v=1</p>
<p>The gist of this is that a New York restaurant found itself facing complaints about service. It reviewed security footage from ten years before and discovered that it was doing the same stuff, just as efficiently, but that the CUSTOMERS had become less efficient. Their obsessive use of mobile technology meant that everything took longer. Rather than order food politely, wait patiently for it to arrive, eat it and then bugger off again tidily, most restaurant patrons are deep into their online lives and everyone else can damn well wait until they take a break from tapping ‘LOL’ and so forth into their little electronic chums.</p>
<p>Of course it is a common complaint these days that people really do spend too much time looking at phones and tablets so I’m not going to add to that. Besides, I am far from innocent of such behaviour myself. I simply LOVE my little Black Mirror and use it a lot too so I can’t take issue with people who do it excessively. </p>
<p>What shocked me more than anything with that article was not the electronic bad manners but the revelation that in 2004 just three people out of forty five were rude and arrogant enough to demand a different table while ten years later that figure had risen to EIGHTEEN out of forty five. My limited grasp of mathematics is not up to working out the percentage increase in people being ill mannered but then it hardly needs to when faced with a rise of that magnitude in just a decade. That figure is simply astonishing, not to mention deeply disturbing. There have always been people for whom having more than enough money acts as a substitute for being polite or considerate. The sloppy rich twit who thinks being rude to waiters is clever or endearing will always, alas, be with us. But, given that the ordinarily paid have grown poorer in the last ten years, what are we to make of the fact that BEHAVING like a spoiled, rich wanker is growing more popular even if these folk don’t have the money to make the rudeness genuinely gold plated? What on earth has happened to us in just ten years to make us think this is a fine way to carry on? </p>
<p>If there is one thing any sensible adult knows it is that being rude to people in shops, restaurants, airports and other such places is really dumb. I have a friend who never grasped this and was always full of bracing tales of how forcefully he demanded better service on airlines during his many business trips abroad. He seemed to think this showed some sort of prestige. I just smiled quietly during his bumptious monologues on the subject and imagined just what hijinks went on in the aircraft galley as the flight attendants added bodily exudates to his meals.</p>
<p>Because, make no mistake on this point, THEY DO. So do waiters in restaurants and if you believe otherwise then you are deluded. The old axiom of ‘Always put a little of yourself into every job’ has a very specific meaning to service industry staff who have to smile politely out front during some childish rant from a customer with an inflated sense of self importance. Once those harried waiters get behind the scenes then THEY are in charge and the rude customer will find their smiles just that bit more genuine once that specially treated meal is placed before them.</p>
<p>All of which should be perfectly obvious and if the wealthy and inconsiderate find themselves dining on the contents of a waiter’s nose then this is right and proper and all is well with the world. But, this is going off topic just a bit. Let us get back to the way in which even the most runny nosed service industry staff are finding themselves hard pressed to keep up with demand for their nasal contents and having to fall back on good old fashioned spit in the coffee.</p>
<p>Help me out here. I’ve worked in various service industry jobs and as a result I have NEVER gone into a restaurant or café and demanded a different table to the one I was offered. It has simply never occurred to me to do so. It’s just a bloody TABLE for heaven’s sake. I’m not planning on buying it. I’m not looking for a relationship with it. I just want somewhere to sit as I find eating food while standing up to be disagreeable. But surely someone reading this must have done it and I’d love to know why. What was it about standing there like a huge toddler and saying “I don’t want that table! I want THAT one!” that met some need in you? Looking back at that figure of three complaints rising to eighteen complaints indicates that behaving like a confused infant in public is far more popular than it used to be. The average article on this site gets fifty or so readers, so statistically at least a few of you reading this have sunk to this level of public nastiness. ‘Fess up. Let’s hear WHY.</p>
<p>Until I get a different explanation from someone who behaves like this then I can draw just two possible conclusions. Firstly, it is possible that, as chaps like Desmond Morris explained so well, humans copy behaviours from the more powerful of their species. We indicate status by adopting clothes and mannerisms from those we perceive to be more successful. For example, a hundred years ago, the wealthy viewed suntanned skin as being a mark of manual labour and stayed well out of the sun lest they end up looking like a navvy. Yet within a lifetime suntanned skin had changed its social signal entirely and the poorly paid were rushing off to destroy their complexions in horrible sun beds so as to give the impression of having been overseas on an expensive holiday. Styles of clothing and the naming of children follow the same top downwards trajectory. So it might be possible to infer that the arrogant and puffed up attitudes of some wealthy folk towards their social inferiors has become something that the less well paid seek to ape in order to appear better off than they inevitably are.</p>
<p>Which is pretty bloody tragic.</p>
<p>Personally though, I have another suggestion. It’s not a nice thought but I have to say it. We are becoming infantilised as a society. The idea that we should laugh and play like children has always been a pleasant one. It IS nice to do so from time to time, but we seem to have grown more accepting of the darker side to this and begun to believe that screaming, pouting and yelling like children is also good. Sadly the proof of this is becoming more apparent.</p>
<p>I was a child at a time when the retail industry hadn’t quite figured out what we now call ‘Pester Power’. Back then, the good stuff that we kids could throw a tantrum over was all kept in sweet and toy shops that our parents had the ability to keep us out of if they chose. The rudimentary supermarkets of Britain in the 60’s simply hadn’t got round to filling the shelves by the checkouts full of sweet and colourful things that drew our eyes and made us fractious. But by the late 1980’s the first pester power kids were entering adult life and the results were not always pretty. I particularly remember a tubby lad from Montreal that I used to work with. Ten years younger than me, he’d grown up as the youngest child in a large family and appeared to have been wretchedly indulged. The smug look of a kid whose mother gave in every time he screamed was writ large upon him and it was a sad thing to see. For now he was discovering that adult life was full of people that couldn’t have cared less for his sense of entitlement and who simply laughed in his face or ignored him when he drummed his heels and pouted when things weren’t exactly to his liking. </p>
<p>But that was twenty five years ago and nowadays he and his type are a lot happier. Because now there are enough overgrown toddlers infesting the world that commerce has found it profitable to embrace them. Fast food chains in particular have discovered that enough adults exist in a perpetually infantilised state to make their businesses flourish. Bright and gaudy colour schemes combine with squashy burgers packed with sugar and fat to create a dining environment in which four year olds of ALL ages can feel entertained and satisfied. </p>
<p>Now that would be fine if they stayed at McDonalds, but the overgrown toddler mentality is creeping out all over, and the result is the unpleasant statistic discovered by that restaurant in New York. And it’s the same here. Businesses run by grownups FOR grownups are having to tolerate the infantilised market in order to compete and this is a tragedy. For it is not just the sugar and fat eating crowd that we have to listen to these days but that other dreadful manifestation of the spoiled infant, The Food Faddist. The snivelling, self-obsessed little twerp for whom no meal can possibly be acceptable until their gamut of obsessive high fibre/gluten free/organic/lactose intolerant bullshit has been run through in front of everybody. I think I despise these types of overgrown children the most.</p>
<p>How nice it would be to visit a restaurant in which a fatuous ninny at the next table was simply called on his toddler-like behaviour! Imagine the scene if you will…. Screen goes all wavy…..</p>
<p>“Excuse me! Excuse me! Waiter!!!!”</p>
<p>“Sir/Madam?”</p>
<p>“I don’t like this! The table is the wrong size and in the wrong place. I want to sit by the window on a better chair and I want my egg cooked like that person’s over there and whatever those green bits are in the quiche look yucky! There’s a salt shaker on my table which is offensive ‘cos I’m on a low sodium diet and this coffee tastes like it still has some caffeine in it and I don’t do caffeine. There should be more gluten free items on the menu ‘cos I’m eating gluten free now since I read a thing on the internet about Gwyneth Paltrow doing it. Basically, I want everything changed round and I don’t want to have to pay my bill ‘cos you didn’t do any of the things I want properly.”</p>
<p>“Sir/Madam?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Now, what we are going to do is this. You are going to leave now. Go away,and don’t come back until you’ve learned to behave in public like a grown up. If you can manage that and do wish to return then bring a fucking note from your DOCTOR proving you are intolerant of certain foods or we’ll just assume you are a wanker who just likes whining about stuff instead. Your infantile behaviour falls below an acceptable standard and all the other patrons around you think you’re a fuckwit and can’t wait to see the back of you. Are we clear on this? Good. Now, off you fuck.”</p>
<p> THAT, I believe  is a restaurant I’d be proud to visit.</p>
<p>I would like to add that if anyone is &#8216;offended&#8217; by any of the above then I am delighted. Feel free to let me know how much my observations have annoyed you as this will amuse me greatly.</p>
<p>In conclusion I would like to sign off with this list from the great journalist Michael Bywater who has written an entire book on the tricky topic. In order to appear publicly  as at least vaguely adult he makes the following suggestions;</p>
<p>How to be an adult.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be affronted.<br />
 Being affronted (or offended, or complaining about &#8216;inappropriateness&#8217;) is no response for a grown-up. Only children believe the world should conform to their own view of it: a sort of magical thinking that can only lead to warfare, terrorism, unmanageable short-term debt and the Blair/Bush alliance</p>
<p>Mistrust anything catchy, whether it&#8217;s the Axis of Evil, advertising slogans, or blatant branding (&#8216;New Labour&#8217;). Catchiness exists to prevent thought and to disguise motive. Grown-ups can think for themselves</p>
<p>Ignore celebrities, except when they are doing what they are celebrated for doing: acting, playing football et cetera. Skill does not confer moral, political or intellectual discrimination. (Except in the case of writers. Writers know everything and can lecture you with impunity.) If a celebrity is not celebrated for doing anything but being a celebrity, smile politely but pay no notice</p>
<p>We should not assume that market forces will decide wisely. The market is rigged by manipulation and infantilisation</p>
<p>Consider our own motivations. We may rail about being treated like children, ordered about, kept from the truth, nannied and exploited… but are we complicit in it? Could the reward actually be infantilisation itself?</p>
<p>Autonomy is the primary marker of being grown up. Babies, children and adolescents don&#8217;t have any. We don&#8217;t want to be in their boat</p>
<p>Suspect administration.<br />
 Its purpose is to free the organisation to do what it&#8217;s meant to do: but the triumph of the administrators &#8211; the lawyers, the accountants, the professional managers &#8211; means that too many organisations now believe that what they are meant to do is administer themselves. This is a profoundly infantile attitude</p>
<p>Do not love yourself unconditionally. Such love is for babies and comes from their mothers. Ignore fashion, particularly in clothes. You don&#8217;t want to look like a teenager for ever</p>
<p>Never do business with a company offering &#8216;solutions&#8217; as in &#8216;ergonomic furniture solutions which minimise the postural strain associated with sitting&#8217; (chairs) and &#8216;Post Office mailing solutions&#8217; (brown paper). The word suggests we have a problem, but since we are grown-ups, that is for us to decide</p>
<p>Denounce relativism at every turn. Shouting &#8216;not fair&#8217; is childish. Demanding respect without earning it is childish. Don&#8217;t fear seriousness. Babies aren&#8217;t allowed to be serious</p>
<p>Watch our language.<br />
 Is there really much difference between a six-year-old in a fright-wig and his father&#8217;s waders shouting &#8216;I&#8217;m the Mighty Wurgle-Burgle-Urgley-Goo&#8217; and an ostensible grown-up demanding to be called &#8216;Tony Blair&#8217;s Respect Tsar&#8217;?</p>
<p>Hide.<br />
 Grown-ups are not required to be perpetually accountable, while the instincts of government and big business, both of which are, almost by their nature, great infantilisers, are to keep an eye on everyone all the time</p>
<p>Eat it up.<br />
 There is nothing more babyish than having dietary requirements</p>
<p>Never vote for, do business with or be pleasant to anyone who uses the words &#8216;ordinary people&#8217;</p>

	<div class="entry-content full-content">
<p><a href="http://onewaiheke.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Spam-1.jpg"><img src="http://onewaiheke.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Spam-1.jpg" alt="Spam 1" width="287" height="176" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1138" /></a></p>
<p>The other night I was talking, over an ale or two, naturally, to a friend who has just returned from a holiday in Hawaii. He was explaining how popular Spam seems to be over there and how this strange and frankly horrible product is now being made in assorted ‘gourmet’ flavours. Somebody decided that Chorizo flavoured Spam was a good idea and others seemed willing to accept this strange decision and actually eat it. Not only that, but he even saw macadamia nuts, (Which Hawaii produces in vast and delicious quantities) available in Spam Flavour.</p>
<p>This revelation produced a horrible moment of shared disgust among the assembled company and we all took that half gulp, half deep breath that all humans do when faced with something too vile to contemplate. Spam is not something that any of us present had eaten in decades. As a foodstuff it rates only very slightly above pet food in most people’s perception.</p>
<p>I first met Spam at the age of four. I went to a very good primary school and I can think of half a dozen friends and relations that went there too and I am sure they will remember this as vividly as I do. The school took its teaching responsibilities seriously and while it went to great lengths to show us kids that the world could be full of colour, fun, music, games and shouting for joy, they also took similar care to demonstrate to us that the world could also be a bleak and joyless place in which sadness, adversity and gloom had to be met head on and accepted. This they did using Spam.</p>
<p>At least once every two weeks we would troop hungrily into the hall for lunch and be faced with the horror of Spam. It was clearly taken from some huge catering pack and served in perfectly round slices along with the scraps of greenery that passed for salad in 60’s Britain. It was, quite simply, inedible. It was a depressing synthetic pink in colour, smelled of chemicals and tasted of sadness. We’d sit and cut faces or shapes into it, putting off the horrible moment when we would have no choice but to eat it. And eat it we would, since this was post war Britain. Rationing had only, finally, been abandoned less than a decade before and the country still ran on the ‘Food-is-Fuel’ mentality and you were still meant to be pathetically grateful for anything not actually poisonous.<br />
 “You’ll eat it and like it!” “That’s good food! You can’t let it go to waste!” “There are starving children in India!”, and of course the terrible; “No pudding until you’ve eaten your MEAT!”</p>
<p>Once I left primary school they found other ways of showing us how crap life could be such as compulsory rugby and beatings and I was never again to eat Spam. In fact I had almost forgotten that it still existed until Monty Python suddenly gave it a boost in their unforgettable ‘Spam Sketch’. The hilarious spectacle of Terry Jones as the proprietor of some gloomy café, reeling off the endless list of meals containing more and more improbable quantities of Spam while a table full of Vikings in the corner broke into song about the stuff suddenly made it seem at least funny.<br />
<a href="http://onewaiheke.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/spam-2.jpg"><img src="http://onewaiheke.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/spam-2.jpg" alt="spam 2" width="268" height="182" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1139" /></a></p>
<p>Almost iconic in fact. Though neither funny nor iconic enough to make me want to eat it again. Indeed, during my impoverished and drunken younger days I ate many revolting things, especially late at night. I’ve even eaten saveloys and doner kebabs (and kept them down too) but I have never been hungry or degraded enough to have touched Spam.</p>
<p>(Just an aside here. My research on the internet into Spam reveals that the famous Python sketch led to the name Spam being applied to unwanted email, though who first decided this is unclear.)</p>
<p>Many countries boast revolting foodstuffs. Scotland has Haggis, which, despite its seemingly disgusting provenance is actually delicious. In Iceland they eat rotted shark which people have weed on. Yet these ‘delicacies’ are presented with swagger and a knowing grin. There’s something defiantly fun about them. But Spam makes no such claims. It is simply nasty, cheap canned ‘meat-style’ food substitute, cheaply packaged and without flair of any kind.</p>
<p>So where could it have come from? Personally, I was AMAZED to find my own country guiltless. I had always simply assumed that anything so deliberately joyless could only have been developed in Britain. But no. Spam is as American as apple pie and school shootings. It was invented by the Hormel Foods Corporation in 1937, and while its brand name is taken to mean ‘Spiced Ham’, it appears that the name actually means something else which they don’t want to tell us and I don’t want to think about.</p>
<p>The American do produce a lot of CRAP food. But, no matter how squashy, fake, horrible and unhealthy these foods may be, our American cousins usually manage to package and advertise them as if they were wholesome, nutritious and fun. The Big Mac is the ultimate example of this on the worldwide scale though a visit to an American supermarket will turn up foods even more unlikely and appalling. Yet even the worst of these will be presented in bright and irresistible packs, hinting at untold gastronomic delight.</p>
<p>Not Spam though. Oh dear no. Spam is, for all its horror, presented in dull and honest tins that promise nothing save for disappointment and self-loathing. Spam is the ultimate anti-fun food.</p>
<p>Yet it is still made, and, we must assume, sold. A look at the tinned meat shelves here at our local supermarket shows that Hormel’s Spam occupies a standard one metre shelf and is available in standard ‘Inedible’, ‘Inedible Low Sodium’, ‘Bacon’ and ‘Turkey’ flavours. Yet just a few feet away lie the inexpressible delights of a New Zealand meat chiller, containing meats of a quality unheard of in many countries. Ten dollars will get you a rump steak so tender you’d think it came from a cow tended by angels, pork chops so rich and flavourful they look like they’ll cook themselves for you, and of course the best lamb available anywhere on Earth. Yet enough people are prepared to bypass these fresh meats and buy Spam instead. It defies belief.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of days I have asked pretty much everyone I’ve encountered if they have eaten Spam recently. None of them have, which came as no surprise. But every single one of them reacted as if I’d asked them if they’d eaten dog roll. Or drunk from a puddle. But then the kind of people I know tend, like me, to be serious about food. So I decided to sit down, write about my curiosity and see if anyone else feels like saying, as Eric Idle’s character did in that sketch; “I LOVE SPAM!”</p>
<p>Who still eats it? Do you have favourite recipes for it? What is it that draws you to its jellified and synthetic delights? Do you feed it to children? (And if so, what did your children do to deserve this?) Answers below please. I’ll even waive my normal refusal to allow replies from anonymous responders in this case. I can see why you’d want to keep this habit a secret.</p>

<p>Gather round everybody, gather round. I have a tale to tell of a hero tragically unsung. His obscurity is something that any decent person would wish to see swept away and if ever a chap deserved to be sung about in loud tones then this is the fellow.<br />
Now your basic Unsung Hero is hardly a rare beast. For every statue erected of grumpy monarchs, self-serving legislators and blood spattered generals there should be similar monuments to any number of men and women who have added, in some way or another, to the sum of human knowledge, security and happiness. </p>
<p>That’s life though. Few of these folks will ever find enough champions to demand that their memory be honoured with some lasting memorial, but the gentleman I wish to tell you of really does require greater recognition, and if this tale serves to bring his honourable name to wider attention then I shall have at least made a start. </p>
<p>There’s a personal aspect to this story too, since the chap in question is buried in my hometown of Brighton in Sussex. As a youngster, I’d walk through the churchyard of St Nicholas at least once a week on my way into town, noting the more famous resting places of Nicholas Tattersall, (the sea captain that sailed the future King Charles the 2nd to France following his defeat at the battle of Worcester) Martha Gunn, (The large and terrifying woman who first encouraged visitors to the town to get their swimming gear on and actually immerse themselves in sea water) and the remarkable Phoebe Hessel whose life story deserves an entirely separate article. Their names I knew. But for some reason the most illustrious inhabitant of the quiet church yard was unknown to me. I must have walked past his simple but handsome gravestone a thousand times and I blush to think that it is only now that I realise what I was missing.</p>
<p><a href="http://onewaiheke.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/sakes-grave.png"><img src="http://onewaiheke.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/sakes-grave.png" alt="" width="177" height="284" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1129" /></a></p>
<p>The man in question was Sake Dean Mahomed. </p>
<p>Admit it. You haven’t heard of him either. Yet this was a man who should rightly be a household name, his statue in every town and his portrait on the wall of every…. But wait. I’m getting ahead of myself.<br />
I discovered Mr Mahomed, or ‘Doctor Brighton’ as he was known in his lifetime, simply because I wanted to know where the word ‘Shampoo’ came from. That strange word is in front of you in the shower every morning. Where could it have originated? French perhaps? No. The French word is exactly the same only with ‘ing’ on the end. (What a crazy day THAT must have been at the Academie Francais as the learned gents deliberated on how to admit this curious new word into their obsessively over-protected language.)</p>
<p>Well, if the good lord had meant us to be in the dark on such matters he would not have given us Wikipedia. It was the matter of a moment or two to discover that the word derives from the Hindi word ‘Champo’, meaning head massage, and was brought to the British Isles by Sake Dean Mahomed who opened the first Shampoo parlour in Brighton in the early years of the 19th century. Well, all things Brightonian are of interest to me so I read a little more on this splendid Bengali gentleman. Mr Mahomed was born in Patna, India in 1759. His exactly birthday is unrecorded, which is a crying shame as it should be marked as a day of international celebration, but no matter, we can surely pick another date for the purpose, but more on that later. At the tender age of ten he met an Anglo Irish army captain by the name of Godfrey Evan Baker and found his way into the service of the East India Company as a surgeon. He remained in Captain Baker’s unit until Baker’s retirement in 1782, at which point he decided to accompany his friend back to Britain. Two years later, while living and studying in Ireland, he met an attractive young lady by the name of Jane Daly, and, despite the objections of her family, converted from Islam to the Anglican faith and eloped with her.</p>
<p>The pair then moved from Ireland to Brighton, then to London and finally back to Brighton where they raised five children and spent the rest of their lives. While in London, Mahomed worked for the Scottish entrepreneur Basil Cochrane at his ‘Vapour Baths’ in Portman Square and his curious new method of ‘Shampooing’ the scalps of Cochrane’s wealthy clients proved popular. However, his employer must have been a difficult man to work with. A contemporary described this gentleman and his brothers thus; ‘The Cochranes are not to be trusted out of sight. They are all romantic, mad, money –getting and not truth telling- and there is not a single exception in any part of that family.’ Ouch. With a write up like that we can assume that Saturday nights at their place must have been a blast, but not the kind of people you’d find it easy to be in business with.</p>
<p>Small wonder then that Mahomed soon struck out on his own and in 1814 opened his own premises on the Brighton seafront. This combined Turkish baths and shampoo establishment was a roaring success and set the family up in fine style. The patronage of the Prince Regent himself set the seal on Mahomed’s status and he found himself appointed ‘Shampooing Surgeon’ to both the Prince Regent and his successor William the 4th.</p>
<p>This royal patronage was to end with the accession to the throne of Victoria, who took one look at the Brighton Pavilion and declared that she could not possibly spend so much as a night there. She can hardly be faulted for this I have to admit. The Pavilion, though magnificent, is possibly the most hallucinatory and vulgar royal palace ever built. So the party town of the south coast lost its royal connection forever, but by this time Mahomed had his life well in order. He died at a ripe old age in February 1851 and went to his rest in the graveyard of St Nicholas. He had authored numerous books on subjects as diverse as surgery, thalassotherapy and the history of the Mughal Empire as well as an account of his own life and travels. He was, in short, A Chap.<br />
But, you may be thinking at this point, is that it? Introducing shampoo to the world at large is an achievement, certainly, but weren’t you going on about public monuments earlier? Is there something else that he did that got you so worked up? Don’t tell me he invented India Pale Ale as well?</p>
<p>Well no gentle reader he didn’t do anything quite THAT impressive, but he did do the absolute next best thing. You see, I have saved the best bit until now. The bit that should, if you are any kind of decent person have you googling his name and clamouring for his memory to be better looked after. For Sake Dean Mahomed opened the first Indian restaurant in Britain.<br />
Pause for that one to sink in. Now let me repeat that in a font size more suited to such a statement;</p>
<p>                                <strong> HE OPENED THE FIRST INDIAN RESTAURANT IN BRITAIN.</strong></p>
<p>If my design talents were up to the job, that sentence would be surrounded by elaborate curlicues and flourishes, with maybe a bare bottomed cherub or two about the margins, blowing trumpets. Because Sake Dean Mahomed really was that much of a Chap. He brought the first curry house to Blighty. Now tell me THAT isn&#8217;t worthy of a bloody great big marble statue or two.<br />
Let me state, and I will brook no argument on this, that the cuisine of the Indian subcontinent is one of mankind’s greatest achievements. In its multitudinous forms it has brought untold joy and fulfilment to everyone who has encountered it. Show me a town without an Indian restaurant and I’ll show you a bleak, desolate and unhappy place in which I would not linger for more than a minute. </p>
<p>So let’s try and set things to rights shall we? Indian restaurateurs, set Mahomed’s portrait prominently on your walls. It’s right there on the internet and he’s a handsome looking fellow. Let his peaceful and intelligent face gaze down from the red flock wall coverings and over the happy throng eating at your tables. Give this man his due. He brought something far better to the world than most of us could ever dream of. I myself shall begin tomorrow and I urge you all to do likewise. I shall print off his portrait, have it framed at my own expense and head without delay to Ajadz restaurant where I shall linger over a fine lunch and present it to the owners with a full explanation.</p>
<p>I’ll even bring a nail.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One third of the content of this blog is from an essay I wrote.  The rest is opinion.  The essay got me thinking.</p>
<p>For the sake of transparency, social justice has always been a subject of which I am passionate about &#8211; borne out of a set of values I grew up with but also through the experiences of personal struggle despite a modest financial background (privileged by all intents and purposes if we were to compare it to two-thirds of the rest of the world). While I managed to overcome those struggles, the experience led to a recognition and an empathy for the struggle of others – a struggle which might be prevented &#8211; and and understanding that the devastating costs to them, their family and society might in fact be unnecessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium"><b>Social Justice &amp; Social Policy 101</b></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium">Social justice is the view that everyone deserves equal economic, political and social rights and opportunities.</span></span></span><sup><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium"><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a></span></span></span></sup>Defining “social policy” however is more difficult simply because social policy relates to anything to do with family life – and it could be argued that all policy relates to family life and either positively or negatively affects family life in some way.<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote2sym" name="sdfootnote2anc"><sup>2</sup></a></sup> To attempt to define social policy, we might look at some examples of past and current issues that have been cause for debate politically for New Zealand that would be described as social policy. These include (but are not limited to) Tangata Whenua/Biculturalism and the Treaty of Waitangi, Gender issues, Housing, Human Rights, Child Abuse, Child Poverty, Welfare issues, Health and Mental Health policies, Education policies, Employment policies.<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote3sym" name="sdfootnote3anc"><sup>3</sup></a> </sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Wellness and Human Rights </b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coming from a background in nursing, my understanding of “wellness” has always been an holistic one – incorporating the physical, emotional/psychosocial, cultural, spiritual aspects of a person. Author Humphrey McQueen<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote4sym" name="sdfootnote4anc"><sup>4</sup></a></sup> writes that wellness is affected by education, employment, housing, working conditions and nutrition as well as healthcare. The controversy lies in whether these are a human right<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote5sym" name="sdfootnote5anc"><sup>5</sup></a></sup> (or to what degree they are a human right) and each political ideology has a different take on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What Political Ideology Do You Subscribe To?</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there are a wide range of political ideologies, for the purpose of simplicity, I will describe the main political ideologies that these fall under: Liberalism, Conservatism, Socialism and the “Third Way”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Liberalism</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key elements of Liberalism include individualism, freedom, reason, equality, toleration, consent and constitutionalism. Variations of Liberals include classic and modern liberalism. Heywood<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote6sym" name="sdfootnote6anc"><sup>6</sup></a></sup> in “Political Ideologies” writes: “Individualism is the core principle of liberal ideology. It reflects a belief in the supreme importance of the human individual as opposed to any social group or collective body. Human beings are seen, first and foremost, as individuals.” Liberalism believes in and values individual freedom (or liberty) and this is given priority over equality, justice or authority. In terms of “reason” liberals believe that the world has a rational structure and that individuals possess the ability to exercise human reason and critical enquiry and therefore make wise judgments on their own behalf and usually for their own best interests. Liberals believe that people are “born equal” and are “morally equal” and are born to an equal playing field to that of others and success is based on their own achievement and therefore support the idea of meritocracy. Liberals believe in “freedom of speech” and tolerance of all speech is enriching to society. Liberals believe in consent or willing agreement between authority as well as social relationship and while they may believe that Government is vital to stability – they do believe in limited Government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Conservatism</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key elements of Conservatism include tradition, pragmatism, human imperfection, organicism, hierarchy, authority and property. Variations of Conservatives include paternalistic conservatism, neo-liberalism and neo-conservatism. Conservatives value tradition and cleave to ideas that have been “tested through time” and which promotes security and stability. Abstract thoughts and principles are distrusted and faith is placed in experience, history and pragmatism – the belief that action should be a product of practical circumstances and practical goals. Invariably, conservatives believe that human beings are corrupted by selfishness, greed and the thirst for power and therefore Government is needed for the enforcement of strict laws and harsh penalties. They believe that a hierarchy of social position and status is a natural part of organic society, that a person&#8217;s “station in life” is a product of luck or “accident of birth” and that those more privileged have a duty to care for the “less fortunate”. This belief in hierarchy is also represented in their view of authority where people are governed from the “top down” and give leadership and guidance to those ranking lower in the hierarchy as they are seen to lack knowledge, experience or education. They also believe families to be the “fabric of society”and that property is vital to security, stability and independence from Government.<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote7sym" name="sdfootnote7anc"><sup>7</sup></a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Socialism</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Socialism developed “as a reaction against the emergence of industrial capitalism” writes Heywood<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote8sym" name="sdfootnote8anc"><sup>8</sup></a></sup>. Key elements of socialism are community, fraternity, social equality, need, social class and common ownership. Variations of Socialism include Marxism, Communism and Social-Democracy. The core value of Socialism is the importance of Community – or the social interaction and membership of social groups and collective bodies. The idea that “no man is an Island” also points to the belief that behaviour can be a product of nurture (social factors) rather than nature (innate qualities). Socialists favour co-operation to competition and collectivism over individualism working towards the outcome of building community as opposed to creating further isolation and conflict. What is also central to a Socialist&#8217;s point of view is social equality. Unlike the Liberals, Socialists believe that it is not enough that people are considered morally equal – but that socially, there should be equal outcomes and not just equal opportunities. To achieve this, Socialists believe that material benefits should be distributed based on need rather than merit or work. While modern Socialists have moved away from the notion of common ownership, “the Socialist&#8217;s goal is either the eradication of economic and social inequalities or their substantial reduction.”<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote9sym" name="sdfootnote9anc"><sup>9</sup></a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 1990&#8242;s, in response to decades in opposition, the British Labour Party came up with a strategy now recognized as the “Third Way.” While upholding the core values of Social-Democracy in terms of social justice, equality and individual freedom, according to Anthony Giddens (academic on the Third Way)<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote10sym" name="sdfootnote10anc"><sup>10</sup></a></sup> it was decided that they had to “find a new balance between individual and collective responsibilities&#8230;somewhere between the extremes of &#8216;uncaring&#8217; individualism on the right and &#8216;costly&#8217; collectivism on the left.” New Zealand&#8217;s version of “Third Way”was the Clark-led Labour Government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Child Poverty and Social Policy</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To explore social policy fully, we could reasonably take any issue relevant to family “wellness”, but let&#8217;s take a look at the issue of child poverty and the role of welfare<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote11sym" name="sdfootnote11anc"><sup>11</sup></a><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote12sym" name="sdfootnote12anc"><sup>12</sup></a><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote13sym" name="sdfootnote13anc"><sup>13</sup></a><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote14sym" name="sdfootnote14anc"><sup>14</sup></a><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote15sym" name="sdfootnote15anc"><sup>15</sup></a> </sup> in New Zealand as an example. Why? Because children are arguably the most vulnerable within our society:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>They do not choose the environment to which they are born and raised</li>
<li>They do not have a voice unless it is given to them</li>
<li>They are (for the most part) powerless</li>
<li>They are dependent upon the adults in their lives and the influence of society</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And also I happen to value them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>A Socialist&#8217;s View on Child Poverty</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2011, Bryan Bruce made a documentary series on Child Poverty in New Zealand called “Inside Child Poverty” where he revealed the experiences of 1 in 5 children in New Zealand living below the poverty line<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote16sym" name="sdfootnote16anc"><sup>16</sup></a></sup> In his response to what could be described as a “Third Way” Budget in an election year (2014) delivered by John Key and Bill English from the National Government, Bruce wrote on his Facebook page<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote17sym" name="sdfootnote17anc"><sup>17</sup></a></sup> about the intervention he wanted to see from the Government in response to child poverty. He writes that the Government had moved from a position of denial of child poverty in 2011 to now a reluctant acknowledgment and that the Budget included some spending towards reducing child poverty such as free healthcare for children under the age of 13 (whereas heathcare was not free for children under 6 in 2011), and that there was now a move towards warrants of fitness for homes to address the number of children hospitalized with respiratory illnesses; but he implores his readership to vote according to those parties who would put in place policies that would intervene to prevent or improve child poverty in New Zealand. Specifically he mentions warrants of fitness for all rental properties, increasing paid parental leave to one year, the introduction of free 24/7 medical care for everyone under 18, state ownership of the entire electricity system to be run as a public utility and not-for-profit, a living wage rather than a minimum wage, the removal of GST from food and an introduction on luxury tax, creating state loans to build affordable housing, and taking part in a cross party talks after the election to end child poverty.<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote18sym" name="sdfootnote18anc"><sup>18</sup></a></sup> Bruce&#8217;s social policy would closely align with a Socialist&#8217;s point of view.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/JLH2u2uIBhw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In reference to the budget (where $5 million was directed towards spending on families), Michael Timmons from the “The Daily Blog”<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote19sym" name="sdfootnote19anc"><sup>19</sup></a></sup> writes “<span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium">The true nature of this government has been on show in recent weeks. We have seen consistent evidence of a government ruling for the economic elite with little or no regard for the broader population. The actions of this government speak to an arrogance and commensurate sense of entitlement. This is shared with our own economic elite and replicated across the western world through the tentacles of neo-liberalism – a failed economic experiment that holds on desperately through the continued corruption of political life and the imposed consent of the masses while entrenching inequality.” Timmins writes that he believes New Zealanders live in a hegemonic society. He says, “For decades we had a social welfare system – although not perfect – that provided a safety net driven by compassion for our fellow members of society. The language of the neo-liberals, however, removed any references to “compassion” or “fairness”, while instead using the mantra of “dependence”, leading to social exclusion and blame of those in need of assistance.” He goes on to describe (in his words) the ignorance of privilege by neo-liberals and the outcomes of their social policies: “&#8230;the blame directed at the poorest is used to mask policies aimed at providing for the wealthy. More cynically, this strategy of blame creates a wedge between the working poor and those receiving assistance. Beneficiaries are blamed for the lack of money for the working poor when in truth it has been siphoned off to the wealthy. This is evident in the concentration of wealth in the top 10% as we tilt towards an oligarchy. Collateral damage in this deliberate exclusion? The children: now with 285,000 in poverty. In New Zealand.”</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium">In stark contrast, blogger and liberal Lindsay Mitchell writing on Welfare Reform writes “two thirds of the child poverty problem relates to DPB reliance and she estimates that 60,000 children belong in welfare families born to teenagers.

She writes, “Poor, uneducated girls have less to lose when choosing or failing to avoid premature parenthood. A benefit will pay equal to or more than working full time at the minimum wage. Yet the major recommendation advanced by CPAG is to increase benefits. Given the above set of circumstances, it isn&#8217;t difficult to anticipate what raising benefits may do. Increase the number of children on benefits.”</span></span></span><sup><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium"><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote21sym" name="sdfootnote21anc"><sup>21</sup></a></span></span></span></sup><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium"> Mitchell does not conclude the article with recommendations for focusing on prevention of teenage pregnancies, but to point out the responsibility for a child in poverty lying with the mothers themselves and a welfare system that does not discourage teen pregnancy.</span></span></span></p>
<p><b>A Conservative&#8217;s View on Child Poverty</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium">Bob McCoskrie leader of the Conservative Not-for-Profit Organization “Family First” writes “In New Zealand, the married two-parent family is increasingly sidelined while the divorce rate skyrockets. More children are growing up without their dads and more solo mums are struggling to make ends meet. There is rising drug and alcohol abuse and violence in the community. Young girls are being forced into prostitution and some are having abortions behind their parents’ back. Standards in the media and advertising are getting worse and political correctness is strangling free speech. All while people demand more rights without taking responsibility.”</span></span></span><sup><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium"><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote22sym" name="sdfootnote22anc"><sup>22</sup></a></span></span></span></sup><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium"> Their social policies centre around upholding traditional views of marriage and family and that the breakdown of these insitutions results in issues such as child poverty. Whilst not a political party, the organization promotes traditional values and believes that Government should leave childcare choices (and favourably support the option of spending more time with children), sex education and the right to decide how they discipline their children to parents. On the one hand they would like to see a right of appeal towards CYFS intervention, on the other hand they are calling for tougher and harsher penalties in terms of child abuse. In other words a reduced role of Government in terms of what they believe to be the role and responsibility of the parent and a return to traditional “tried and tested norms” in terms of marriage and family.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium">Conservative National MP Paula Bennett (Minister of Social Development) in commenting about welfare changes made to Government said that the legislation “changed the passive approach of welfare to a more work-focused system” &#8211; in other words, the focus on practical solutions that promote responsibility.</span></span></span><sup><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium"><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="#sdfootnote23sym" name="sdfootnote23anc"><sup>23</sup></a></span></span></span></sup><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium"> A tougher, tighter system where benefits were passed to a youth centre rather than directly to the parent and women on the “widow&#8217;s benefit” or “women alone” benefit would also face tougher work tests. While the Opposition might describe this as punitive (I certainly do), this is an example of the Conservative social policy of duty to help but not to assist that person to achieve equal status or equal outcomes but to be assisted to take responsibility for their own circumstances, with tougher approaches to welfare in order to motivate those people to remain on a benefit for as short a time as possible.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium"><b>Back to Social Justice</b></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium">I find it hard to believe that any liberal who believes wholeheartedly in meritocracy and a limited Government could have understood real suffering and the odds that can be stacked against a child &#8211; otherwise, wouldn&#8217;t they have more empathy for those that do?  It surely is a lack of understanding of the impact of a child&#8217;s environment. Those in helping professions will understand the impact physical, sexual or psychological abuse has on a child whether it is experienced or witnessed. They will understand the impact of broken attachment between a primary caregiver and a child. They will understand the impact of addictions (eg. alcoholism, gambling, drug addictions). They will understand the effects of poverty on a child. They will understand the effects and genetic influences of mental illness on a child. Research clearly shows these children are more likely to have learning difficulties, poor concentration in school and therefore poor educational outcomes which has a follow-on effect if we are to look at skills, abilities, job opportunities and financial reward. These children are more likely to experience addictions themselves or to experience mental illness or to choose an abusive relationship as an adult. These children are more likely to get in trouble with the law, to be imprisoned. These children are more likely to commit suicide. In terms of cause – the experiences of this child becomes hard-wired into his/her brain. Once those brain pathways are formed, they are extremely difficult to shift without major intervention. </span></span></span></p>

<li><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium">It is my view that every child is equal and that if one child is disadvantaged by his/her environment during his/her development then opportunities should be offered to put that right as early as possible (but as late as adulthood) </span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium">It is my view that the (current) Government&#8217;s way of giving with one hand and punishing with the other is most certainly punitive – very much acting like the “Critical Parent”: “I will give you this morsel as a token towards your significant need, but you should feel utterly ashamed for having that need.” </span></span></span></li>

<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium"><b>But What About Responsibility?</b></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium">Anyone who has worked in a helping profession will know that pure socialist ideologies do not work. There is a point at which the helping relationship becomes an empowering partnership that does not foster dependence but assists the growth of that person&#8217;s confidence and strength. This is an essential component for change. On the one hand, there is the recognition that this person (likely) has a background of issues working against them and their ability to change. On the other hand, there is also the recognition that at some point this person has to take responsibility as an adult and be willing and committed to change. There is tension between these two truths and it is a difficult balance with which those in the helping profession wrestle with.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium">I&#8217;m not an alcoholic, but I like the philosophy by which Alcoholics Anonymous is built. These are some of the principles (as I understand them):</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium">We&#8217;re no better than you are – we have all suffered the same issues as you and we&#8217;ve all made the same mistakes – there is no shame here, we are of equal value</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium">Sure, acknowledge the pain and hurt that&#8217;s in your life, you have to deal with that – better to talk about it and express it that way than run from it with all that drink and hurt the people around you – but also take responsibility for your actions and your mistakes you&#8217;ve made because you&#8217;ve carried that hurt inside for so long and chosen to deal with it this way. It&#8217;s up to you to do something about it now you&#8217;re an adult.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium">Change is hard so we do it together in the context of community and help one another through it</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium"><b>The Value of Community</b></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium">I believe that we as humans are social creatures. We are born into families for a reason. We&#8217;re not made to live in isolation. We&#8217;re not made to overcome adversity on our own. When isolation occurs for whatever reason, that person&#8217;s resilience is diminished. The outcome of the breakdown in families and communities is isolation and social adversity. </span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium">In my view child poverty – both globally and nationally for New Zealand – is an outrage. It is a reflection of our own greed and self-interest. It is immoral. The idea of “every man for himself!” creates a society that is so utterly selfish and depraved. But I think we can change that if we choose to care, and we choose to learn what it might be like to walk in another person&#8217;s shoes. It is my view that we must respond to child poverty and other social issues as a community and that we look to solutions that build and strengthen our communities rather than isolate us further into individualism. </span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium">To the member in our community who is struggling with adversity, we could choose to say:</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium">We&#8217;ve had our own struggles too</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium">If I experienced what you&#8217;d experienced, chances are I&#8217;d be just the same</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: medium">You&#8217;re a valuable part of our community and we care about your kids and your family too, so how about we help you with what you&#8217;re experiencing and work this out together?</span></span></span></li>

	<div class="entry-content full-content">
<p><em>The news that Headland is seeking a new Artistic Director for next year&#8217;s Sculpture on the Gulf has Waiheke&#8217;s artistic community in a state of excitement. Normally, we&#8217;d have sent Tom Payne (Presenter of the slightly popular local arts show &#8216;A Payne in the Arts&#8217;) along to cover this important story, but, as he&#8217;s already left for The Bienniale* we had no choice but to send Alan Knight along in his place.</em></p>
<p>Current Headland Artistic Director Dorothy Pseud has come a long way since co-founding the Condemned Garden Shed Gallery in Ostend in 2003. For the last few years she has headed up the team responsible for bringing the island&#8217;s premier sculpture exhibition to life on the hills above Matiatia. But all good things must come to an end and as the search begins for her successor I caught up with her to look back on her work over the last few years as well as contemplate what the future holds. Now it was clear from the start that I&#8217;d be lucky to get anything but pretentious nonsense from her regarding the generally ludicrous and shoddy standard of work usually presented at Headland so naturally I took the precaution of adding a generous dose of CIA approved truth serum to her cup of decaff so as to get a more realistic overview of what we can expect next year.</p>
<p>I began by asking her what exactly does the Artistic director do? Ms Pseud sighed heavily, “Look,” she began, “The whole thing is basically BOLLOCKS right? Sculpture? Don&#8217;t make me laugh. On Waiheke? Michaelangelo was a sculptor. Bernini was a sculptor. Frederick Hart was a sculptor. You know? Actual TALENTED people who took stone or metal and turned it into bloody ART? We, on the other hand, get fifteen or so total wankers with a scrappy grant and a few sheets of bleedin&#8217; corrugated iron or some other crap they managed to scrounge from the transfer station. Either that or they went off their meds, had some sort of half hearted idea then got an engineering firm to do the actual construction then took all the credit. We stick it on a hillside, tack some slab of pretentious waffle about what it&#8217;s supposed to &#8216;mean&#8217; in front of it and away we go. Pathetic I know but people seem to like it. Why am I being this honest?”</p>
<p>“I drugged your coffee.”</p>
<p>“Oh&#8230;..Right&#8230;.That would do it I suppose&#8230;..”</p>
<p>“So how are the sculptures chosen?”</p>
<p>“Well, to begin with, you have to sort out the real stuff from the stuff submitted by people taking the piss. Now that really IS tricky. Let&#8217;s say, just as an example, we get an artwork that consists of three sheep&#8217;s skulls glued to a plank and sprayed yellow. Now if a Real Artist thought of that then obviously it&#8217;s brilliant and may win a major award, but if the same idea came from some group of blokes sitting around, drinking beer and trying to be annoying then it&#8217;s just crap. See what I mean?”</p>
<p>“Not really, no. If an idea is rubbish then surely it&#8217;s rubbish no matter who perpetrates it?”</p>
<p>“You didn&#8217;t go to Art School did you?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“I can tell. Look, the point is, if someone has been to some sort of Art College, spent three years splattering plaster or resin or oatmeal on the walls, had some sort of distressing mental breakdown after living on pot noodles in a basement for a while then got some sort of write up in a magazine that nobody reads then you have to take their work seriously and exhibit it!”</p>
<p>“Ever get it wrong?”</p>
<p>“OK, there was the thing with the traffic cones&#8230;”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t remember that one&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Last Headland but one. The notable sculptor Fenton Bulstrode submitted an installation consisting of seventeen traffic cones arranged in a semi circle, right? Utter wank of course, but Bulstrode is &#8216;Well Known&#8217;. He&#8217;s the guy that did the pile of sponge cake thing on the Wellington waterfront back in 2004 that caused that big traffic accident. So how could we refuse? He was supposed to send us the cones by courier and then come up and spend a week or so arranging them. But then the council did those repairs on Nick Johnson Drive and put identical cones out. We thought the freight company had dropped them off so we gathered them up and put them somewhere safely. Then the real ones arrived but we thought it was a mistake and sent them back. So we had a furious sculptor who refused to work with the cones we gave him, said they had the wrong &#8216;feel&#8217;, plus all the fuss when that bloke drove his bicycle into the huge hole in the road that wasn&#8217;t marked properly because we&#8217;d taken the traffic cones away. Bloody nightmare that was.”</p>
<p>“I can imagine.”</p>
<p>“But, as I said, the whole thing is style over substance. You think the average visitor knows what he&#8217;s looking at? Come on! We put out a broken horse float covered in scribble and they practically salivated over the stupid thing. Most of them are half pissed and developing sunstroke by the time they get to the exhibits so who really cares? If we say it&#8217;s ART they have to believe it right? This year it will probably be a shop window dummy squatting on a child&#8217;s potty with some sea shells glued on it for all I know. As long as it&#8217;s called something &#8216;deep&#8217; like &#8216;<em>Intimations Of Uncertainty, Chapter Nine</em>&#8216; or some such drivel then who&#8217;s going to argue?”</p>
<p>“Surely someone must see it&#8217;s all nonsense?”</p>
<p>“Well, we did get one review that called it &#8216;A fatuous parade of self important ugliness seemingly cobbled together at a toddler&#8217;s playgroup.&#8217; “</p>
<p>“Ow. That&#8217;s harsh. Who said that?”</p>
<p>“You did.”</p>
<p>“Oh&#8230;.Right.”</p>
<p>“So, coming next year?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Fair enough.”</p>
<p><em>* We know it&#8217;s not until next year but Venice is a bloody long way when you have to walk and/or swim. </em></p>

	<div class="entry-content full-content">
<p>During the Waiheke Local Board <img class="size-medium wp-image-1091 alignright" alt="sour grapes" src="http://onewaiheke.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/sour-grapes-300x244.jpg" width="300" height="244" />election I had the pleasure of working with the Essentially Waiheke team to win the Waiheke Local Board election.  The Essentially Waiheke team (Paul, John, Beatle and Becs) plus Shirin.  Made a clean sweep in the local elections and removed 4 out of 5 of the previous board members.</p>
<p>My role in the whole thing was making the Essentially Waiheke website and managing the social media.  I found it a really good experience working with a team to win the campaign.  Most of the former board members have taken defeat gracefully to their credit.  However one former board member in particular appears to have some sour grapes and not just sour but bitter, twisted and sour grapes.</p>
<h3>Ungraceful Former Local Board Member</h3>
<p>One ungraceful former board member has setup a blog and Facebook page which continually opposes whatever the current local board does, even if it is good for the community and continually spread misinformation and what can only be called lies and rumours in an vain attempt to turn people against the current local board.  These were the same techniques that they used during the local board elections – it did not work then and it is not working now.</p>
<p>After the election I believed that this behaviour would stop, well at least ease back till 12 to 18 months out from the next election.  I was wrong, it really is a continuous barrage.  I have to say that all that they are achieving with this type of behaviour is a confirmation to the general public of Waiheke that voting them out of the local board was the best thing that they could of possible done.</p>
<p>I would like to say that my efforts went a long way to get the Essentially Waiheke campaign team to win but after analysing the whole situation I came to the conclusion that this former board was very unpopular and would not get voted back in because of the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly they got voted in with a minority of votes because the votes were then split between some really good people.</li>
<li>They then disgraced themselves with the way that the Chair of the board was chosen and the side-lining of Denise Roche when she got a majority of votes.</li>
<li>I heard all sorts of stories which may or may not be true of funding cuts, issues with resource consents and general opposition from the council for anyone that opposed what the previous local board did in anyway shape or form.</li>
<li>They then appeared to make a lot of controversial decisions which went against what the public Waiheke wanted and appeared to have hidden agendas with very little transparency.</li>
<li>They disgraced themselves again with the way they side-lined Paul Walden after he won the Waiheke Local Board by election.</li>
<li>They then did not participate in public campaigning meetings.</li>
<li>They sent spam out as part of their local board campaign.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I did not know better, I would of thought that they did not want to get elected back onto the local board.  So all I can conclude is that they got themselves voted out, all the Essentially Waiheke team had to do is put a half decent team together to oppose the previous board members  and it worked a charm – a clean sweep.  As a side note the current local board is not half decent but really a great bunch who want to work together for a better Waiheke.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><em>This continuous barrage of misinformation and sour grapes does nothing but discredits the one sending it</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>This continuous barrage of misinformation and sour grapes does nothing but discredits the one sending it so I have not even bothered to comment or engage in it till now.  The only conclusion that I can come to is that the reason for this constant misinformation and opposition to whatever the local board does is because members of the ousted local board want to get voted back in, in the next local board election.</p>
<p>As a recap &#8211; they got voted in with a minority of the votes because of vote splitting, they then lost approximately 30% of their voting support base in the most recent election, they do nothing positive for Waiheke to date except oppose whatever the new local board does.  So they really are deluded when they believe that they will ever get voted back in.</p>
<h3>What can you do to stop the spread of misinformation?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Block anyone spreading misinformation on Facebook</li>
<li>Never comment on misinformation, even if it is to correct as this helps spread it</li>
<li>Don’t visit any blogs spreading misinformation</li>
<li>Remove yourself from any Facebook groups / pages that spread misinformation</li>
<li>Then tell your friends to do the same</li>
</ul>
<p>By allowing yourself to read this stuff and even commenting on it actually helps the spread of it.  All they want is an audience so if you remove yourself and encourage others to do the same you can help minimise the spread of this garbage.</p>

Europe has fallen to Napoleon, and only the Royal Navy stands in his way to total victory. Off the cost of South America, a new conflict is brewing. Captain Jack “Lucky Jack” Aubrey of the Man-of-War HMS Surprise is under orders to sink or capture the French privateer Acheron, which has been deployed to the region. After seven weeks of uneventful sailing, the Acheron strikes first, all but crippling the Surprise in an engagement in which Aubrey realizes his enemy’s ship is nautically superior to his own. Along with his close friend and confidant Stephan Maturin who also happens to be the ship’s surgeon, Aubrey is now faced with the choice of retreating to England and admitting defeat or remaining at the Acheron’s mercy. Aubrey must now do the impossible if he is to survive, repair his ship, catch up to his enemy and defeat the Acheron–somehow.</p>
<p>Based on the best selling novels by Patrick O’Brien with Russell Crowe as Aubrey and Paul Bettany as Maturin this is one of the best movies about the age of fighting sail.</p>

	<div class="entry-content full-content">
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Environmental issues can be a source of heated debate, as we know all too well from past and present local controversies. People sometimes take up entrenched positions on opposing sides of an issue, and in a small community this can become personal and divisive. How can philosophy help? </span></p>
<div dir="ltr">
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">I believe we can all benefit from enhancing our critical thinking abilities, learning how to recognise the assumptions behind our own positions and those of others we disagree with, and trying to formulate our arguments in such a way as to find as much common ground as possible with others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Whether we are concerned about global problems of climate change, pollution, and using up finite natural resources, or about balancing the needs of humans with those of other species here on Waiheke and in our coastal waters, philosophical questions arise. Why does the environment matter? What do we owe to our own and other species, to ecosystems, and to future generations? </span></p>

	<div class="entry-content full-content">
<p>Kauri disease, also known as PTA (<i>Phytophthora Agathis) </i>is killing kauri throughout the Auckland and Northland areas.  It has been identified in the Waitakere Ranges, Great Barrier Island and most of northland’s great kauri forests. The pathogen can exist in soil as spores and it can move in water as a zygote.  Symptoms of the disease include foliage yellowing, canopy thinning, dead branches, trunk collar lesions that bleed gum and finally tree death.</p>
<p>Effective treatment is still in the research stage.</p>
<p>The good news is that both Coromandel Ranges and Waiheke Island are free of the disease.</p>
<p>To keep the island’s kauri free of this deadly disease there is a need to know how the pathogen gets from one place to another.  Already research shows that it can attach to shoes in dirt, or to the feet of animals such as pigs.  It can, also, be accidentally transported in the soil attached to potted seedlings or trees.</p>
<p>Forest and Bird have signs at the entrances of their reserves asking people to clean their shoes before entering the reserves.  However, there is opportunity to increase public awareness of the disease and decrease its accidental introduction to our beautiful island.  Involving the ferry companies more actively in a ‘keep Waiheke free of Kauri disease’ campaign would be wonderful, as the wharves are the main way that people set foot on the island.  Our Local Board could play a big part in supporting public education initiatives and negotiating with the ferry companies in partnership with conservation organisations and Council’s bio-security team to reduce the possibility of the disease ever ‘landing’ here.</p>
