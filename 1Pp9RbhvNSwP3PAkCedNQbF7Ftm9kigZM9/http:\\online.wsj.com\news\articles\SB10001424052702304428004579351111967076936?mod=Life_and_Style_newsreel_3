The Seattle Seahawks, Denver Broncos and the Puppy Bowl face competition for eyeballs--from the first Kitten Bowl.
The fierce competition of Super Bowl Sunday won't be confined to MetLife Stadium. Animal Planet's "Puppy Bowl," in which puppies haul chew toys across a mock football field for points, has long reigned as the cutest sporting event of the year. Now, kittens and goldfish are throwing down. The "Puppy Bowl," 10 years old this year, has become one of the top television alternatives to the Super Bowl, drawing 12.4 million viewers over the course of its 12-hour marathon last year. Along with a handful of other alternatives, including PBS's "Downton Abbey" and Showtime's "Shameless," the "Puppy Bowl" will once again go head-to-head with the big game. The Puppy, Kitten and Fish Bowls

Dogs play on the field during Puppy Bowl X.
Animal Planet This year, the canine competition faces its own counterprogramming. On Feb. 2, Hallmark Channel will air its first "Kitten Bowl," billed as "the greatest feline showdown in cable TV history." That same day, Nat Geo Wild will premiere its "Fish Bowl," which follows a goldfish named Goldie as she navigates her glass bowl for four straight hours. Bill Abbott,
president and CEO of Hallmark Channel's parent company Crown Media, sees room for more than one baby animal showdown. "Kittens especially are just as cute as puppies and, in fact, sometimes cuter," he said. "People who love cats should have an alternative as well." Geoff Daniels, executive vice president and general manager of Nat Geo Wild, said the channel felt an obligation to launch its own animal bowl. "To put puppies and kittens in a bowl is just wrong," he said, "The only thing that belongs in a bowl, other than chips, are fish." "Puppy Bowl" executive producer Melinda Toporoff said the idea for the show grew out of a brainstorming session a decade ago. "They thought, you know, who can compete with the Super Bowl? Let's just put some puppies on a field and call it 'Puppy Bowl,' " she said. "I don't think anyone realized what they were kicking off."
