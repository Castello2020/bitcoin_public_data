This is the same man that tried to kill me in 1995. Then I meet the man of my dreams and everything was going great until I started to remember what I buried for years. Being molested  by my sister from the age of 3 until 11. I told my parents about it a number of time&#8217;s to make it stop and all I was told was that she would never do this to me. So I started thinking it was okay until I left at the age of 17 (1983). I moved in with my ex and that was when the abuse from him started until he almost killed me in 1995. From 1995 until 2001 I was raising my girls on my own this is when I meet the man of my dreams. He stepped in as dad for the girls and treats them like his own. We put them thru college and are still paying. Because we had little to no help from him. I just slowly start to shut down because in my past My family would say your not worth it and you mess everything up, because everyone in my family didn&#8217;t care I did care what happen to me. This is one of the reasons why we are in money problems because I just didn&#8217;t care, what happened to me. For years I just dealt with it until I couldn&#8217;t any more. I really care what happened now but it my be to late and now I am under doctors care. I suffer from PTSD and severe depression. I know with their help I am worth it. They also helped me thru the death of my Mom 12-13-12. But now we are going to lose our house if $16,500 isn&#8217;t paid by June 28 o our house will go out to auction on Aug 15th. for back taxes. I have let my family down and now if we lose the house I don&#8217;t know how my mental health is going to take it. Any amount would help out. PLEASE can you help.

I am a GOD fearing person and religious too. So I swear in the name of GOD that whatever I narrate below is all true . May GOD punish me and my family if I am lying to you all. To begin with &#8230;., my husband is a businessman. We used to be the happiest family with 5 children. My elder two daughters finished their studies but 3 others are still studying .Since last three years our business did not run well and my husband is in great debts and very difficult to support the family and children education and right now he is in great depression. My husband is desperately in need of some money to pay back the debts and give education to our children. My husband owes about US$ 850000 (interest is increasing every day) to Bank and private lenders. Initially, he took some loans from Bank and private lenders to do some business and build our house but for last three years his business didn\46#39;t run well and in great debts. Bank Authority and private lenders are pressing him to pay back the loan with interest and threaten to take him to Court. It is really devastating! Your small donation of US$ 850000 will uplift us and bring back the happiness in our family. Right now my family is in great tension and great trouble. Our family is also a very religious person and love to do charity works. When we were financially sound we used to do charity works. We will continue to do if GOD HELP us ! Please kindly help us.

My husband works hard but only makes min. wage. In this town, it\46#39;s small and many job opportunities are not here. There are drug addicts everywhere, the schools for our children are bad, and there is no further education for me and my husband here. With the the money, I would just like to move somewhere where we can get a better life, have my daughter, husband, and I go to school, be safe, and survive. We struggle with every one of his pay checks to try to stretch it as much as we can. We don\46#39;t qualify for assistance because we are only $2 over. I also have debt in medical bills that I am trying to pay off because of my frequent migraines and asthma. I have been applying to jobs around here and no one is hiring. If I just had enough to move, pay a bill, or anything to finish my education, that would be great. I do feel grateful for what I do have in life...a beautiful family, a roof over my head. But I really am hurting inside and praying every night for an opportunity to move forward with our lives. This whole town is full of poverty, and most are on food stamps. There is a nearby base that just layed off many people so they are now on assistance too. I know because my mom is one of them. I feel bad for what\46#39;s going on around me. I wish I could help her too. I wish I could have a room to take in my husbands dad that is mentally disabled and is having issues in the home he is in now. \74br /\76I believe other applicants need money just as bad too because they wouldn\46#39;t be asking. The only thing that separates us is how we will spend it. Mine is a wide range of things I need to pay bills, and get a better life. I want to further our education for a better future. I think the things that would separate me is that it\46#39;s happening not just to me, but all around me and in my family. So I wouldn\46#39;t just help my daughter, husband, and my self. I would take in my father in law from his situation, and help my mother. Even If it\46#39;s a small amount...I have learned recently how to stretch a dollar.

in elementary and highschool classes and who need my help after I graduate.I tried hard the first year and though I have good grades,now,I\46#39;m not in a psition to continue due to lack of financial support.Please,I need somebody out there who can really help me,whom I will always remember all my profession and all my life.This is not something fake,it is just a call from someone at a critical point of his life and his profession.Please,I really need your help in the name of GOD to continue my studies and to help my parents and younger siblings aho have no hope without me.\74br /\76

and apparently the checks have bounced and I have until the 16th of August to pay the checks off or face jail time and on top of that my car might be repossessed as well if I can&#8217;t pay $500 towards the car by the 16th of August.I thought there were enough funds to cover the checks but just not enough.\74br /\76 The car is a 2003 Ford Mustang GT and it has sentimental value because I got the car the very same day my lovely mother passed away on March 30th 2012,and my dad,Harold Jerry McCarter passed away 3 weeks later.(you can google Judith Gail McCarters death from last year in S.C.)\74br /\76 I don&#8217;t know what else to do but keep believing that God will get me out of this mess and restore my life back to better than before.\74br /\76Also the property taxes are past due on the car as well and need the funds to pay that.\74br /\76 So I need in total a round about figure of $2500 to $3500 to get back on my feet(I&#8217;m not suppose to be driving the Mustang but pray rhat the car is invisible to police)\74br /\76 I lost my job of 8 years in Sept. of 2012 and times are very tough,the little bit of inheritance from my parents death helped me this far.Jobs are hard to find but I feel as if I&#8217;m stranded without due to my vehicle not being totally legal.\74br /\76 My plan is to be a manager trainee at The Waffle House and go back to work,I&#8217;ve

And is someone going to be able to hear me. If not at least I would have some comfort in writing about it. As a little girl I was almost raped by our neighbour, luckily someone walked in and saved me. As far as I can remember I was a shy girl, scared of her own shadow, not social at school, getting bullied and never wanted to go to school. In high school I was also bullied due to my character. My mum has Bi-polar so I grew up trying to support her as I was the only one there. My brother was working and dad was out and about cheating on mum. After I completed High school I couldn\46#39;t get into University which I really wanted. Straight after that mum had a manic episode, I had never seen anything like it, she asked me who I was....I was so scared. I though I had lost mum forever. They put her in a mental institute and when she had her manic phases she was locked up into a hospital cell with a dirty bed and a cup to pee in. She stayed 9 days and was discharged but my dad didn\46#39;t stop his womanising habits, I don\46#39;t know how someone can be so careless. After all this stress I had a nervous breakdown at 20 and was diagnosed with major depression and panic disorder. It took 5 months for the meds to work, within those 5 months I couldn\46#39;t eat, sleep, get out of bed, basically I was just like a ghost. September 5 I felt really good, at last the meds were working. Behind mums, my brothers and my struggle there was something going on behind us, dad had another daughter from the woman he was having an affair with, and when he was working he was supporting them and stealing money from us, of course mum found out and there we go in the mental institute again. At a young age when you see your mum shackled to the bed and being drugged out by nurses you don\46#39;t take it so well, I\46#39;m scarred for life. As time went by and mum and dad had their domestics and he tried to hit her, pull her hair me and my brother tried to stop him. To be honest I never had a day in my life where I looked up at the sky and said \46quot;Thank you God. I\46#39;m alive\46quot;.\74br /\76I didn\46#39;t enjoy living I still don\46#39;t. One day I decided to end my life, so I took a cocktail of medicine, anything and everything, I closed the fridge door, then reopened it and took some more just to make sure I wasn\46#39;t coming back alive. I went walking to the park it was night, I wanted to pass out there and not at home. When I woke up I found myself in hospital. 2 days had passed, I was sleeping then I opened my eyes and though oh no, I\46#39;m such a failure. For those of you who think wanting to take your life is being selfish please don\46#39;t judge me because you are reading my story but you have no idea the emotional and psychological pain I went through, and with my illness I was never able to keep a job. So now at 32 I have nothing, nothing. I\46#39;m looking for work. I have been out of work for more than a year and I am feeling worthless because I want to help my family but I cant because I cant even get an interview. If you can help me, I would be thankful for the rest of my life because no one has ever helped me.

A few weeks before her mothers death her father escaped with her from home. He told Debby that her mother was crazy, and she was bad and dangerous for her. She never went to the funeral because her dad told that he didn\46#39;t know about it. Debby\46#39;s life was going to be a great hell. Her father gave her a new home together with her stepmother Janneke and stepsister Vanessa. A life full of hatred and jealousy, a stepmother whom she was abused , a stepsister who belittled her , and a father who did nothing about it. She always felt lonely and missed her mother who she never got to know very well. . She had no family and friends and was alone until she left the house at a age of 21. She married Martijn , and thought her terrible life at home was over and she can live on in freedom. Debby gave birth to 3 boys. She promised to herself that she would never give her kids the youth that she went trough. Besides her children and husband she had no family. Only a couple of friend, and one best friend.\74br /\76Many years past by. With a marriage of 9 years Debby is still not happy. Her husband is never there for her, has no time for her, and burried himself in his work.  Her husband promised to do better, to make more time for her and the children. Unfortunately this promise didn\46#39;t happen and Debby was angry, and as always feeling very lonely again. Debby and Martijn had a good friend. Trough the years Debby had a couple of friends, but this friend was  the only best friend for her and she talked with him about the situation many times and days. He could be there for here when she needed somone to talk and listen. After many times of talking, Debby started to get special feelings for him.  She decided to end the marriage, not because she had feelings for her friend, but her husband let her alone again, and didn\46#39;t make his promises come true. For her it was over, she gave her husband time to think about it. Then something strange happend. \74br /\76One afternoon Debby was going to pick her children up at school, but her husband was waiting for her there. When she arrived her husband came to her and with a mean voice he said, \46#39;your gonna come home right know, we have things to talk about\46#39;. Debby was really scared.  Her parents in law were going to take care of the children.\74br /\76 At home her husband told Debby that she must go to see a doctor. Debby was really scared and was thinking why. Her husband was not himself, looks like he was manipulated by his parents. Her husband said that she was very sick and must go to a hospital. Debby went angry and keep asking why?  She asked when will I see the children? Her husband said tommorow you will see them again. He kept on saying to her that she must go to see a doctor, Debby said no because there was nothing wrong with her. Martijn got angry and started yelling again and left. Debby was alone again en called her only best friend right away. She explained the situation. her friend said that he was on his way to her. In mean time Martijn came back, and said if you are not going to see a doctor, you will not see our children tommorow. Debby was sad and angry and escaped from her house. She was underway in her car and called her friend. Debby said she not wanted to go home today. So her best friend took her to a hotel just outside the city. The next day they were driving back home, Debby received a message from her husband that she must come home to talk things over. When she came home, her husband was home with his parents.\74br /\76Her parents in law always were jalous on her. Because her mother in law didn\46#39;t had a great conncetion with her son, that Debby got with her children. She always wanted to be the mother of Debby\46#39;s children. \74br /\76\74br /\076', 'timestamp': '1379637917835', 'permalink': 'http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment\0751379637917835#c2245582544954046203', 'author': {'name': 'Shayer Ram', 'avatarUrl': 'http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif', 'profileUrl': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/13915296641024205480'}, 'displayTime': '19 September 2013 17:45', 'deleteclass': 'item-control blog-admin pid-14978084'}, {'id': '7602862127427466184', 'body': 'Debby asked to them what they want from her. The plan of her parents in law and her own husband was to get Debby into the hospital ,so she can not take care of the children, and at the end her mother in law has the children as she always wanted. Many weeks ago they planned this and called all of Debby\46#39;s friends, and manipulated them to get her into the hospital. Her parents in law were yelling and screaming to Debby. Her husband did nothing, he all let this happen. Nothing was about the marriage anymore. Only that Debby was a bad mother, bad wife and a bad human being. this is what her parents in law said to her. After this her husband and her parents in law left the house, tooking away her car keys so she can\46#39;t go anywhere. And she was told that every 30 minutes a neighbour will come and see if Debby is stil in her house, if not, she will never see her children again. They left and Debby was alone again. her mother in law called Debby\46#39;s best friend and told that Debby was crazy, a bad mother an a bad human being, and that she must go to the hospital, because she cannot take care of herself. She was trying to manipulate him too, buthe was the only one who said \46#39;I not going to fall for this, I don\46#39;t believe you, how can you people do something like this\46#39;. Her mother in law was really angry and told Debby\46#39;s friend that she wil going to kill him. Her friend had secretly a big crush on Debby, she was the love of his life. At night her best friend came to help her, but she was scared that someone will see her go away. Her friend waited for midnight in his car down the street. At midnight they met, her friend told her that she must go to the police, and she decided to go to the police station first thing in the morning. Her friend took her there. debby explained everything to the police, but was shocked that the police said they would not be able to help her without any proof. Debby cried, what does she have to do, she want to see her children again, so her best friend decided to go after the children, and bring them back to his love of his life.\74br /\76Will it succeed to get the children back? Could she finally have a life in freedom after 35 years living in fear? Will her friend get his love of his life, and be part of his freedom?\74br /\76\74br /\76\74br /\76my email is amdshaye@hotmail.com\74br /\76rights can be sold by negotiation\74br /\76         2013 &#169; All rights reserved and owned by Shayer Ramsanjhul \46amp; Debby Angelique van den Berg\74br /\076', 'timestamp': '1379637961433', 'permalink': 'http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment\0751379637961433#c7602862127427466184', 'author': {'name': 'Shayer Ram', 'avatarUrl': 'http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif', 'profileUrl': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/13915296641024205480'}, 'displayTime': '19 September 2013 17:46', 'deleteclass': 'item-control blog-admin pid-14978084'}, {'id': '1366907378069182715', 'body': 'https://www.giveforward.com/fundraiser/2w43/help-ken-and-gill\46lt;--- this is a very shocking story any help will change those life\46#39;s forever, any donation will be appreciated', 'timestamp': '1380478820730', 'permalink': 'http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment\0751380478820730#c1366907378069182715', 'author': {'name': 'rachelle de leon', 'avatarUrl': 'http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif', 'profileUrl': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/07078115962022159391'}, 'displayTime': '29 September 2013 11:20', 'deleteclass': 'item-control blog-admin pid-1616725054'}, {'id': '4877364036618236436', 'body': 'yes hello me and a friend are starting an up and coming graphic design company and help is greatly appreciate my email is echevarriajeyddan@yahoo.com and his is everton_gentles@hotmail.com', 'timestamp': '1380741796494', 'permalink': 'http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment\0751380741796494#c4877364036618236436', 'author': {'name': 'jeyddan echevarria', 'avatarUrl': '//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-KxQW7V8etZI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC8/ixq7CETl-38/s512-c/photo.jpg', 'profileUrl': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/12821011156389237330'}, 'displayTime': '2 October 2013 12:23', 'deleteclass': 'item-control blog-admin pid-1966080809'}, {'id': '6529360719203929494', 'body': 'Doctor Cite is a virtual platform with real-time experience which is made possible by a team of Certified Doctors. \74a href\75\42http://www.doctorcite.com/\42 rel\75\42nofollow\42\76\74b\76Online Doctor Consultation\74/b\76\74/a\76 is one step away for the Patients.

I am keeping custody of my 2 girls but I cannot afford to support my kids on my high school education. After talking with my mom, I have decided to move up north with my kids and stay with my her while I get a college degree so I can give my girls a more secure future.\74br /\76\74br /\76The plan was to rent a 16 ft penske around Nov 8th. The Penske would allow me to rent a smaller truck and still tow my car. I planned on working until November 8th which would give me enough for the move and a little more till I could get a part time job so I could go to school full time. I told my boss of my plans and he asked me to turn in my resignation stating that I would be leaving on November 8th. I was let go right after. \74br /\76\74br /\76I am moving from Orlando, FL to Indiana. I have already been accepted to 2 colleges and planned to start my prerequisites in January. The truck with car dolly is around $680. The gas for 1000 miles would be around $400. So a total of around $1100 is needed.\74br /\76\74br /\76I feel embarrassed asking strangers for help but my kids\46#39; future are in my hands, and I am worried. If I can\46#39;t get to Indiana my kids will have to go with their mom, and that environment is not good. She works for a traveling company and my children need the safety of a stable life and better education than they could get there. They have a home school curriculum with about twenty students from all grade levels and a certified teacher that over sees the program. But, some kids don&#8217;t do well with that situation. My daughter is fifteen and she is only in the seventh grade. Since she started at a public school she is 2 points away from being a straight A student.\74br /\76\74br /\76Please, if you could find it in your heart to give any form of donation it would be greatly appreciated, whether it\46#39;s monetary or a company supplying a truck for moving I would be honored to prove my situation any way possible.

I\46#39;ve been reaching out to my community for about a month but i havnt found any help yet, I first want to tell you a little bit of my story. i have three beautiful children Elijah who is 5, Ella who is 3, and Emily who is 1. when Ella was three months old she was diagnosed with failure to thrive and has lived between home and the hospital. It\46#39;s a constant battle to get her to eat and get her weight up she still isn\46#39;t on the growth chart but she is trying hard :) she has a mountain of medical bills and medical needs that we can no longer keep up with because a year ago when Emily was born I had to stop working due to my health which started declining during my pregnancy with her, a few weeks before i was to deliver i experienced severe pain under my right rib and immediately went to the hospital. Shortly after a few tests and scans were done the doctor and his nurse rushed and and told me they had to take the baby right away because i was in kidney failure and my life and the babies was in danger. Emily was born a happy healthy beautiful girl and i was taken for more tests and surgeries. Several surgeries and medications later i was doing better. then a months later everything started going down hill again, they found out i had Lupus and RA. It\46#39;s a struggle everyday but I will never give up and let Lupus win! So as you can imagine with only my husband working and between my medical costs and Ella\46#39;s it has been extremely hard to pay the bills we have and we are losing where we are staying because we aren\46#39;t able to pay all of our rent anymore. So I thought I\46#39;d reach out to my community for help and prayers for my family. I\46#39;m asking that you please pray for our family and ask your friends to do so as well, and I do know that it is hard times for everyone right now but i have faith that someone will be able to help us either financially or materialistically, if there is anyway that you or someone you know would be able to help us out financially I\46#39;ve set up an account with Go fund me which is a safe and secure way to donate the link to it is http://www.gofundme.com/Give-a-home any amount helps! You can also contact me at my email at sarahlynturner1988@gmail.com  i really need to get the down payment for a home before we dont have a place to go if there is any way you can help please do. thank you so much for your time and prayers God bless.', 'timestamp': '1383246572994', 'permalink': 'http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment\0751383246572994#c3821264241330964354', 'author': {'name': 'Sarah turner', 'avatarUrl': 'http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif', 'profileUrl': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/12102486929136693690'}, 'displayTime': '31 October 2013 12:09', 'deleteclass': 'item-control blog-admin pid-245873626'}, {'id': '7095484450734425262', 'body': 'Hi my name is Dannielle I need 1,000 dollar\46#39;s.to get my out of jail because her ex boyfriend girlfriend said my mom never paid child support but I don\46#39;t know how she is involve with this she been in jail for 3 days now and we really need her here if you read this contact me banksdannielle@gmail.com', 'timestamp': '1383988422192', 'permalink': 'http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment\0751383988422192#c7095484450734425262', 'author': {'name': 'James Smith', 'avatarUrl': 'http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif', 'profileUrl': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/12868786775202928585'}, 'displayTime': '9 November 2013 01:13', 'deleteclass': 'item-control blog-admin pid-763892504'}, {'id': '7455846034156105220', 'body': 'I WANTED BIG MONEY ANY INTERST', 'timestamp': '1384780212489', 'permalink': 'http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment\0751384780212489#c7455846034156105220', 'author': {'name': 'Abraham', 'avatarUrl': 'http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif', 'profileUrl': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/03024309908854357987'}, 'displayTime': '18 November 2013 05:10', 'deleteclass': 'item-control blog-admin pid-1308955938'}, {'id': '6028968207354562366', 'body': 'Hi, my name is Jimmie, I am 45.

His now ex-wife left him about 2 years ago and made the divorce a rough one. It stressed him out something fierce, especially when he discovered that she had been taking several hundred dollars from the account before leaving. In July 2012, he turned 50. Less than 2 weeks after his birthday, he had a stroke. The local hospital rushed him to Saint Luke&#8217;s in Kansas City to run test and try to locate the cause of the stroke. During the tests, they found a lump on his neck. A specialist was called in and confirmed that it was cancer. Before they could do any treatment, he had a biopsy to try to locate the source, which they never found. During the biopsy, they removed his tonsils just to be on the safe side. Next his teeth had to be removed because of a degenerative disease in his gums (his mom also has it). The radiation would have caused his bone to soften and more problems if a tooth needed pulled. Within a month and a half, he had a stroke, cancer, tonsils out, and teeth removed. He began treatment, 45 rounds of radiation and 3 rounds of chemo. Half way in, he became really ill. He was placed in the hospital and was told he had C-Diff (a horrible intestinal disease that comes with a smell of death and the same smell as a taste in the mouth). They decided to put in a stomach feeding tube while he was in the hospital. The day after the feeding tube was put in, he had a massive clot go through heart and into his lungs. This almost killed him. He was told that his only option was to try an experimental drug to dissolve the clot, but was told that he would probably still die. He agreed to the drug and pulled through. After all this, he required around the clock care. His sister in law offer to take care of him for a couple weeks, during which time she stole almost $1000 from him. My family and I moved him in with us to care for him. All his stuff was moved out of his house and it was put up for rent, to try to generate an income during this. When his stuff was moved, a lot of it was taken by his family, so he lost a lot of his possessions that he needed for his work. He&#8217;s a rancher. His truck was even messed up by someone who said they were his friend, but they are not getting it fixed or anything. He finally completed his treatments and January 2013 he was told he was cancer free. Since then, his health has been getting better and better. He&#8217;s even back to work. But his finances are consistently getting worse. He had taken a $30,000 loan before he got sick to help pay for stuff from his divorce and some other bills. Paying this bill alone every month takes about half of his check. \74br /\76He has helped so many people and asked nothing in return. He won&#8217;t even ask for help, so I am asking for him. $30,000-40,000 would help get him out of this hole and get him back on his feet. Please, Pleases, Please help?\74br /\76If you have any questions or would like more information.

I have been feeling so alone and lost in my mess that I had no thought that anyone could be going through the same as me. I now see that there is so many of us in the same boat. I lost my job four days before Thanksgiving, I was a cook for a hotel. I hurt my back at home could not go to the doctor because my ins at work had not kicked in yet, only had two weeks to go. I was laid up for about a week. I was still in a lot of pain but needed to get back to work, no matter the pain. Well they were not having that. They Said I have to be able to pick up my 40 pounds. Well I did sign the paper work saying I could, when I first started there it was in my paper work. I can not even pick up 20 pounds right now as it is. I broke my back 13 years ago fell about three stories. But after a year of hell I got back upon my feet, but the back will always be a pain in my life. Well so much for that job. I have gone out and been online every day trying to find a job. I am use to waitress work in nice places but noting so far. I even went to subway, hamburger places and still nothing yet, I would love to work in anyone of these places I am so not a picky person. I applied for food stamps and they said yes I can get it. Well that was three weeks ago and still no card in the mail. I applied for a free phone that was also three weeks ago. I hated to do it but one has to eat and I had to get a phone because of jobs and I knew mine would be cut off. Well that happened today. I am thinking my cable and online will go next. Had to spend $75 of my jan- 1st rent to buy food for a month. I do not think I will ever eat beans, eggs, and rice again once I get back to my life, I mean I would, but after eating it for almost a month I would rather not for awhile. I am single 53 and alone so xmas really was pretty sad for me. All my kids are over seas right now, so the last thing they needed was a messed up xmas knowing mom was going through this, you know. I even emailed a church today asking them to pray for me because maybe just me doing it alone was not enough. But we are all so many so I am going to add all of you out there in my prayers, and I am going to pray really loud!!!!! And if you do not hear back from me on here it\46#39;s because of getting cut off line. If anyone can help me I would be so grateful and will pay it forward once I am on my feet. Thank you Susie McGee in SA. TX. Email susieq78240@yahoo.com And this is my 80 year old mothers # 210-695-3767. We are not close but I think she would take the call as long as she does not have to help. Sad but true.

It may already be too late for us. If we get evicted from our home, it will be the most devastating and demoralizing thing to ever happen to us and I literally don\46#39;t know where we\46#39;ll go.

They will be crushed and their world will unravel. Their school, their friends and safe familiar neighborhood will be a fleeting memory.  Please Help. We live modestly.   I am a good man with no criminal record of any kind. No substance abuse, no gambling nor vices. We are good people; friendly, caring, charitable citizens but, two years ago I became unemployed.  I have tried extremely hard to find a good steady job like I had before but still it all falls short. I\46#39;ve worked all of my life without ever needing public assistance. I always had a descent job.  I had a 22 year carrier in the USAFR.  I/we do not deserve to be subjected to hopelessness and despair. The economy has destroyed my credit. I spent all my savings over the last two years trying to stay afloat. I want to work. I want to have hope but my mind is consumed with the fear of homelessness. I\46#39;m not suicidal but it does cross my mind.  My self esteem and self confidence have been beaten down from this unnecessary and unfair sequence of events.  I have nowhere to turn nor anyone to turn to.  Please, help me keep our home.  I\46#39;ve been humbled.  The lack of money is the root of all misery.  I need a second chance to make it all right. \74br /\76Your foundation is really my last hope. I\46#39;ve often thought what I\46#39;d do if I\46#39;d won the lottery and I truly always come to the conclusion that I\46#39;d definitely give most of it away.  I envy you. You can bring such quick relief to pain, loss and suffering with just the stroke of your pen. That must feel good. I wish I could do it.  If I\46#39;m being crass, forgive me. Right now I\46#39;m not my old self.\74br /\76I just can\46#39;t lose this house. It would surely be the end of us. Please someone, please anyone give me a second chance to make it all right again.

We have PHCs but their condition is as bad as other govt. institutions.so we take a initiative to counter the problems faced by our people and make our community a better place for people with at least one thing they needed the most.\74br /\76In order to complete this project, we need all the equipment&#8217;s required in a hospital like x-ray machines , ct- scanner , MRI etc. we collected money from area people but that&#8217;s not enough to start a project like this. We would be most grateful if u donate us some money because we don&#8217;t have any financial assistance from any source to initiate our Project. However the initiative is small but someone has to take the responsibility so we are hoping it will bring changes in the health perspectives of the area. If you are interested, we will keep you informed with regular updates on the progress of our project.\74br /\76U Can help us with minimum donate 100 rupees in the favor of Anil kumar, PNB(PUNJAB NATIONAL BANK)branch- Talyana and Account number (1373000100544189)address is ..

My name is Ina and I am mother of two children. Two beautiful boys. I am 47 years old and I live in Europe, Latvia. I live alone since I broke up with my partner. That was around 10 years ago. It has been very hard to take care of two children and myself since then. I always have had big problems with my finances. I am working in high-school as a secretary for about 17 years now, but the salary I am earning is quite less. There was times when I even had no money to buy food for ourselves, not speaking of anything else. That is why I had to ask for help at the banks. They helped, of course, and everything was fine till I had to start paying that money back. I started missing my terms because of not having enough money and debts started to grow. It has been two years now since I am struggling with my debts and the problem is, I cannot get rid of them. I have no other family members or friends who could help me with money, and banks are refusing giving me more. There is big possibility that I could actually lose our home. And if that happens, I have nowhere else to go. And that is sad because life forced me to get in this situation I am in now. I always have tried to do best for my kids, but it is extremely hard for one parent. I am desperate, I don\46#39;t know what else I can do. I have tried to look for some people who maybe could help, but no luck so far. The amount I am asking is 2.000$.

I have had no major issues as this recent time. I applied for Short Term Disability through Verizon via MetLife and was denied for both my original claim and my appeal. I have a pending Long-Term Claim pending.\74br /\76\74br /\76I have not been mentally able to work since March 2013. I have been seeing a psychiatrist and a thereapist for the problems I am having.

I am 48 years old, we have three childrens that depends of us, my husband is that type of person that likes to work hard but since a year he can\46#39;t find a job righ now. I am very sick, the doctor diagnosed me with cancer (Lymphoma nohawkins) since the diagnoses came we have had a lot of problems more that we have ever had but with the help of some friends and God we are able to buy foods, pay bills, rent etc. When I arrive home from quimio I go into the kitchen and start cooking food such as tamales, empanadas, gorditas to sell so we can make some money to pay the rent but sometimes I can\46#39;t do it, I can\46#39;t hold all of this, I don\46#39;t feel good some times the quimio is hard although some times God help me. The docter said that I need rest after quimo and I don\46#39;t do it .I try and try to make some food for my kids and always tell my children that we will be able to make it thorough with a better house (This is our dreams) that they have their own rooms. I believe that we are a people that like to work but with all of these problems I don\46#39;t know what to do. We try our best to make everything change for better. This is frustrating for me to know that I can\46#39;t be there for my children the right way as a mom because quimio for Lymphoma is very stressing for me and puts me in a worst situation but just thinking everyday to earn a bit of money to pay for the rent is all I need that can help us. Please don\46#39;t forget me I hope that you help us. I truly would give all my life to help my husband and children. They notice whenever I feel sick and it makes me feel bad. This is so frustrating and it\46#39;s all about the money, some prescriptions I can\46#39;t afford, rent and another problems I have about the quimio and I cant attended my children or medicine for me to feel better because I don\46#39;t have money. Sometimes my ten years old son is sad seeing me like this and I know that they feel sad. Its not fair for them to feel like this when they can be happy, at that edge all of this make cry.

My ex husband committed suicide in 2008, so I\46#39;m the only parent left for my children. I now have grandchildren and  my biggest dream is for my children and grandchildren to actually be able to say, \46quot;let\46#39;s go to grandma\46#39;s house.\46quot; I dream of having holiday\46#39;s, birthday\46#39;s, dinners, etc., in a real house of my own. I dream of my precious dogs having a beautiful yard to run and play in, they are my babies now that my children are grown. Oprah, I imagine on a daily basis of moving into MY own home, decorating it beautifully and comfortably for my family to come visit, especially my grandchildren. I always imagine what it would feel like to have solid roots, real grounding, I imagine it must be wonderful. I see my grandchildren running and playing in my beautiful backyard. I am now living in an 60 year old run down house in a bad part of town until the owners sell it, kind of a house sitter I guess. Anyway Oprah, that\46#39;s been my life long dream, MY OWN beautiful house.

The orphanage provides accommodation, feeding, education,health care, clothing and all it takes to live to these kids who are vulnerable and less privileged.website:  www.abetterworld-cm.org Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ABetterWorldOrphanage\74br /\76As the number of the kids has increased with more orphaned babies depending to survive by artificial milk which is expensive here and the older kids also advancing in education with one of them in a medical school, a few of them in High school, some of them in secondary school and the others in kinder garden and primary school,while there are other kids with ill health cases like HIV, Asthma, etc that need monthly medical attention, the financial demand has greatly increased including feeding or providing three times meals daily for 44 children. This has led me to land myself into a series of huge debts just to make sure the kids have the care and attention they deserve. As I am writing to you one of the creditors has taken a decision from the court to take over the house the orphans and I live in by the 10th of April 2012 if I don\46#39;t pay the money I owe him. Where will I go with all these kids who all depend now on me as their only source of help? I love them so much and they love me too. We are a family now and don\46#39;t don\46#39;t deserve to be scattered apart just because of money. I am so troubled. Because of this trouble the kids can barely eat well for lack of finances.

She is a veteran herself, who was diagnosed with leukemia It all started when i was in 5th grade. She was a juvenile probation officer for years, she was on her way to court and fell on black ice. Form that fall she messed her back, neck, and shoulders up. she tried to push through it but she gave in went to the hospital and it was NOT GOOD. She had different surgeries but nothing worked it got worse and worse. she cant really walk or even lift over a gallon of milk. It\46#39;s just been me and her so i had to grow up FAST. She was unable to work so the bills piled up fast with the house.I remember walking home from middle school and cutting through the hospital to go see her on my way home. That was all of middle school and when i was 13 that when she was diagnosed with meningitis, She was being read her last rights when a doctor ended up coming and and some how saving her life. We thought it could never get worse. Then a few years later on December 27th 2009 we got the call that changed both of our lives forever. She had been diagnosed with leukemia and apparently had it for years without anyone catching it. I was scared but had to be the man i had been since around 12 years old. I wanted to show her that she didnt have to worry about me i was an adult and I would be okay she needed to worry about her. I wanted as crazy as it sounds now to think about, but i wanted her to know that she didnt have to fight or hold on for me i would be okay. So I joined the ARMY and in less than 2 months i was in test taken and had a date to leave. I joined that national guard so i could still be home. So life went on she did really really good with everything. I came home took care of her and myself of course and her taking care of my grandmother. well eventually she ran out of her settlement from court and the family was helping as well as me giving almost everything i had. God Bless her soul my grandmother passed away and my mom was broken i thought maybe she would give up feeling like she was alone. But she was able to really help us out when she passed and left my mom an okay amount of money (not a lot to most people). so with that and my money we were okay again took our first vacation last summer actually. But what i didnt know is that we were broke then again she and paid bills in advance being smart. So now for the past few months it has been bad again and what i call bad is bad (could always be worse). But I am working at a 9$ an hour job and getting NO hours. And now we are to the point that come the end of April we have my paychecks and that is it. i get paid every other week and getting no hours my check today was $123. I have started s Donation page for her and tried a Social Media help and we got 75$ the past about 2 weeks and hey that is great that is a bill you know. But with a mortgage of $1050 i think that wont cut it. I know we could sell it and get an appt or she move in with family and me ill figure it out. But I will NOT let her work as hard as she did be through the hell she went though with my asshole dad. Work as hard as she did working going to school again fighting this hard to give up in her dream. She walked though the doors here when we bought it and said \46quot; i want to live and die in this house\46quot;. I knew she didnt mean die here but she meant this is what she wants to be happy she wants this forever this is it. And i WONT let here give up on that i cant. i have asked my dad and friends but nothing. and if mu aunts or uncles help she will pay what she can after court for disability. but i hate to see her have nothing ALL the time. SO I AM LITERALLY BEGGING YOU PLEASE HELP EVEN IF IT IS JUST LIKE $7000 SO WE CAN BE OKAY FOR A LITTLE. I have always done what i can to help but at this point I am lost and dont know what to do. I dont even know if this is real but please please help us.

In 2012 I moved back to Florida in the hopes of finding a job but I didn\46#39;t find one and I spent all of my money staying in a hotel and when it ran out I ended up in a shelter where I stayed for 9 1/2 months and was diagnosed with severe clinical depression and PTSD. I am still looking for a job and still can\46#39;t find one. Not one close enough to work into picking up my granddaughter anyway; and I have no one to pick her up and watch her until I get home.

I have tried everything to try and get a car but I just can\46#39;t afford it, I can\46#39;t even afford furniture for my house we have a bed and that\46#39;s all the furniture we have. I signed up for freecharitycars.org and I am still on the waiting list but it seem like it takes a long time, I see people who have been there for up to 4 years. I don\46#39;t have a long list of friends, like I had when I had money; it\46#39;s kind of hard. So if you read my story and can help and know anyone else that can help I would appreciate it, I am just looking for some help to get back on my feet. A car would help me do this, because I would have the transportation that I need to get to the jobs that am being offered and get back on time to pick up my granddaughter. So please help if you can, even if it\46#39;s just $1.00 dollar every little bit counts.

In 2005, we sealed our love with a ceremony with our closets friends. Even though this was not legal in Arizona in our hearts it was. \74br /\76Ten years later, Sharon is my best friend, the love of my life, my soulmate, my partner, my confident, and I hope the mother of our baby. \74br /\76At the age of 21, I was told I was unable to have children due to endometriosis. This was heart breking to me because I come from big family and family is very important me and now us.\74br /\76Our dream is to be a moms but being in a same sex couple relationship this is not easy. We have tried many IUIs and few IVFs with no positive result. At the first try thru IUI we got pregnant but at eight weeks we had a miscarriage. At this point we have reached the limit of our resources. \74br /\76We have realized that there are many babies that need be love and care for. We love to adopt a baby.\74br /\76We are beyond ready to be moms but adoption is very expensive and we need your help. You are probably wondering why we need money but we have found an agency that asure us a newborn baby, to start the process we need to come up with $20,000.00 at the time of signing the contract the rest of the money is due when the baby is born. We have tried many IUI and a few IVF with no luck, the next step for us is to try to adopt. We are a serious couple, we have been together more than 10 years now. We truly would like to be mothers and with your help we have hope! Without your support it will be very difficult to full fill our dream of adopting a baby. We are grateful to share with you our hopes and dreams, we have realize that to be able to love and nurturing a child is more important than to give birth. \46quot;It\46#39;s not how much we give but how much love with put into giving\46quot; thank you soooo much.

I\46#39;m the person who would be loaning money, or helping out strangers. Unfortunately, the economy, and other challenges have over wrought my ability to stand independently, right now. If I could conjure up a way and a means for myself to overcome these financial difficulties, I would. I need to be direct, I am 52 years old, and I have a 30% percent loss of use in my right leg, due to an injury on the job in 2012. I live with two roommates in a cramped apartment, in Woodside Queens, but thankfully no one is difficult to get along with. After having a disastrous year finding work, I nearly gave up, but I still pound the pavement, and the computer keys. Having a sense of humor is extremely important, in times of strife, it keeps the heart healthy. I am financially depleted, for three months since last December 2013, I managed to stay afloat assisting a real estate agent, by showing apartments, but the crest wave of potential tenants has run dry over the last two months. The real estate agent offered a percentage of every commission made on any apartment I secured a tenant for. This is not a permanent job, only a part time position, in the likelihood of my getting full time employment. Now I am two months behind in my rent, I need at least $1500.00 dollars to get me back on track, for the time being, but I would prefer taking it as a loan. There is a chance of my getting employment within the next two weeks, but it is not going to help me now, I really need this money, especially since one of my roommates will be moving out in a few weeks, into his own place. I beg of anyone within the frame of my character, to accept my truth, and consider assisting me at this time. I am not a leach, or an opportunist, I hate beggars of any sort, but I have been reduced to begging myself, it is a daunting position to be in, especially being an American born citizen. My email address is michael.a.g1@hotmail.com. Thank You.

You do have food.. you do have a house.. you do have cars... your husband have a good work.... But we at a place where we met our 4 sons needs to. All 4 of them have had struggles to study. Learning diss-abilities. My eldest have Autism, my second son has Tourette syndrome, my 3th son has auditive perception problem, my 4th son have had meningitis as baby and have a shunt and costs us millions with the shunt. We try to let them all 4 have a normal life. My husband take on a work that keep him away to help with their needs. They cant get really good works with good salaries and my husband salary had to carries al four. The youngest try to study in collage for mechanic, in Namibia Oshikati, but he really do struggle. At the end all the carrying of all four son take its toll and we in financial despair. To look after all four, pay their house bills and keep their moral high it cost as N$ Namibia dollars 40 000 a month and still we had our normal bills to pay to. All I say if we just can built our home finished and pay the loans and overdrafts... then we can have a brake. We do budget good and I know their is not wrong with our coping with money, but the daily caring all four. Their salary is N$ Namibia Dollars 2000 but that can not handle even a house per month. They hard workers but only can get casual labors work. I pray to God for a brake. Still His grace is so amazing on us. Do I really need to cry? My head say only 3 million N$ Namibia dollars will really give us a brake to brake clean... But still we carry on. We love life and we do care. I am a pastoral counselor and work in community help people out with life skills and lift their moral so that they also feel their is better way of living. So do we really need that brake? Do I need to cry?</p><span id='bc_0_1MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1396741359'><a o='d' target='_self' href='http://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=3165484205805005056&amp;postID=1311610133039952615'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_1BR' class='comment-replies'><span id='bc_0_1b+seed5Sk_D' kind='d'><div id='bc_0_0T' class='comment-thread inline-thread' kind='t'   t='0' u='0'><span id='bc_0_0TT' class='thread-toggle thread-expanded' kind='g'><span id='bc_0_0TA' class='thread-arrow'></span><span id='bc_0_0TN' class='thread-count'><span id='bc_0_0TNT' style='display: none;'></span><span id='bc_0_0TNU' style='display: none;'></span><a href='javascript:;' target='_self'>Replies</a><div id='bc_0_0TD' class='thread-dropContainer thread-expanded'><span class='thread-drop'></span></div></span></span><ol id='bc_0_0TC' class='thread-chrome thread-expanded'><div><li id='bc_0_0B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-KZvSUuiqPdk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/svcRehvsJ4M/s512-c/photo.jpg'></img></div><div id='c426397954692977285' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_0M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.blogger.com/profile/01764326454610423895'>szabo timea</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment=1382031271604#c426397954692977285'>17 October 2013 10:34</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_0MC' class='comment-content'>Hello we want to make our own business,but have no place for work in reconditionig,no home or place our own,nor money to buy one.<br />We tried to make one place for funding,no result.If you can fund us or can help us in this matter would be very grateful.<br />http://www.gofundme.com/4s1i88</p><span id='bc_0_0MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-304421448'><a o='d' target='_self' href='http://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=3165484205805005056&amp;postID=426397954692977285'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_0BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_0B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li></div><div id='bc_0_0I' class='continue' kind='ci'><a href='javascript:;' target='_self'>Reply</a></div></ol><div id='bc_0_0T_box' class='comment-replybox-thread'></div></div></span></div><div id='bc_0_1B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_2B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DZqeH26_IF4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACI/B_aEVYgBD-8/s512-c/photo.jpg'></img></div><div id='c8553616630572342399' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_2M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.blogger.com/profile/18107647642934066157'>Marlo Ettien</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment=1371696223254#c8553616630572342399'>19 June 2013 19:43</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_2MC' class='comment-content'>I have a pressing matter for which I am asking all my friends, acquaintances and family to assist me with.

This is the same man that tried to kill me in 1995. Then I meet the man of my dreams and everything was going great until I started to remember what I buried for years. Being molested  by my sister from the age of 3 until 11. I told my parents about it a number of time&#8217;s to make it stop and all I was told was that she would never do this to me. So I started thinking it was okay until I left at the age of 17 (1983). I moved in with my ex and that was when the abuse from him started until he almost killed me in 1995. From 1995 until 2001 I was raising my girls on my own this is when I meet the man of my dreams. He stepped in as dad for the girls and treats them like his own. We put them thru college and are still paying. Because we had little to no help from him. I just slowly start to shut down because in my past My family would say your not worth it and you mess everything up, because everyone in my family didn&#8217;t care I did care what happen to me. This is one of the reasons why we are in money problems because I just didn&#8217;t care, what happened to me. For years I just dealt with it until I couldn&#8217;t any more. I really care what happened now but it my be to late and now I am under doctors care. I suffer from PTSD and severe depression. I know with their help I am worth it. They also helped me thru the death of my Mom 12-13-12. But now we are going to lose our house if $16,500 isn&#8217;t paid by June 28 o our house will go out to auction on Aug 15th. for back taxes. I have let my family down and now if we lose the house I don&#8217;t know how my mental health is going to take it. Any amount would help out. PLEASE can you help.

I am a GOD fearing person and religious too. So I swear in the name of GOD that whatever I narrate below is all true . May GOD punish me and my family if I am lying to you all. To begin with &#8230;., my husband is a businessman. We used to be the happiest family with 5 children. My elder two daughters finished their studies but 3 others are still studying .Since last three years our business did not run well and my husband is in great debts and very difficult to support the family and children education and right now he is in great depression. My husband is desperately in need of some money to pay back the debts and give education to our children. My husband owes about US$ 850000 (interest is increasing every day) to Bank and private lenders. Initially, he took some loans from Bank and private lenders to do some business and build our house but for last three years his business didn&#39;t run well and in great debts. Bank Authority and private lenders are pressing him to pay back the loan with interest and threaten to take him to Court. It is really devastating! Your small donation of US$ 850000 will uplift us and bring back the happiness in our family. Right now my family is in great tension and great trouble. Our family is also a very religious person and love to do charity works. When we were financially sound we used to do charity works. We will continue to do if GOD HELP us ! Please kindly help us.

I am currently seeking for financial assistance from the giving hand. I live with my diabetic mother, my two unemployed sister and brother and I am the last born in the family. I worked in the Aviation Industry for a period of six difficult years supporting my family in the process, but even my wage was just not adequate to sustain me and my family until the contract ended.<br /><br />Working in this industry made open my eyes and broadened my awareness in so many avenues and departments and one of them was the Pilots (flying profession). Part of me requesting for financial assistance is to not only empower myself but also give back to the underprivileged young children from poor communities who also have big dreams of working as pilots as this is a very expensive course to do in this country. there are  few schools of pilots that offer this program but without any financial offer in hand it is impossible to even get off the ground. I therefore realized that if I could start a Pilot Learner-ship program, identify these potential young students around the world and engage with some of the experienced pilots, together we can change the world and make it a better place.<br />I am adamant that this is a life changing and an exciting career, without asking for your financiaI assistance i cannot do it alone.<br /><br />Most kindly regards<br />M Petse<br /><br /> +27836719394 (South Africa)<br />email: mbupetse@gmail.com</p><span id='bc_0_15MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-203436730'><a o='d' target='_self' href='http://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=3165484205805005056&amp;postID=4184695497592315458'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_15BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_15B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_16B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b36-rounded.png'></img></div><div id='c3067021166983580218' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_16M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.blogger.com/profile/17680478661962900424'>MichelleV</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment=1375418687835#c3067021166983580218'>1 August 2013 21:44</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_16MC' class='comment-content'>By way of introduction my name is Michelle, a single mother of two girls 7&amp;10. I normally work two jobs to keep us afloat. We have set up a website for donations that will be used to pay medical bills, hospital bills, doctor co~pays, back rent, and school expenses due to a financial hardship that has affected us drastically. For the first time in my life I am on state assistance, barely get enough food stamps to feed my girls. As their mother, I have been unable to return to my work due to a series of surgery(s) and need assitance in paying hospital bills, lab bills, medical, dental, and vision insurance. Both girls have also incurred medical/hospital expenses too. I know I will get back on my feet someday, so I pray for miracles every day. We have sold all of our furniture and most of our house hold belongings to pay for insurance premiums, copays, bills, hospital bills, as my youngest has a life threatening kidney condition that gets monitored at Vanderbilt. We expect nothing and appreciate anything anyone can do.  Your kindness would be greatly appreciated, would touch our hearts, and change our lives. We are also facing eviction from our home, due to getting behind in our rent. <br />We all sleep in one bed, an inflatable air mattress, with the youngest at the foot of our bed on the floor.Please help my girls and I, we can&#39;t do it alone!

Not only would like to finish my last 3 courses to get my degree and hopefully go on to a university. But I have hardly any funds and recently lost my job. My husband works hard but only makes min. wage. In this town, it&#39;s small and many job opportunities are not here. There are drug addicts everywhere, the schools for our children are bad, and there is no further education for me and my husband here. With the the money, I would just like to move somewhere where we can get a better life, have my daughter, husband, and I go to school, be safe, and survive. We struggle with every one of his pay checks to try to stretch it as much as we can. We don&#39;t qualify for assistance because we are only $2 over. I also have debt in medical bills that I am trying to pay off because of my frequent migraines and asthma. I have been applying to jobs around here and no one is hiring. If I just had enough to move, pay a bill, or anything to finish my education, that would be great. I do feel grateful for what I do have in life...a beautiful family, a roof over my head. But I really am hurting inside and praying every night for an opportunity to move forward with our lives. This whole town is full of poverty, and most are on food stamps. There is a nearby base that just layed off many people so they are now on assistance too. I know because my mom is one of them. I feel bad for what&#39;s going on around me. I wish I could help her too. I wish I could have a room to take in my husbands dad that is mentally disabled and is having issues in the home he is in now. <br />I believe other applicants need money just as bad too because they wouldn&#39;t be asking. The only thing that separates us is how we will spend it. Mine is a wide range of things I need to pay bills, and get a better life. I want to further our education for a better future. I think the things that would separate me is that it&#39;s happening not just to me, but all around me and in my family. So I wouldn&#39;t just help my daughter, husband, and my self. I would take in my father in law from his situation, and help my mother. Even If it&#39;s a small amount...I have learned recently how to stretch a dollar. Also, I have always had faith and stayed on the positive side of things.

recently I have been struggling alot and sweating alot too,so here it goes.<br /> PLEASE READ!<br /> I wrote a check to cover my rent and car payment in July and apparently the checks have bounced and I have until the 16th of August to pay the checks off or face jail time and on top of that my car might be repossessed as well if I can&#8217;t pay $500 towards the car by the 16th of August.I thought there were enough funds to cover the checks but just not enough.<br /> The car is a 2003 Ford Mustang GT and it has sentimental value because I got the car the very same day my lovely mother passed away on March 30th 2012,and my dad,Harold Jerry McCarter passed away 3 weeks later.(you can google Judith Gail McCarters death from last year in S.C.)<br /> I don&#8217;t know what else to do but keep believing that God will get me out of this mess and restore my life back to better than before.<br />Also the property taxes are past due on the car as well and need the funds to pay that.<br /> So I need in total a round about figure of $2500 to $3500 to get back on my feet(I&#8217;m not suppose to be driving the Mustang but pray rhat the car is invisible to police)<br /> I lost my job of 8 years in Sept. of 2012 and times are very tough,the little bit of inheritance from my parents death helped me this far.Jobs are hard to find but I feel as if I&#8217;m stranded without due to my vehicle not being totally legal.<br /> My plan is to be a manager trainee at The Waffle House and go back to work,I&#8217;ve already spoke with a manager of The Waffle House and was told they need managers and are training.<br /> Any help will be GREATLY APPRECIATED.May the Lord bless and prosper you. beacon1967@gmail.com<br /> Jeff McCarter 864-237-5280<br /> 110 Village Park Drive Apt.57<br />

class='comment-content'>I am a recently divorced mom of four little girls. I also have Systemic Lupus, Fibromialgia, and COPD. I work from home making a quarter a minute answering the phone for infomercials, and I use my child support to pay the monthly bills. We don&#39;t have any extra. This house is paid for and its all we have. Stability for my girls is critical. I have one daughter who is ADHD and Dyslexic and my littlest daughter Makayla has Aspergers, and is dyslexic as well I homeschool her and one of my older children who has apraxia of speech. A day or two ago I got a certified letter from the tax assessors office saying I owe all this money for taxes,<br /><br />Some people asked if this was a scam you are welcome to see for yourself by going to the assessors office website and viewing my tax bills. simply go to http://in-lake-assessor.governmaxa.com/propertymax/rover30.asp?sid=16A19D06BF2441FDA3EAEE5DC1F2867D and click guest, then Type in Anna Malik you can see for yourself our family needs your help!<br /><br /><br />Usually use my tax check to pay them but it wasn&#39;t much this year, and we needed a car because we didn&#39;t have one.I didn&#39;t think this would happen so quickly. The Assessors office won&#39;t wait until March for the new Tax check.<br /><br /><br />Basically I am constantly in a race between keeping the lights on, internet on and food on the table and gas in the car. We don&#39;t even have Cable Television and havent for months.<br /><br /><br />Our family needs your help, I can&#39;t bare the thought of losing this house, I don&#39;t know where we would go, we have absolutely no family; and no friends.<br /><br /><br />I am really really really scared.<br /><br /><br />I don&#39;t know what else to do but to ask for help on this site. I figure if 1000 people donate just four dollars then we can pay this bill and the one that is coming up in a month or so.<br /><br /><br />I live in Lake county,In. You never know when the bills are coming; there is no rhyme or reason to it. Its just pay me. I hate to ask for help. I hate the position we are in. However, I need to swallow what little pride I have left to keep a roof over m girls head, that&#39;s all that matters right now.

I am 25 and currently a husband and father of 2 daughters as well as a step daughter and step son. I am taking care of all of them with only my job alone and I LITERALLY came from nothing to what I have today. Most people would say, &quot; well work hard and be proud and keep at it,&quot; but it is so hard in today&#39;s world. I am trying to just purchase my home that is $65,000 . I have been renting it until I can build my credit to get a loan. It is seeming impossible because I am paying for all of us so I don&#39;t have money to constantly buy things to build my credit just so I can get a loan and go into debt even longer. I ask for help..AT LEAST with my home...I live in Mississippi in a nice community and want only the best for my family..I know I am young but I chose to take care of my family instead of going out and doing worldly things and wasting time. Any help is appreciated..if not for me at least for my little ones.

And is someone going to be able to hear me. If not at least I would have some comfort in writing about it. As a little girl I was almost raped by our neighbour, luckily someone walked in and saved me. As far as I can remember I was a shy girl, scared of her own shadow, not social at school, getting bullied and never wanted to go to school. In high school I was also bullied due to my character. My mum has Bi-polar so I grew up trying to support her as I was the only one there. My brother was working and dad was out and about cheating on mum. After I completed High school I couldn&#39;t get into University which I really wanted. Straight after that mum had a manic episode, I had never seen anything like it, she asked me who I was....I was so scared. I though I had lost mum forever. They put her in a mental institute and when she had her manic phases she was locked up into a hospital cell with a dirty bed and a cup to pee in. She stayed 9 days and was discharged but my dad didn&#39;t stop his womanising habits, I don&#39;t know how someone can be so careless. After all this stress I had a nervous breakdown at 20 and was diagnosed with major depression and panic disorder. It took 5 months for the meds to work, within those 5 months I couldn&#39;t eat, sleep, get out of bed, basically I was just like a ghost. September 5 I felt really good, at last the meds were working. Behind mums, my brothers and my struggle there was something going on behind us, dad had another daughter from the woman he was having an affair with, and when he was working he was supporting them and stealing money from us, of course mum found out and there we go in the mental institute again. At a young age when you see your mum shackled to the bed and being drugged out by nurses you don&#39;t take it so well, I&#39;m scarred for life. As time went by and mum and dad had their domestics and he tried to hit her, pull her hair me and my brother tried to stop him. To be honest I never had a day in my life where I looked up at the sky and said &quot;Thank you God. I&#39;m alive&quot;.<br />I didn&#39;t enjoy living I still don&#39;t. One day I decided to end my life, so I took a cocktail of medicine, anything and everything, I closed the fridge door, then reopened it and took some more just to make sure I wasn&#39;t coming back alive. I went walking to the park it was night, I wanted to pass out there and not at home. When I woke up I found myself in hospital. 2 days had passed, I was sleeping then I opened my eyes and though oh no, I&#39;m such a failure. For those of you who think wanting to take your life is being selfish please don&#39;t judge me because you are reading my story but you have no idea the emotional and psychological pain I went through, and with my illness I was never able to keep a job. So now at 32 I have nothing, nothing. I&#39;m looking for work. I have been out of work for more than a year and I am feeling worthless because I want to help my family but I cant because I cant even get an interview. If you can help me, I would be thankful for the rest of my life because no one has ever helped me.

I&#39;m all my kids have and hate to disappoint them. If given a chance I will pay back every dime that I borrow. At this time the amount I owe is $1622.00 which you can pay directly to my apartments, which is Town Parc Apts in Amarillo Texas <br /> their phone number is 806-358-1300. I have just had a rough few years and found myself in a very tight spot. In December 2009 my dad passed away and then my mother right behind him in February 2010. Things seemed ok for a while then last November on my Moms birthday my brother took his life in my house, where I and my kids found him. So we moved in March of this year only to be at the verge of being put out. At times I feel like giving up but by the Grace of God I keep pushing and praying that God send me a guardian angel. Not trying to scam anyone but this is how desperate I am at this time, that I would take a chance on a complete stranger helping me and my kids, because all that stood up at the funeral and said they would be there are gone. I do have three sisters but they are struggling just as bad as me and I hate to burden them. May God truly bless you regardless if you help me or not. Thanks for listening to my life complaints.

A few weeks before her mothers death her father escaped with her from home. He told Debby that her mother was crazy, and she was bad and dangerous for her. She never went to the funeral because her dad told that he didn&#39;t know about it. Debby&#39;s life was going to be a great hell. Her father gave her a new home together with her stepmother Janneke and stepsister Vanessa. A life full of hatred and jealousy, a stepmother whom she was abused , a stepsister who belittled her , and a father who did nothing about it. She always felt lonely and missed her mother who she never got to know very well. . She had no family and friends and was alone until she left the house at a age of 21. She married Martijn , and thought her terrible life at home was over and she can live on in freedom. Debby gave birth to 3 boys. She promised to herself that she would never give her kids the youth that she went trough. Besides her children and husband she had no family. Only a couple of friend, and one best friend.<br />Many years past by. With a marriage of 9 years Debby is still not happy. Her husband is never there for her, has no time for her, and burried himself in his work.  Her husband promised to do better, to make more time for her and the children. Unfortunately this promise didn&#39;t happen and Debby was angry, and as always feeling very lonely again. Debby and Martijn had a good friend. Trough the years Debby had a couple of friends, but this friend was  the only best friend for her and she talked with him about the situation many times and days. He could be there for here when she needed somone to talk and listen. After many times of talking, Debby started to get special feelings for him.  She decided to end the marriage, not because she had feelings for her friend, but her husband let her alone again, and didn&#39;t make his promises come true. For her it was over, she gave her husband time to think about it. Then something strange happend. <br />One afternoon Debby was going to pick her children up at school, but her husband was waiting for her there. When she arrived her husband came to her and with a mean voice he said, &#39;your gonna come home right know, we have things to talk about&#39;. Debby was really scared.  Her parents in law were going to take care of the children.<br /> At home her husband told Debby that she must go to see a doctor. Debby was really scared and was thinking why. Her husband was not himself, looks like he was manipulated by his parents. Her husband said that she was very sick and must go to a hospital. Debby went angry and keep asking why?  She asked when will I see the children? Her husband said tommorow you will see them again. He kept on saying to her that she must go to see a doctor, Debby said no because there was nothing wrong with her. Martijn got angry and started yelling again and left. Debby was alone again en called her only best friend right away. She explained the situation. her friend said that he was on his way to her. In mean time Martijn came back, and said if you are not going to see a doctor, you will not see our children tommorow. Debby was sad and angry and escaped from her house. She was underway in her car and called her friend. Debby said she not wanted to go home today. So her best friend took her to a hotel just outside the city. The next day they were driving back home, Debby received a message from her husband that she must come home to talk things over. When she came home, her husband was home with his parents.<br />Her parents in law always were jalous on her. Because her mother in law didn&#39;t had a great conncetion with her son, that Debby got with her children. She always wanted to be the mother of Debby&#39;s children. <br /><br /></p><span id='bc_0_31MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-14978084'><a o='d' target='_self' href='http://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=3165484205805005056&amp;postID=2245582544954046203'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_31BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_31B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_33B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b36-rounded.png'></img></div><div id='c7602862127427466184' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_33M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.blogger.com/profile/13915296641024205480'>Shayer Ram</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment=1379637961433#c7602862127427466184'>19 September 2013 17:46</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_33MC' class='comment-content'>Debby asked to them what they want from her. The plan of her parents in law and her own husband was to get Debby into the hospital ,so she can not take care of the children, and at the end her mother in law has the children as she always wanted. Many weeks ago they planned this and called all of Debby&#39;s friends, and manipulated them to get her into the hospital. Her parents in law were yelling and screaming to Debby. Her husband did nothing, he all let this happen. Nothing was about the marriage anymore. Only that Debby was a bad mother, bad wife and a bad human being. this is what her parents in law said to her. After this her husband and her parents in law left the house, tooking away her car keys so she can&#39;t go anywhere. And she was told that every 30 minutes a neighbour will come and see if Debby is stil in her house, if not, she will never see her children again. They left and Debby was alone again. her mother in law called Debby&#39;s best friend and told that Debby was crazy, a bad mother an a bad human being, and that she must go to the hospital, because she cannot take care of herself. She was trying to manipulate him too, buthe was the only one who said &#39;I not going to fall for this, I don&#39;t believe you, how can you people do something like this&#39;. Her mother in law was really angry and told Debby&#39;s friend that she wil going to kill him. Her friend had secretly a big crush on Debby, she was the love of his life. At night her best friend came to help her, but she was scared that someone will see her go away. Her friend waited for midnight in his car down the street. At midnight they met, her friend told her that she must go to the police, and she decided to go to the police station first thing in the morning. Her friend took her there. debby explained everything to the police, but was shocked that the police said they would not be able to help her without any proof. Debby cried, what does she have to do, she want to see her children again, so her best friend decided to go after the children, and bring them back to his love of his life.<br />Will it succeed to get the children back? Could she finally have a life in freedom after 35 years living in fear? Will her friend get his love of his life, and be part of his freedom?<br /><br /><br />my email is amdshaye@hotmail.com<br />rights can be sold by negotiation<br />         2013 &#169; All rights reserved and owned by Shayer Ramsanjhul &amp; Debby Angelique van den Berg<br /></p><span id='bc_0_33MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-14978084'><a o='d' target='_self' href='http://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=3165484205805005056&amp;postID=7602862127427466184'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_33BR' class='comment-replies'><span id='bc_0_33b+seed5SmMD' kind='d'><div id='bc_0_32T' class='comment-thread inline-thread' kind='t'   t='0' u='0'><span id='bc_0_32TT' class='thread-toggle thread-expanded' kind='g'><span id='bc_0_32TA' class='thread-arrow'></span><span id='bc_0_32TN' class='thread-count'><span id='bc_0_32TNT' style='display: none;'></span><span id='bc_0_32TNU' style='display: none;'></span><a href='javascript:;' target='_self'>Replies</a><div id='bc_0_32TD' class='thread-dropContainer thread-expanded'><span class='thread-drop'></span></div></span></span><ol id='bc_0_32TC' class='thread-chrome thread-expanded'><div><li id='bc_0_32B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b36-rounded.png'></img></div><div id='c127353710291571542' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_32M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.blogger.com/profile/00430726442506089757'>sam sheik</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment=1398431520219#c127353710291571542'>25 April 2014 06:12</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_32MC' class='comment-content'>CALL SHEIK HERBALIST HEALER +27604916822 WE DO ONLINE HEALING WORLD WIDE  SAME DAY BRING BACK LOST LOVE, PENIS ENLARGEMENT CREAM FOR SALE , GAY AND LESBIAN LOVE PORTIONS FOR SALE ,LUCKY CHARMS TO WIN LOTTO,CASINO AND TENDERS IN STOCK ,GET ALL KIND OF HERB FOR ANY PROTECTION YOU NEED , I EVEN HEAL ONLINE ,I FINISH ALL UNFINISHED WORK FOR UR ANCESTORS OR DOCTORS WHICH ARE TAKING UR FOR A RAID ASKING MONEY EVERY TIME , I WILL FINISH THEM SAME DAY ,DO U WANT TO BOOST UR BUSINESS OR NEED ARE PROMOTION AT WORK JUST CALL SHEIK NOW He is a holistic healer, with extreme powers that guides all the spirits on earth, and his experience is in solving and eliminating all kinds of life problems.

I am keeping custody of my 2 girls but I cannot afford to support my kids on my high school education. After talking with my mom, I have decided to move up north with my kids and stay with my her while I get a college degree so I can give my girls a more secure future.<br /><br />The plan was to rent a 16 ft penske around Nov 8th. The Penske would allow me to rent a smaller truck and still tow my car. I planned on working until November 8th which would give me enough for the move and a little more till I could get a part time job so I could go to school full time. I told my boss of my plans and he asked me to turn in my resignation stating that I would be leaving on November 8th. I was let go right after. <br /><br />I am moving from Orlando, FL to Indiana. I have already been accepted to 2 colleges and planned to start my prerequisites in January. The truck with car dolly is around $680. The gas for 1000 miles would be around $400. So a total of around $1100 is needed.<br /><br />I feel embarrassed asking strangers for help but my kids&#39; future are in my hands, and I am worried. If I can&#39;t get to Indiana my kids will have to go with their mom, and that environment is not good. She works for a traveling company and my children need the safety of a stable life and better education than they could get there. They have a home school curriculum with about twenty students from all grade levels and a certified teacher that over sees the program. But, some kids don&#8217;t do well with that situation. My daughter is fifteen and she is only in the seventh grade. Since she started at a public school she is 2 points away from being a straight A student.<br /><br />Please, if you could find it in your heart to give any form of donation it would be greatly appreciated, whether it&#39;s monetary or a company supplying a truck for moving I would be honored to prove my situation any way possible. Feel free to contact me. Also, you can look over my blog &#8211; singlefatherneeds help. <br />http://singlefatherneedshelp.blogspot.com<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Jeff W<br /></p><span id='bc_0_41MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-861669517'><a o='d' target='_self' href='http://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=3165484205805005056&amp;postID=8493723173880793789'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_41BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_41B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_42B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b36-rounded.png'></img></div><div id='c6829383419131848622' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_42M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.blogger.com/profile/01979019917076339815'>LakshmiKumar</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment=1382266474094#c6829383419131848622'>20 October 2013 03:54</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_42MC' class='comment-content'><br />Date : 20th Oct,2013<br /><br />LakshmiKumar<br /><br />Grow &amp; Shine <br /><br />287, 3rd A Cross , 2nd Block, Basaveswaranagar<br /><br />Bangalore &#8211; Karnataka &#8211;Pin 560079 <br /><br /> <br /><br />To <br /><br />whomsoever it may concern <br /><br />Dear Madam/Sir <br /><br />My name is LakshmiKumar, and I am writing on behalf of my New project Grow &amp; Shine is the education program of the  global network of youth working for positive change. <br />As Grow &amp; Shine members, we are trying to make a positive difference through our <br /><br />actions.

I&#39;ve been reaching out to my community for about a month but i havnt found any help yet, I first want to tell you a little bit of my story. i have three beautiful children Elijah who is 5, Ella who is 3, and Emily who is 1. when Ella was three months old she was diagnosed with failure to thrive and has lived between home and the hospital. It&#39;s a constant battle to get her to eat and get her weight up she still isn&#39;t on the growth chart but she is trying hard :) she has a mountain of medical bills and medical needs that we can no longer keep up with because a year ago when Emily was born I had to stop working due to my health which started declining during my pregnancy with her, a few weeks before i was to deliver i experienced severe pain under my right rib and immediately went to the hospital. Shortly after a few tests and scans were done the doctor and his nurse rushed and and told me they had to take the baby right away because i was in kidney failure and my life and the babies was in danger. Emily was born a happy healthy beautiful girl and i was taken for more tests and surgeries. Several surgeries and medications later i was doing better. then a months later everything started going down hill again, they found out i had Lupus and RA. It&#39;s a struggle everyday but I will never give up and let Lupus win! So as you can imagine with only my husband working and between my medical costs and Ella&#39;s it has been extremely hard to pay the bills we have and we are losing where we are staying because we aren&#39;t able to pay all of our rent anymore. So I thought I&#39;d reach out to my community for help and prayers for my family. I&#39;m asking that you please pray for our family and ask your friends to do so as well, and I do know that it is hard times for everyone right now but i have faith that someone will be able to help us either financially or materialistically, if there is anyway that you or someone you know would be able to help us out financially I&#39;ve set up an account with Go fund me which is a safe and secure way to donate the link to it is http://www.gofundme.com/Give-a-home any amount helps! You can also contact me at my email at sarahlynturner1988@gmail.com  i really need to get the down payment for a home before we dont have a place to go if there is any way you can help please do. thank you so much for your time and prayers God bless.</p><span id='bc_0_48MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-245873626'><a o='d' target='_self' href='http://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=3165484205805005056&amp;postID=3821264241330964354'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_48BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_48B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_49B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b36-rounded.png'></img></div><div id='c7095484450734425262' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_49M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.blogger.com/profile/12868786775202928585'>James Smith</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment=1383988422192#c7095484450734425262'>9 November 2013 01:13</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_49MC' class='comment-content'>Hi my name is Dannielle I need 1,000 dollar&#39;s.to get my out of jail because her ex boyfriend girlfriend said my mom never paid child support but I don&#39;t know how she is involve with this she been in jail for 3 days now and we really need her here if you read this contact me banksdannielle@gmail.com</p><span id='bc_0_49MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-763892504'><a o='d' target='_self' href='http://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=3165484205805005056&amp;postID=7095484450734425262'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_49BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_49B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_50B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b36-rounded.png'></img></div><div id='c7455846034156105220' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_50M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.blogger.com/profile/03024309908854357987'>Abraham</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment=1384780212489#c7455846034156105220'>18 November 2013 05:10</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_50MC' class='comment-content'>I WANTED BIG MONEY ANY INTERST</p><span id='bc_0_50MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1308955938'><a o='d' target='_self' href='http://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=3165484205805005056&amp;postID=7455846034156105220'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_50BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_50B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_51B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b36-rounded.png'></img></div><div id='c6028968207354562366' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_51M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.blogger.com/profile/10908773960939908316'>woodsman41</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment=1385255603182#c6028968207354562366'>23 November 2013 17:13</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_51MC' class='comment-content'>Hi, my name is Jimmie, I am 45.

His now ex-wife left him about 2 years ago and made the divorce a rough one. It stressed him out something fierce, especially when he discovered that she had been taking several hundred dollars from the account before leaving. In July 2012, he turned 50. Less than 2 weeks after his birthday, he had a stroke. The local hospital rushed him to Saint Luke&#8217;s in Kansas City to run test and try to locate the cause of the stroke. During the tests, they found a lump on his neck. A specialist was called in and confirmed that it was cancer. Before they could do any treatment, he had a biopsy to try to locate the source, which they never found. During the biopsy, they removed his tonsils just to be on the safe side. Next his teeth had to be removed because of a degenerative disease in his gums (his mom also has it). The radiation would have caused his bone to soften and more problems if a tooth needed pulled. Within a month and a half, he had a stroke, cancer, tonsils out, and teeth removed. He began treatment, 45 rounds of radiation and 3 rounds of chemo. Half way in, he became really ill. He was placed in the hospital and was told he had C-Diff (a horrible intestinal disease that comes with a smell of death and the same smell as a taste in the mouth). They decided to put in a stomach feeding tube while he was in the hospital. The day after the feeding tube was put in, he had a massive clot go through heart and into his lungs. This almost killed him. He was told that his only option was to try an experimental drug to dissolve the clot, but was told that he would probably still die. He agreed to the drug and pulled through. After all this, he required around the clock care. His sister in law offer to take care of him for a couple weeks, during which time she stole almost $1000 from him. My family and I moved him in with us to care for him. All his stuff was moved out of his house and it was put up for rent, to try to generate an income during this. When his stuff was moved, a lot of it was taken by his family, so he lost a lot of his possessions that he needed for his work. He&#8217;s a rancher. His truck was even messed up by someone who said they were his friend, but they are not getting it fixed or anything. He finally completed his treatments and January 2013 he was told he was cancer free. Since then, his health has been getting better and better. He&#8217;s even back to work. But his finances are consistently getting worse. He had taken a $30,000 loan before he got sick to help pay for stuff from his divorce and some other bills. Paying this bill alone every month takes about half of his check. <br />He has helped so many people and asked nothing in return. He won&#8217;t even ask for help, so I am asking for him. $30,000-40,000 would help get him out of this hole and get him back on his feet. Please, Pleases, Please help?<br />If you have any questions or would like more information.

I have been feeling so alone and lost in my mess that I had no thought that anyone could be going through the same as me. I now see that there is so many of us in the same boat. I lost my job four days before Thanksgiving, I was a cook for a hotel. I hurt my back at home could not go to the doctor because my ins at work had not kicked in yet, only had two weeks to go. I was laid up for about a week. I was still in a lot of pain but needed to get back to work, no matter the pain. Well they were not having that. They Said I have to be able to pick up my 40 pounds. Well I did sign the paper work saying I could, when I first started there it was in my paper work. I can not even pick up 20 pounds right now as it is. I broke my back 13 years ago fell about three stories. But after a year of hell I got back upon my feet, but the back will always be a pain in my life. Well so much for that job. I have gone out and been online every day trying to find a job. I am use to waitress work in nice places but noting so far. I even went to subway, hamburger places and still nothing yet, I would love to work in anyone of these places I am so not a picky person. I applied for food stamps and they said yes I can get it. Well that was three weeks ago and still no card in the mail. I applied for a free phone that was also three weeks ago. I hated to do it but one has to eat and I had to get a phone because of jobs and I knew mine would be cut off. Well that happened today. I am thinking my cable and online will go next. Had to spend $75 of my jan- 1st rent to buy food for a month. I do not think I will ever eat beans, eggs, and rice again once I get back to my life, I mean I would, but after eating it for almost a month I would rather not for awhile. I am single 53 and alone so xmas really was pretty sad for me. All my kids are over seas right now, so the last thing they needed was a messed up xmas knowing mom was going through this, you know. I even emailed a church today asking them to pray for me because maybe just me doing it alone was not enough. But we are all so many so I am going to add all of you out there in my prayers, and I am going to pray really loud!!!!! And if you do not hear back from me on here it&#39;s because of getting cut off line. If anyone can help me I would be so grateful and will pay it forward once I am on my feet. Thank you Susie McGee in SA. TX. Email susieq78240@yahoo.com And this is my 80 year old mothers # 210-695-3767. We are not close but I think she would take the call as long as she does not have to help. Sad but true. Good luck everyone and God bless us all..........</p><span id='bc_0_64MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-171657170'><a o='d' target='_self' href='http://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=3165484205805005056&amp;postID=7228798604528491857'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_64BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_64B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_65B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-u8KUqZnYt40/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAs/R0ibIszF0DU/s512-c/photo.jpg'></img></div><div id='c5339619157667581999' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_65M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.blogger.com/profile/11133519509780770755'>Ali Algeria</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment=1388187786195#c5339619157667581999'>27 December 2013 15:43</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_65MC' class='comment-content'>hello my name is Ali ( i will give my complete name when i find someone trust him )<br />i live in Algeria i am not looking for money but i need someone to pay for my study in USA or Canada or New Zealand  .<br />i am in big trouble and my life in risk because i am gay and to be gay is a crime here in my country . and may family  want me to get married very soon . i can not say no and i could not say i am gay . but if the know about that i will go to the jail or get killed by my family or someone else so i need someone to help me get out from here but the only easy way is to ask for study visa .<br />i am 33 years old now and i do not have much time .<br />i work as a secretary man in office state here in Algeria i just get this job since few days from now and the pay is not enough to help me to ask for any kind of visa i just get about 160 dollars in the month  .<br />and if i do not find the way to get out from this hell i will kill my self because its better than this life .<br />i am not a hustler or a bad boy want to get easy money .<br />i just want to be myself and be happy and live .<br />and i promise i will Proved every thing i said in this letter  and after i get help from you and be fine i will return your money i swear .<br />thanks so much for reading my email .<br />email /aalianos@yahoo.com</p><span id='bc_0_65MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-962078768'><a o='d' target='_self' href='http://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=3165484205805005056&amp;postID=5339619157667581999'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_65BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_65B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_66B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-J0N9JaCT3KE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/oLPFc86unKg/s512-c/photo.jpg'></img></div><div id='c70971841999404693' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_66M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.blogger.com/profile/03913818624567037502'>Matthew Smith</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment=1388929431177#c70971841999404693'>5 January 2014 05:43</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_66MC' class='comment-content'>Dear Angels of Mercy,<br />I will be concise because I&#39;m sure you have many more important things to attend to.<br />On January 7th my house / our home will be up for auction at the Warner Robins / Houston County Court House in Warner Robins, Georgia.  It may already be too late for us. If we get evicted from our home, it will be the most devastating and demoralizing thing to ever happen to us and I literally don&#39;t know where we&#39;ll go.  Everything I&#39;ve worked for will be lost because I can&#39;t imagine where we&#39;ll put all our belongings we&#39;ve acquired over the years.<br /> My two boys I fear for the most. They will be crushed and their world will unravel. Their school, their friends and safe familiar neighborhood will be a fleeting memory.  Please Help. We live modestly.   I am a good man with no criminal record of any kind. No substance abuse, no gambling nor vices. We are good people; friendly, caring, charitable citizens but, two years ago I became unemployed.  I have tried extremely hard to find a good steady job like I had before but still it all falls short. I&#39;ve worked all of my life without ever needing public assistance. I always had a descent job.  I had a 22 year carrier in the USAFR.  I/we do not deserve to be subjected to hopelessness and despair. The economy has destroyed my credit. I spent all my savings over the last two years trying to stay afloat. I want to work. I want to have hope but my mind is consumed with the fear of homelessness. I&#39;m not suicidal but it does cross my mind.  My self esteem and self confidence have been beaten down from this unnecessary and unfair sequence of events.  I have nowhere to turn nor anyone to turn to.  Please, help me keep our home.  I&#39;ve been humbled.  The lack of money is the root of all misery.  I need a second chance to make it all right. <br />Your foundation is really my last hope. I&#39;ve often thought what I&#39;d do if I&#39;d won the lottery and I truly always come to the conclusion that I&#39;d definitely give most of it away.  I envy you. You can bring such quick relief to pain, loss and suffering with just the stroke of your pen. That must feel good. I wish I could do it.  If I&#39;m being crass, forgive me. Right now I&#39;m not my old self.<br />I just can&#39;t lose this house. It would surely be the end of us. Please someone, please anyone give me a second chance to make it all right again. Maybe you could just buy my house and let me start paying you.   At 61 years of age I will receive a pension from the USAFR; anything . . . anything . . . .please.<br />Sincerely,<br />Matthew E Smith<br />niacin777@gmail.com   (478) 953-6920<br /></p><span

As the GRACE members, we are trying to make a positive difference through our actions. We have begun a project for the betterment of the village people health by providing them a hospital equipped with all the facilities. Our area is a remote place where the health measures of the villagers are very poor they have to go for the a little blood test for 20 km and if there is a major disease like heart attack or stroke they have to go to the major cities Chandigarh ,Delhi etc. Major goal of Our project is to established a world class hospital with better doctors and better equipment&#8217;s .there is a strong need of a hospital in our area because of poor health conditions. We have PHCs but their condition is as bad as other govt. institutions.so we take a initiative to counter the problems faced by our people and make our community a better place for people with at least one thing they needed the most.<br />In order to complete this project, we need all the equipment&#8217;s required in a hospital like x-ray machines , ct- scanner , MRI etc. we collected money from area people but that&#8217;s not enough to start a project like this. We would be most grateful if u donate us some money because we don&#8217;t have any financial assistance from any source to initiate our Project. However the initiative is small but someone has to take the responsibility so we are hoping it will bring changes in the health perspectives of the area. If you are interested, we will keep you informed with regular updates on the progress of our project.<br />U Can help us with minimum donate 100 rupees in the favor of Anil kumar, PNB(PUNJAB NATIONAL BANK)branch- Talyana and Account number (1373000100544189)address is ..

My name is Ina and I am mother of two children. Two beautiful boys. I am 47 years old and I live in Europe, Latvia. I live alone since I broke up with my partner. That was around 10 years ago. It has been very hard to take care of two children and myself since then. I always have had big problems with my finances. I am working in high-school as a secretary for about 17 years now, but the salary I am earning is quite less. There was times when I even had no money to buy food for ourselves, not speaking of anything else. That is why I had to ask for help at the banks. They helped, of course, and everything was fine till I had to start paying that money back. I started missing my terms because of not having enough money and debts started to grow. It has been two years now since I am struggling with my debts and the problem is, I cannot get rid of them. I have no other family members or friends who could help me with money, and banks are refusing giving me more. There is big possibility that I could actually lose our home. And if that happens, I have nowhere else to go. And that is sad because life forced me to get in this situation I am in now. I always have tried to do best for my kids, but it is extremely hard for one parent. I am desperate, I don&#39;t know what else I can do. I have tried to look for some people who maybe could help, but no luck so far. The amount I am asking is 2.000$. If not the whole sum, even half of that money would be real life-saver for me and my kids. I would like to say thank you for letting me share my story and hoping for your response!<br /><br />Yours faithfully!<br />e-mail: Ina675@inbox.lv</p><span id='bc_0_84MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-306097456'><a o='d' target='_self' href='http://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=3165484205805005056&amp;postID=1804240494595061920'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_84BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_84B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_85B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='//lh5.googleusercontent.com/-chnVCJ_a-gI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACs/wcsCjUpJ8og/s512-c/photo.jpg'></img></div><div id='c9130067795554654488' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_85M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.blogger.com/profile/11937280248660045859'>TheEsy104</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment=1390598908893#c9130067795554654488'>24 January 2014 13:28</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_85MC' class='comment-content'>Dear Oprah,<br /><br />I wanted to reach out to your foundation to thank you for the charity and giving that your foundation does on a daily basis.  I&#39;ve currently been faced with a situation where I am in a financial hardship and I am seeking assistance.  I am married to my wife and we just recently had our child.  Our child is six months old, and she&#39;s a little baby girl by the name of Selah. <br /><br />My hardship is concerning my financial difficulties to pay my student loan debt as it is creating very hard times to support my family.  My student loan debt is currently $17,000 and I am making monthly payment on the debt of $600 per month.  This amount has began to come to an unrealistic expectation for me and my family. <br /><br />Please, if you can find it in your hearts to help my family out we would really appreciate it.  I would like my child to be able to enjoy life and experience things that I did not have a child growing up, but it&#39;s hard to compete with the financial distress of my student loan debt. <br /><br />Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation I am pleading with you to make a kind gift to my family to help us with our hardship.  I will leave the amount undisclosed as our family is appreciative of any gift amount. <br /><br />Please feel free to contact me at (570) 294-2034 or by email at esy104@gmail.com.<br /><br />Best Wishes,</p><span id='bc_0_85MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-584778390'><a o='d' target='_self' href='http://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=3165484205805005056&amp;postID=9130067795554654488'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_85BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_85B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_86B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='//lh5.googleusercontent.com/-NDfH-mMBkm0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAG8/vesSzIB844M/s512-c/photo.jpg'></img></div><div id='c1984162447230177606' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_86M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.blogger.com/profile/02113240848467547699'>Jay Pena</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment=1390794962675#c1984162447230177606'>26 January 2014 19:56</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_86MC' class='comment-content'>im a single dad me and my son name joseph jr. hes 4 yrs. im liven in an appartment not so good. im in need to move out and get a new house. im not working.. please anything will help. email at jaypacsh@mail.com please help me in the name of the lord</p><span id='bc_0_86MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1693550060'><a o='d' target='_self' href='http://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=3165484205805005056&amp;postID=1984162447230177606'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_86BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_86B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_87B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b36-rounded.png'></img></div><div id='c1635095823964448115' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_87M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.blogger.com/profile/06018921524105267960'>manikandan</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment=1391020792715#c1635095823964448115'>29 January 2014 10:39</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_87MC' class='comment-content'>HI Oprah,<br /><br />   i am manikandan from pudukkottai (india) ..i need help mam...my dad is passed away in 2010..he was affected in throat cancer..we spend more money for treatment..but no use mam..now we are some critical position mam..pls help me..pls..im doing business in my hometown..my income only pay on interest amount only still i have 20 lakhs indian rupee (35000 USD) credit..so pls help me mam..<br /><br /> please give me 35000 USD..please trust me mam.<br /><br />i will try give ur amount within 3 years mam..<br />pls ... pls help me..<br />my english is too bad..pls excuse..<br /><br /><br />my mail id:smanipdkt@gmail.com<br />ph no: +918883548018<br /><br />thank you..</p><span id='bc_0_87MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1374345426'><a o='d' target='_self' href='http://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=3165484205805005056&amp;postID=1635095823964448115'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_87BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_87B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_88B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_gzMMDIHyNs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABA/T4u40sadaFs/s512-c/photo.jpg'></img></div><div id='c5408219780863887886' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_88M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.blogger.com/profile/09603881761104289715'>Herman Collins</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment=1391022151255#c5408219780863887886'>29 January 2014 11:02</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_88MC' class='comment-content'>http://www.gofundme.com/453a1g<br /><br /><br />I am an older, single dad, (will be 60 this year) raising my two daughters who are 9 and 6 years old. I had cancer surgery in (August 2013). There were complications from that and I had to have another surgery to correct it. I&#39;m slowly healing, but it&#39;s taking a while. I&#39;m in pain a lot, but I&#39;m keeping up a good face for my girls. These health issues have caused unexpected expenses and I have gotten behind in just about everything. The money I get from disability was already barely enough to make ends meet. At this moment we are in danger of having our water and power cut off, as well as facing eviction. In addition, I have a medical bill that needs to be paid, but I&#39;ll have to worry about that later. Right now we just need to be secure in a living space. I tell my girls everything will be alright, and that God will help us. I started to tell them about our Forever House, where we won&#39;t have to move from. Please help us stay in our home.

My Grandmother was diagnosed with Stage 4 Renal Failure and started dialysis in December 2012. She was living by herself and was starting to show signs of the toll Dialysis takes on the body. Multiple falls, had a car accident, multiple hospital visits, 3 strokes, ect. The strokes rendered her unable to take care of herself anymore alone. My family and I decided to bring her to live with us.<br /><br /><br />Meanwhile, after having to take time off work so much, using FMLA, I fell into Major Depressive Disorder, which I have been battling since 1998. I have had no major issues as this recent time. I applied for Short Term Disability through Verizon via MetLife and was denied for both my original claim and my appeal. I have a pending Long-Term Claim pending.<br /><br />I have not been mentally able to work since March 2013. I have been seeing a psychiatrist and a thereapist for the problems I am having. I am currently taking 2 medications for myy issues,<br /><br />After being denied by MetLife, my insurance was cancelled, we lost our vehicle, defaulted on multiple loans, have had problems paying our utilities, and i forgot to mention, We have 2 children that are ours and have guardianship of my Godson. The guardianship was finalised during all of this.<br /><br />Now that all of this has happened, my Grandmother is declining more and more everyday. She is now living with my mother, after I had a major meltdown and could not handle the stress of it anymore. <br /><br />Now that she lives with my mother I have to travel to her house Monday through Friday to sit with my Grandmother so my mother can go to work and make BARELY enough to make it for her, yet alone her and my Grandmother.<br /><br />I am surely but very slowly coming out of my mental issues but I feel them coming back again since I have no job and do not believe that I can actually work my regular job at this tiime without being terminated for my actions due to my issues.<br /><br />My family and I DESPERATLY need any assistance available. <br /><br />Any assistance provided will be used for monthly bills, food (after food stamps have been exhausted), hopefully enough will be provided for my mother and I to get a nurse or a sitter to care for my Grandmother at least 2 or 3 days a week. The ones we have checked on have been at the least $13.00 per hour. <br /><br />Please help if at all possible.<br /><br />God Bless!<br /><br />Please visit http://www.gofundme.com/6k99x0 to help!</p><span id='bc_0_89MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-2083026700'><a o='d' target='_self' href='http://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=3165484205805005056&amp;postID=5444095113975880576'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_89BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_89B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_90B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-sVPfwoxAQKA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACE/VbOdGmciYI4/s512-c/photo.jpg'></img></div><div id='c5756274322133329831' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_90M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.blogger.com/profile/05976038287216178735'>Maria Delilah Romo</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment=1391412236661#c5756274322133329831'>2 February 2014 23:23</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_90MC' class='comment-content'>pleasant day to people like you can help people like us that are in need financially <br />i am trying to get some help from you. <br />i am a mother of 5 kids. my eldest is a hearing impaired who until is jobless though he has been trying to apply for a job. my eldest daughter had just graduated and get a part time job but her salary is not even enough for her needs. <br />the 3rd is a college student then the 2 is in grade5 and grade2 who has autism. <br />he is under a psychologist. <br />at present i am trying to apply for a job but because my youngest with autism needs me its hard for me to look for a full time job. <br />my husband has just get back to work and just recently we were hit by the 7.2 earthquake here in Bohol.Philippines, <br />it worries me much because this month will be the prefinal exams of my kids. <br />the past exams i just ask for a promissory note. but nopw for their Pre,final and final exams they will not be allaowed to get promisorry note. <br />my 4th son had surgery last december 19, with derma.aconthoma <br /><br />this is our BIG PROBLEM right now. <br />i dont know where to ask for some financial asistance <br />so that i thought of asking from people like you with a big soft heart. <br />PLEASE HELP US. <br />WHAT WE NEED IS ONLY FOR THE TUITION FEE DUES OF MY CHILDREN. <br /><br />i also wanted to have a small capital for a small business(small store) as livelihood so that it can help us meet our daily needs. <br /><br />I am praying and hoping for very kind generosity. <br /><br />sincerely, <br />maria delilah <br />jesromo5@gmail.com<br /><br /></p><span id='bc_0_90MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1652478'><a o='d' target='_self' href='http://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=3165484205805005056&amp;postID=5756274322133329831'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_90BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_90B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_91B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b36-rounded.png'></img></div><div id='c1026942517018545287' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_91M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.blogger.com/profile/10186464216751212832'>Olga Castro</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment=1391486213773#c1026942517018545287'>3 February 2014 19:56</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_91MC' class='comment-content'>Mrs Opra winfrey I am talking to you, with all the shame that I have to ask for your help in my financial problems. I am 48 years old, we have three childrens that depends of us, my husband is that type of person that likes to work hard but since a year he can&#39;t find a job righ now. I am very sick, the doctor diagnosed me with cancer (Lymphoma nohawkins) since the diagnoses came we have had a lot of problems more that we have ever had but with the help of some friends and God we are able to buy foods, pay bills, rent etc. When I arrive home from quimio I go into the kitchen and start cooking food such as tamales, empanadas, gorditas to sell so we can make some money to pay the rent but sometimes I can&#39;t do it, I can&#39;t hold all of this, I don&#39;t feel good some times the quimio is hard although some times God help me. The docter said that I need rest after quimo and I don&#39;t do it .I try and try to make some food for my kids and always tell my children that we will be able to make it thorough with a better house (This is our dreams) that they have their own rooms. I believe that we are a people that like to work but with all of these problems I don&#39;t know what to do. We try our best to make everything change for better. This is frustrating for me to know that I can&#39;t be there for my children the right way as a mom because quimio for Lymphoma is very stressing for me and puts me in a worst situation but just thinking everyday to earn a bit of money to pay for the rent is all I need that can help us. Please don&#39;t forget me I hope that you help us. I truly would give all my life to help my husband and children. They notice whenever I feel sick and it makes me feel bad. This is so frustrating and it&#39;s all about the money, some prescriptions I can&#39;t afford, rent and another problems I have about the quimio and I cant attended my children or medicine for me to feel better because I don&#39;t have money. Sometimes my ten years old son is sad seeing me like this and I know that they feel sad. Its not fair for them to feel like this when they can be happy, at that edge all of this make cry. It&#39;s very sad for me to ask because I never thought I would ask for help but I am very desperate right now and we need your help. Please I request you kindly for your help.

My wife is<br /><br />having to take care of me and cook, clean, and help assist me when<br /><br />needed.  My first surgery was October 30, 2009 with my spine, neck,<br /><br />back.  In September 18, 2010 I had another spine surgery perform, the<br /><br />doctor went in and tore that same disk out and replace it with a metal<br /><br />plate because it was fix, they thought it was fixed but it wasn&#39;t<br /><br />fixed.  My body did not heal from the major injury I had in September<br /><br />3, 2009.  I was receiving physical therapy to see if I could return<br /><br />back to work properly, but wasn&#39;t able to function. I later had<br /><br />another surgery with both of my hands for carpal tunnel in March 19,<br /><br />2013 &amp; September 17, 2013.  My nerves are damaged until they hurt<br /><br />constantly.

Our country is a very small island in Indian ocean and country&#39;s economy is not rich and most of the people are struggling to earn money to live.<br />I am a self employed girl and running a small business of fashion jewelry selling. I import these from Hong Kong and sell to local people and earn money for my living. Now the method i am using is taking orders with 50% advance payment from customers and import jewelry since i do not have money to import, display and sell.<br />My hope is to import some jewelry, display at an outlet and sell. Honestly speaking, i do not have money to fulfill this hope. If you can, pls help me to make my dream a real. If you want, I can send you any detail of me to prove that i am not a cheater. Pls consider my humble request.<br /><br />Thank You!</p><span id='bc_0_94MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span

id='bc_0_98MC' class='comment-content'>Dear Oprah, Hello,<br />Well, I&#39;m just going to get to the point. I&#39;m a 58 year old single mother of 5. My dream is to own my own home, something I&#39;ve never had the joy of doing. My children never knew what it was to be in one place for long. My ex husband committed suicide in 2008, so I&#39;m the only parent left for my children. I now have grandchildren and  my biggest dream is for my children and grandchildren to actually be able to say, &quot;let&#39;s go to grandma&#39;s house.&quot; I dream of having holiday&#39;s, birthday&#39;s, dinners, etc., in a real house of my own. I dream of my precious dogs having a beautiful yard to run and play in, they are my babies now that my children are grown. Oprah, I imagine on a daily basis of moving into MY own home, decorating it beautifully and comfortably for my family to come visit, especially my grandchildren. I always imagine what it would feel like to have solid roots, real grounding, I imagine it must be wonderful. I see my grandchildren running and playing in my beautiful backyard. I am now living in an 60 year old run down house in a bad part of town until the owners sell it, kind of a house sitter I guess. Anyway Oprah, that&#39;s been my life long dream, MY OWN beautiful house. Thank you for your time.<br /><br />Lori Hungate<br />nigella4u@gmail.com</p><span id='bc_0_98MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1506196403'><a o='d' target='_self' href='http://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=3165484205805005056&amp;postID=7753411705957361752'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_98BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_98B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_99B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/openid36-rounded.png'></img></div><div id='c7830053684896257107' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_99M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='https://me.yahoo.com/a/9E66MjkxneNCaP4hqT7nxOBok5F77l37bg--'>Steven</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment=1393518156910#c7830053684896257107'>27 February 2014 08:22</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_99MC' class='comment-content'>hi oprah I am 43 with 3 boys I get ssi I live on $513 iam kick out of my home and I have no car and my oldest boy is very sick I need help real bad can you help me get on my feet  please help me  sent me what you think right to get me a home and a car please me you can sent it to 1006 iowa st rolla Missouri 65401 in my steven strom please me help god bless you</p><span id='bc_0_99MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-425108114'><a o='d' target='_self' href='http://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=3165484205805005056&amp;postID=7830053684896257107'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_99BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_99B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_100B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Tf3A0lSoGBc/TKoqavO7YUI/AAAAAAAAABM/C3U4-N8HsSo/S45/belen.jpg'></img></div><div id='c1632601668383270351' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_100M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.blogger.com/profile/10918166550379878306'>Belmar</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment=1394022723353#c1632601668383270351'>5 March 2014 04:32</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_100MC' class='comment-content'>Hi! My name is Maria, I&#39;m 28 and I come from Uruguay. I&#39;m at the final stage of my BA (Economics) in Penn State University (USA). I already paid $25,000 (a HUGE effort for my retired parents). I found out that this year I still need to pay some $22,000 more (without including books, which can cost up to $300 each, technology fees, and diploma processing costs). I just received the first bill of the year, which is already $8,000. I need URGENT help! I count on you.<br />I will be adding documentation and you can request my graduation pictures after I finish (or my diploma in case I cannot attend graduation).<br /><br />THANKS! I can&#39;t find the words to tell you how important this is to me!<br /><br />I have a regular job and it is a nice pay only for a living, i can&#180;t afford tuition.

I am 26 year of age and started this cause  at the age of 22. The kids at the orphanage are from age 2 weeks old to 18 years old. The orphanage provides accommodation, feeding, education,health care, clothing and all it takes to live to these kids who are vulnerable and less privileged.website:  www.abetterworld-cm.org Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ABetterWorldOrphanage<br />As the number of the kids has increased with more orphaned babies depending to survive by artificial milk which is expensive here and the older kids also advancing in education with one of them in a medical school, a few of them in High school, some of them in secondary school and the others in kinder garden and primary school,while there are other kids with ill health cases like HIV, Asthma, etc that need monthly medical attention, the financial demand has greatly increased including feeding or providing three times meals daily for 44 children. This has led me to land myself into a series of huge debts just to make sure the kids have the care and attention they deserve. As I am writing to you one of the creditors has taken a decision from the court to take over the house the orphans and I live in by the 10th of April 2012 if I don&#39;t pay the money I owe him. Where will I go with all these kids who all depend now on me as their only source of help? I love them so much and they love me too. We are a family now and don&#39;t don&#39;t deserve to be scattered apart just because of money. I am so troubled. Because of this trouble the kids can barely eat well for lack of finances. Please help settle this debt and regain the only home these orphans have, and help them have good nutrition and education which is their future as they are the future generation.<br />Contact me on:<br />Emai: abetterworld.cm@live.com / contact@abetterworld-cm.org<br />Tel: 0023773093752<br />website: www.abetterworld-cm.org<br />Facebook; https://www.facebook.com/ABetterWorldOrphanage<br /><br />I am looking forward for a positive reply to my plea for help.

He told me he was a only child and that his parents have both died. He lived with cousins and had a close cousin who had HIV (she was only aged 21). <br />I got on with him really well. His cousin (who he said he lived with) was really nice too. I use to see him and his family and friends a lot. We would alway all meet up and go out together. He even meet my family. We talked about getting married.<br />Then one day he told me his cousin was dying as she is coughing up blood and that her HIV was getting worse. He begged me to give him money. I wasn&#39;t sure at first and then a close client at work told me that a life is always worth more then any amount of money. I agreed to take the loans out and credit card debt to help raise money to help send her for treatment. <br />2 months later I had a phone call off his phone and it was a girl. It ended up being the guy I was dating, had a  wife. She asked me who I was and what I was doing talking to her husband . I have told the police and they can&#39;t do anything about it. I have now got myself into so much debt I can&#39;t see myself ever getting out of it. His family member does have cancer but not HIV and aren&#39;t dying but are being treated. I have a full time job and now also working a part time job too. I am trying to pay off all the debt but it isn&#39;t going anywhere. I have even thought about killing myself to get me out of this mess, as that looks to be the only way out. But as I am god fearing, I wouldn&#39;t ever go down that route. Can someone please help me.

She is a veteran herself, who was diagnosed with leukemia It all started when i was in 5th grade. She was a juvenile probation officer for years, she was on her way to court and fell on black ice. Form that fall she messed her back, neck, and shoulders up. she tried to push through it but she gave in went to the hospital and it was NOT GOOD. She had different surgeries but nothing worked it got worse and worse. she cant really walk or even lift over a gallon of milk. It&#39;s just been me and her so i had to grow up FAST. She was unable to work so the bills piled up fast with the house.I remember walking home from middle school and cutting through the hospital to go see her on my way home. That was all of middle school and when i was 13 that when she was diagnosed with meningitis, She was being read her last rights when a doctor ended up coming and and some how saving her life. We thought it could never get worse. Then a few years later on December 27th 2009 we got the call that changed both of our lives forever. She had been diagnosed with leukemia and apparently had it for years without anyone catching it. I was scared but had to be the man i had been since around 12 years old. I wanted to show her that she didnt have to worry about me i was an adult and I would be okay she needed to worry about her. I wanted as crazy as it sounds now to think about, but i wanted her to know that she didnt have to fight or hold on for me i would be okay. So I joined the ARMY and in less than 2 months i was in test taken and had a date to leave. I joined that national guard so i could still be home. So life went on she did really really good with everything. I came home took care of her and myself of course and her taking care of my grandmother. well eventually she ran out of her settlement from court and the family was helping as well as me giving almost everything i had. God Bless her soul my grandmother passed away and my mom was broken i thought maybe she would give up feeling like she was alone. But she was able to really help us out when she passed and left my mom an okay amount of money (not a lot to most people). so with that and my money we were okay again took our first vacation last summer actually. But what i didnt know is that we were broke then again she and paid bills in advance being smart. So now for the past few months it has been bad again and what i call bad is bad (could always be worse). But I am working at a 9$ an hour job and getting NO hours. And now we are to the point that come the end of April we have my paychecks and that is it. i get paid every other week and getting no hours my check today was $123. I have started s Donation page for her and tried a Social Media help and we got 75$ the past about 2 weeks and hey that is great that is a bill you know. But with a mortgage of $1050 i think that wont cut it. I know we could sell it and get an appt or she move in with family and me ill figure it out. But I will NOT let her work as hard as she did be through the hell she went though with my asshole dad. Work as hard as she did working going to school again fighting this hard to give up in her dream. She walked though the doors here when we bought it and said &quot; i want to live and die in this house&quot;. I knew she didnt mean die here but she meant this is what she wants to be happy she wants this forever this is it. And i WONT let here give up on that i cant. i have asked my dad and friends but nothing. and if mu aunts or uncles help she will pay what she can after court for disability. but i hate to see her have nothing ALL the time.

When I lost my job in 2008 I managed to keep my head above water. Around 2010 still not being able to find a job, things started getting bad. In June of 2011 I took on taking care of my oldest granddaughter because of an unnecessary custody battle with a stranger (long story), I am still taking care of her. In 2012 I moved back to Florida in the hopes of finding a job but I didn&#39;t find one and I spent all of my money staying in a hotel and when it ran out I ended up in a shelter where I stayed for 9 1/2 months and was diagnosed with severe clinical depression and PTSD. I am still looking for a job and still can&#39;t find one. Not one close enough to work into picking up my granddaughter anyway; and I have no one to pick her up and watch her until I get home. I tried to get daycare and they told my that they don&#39;t have any daycare vouchers unless she is 5 or under. I have tried everything to try and get a car but I just can&#39;t afford it, I can&#39;t even afford furniture for my house we have a bed and that&#39;s all the furniture we have. I signed up for freecharitycars.org and I am still on the waiting list but it seem like it takes a long time, I see people who have been there for up to 4 years. I don&#39;t have a long list of friends, like I had when I had money; it&#39;s kind of hard. So if you read my story and can help and know anyone else that can help I would appreciate it, I am just looking for some help to get back on my feet. A car would help me do this, because I would have the transportation that I need to get to the jobs that am being offered and get back on time to pick up my granddaughter. So please help if you can, even if it&#39;s just $1.00 dollar every little bit counts. Thank you in advance.<br /> Thank you,<br /> Patsyann Wheeler. <br /> See my campaign @ http://www.gofundme.com/WheelsforTheWheelerFamily<br /></p><span id='bc_0_112MN' class='comment-actions secondary-text' kind='m'><a kind='i' href='javascript:;' target='_self' o='r'>Reply</a><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-61522977'><a o='d' target='_self' href='http://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=3165484205805005056&amp;postID=4637451840737458099'>Delete</a></span></span></div><div id='bc_0_112BR' class='comment-replies'></div><div id='bc_0_112B_box' class='comment-replybox-single'></div></li><li id='bc_0_113B' class='comment' kind='b'><div class='avatar-image-container'><img src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/openid36-rounded.png'></img></div><div id='c2867710885999525917' class='comment-block'><div id='bc_0_113M' class='comment-header' kind='m'><cite class='user'><a rel='nofollow' href='https://openid.aol.com/opaque/3ad6c856-87d1-11e3-9065-000bcdca4d7a'>3ad6c856-87d1-11e3-9065-000bcdca4d7a</a></cite><span class='icon user'></span><span class='datetime secondary-text'><a rel='nofollow' href='http://millionairegivingmoney.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-how-do-i-ask-oprah-for-money-with.html?showComment=1398206195996#c2867710885999525917'>22 April 2014 15:36</a></span></div><p id='bc_0_113MC' class='comment-content'>Do you have bad credit?<br />You need money to pay the bills?<br />You need to start a new business?<br />Do you have an unfinished project at hand due to poor funding?<br />You need money to invest in some of the areas of specialization that will benefit you? and you do not know what to do.<br /><br />I am Mr James Parker, a private money lender.

We live in Avondale Arizona. Family is everything to us and we look forward to staring through adoption with your help. Choosing adoption is and amazing, self-less gift to a baby!<br />Our Story<br />We met in 2003 in Puerto Rico, in 2004 Sharon moved to Phoenix to start a life with me. In 2005, we sealed our love with a ceremony with our closets friends. Even though this was not legal in Arizona in our hearts it was. <br />Ten years later, Sharon is my best friend, the love of my life, my soulmate, my partner, my confident, and I hope the mother of our baby. <br />At the age of 21, I was told I was unable to have children due to endometriosis. This was heart breking to me because I come from big family and family is very important me and now us.<br />Our dream is to be a moms but being in a same sex couple relationship this is not easy. We have tried many IUIs and few IVFs with no positive result. At the first try thru IUI we got pregnant but at eight weeks we had a miscarriage. At this point we have reached the limit of our resources. <br />We have realized that there are many babies that need be love and care for. We love to adopt a baby.<br />We are beyond ready to be moms but adoption is very expensive and we need your help. You are probably wondering why we need money but we have found an agency that asure us a newborn baby, to start the process we need to come up with $20,000.00 at the time of signing the contract the rest of the money is due when the baby is born. We have tried many IUI and a few IVF with no luck, the next step for us is to try to adopt. We are a serious couple, we have been together more than 10 years now. We truly would like to be mothers and with your help we have hope! Without your support it will be very difficult to full fill our dream of adopting a baby. We are grateful to share with you our hopes and dreams, we have realize that to be able to love and nurturing a child is more important than to give birth. &quot;It&#39;s not how much we give but how much love with put into giving&quot; thank you soooo much.

I&#39;m the person who would be loaning money, or helping out strangers. Unfortunately, the economy, and other challenges have over wrought my ability to stand independently, right now. If I could conjure up a way and a means for myself to overcome these financial difficulties, I would. I need to be direct, I am 52 years old, and I have a 30% percent loss of use in my right leg, due to an injury on the job in 2012. I live with two roommates in a cramped apartment, in Woodside Queens, but thankfully no one is difficult to get along with. After having a disastrous year finding work, I nearly gave up, but I still pound the pavement, and the computer keys. Having a sense of humor is extremely important, in times of strife, it keeps the heart healthy. I am financially depleted, for three months since last December 2013, I managed to stay afloat assisting a real estate agent, by showing apartments, but the crest wave of potential tenants has run dry over the last two months. The real estate agent offered a percentage of every commission made on any apartment I secured a tenant for. This is not a permanent job, only a part time position, in the likelihood of my getting full time employment. Now I am two months behind in my rent, I need at least $1500.00 dollars to get me back on track, for the time being, but I would prefer taking it as a loan. There is a chance of my getting employment within the next two weeks, but it is not going to help me now, I really need this money, especially since one of my roommates will be moving out in a few weeks, into his own place. I beg of anyone within the frame of my character, to accept my truth, and consider assisting me at this time. I am not a leach, or an opportunist, I hate beggars of any sort, but I have been reduced to begging myself, it is a daunting position to be in, especially being an American born citizen. My email address is michael.a.g1@hotmail.com.
