| EmbedOri Inbar developed a passion for augmented reality (AR) ever since he realized that it will change every aspect of life and work we can think of. This realization has motivated him to become an industry start-up entrepreneur, a founder of a not-for-profit organization, an event organizer and a recognized speaker on topics related to augmented reality. Thus I was very happy to get him for an interview on Singularity 1 on 1.
During my conversation with Ori Inbar we cover a variety of interesting topics such as: the story behind his passion and motivation for augmented reality; the past and the present definition of augmented reality; differences between augmented reality, virtual reality and real reality; major applications for AR; the dangers and costs of militarization; Ori’s favorite augmented reality devices; issues of privacy, advertising and big brother; “wearing” vs “not-wearing” and Vernor Vinge‘s Rainbows End; the three laws of augmented reality design; Ogmento and AugmentedReality.org; transhumanism and the technological singularity…
My favorite quote that I will take away from this conversation with Ori Inbar is: “When you think of any aspect of life or work, augmented reality is completely going to change how we do it.”

Who is Ori Inbar?
Ori Inbar is the Founder and CEO of AugmentedReality.ORG, a global non-for-profit organization dedicated to advancing augmented reality (AR), and the producer of Augmented World Expo – the world’s largest event dedicated exclusively to the AR industry. In 2009, Ori was the co-founder and CEO of Ogmento, one of the first venture-backed companies conceived to develop and publish augmented reality games – games that are played in the real world. Ori is a recognized speaker in industry events and a sought-after advisor for AR initiatives as well as one the speakers for the upcoming ISTAS2013 conference in Toronto that I plan to attend this June 27-29.

At the beginning of the interview it seemed that you were confusing Virtual Reality with Augmented Reality.
A brief definition of Augmented Reality:
AR is a way viewing digital information which has been superimposed – or augmented – onto a live view of the physical, real-world environment around you. Artificial information about your environment and its objects is overlaid on the real world.
AR can also be described as enhancing what we see, hear, feel and smell, but by far the most popular use is enhancing what we see.
An example of the worst use for AR is holding your smartphone up to a QR code in a magazine ad in order to see the beer flowing.
As you mentioned, Head-Mounted Displays have been with us for a long time and are a good example of practical AR.
A good use of current AR:

Examples of the potential of AR are best seen in video rather than described:
Microsoft Future Augmented Reality

Sight: Contact Lenses with Augmented Reality
http://youtu.be/GJKwHAvR4uI
There are also a number of movies that use AR, especially “Iron Man” and “Minority Report”
I would also recommend the following article:

Thanks Terrence,
You are correct in observing that I was indeed mixing up virtual and augmented reality in the beginning of the conversation. Terrence Lee Reed
One thing that I had not thought about previously that you touched on in the interview was how users of AR could filter their reality, or in the case of children their parents, school or the state could filter out profanity, nudity, lewdness, etc. This is a very real possibility. On the personal level it is dangerous because we can create a confirmation bias bubble like talk radio does today. An interesting possibility would be the ability to anonymize yourself, people will not be able to see your face clearly because it will appear pixelized and your conversations will be automatically muted for everyone but your intended audience.
On the state level they would track everything you do, say or even feel and modify the content of your world accordingly either to prevent you from doing what they don’t want you to do or to entrap you and use it as evidence against you, welcome to pre-crime.
On the corporate level they already track everything you do using face recognition and of course everything you buy, but they are just going to love controlling what you see, hear and feel (they already control what you smell).
It’s a brave new world after all.

Fantastic interview. I thought you asked some wonderful questions, and Ori was able to explore some semantic misconceptions and provide a good comprehensive overview of AR.
