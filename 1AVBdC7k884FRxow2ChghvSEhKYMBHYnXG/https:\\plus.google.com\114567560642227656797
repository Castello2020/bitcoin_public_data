If you address it to "Public," it's a blog post. If you address it to "Your Circles" it's a tweet. If you address it to your "My Customers" Circle it's a business newsletter. If you address it to a single person, it can be a letter to your mother. I'd say this is pretty revolutionary.﻿Read moreShow less1Add a comment...Todd StiersShared publicly - 2012-10-01 “When Mitt starts working his mouth and goes off on some weird tangent about who knows what, please just tune him out.
