<p>Welcome to Spritesmods. At this site, I'll document my more interesting hacks
for your viewing pleasure. While it's not updated that regularly, I try to add an
article about every month.</p>
<p>
Ow, by the way: all the pictures are thumbnails. You can click on them to
get the originals, straight from my camera. If you want to comment on an article,
there's a discussion area at the last page of every one of 'em.
</p>
<p>
You can follow Spritesmods on <a href="http://twitter.com/SpritesMods">Twitter</a> 
too if you want to know about the projects I'm working on, that may or may not 
eventually make it to the site.

Any use?
I tried to transplant one onto a BGA capable pendrive but it isn't doing anything.
Can send this too as it might be handy due to the large pin spacings.

Had a thought about interfacing to chips, what about using an elastomer based system and 3D printed clamp?
The connectors used on Poundland voltage sensors are useful here, discovered that ages ago.

I did a somewhat similar hack not long ago, but since I didn't know about the ZIF socket I used the more expensive 360 Clip and a RPi to bit-bang it. See http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=44&amp;t=16775

The main issue with the 360 Clip is that the contact with the NAND is not very good, and in addition part of the PCB sticks out of the clip, leading to inability to position the clip if there is a high enough component, like a capa, on one side of the NAND.</p></div><a id="cmtid2006"></a><div class="comment"><strong>JoeJoe wrote at 11 Sep 2012, 18.15:</strong><p>I can't wait!</p></div><a id="cmtid2003"></a><div class="comment"><strong>Sprite_tm wrote at 10 Sep 2012, 22.14:</strong><p>J.W.: I hear ya!
