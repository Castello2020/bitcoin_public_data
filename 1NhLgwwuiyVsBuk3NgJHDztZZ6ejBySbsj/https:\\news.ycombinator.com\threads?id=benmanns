I think the 5.75% return is over the 48 month vesting duration, on the extra money you would have earned (and invested). So, the excess (per year) would be something more like (50(1.0575^3)+50(1.0575^2)+50*(1.0575^1))/4. (Though it seems I'm a little off, so maybe they do the calculation monthly or biweekly).Edit: Search http://www.tejusparikh.com/projects/equity_calculator/js/app... for bigCoInterest.replybenmanns 27 days ago | link | parent | on: Bitcoin balance lookup
Ah, that's pretty cool. Otherwise you can use things like vanitygen to create a similar address. I just created https://duckduckgo.com/?q=1NhLgwwuiyVsBuk3NgJHDztZZ6ejBySbsj-----benmanns 28 days ago | link | parent | on: Bit.ly's shady business model
If you keep track of either the short URL or the long URL somewhere on your end, you can get the other part using bitly's link API: http://dev.bitly.com/links.html and the associated metrics with the link metrics API: http://dev.bitly.com/link_metrics.html -- Once you have that, you can write a simple app (or use any of the free ones out there) to provide the same service.Or honestly, just pay the $700 if it's not worth the dev investment and provides a significant value to your service.-----benmanns 52 days ago | link | parent | on: Reading and Writing Redis Protocol in Go
I was wondering the same thing. Perhaps "\r\n" is more friendly to Windows or Telnet users?-----benmanns 66 days ago | link | parent | on: Minimum Viable Block Chain
Alice or Bob have to sign the fee (in addition to the rest of their transaction) with their private key in order for the miner to spend it later.-----benmanns 66 days ago | link | parent | on: Minimum Viable Block Chain
Except that now the power is in the hands of the manufacturer, who can now execute Sybil attacks.-----benmanns 81 days ago | link | parent | on: Pronking for Programmers
I would suggest reading through the Express (or any popular project) source code to improve yourself as a JavaScript developer. As you do, there will inevitably be things you notice that should be fixed. E.g. typos, edge cases, refactoring[0]. Fixing those will help you familiarize yourself with the project, the process, and will eventually lead to bigger contributions.[0] Though be careful with that. Only refactor stuff if you're pretty confident about how it works, and that your changes don't decrease performance or readability.-----benmanns 83 days ago | link | parent | on: Airbnb closes $500M round of funding at a $10B val...

Wow! I had no idea. According to http://www.idanalytics.com/news-and-events/news-releases/201...> More than 15 percent of SSNs are associated with two or more people. More than 140,000 SSNs are associated with five or more people. Significantly, more than 27,000 SSNs are associated with 10 or more people.-----GeneralMayhem 93 days ago | link
That article is referring to corporate records, though, and leads with the fact that many people have multiple SSNs if you track all their commercial accounts as gospel truth. Does social security actually hand out duplicate SSNs, or is this all caused by people not remembering theirs/bad typing?-----steveklabnik 94 days ago | link
Yup. It was stated over and over again that SSNs were not supposed to be a form of ID, but nobody pays attention...-----jimktrains2 94 days ago | link
I've always wondered how the SS administration deals with this. SSN _should_ be unique, but in practice they're not, so how do these people deal with taxes and _gasp_, social security?-----chid 94 days ago | link
