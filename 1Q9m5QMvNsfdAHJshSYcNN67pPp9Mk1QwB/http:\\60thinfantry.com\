In memoriam of two 60th Regiment veterans who recently passed away:  John Celler, CO. B, 60th, 9th, the most special of all men died on March 1, 2010 in CT and Capt, Grady Holman Jr., CO. B, 60th, 9th passed away March 14. Grady was awarded the DSC and Company B the Presidential Unit Citation for valor beyond extraordinary on December 12, 1944.  Both were Purple Heart recipients, Grady with multiple Oak Leafs, they were also Bronze Star and CIB recipients. The word Hero does come close to describing what honorable men they were.
