<p>With the exciting double parking ticket trial of AKPF #1 co-producer Garret Ean last week, the audience is treated in <a title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK89tGDVALs" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK89tGDVALs" target="_blank">this episode</a><a href="http://freeconcord.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/akpf_trial_2014_07_18.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignright wp-image-6267" src="http://freeconcord.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/akpf_trial_2014_07_18.jpg?w=300" alt="akpf_trial_2014_07_18" width="154" height="98" /></a> to the complete and illustrated footage of the court hearing featuring infamous faces of the Keene criminal justice system. Judge Edward Burke hears the case brought forward by KPD prosecutor Jean Kilham, with AKPF agent Jane called upon as the sole witness. In this inquiry, we see how eager to object to anything and everything that the state&#8217;s representative is, and Burke also plays a significant role in tipping the hand of the defense on lines of questioning. Ultimately, most arguments are not permitted to be made, and the disproportionate fine of five dollars per offense is levied, though compensated partially in Obamacoin.</p>

<p><a href="http://weusecoins.com">Bitcoin</a> is a decentralized currency and financial transaction network that is changing the world.  One bitcoin is worth over $600 at the time of this writing.  As time goes on, more merchant solutions are being released that are making accepting bitcoin at brick-and-mortar business easier and easier.  These local businesses are the pioneers in this space.  How exciting that bitcoin is being used in Keene!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on facebook, join up with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/603466176347264/">Keene Bitcoin Network</a>!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sentinelsource.com/news/local/as-bitcoin-thrives-local-businesses-approach-with-caution/article_cfb69ada-3305-51d4-97be-c80616c48859.html">the Sentinel&#8217;s story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As Silicon Valley investors and currency speculators continue to keep their sights — and dollars — fixed on Bitcoin, a small number of Monadnock Region businesses are dipping their toes in the water to experiment with the electronic currency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When someone comes into the Corner News in Keene interested in buying something with Bitcoin — about three or four times a week, owner Roberta Mastrogiovanni said — both parties whip out their smartphones.<span id="more-27915"></span> Using one of many available Bitcoin apps that link to their online wallets, Mastrogiovanni creates a unique code representing the transaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>“I just open up the app,” she said, demonstrating on her iPhone.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, say the customer wants to spend $10.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mastrogiovanni taps the dollar amount into her phone, and it tells her how much bitcoin she will receive. In this case, at the going rate of about $620 for one bitcoin, just under 0.02 bitcoin will be subtracted from the customer’s wallet and transferred into hers.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s a cinch,” Mastrogiovanni said.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The customers get their bitcoin by buying it at an online exchange or through one of several startups that will set up in-person meetings between interested buyers and sellers.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Corner News joined the Bitcoin craze in 2011 when customers started asking for it.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I didn’t know a lot about it, so I did some research and decided to accept it,” Mastrogiovanni said. Back then, one bitcoin was worth about $40, she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The currency is used like PayPal, but it isn’t regulated by any bank, and no one guarantees the transactions except the network of people operating computers all over the Internet.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The unregulated nature of Bitcoin has appealed to New Hampshire’s many libertarians and proponents of the Free State Project, which encourages people to move to New Hampshire and make the state a model of limited government. One of the first Bitcoin ATMs, where customers can insert cash to have bitcoin added to their online wallets, was created in Manchester. After the online retailer <a style="color: #457d9d;" href="http://overstock.com/">Overstock.com</a> began accepting Bitcoin, it published data on where most of the purchases were taking place, and the Granite State topped the list.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ian Freeman, a Keene radio host and activist and blogger on <a style="color: #457d9d;" href="http://freekeene.com/">FreeKeene.com</a>, said both his radio show and the organization began accepting Bitcoin donations and using it for expenses early on.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I would say that it was more of a natural thing,” he said. “We were pretty early adopters, and every since the liberty movement has started using it people have become very interested.”</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It puts the power of money back in the hands of the people,” he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the same breath, Freeman also has to mention Bitcoin’s other upside: it’s easy to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Pretty much every time I go to Corner News I pay with Bitcoin just because I can,” he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens after the customer leaves the store, though, is still a bit of a mystery to Mastrogiovanni and many Bitcoin followers.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The back-end processes of Bitcoin transactions were designed in 2009 by its mysterious creator to be extremely complex. That keeps the value up and limits the amount of bitcoins that can exist in the market.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When one of Mastrogiovanni’s customers scans the QR code on her phone to create a transaction, that transaction then gets posted on the currency’s online hub (a public list of all Bitcoin transactions worldwide) to be validated by a network of people running highly specialized software, often on custom-made, high-speed computers. The computers must then solve a math problem to authenticate the Bitcoin and add it to a running chain of Bitcoin transaction before it can move the money into Mastrogiovanni’s online wallet.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process is known as mining, and the miners — the people whose computers complete the encryption first — make a profit in Bitcoin for every problem their computers solve.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matt Fox, the owner of Stone Farm, an inn in Fitzwilliam, said he also began accepting Bitcoin from customers several years ago for ideological reasons; he thought of it as an exciting experiment.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m kind of a tourist when comes to money, and I’m kind of an econ nerd,” Fox said.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, it’s a matter of convenience.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s fast, it’s great,” he said. “It’s money that people are using, and I want to have a little bit of it.”</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fox said that between 15 and 20 percent of the business at the inn gets paid for in Bitcoin. Sometimes, he turns around and buys things with it. If he needs some cash to pay a bill, he’ll sell Bitcoin to someone offering dollars in exchange online.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“When the cable bill comes up, I can sell .009 bitcoin or whatever for cash,” he said. “You can usually throw it out there and someone will want to buy it.”</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to Corner News, Moda Suo Hair Salon in Keene accepts Bitcoin. Tyler Rogers, a manager at the salon, said only three or four customers have used it. Carroll Garden Center in Marlborough also accepts it, but no customers have used it in the store, a manager said.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fox, who follows Bitcoin and cryptocurrency use closely, said the handful of businesses that advertise they accept Bitcoin represents a small proportion of the Bitcoin business in the area.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What you see there, I know, is a fraction of what there is,” he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting more bricks-and-mortar stores to accept the currency can be a challenge because store owners don’t always trust it as much as online vendors do, Freeman said.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Getting into a physical location is a little more complicated than using it online,” he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Corner News, customer Ian P.R. Casey of Keene said he uses Bitcoin to buy things online, often because vendors offer a discount to customers paying with Bitcoin and because he thinks it’s more secure. But he was unsure whether he would use it in a store, even a Bitcoin-friendly place like Corner News.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t know how to use it, to be honest,” he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Libertarians aren’t the only people interested in Bitcoin’s future, by far. Last week, computer giant Dell became the biggest company to start accepting the currency. Some of Silicon Valley’s biggest venture capitalists have put money in Bitcoin startups.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The total value of the Bitcoin market is still only around $8 billion. The dollar value of a Bitcoin has jumped around in the past few years, soaring to more than $1,000 in November 2013 and reaching a low point this year over March and April after Mount Gox, the most popular Bitcoin exchange, was hacked in February and later when Chinese authorities announced in April they were shutting down Bitcoin exchanges in that country.</p>
</div>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because it’s a small portion of Mastrogiovanni’s business, she said doesn’t worry too much about its ups and downs. She occasionally converts her small amount of Bitcoin into dollars for safekeeping, but mostly lets it sit in her wallet to appreciate and depreciate with the market.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="encrypted-content" style="color: #000000;">
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s just an experiment,” she said. “I’m not sure I understand it and I’m not sure what the future will be, but it’s interesting. It’s like anything else; when your customer gives you a request, you try to do it.”</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="CM-Bodycopy3Lead" style="color: #000000;">We are well into the 2014 election season, and there’s a lot at stake.<span id="more-27911"></span></p>
<p class="CM-Bodycopy-Ragged" style="color: #000000;">Not just control of the U.S. Senate, as newly minted New Hampshire resident Scott Brown ignores his GOP primary opponents in his rush to target incumbent Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.</p>
<p class="CM-Bodycopy-Ragged" style="color: #000000;">Not just the perversity quotient of the U.S. House, as primary voters sort through which candidates – representing which wing of the Republican Party? – will challenge Democratic incumbents Annie Kuster and Carol Shea-Porter.</p>
<p class="CM-Bodycopy-Ragged" style="color: #000000;">Not just the balance of power in the New Hampshire General Court, as we’re still trying to forget – or at least recover from – the two-year reign of House Speaker “Bully” O’Brien.</p>
<p class="CM-Bodycopy-Ragged" style="color: #000000;">I hate to mention this, but there’s also the 2016 presidential campaign right around the corner. And if we’re going to fulfill the responsibility of the “First in the Nation” primary, then New Hampshire needs to have solid – and sane – political parties.</p>
<div class="inline_content" style="color: #000000;"></div>
<p class="CM-Bodycopy-Ragged" style="color: #000000;">You see, New Hampshire is the focus of a unique political experiment, started in 2001 by then-Yale doctoral student Jason Sorens. His idea was to get 20,000 activists to move to a single state with a small population and an easily accessible government.</p>
<p class="CM-Bodycopy-Ragged" style="color: #000000;">“Once we’ve taken over the state government, we can slash state and local budgets, which make up a sizeable proportion of the tax and regulatory burden we face every day. Furthermore, we can eliminate substantial federal interference by refusing to take highway funds and the strings attached to them. Once we’ve accomplished these things, we can bargain with the national government over reducing the role of the national government in our state. We can use the threat of secession as leverage to do this.”</p>
<p class="CM-Bodycopy-Ragged" style="color: #000000;">Snowplowing? Bridge safety? An adequately funded judicial system? Public colleges? These things are nowhere on the Free Staters’ priority list.</p>
<p class="CM-Bodycopy-Ragged" style="color: #000000;">No, the Free Staters – at least those in Keene – seem to be more interested in marijuana and videotaping the city’s parking enforcement officers.</p>
<p class="CM-Bodycopy-Ragged" style="color: #000000;">Here’s where it gets serious: Free Staters don’t care about political parties. That’s how two Free Staters, who lived in the same house, ran for state representative on opposite sides of the ticket. (The Democratic candidate won.) Free State candidates don’t advertise their allegiance to the project, they just join up with a political party and run for office.</p>
<p class="CM-Bodycopy-Ragged" style="color: #000000;">In their 2012 election results roundup, the project outlined the progress they had made: Over the past eight years, FSP participants who have become state representatives went from zero to 1, to four, to 12 to 14 in 2010, to eleven this cycle. Only 1,100 movers are on the ground. With only 5 percent of the goal movers in New Hampshire, political FSP participants held onto the status quo while Republicans got trounced. Baby steps, people. It ain’t called a “project” for nothing!</p>
<p class="CM-Bodycopy-Ragged" style="color: #000000;">Twenty-thousand movers could translate into 200 state reps, half the house. Imagine what fun would ensue.</p>
<p class="CM-Bodycopy-Ragged" style="color: #000000;">One-fourth of the legislators identified as belonging to FSP ran as Democrats.</p>
<p class="CM-Bodycopy-Ragged" style="color: #000000;">And now it’s 2014, election season again.</p>
<p class="CM-Bodycopy-Ragged" style="color: #000000;">Is it going to get even weirder this year?</p>
<div class="inline_content" style="color: #000000;"></div>
<p class="CM-Bodycopy-Ragged" style="color: #000000;">Sen. Peter Bragdon is retiring, and “Free State” mover Dan Hynes is running for his seat. Apparently Hynes has offered free room and board to FSPers willing to work for his campaign.</p>
<p class="CM-Bodycopy-Ragged" style="color: #000000;">And here’s what his campaign website says about why he’s running (under “Smaller Gov”): “Dan Hynes opposes government regulations that force people to do things against their will, or that prevents them from doing things that bring them happiness as long as it does not harm other people.”</p>
<p class="CM-Bodycopy-Ragged" style="color: #000000;">But don’t we need rules about which side of the road to drive on? Laws to protect property? What happens when the things that make one person happy conflict with what makes other people happy? What happens when most people want to have our highways plowed, but some people don’t want to pay for it?</p>
<p class="CM-Bodycopy-Ragged" style="color: #000000;">People actually think that this kind of chaos is a good idea? And they’re moving to New Hampshire to create it?</p>
<p class="CM-Bodycopy-Ragged" style="color: #000000;">Hasn’t New Hampshire already had enough nuttiness from our politicians? Can’t we all agree that we need a functioning government? And rational political parties? And that Granite Staters don’t really want to secede from the United States?</p>
<p class="CM-Bodycopy-Ragged" style="color: #000000;">This election year, we need to pay close attention to who we’re voting for, where their allegiance lies and what sort of a government they believe in (if any).</p>
<p class="CM-Bodycopy-Ragged" style="color: #000000;">There’s a lot at stake.</p>

<p>Just over a month has passed since attorney Seth Hipple <a href="http://freekeene.com/2014/06/04/weare-police-settle-with-fsp-president-for-57500/">spanked the notoriously corrupt Weare police in court and snagged a $57,000 settlement </a>for Carla Gericke (the president of the <a href="http://freestateproject.org">Free State Project</a>). Now, Hipple wins again and Weare is paying up $35,000 more to another liberty activist, <a href="http://bikerbillnh.blogspot.com/2014/07/weare-police-apologize-for-1a-and-a8.html">Biker Bill Alleman</a>, who was also <a href="http://freeconcord.org/2011/02/23/nh-vj-bill-alleman-arrested-by-weare-pd-on-illegal-recording-warrant/">arrested by Weare police for recording video in public in 2011</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2014/07/15/650730/10089236/en/Weare-NH-Resident-Wins-Settlement-Against-Weare-Police-Department-Announces-The-Law-Offices-of-Martin-Hipple.html">press release announcing the settlement</a>, attorney Hipple says, &#8220;The precedent set in Gericke v. Begin is just now starting to ripple through the courts&#8230;and I look forward to seeing many more victories for the First Amendment and government accountability in the coming years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biker Bill is quoted in the release as saying, &#8220;I really hope we&#8217;ve seen the end of this unlawful nonsense in New Hampshire&#8230;Public servants need to understand, finally, that they&#8217;re &#8216;at all times accountable&#8217; to the people.&#8221; On his facebook page, Biker Bill <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sean.mccormick/posts/10154391617755374?comment_id=10154391628420374&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=1">credits the Free State Project community as the reason for the success</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, Biker Bill was given a written apology from new-to-the-job Chief John D. Velleca.  Apologies from police are VERY rare.  It states, in part:<span id="more-27896"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;After reviewing your case and applicable case law, including the recent decision in Gericke v. Begin, we have concluded that your arrest&#8230; should not have occurred. Accordingly, we regret and apologize for your arrest and prosecution&#8230;I will continue to educate our officers on the importance of understanding and respecting the rights of all citizens, as well as the influence new case law has on policing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Will positive changes actually come to Weare PD? Don&#8217;t get your hopes up. In the meantime, the portion of the $35,000 that went to Biker Bill should buy him a fancy new camera!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the NH State Police have created a similar case in their <a href="http://freekeene.com/2014/07/01/breaking-james-robin-hood-cleaveland-arrested/">recent arrest of Free Keene blogger James Cleaveland for recording in public</a>.  How much will Cleaveland be awarded in the end?  Stay tuned to <a href="http://freekeene.com">Free Keene</a> for the latest on the War on the Press.</p>

<p>Local independent newsman, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jaredgoodell">Jared Goodell</a> has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152228688517543&amp;set=a.47224877542.61493.693672542&amp;type=1">broken news about Keene High School warden Lynne Wagner resigning</a>, scooping the Keene Sentinel.  Here&#8217;s Wagner&#8217;s alleged <a href="https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/t1.0-9/10517983_10152228688517543_1946801071929057447_n.jpg">letter of resignation as posted to Goodell&#8217;s facebook account</a> that cites both micromanagement and unprofessional tactics as reasons for leaving the helm of the day prison.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152226841392543&amp;set=a.47224877542.61493.693672542&amp;type=1">Goodell calls Wagner a &#8220;witch&#8221; on his facebook profile</a> and tells me that he&#8217;s kept in touch with several Keene High staff since graduating and has heard many comments about Wagner, including that she is crass and narcissistic. He described an incident involving one of Wagner&#8217;s first-implemented changes when arriving at KHS:</p>
<p><a href="http://freekeene.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/a13181.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-27885" src="http://freekeene.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/a13181.jpg" alt="a1318[1]" width="144" height="200" /></a>&#8220;A group of students created a super student parking spot near the front entrance of the high school. The parking spot was painted with the &#8220;Superman&#8221; symbol, meant to represent &#8220;Super Student.&#8221; The spot was further marked by a sign, much like a handicap sign, that read &#8220;Reserved for Student of The Month.&#8221; When Wagner arrived at the school, she had the parking spot&#8217;s artwork painted over with black paint and the sign was replaced with one that read &#8216;Principal Parking Only&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Current KHS inmate and incoming 2015 Senior Sophie Shatzman said of Wagner, &#8220;She talked to the students like they were too young to understand anything important in life, which didn&#8217;t get her a lot of respect.&#8221;<span id="more-27883"></span></p>
<p>Another former KHS prisoner, Renee Kate, recently released into the larger plantation with the rest of us serfs, says that Wagner was hated by many, including some teachers, and that she was a &#8220;tyrannical bitch&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="http://freekeene.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ccdocphoto1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-27887" src="http://freekeene.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ccdocphoto1-300x127.jpg" alt="Keene Spiritual Retreat" width="300" height="127" /></a>Some would call this article hyperbolic for likening a government school to a prison, but perhaps those people are unaware that government school <a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/xv/193/193-mrg.htm">attendance is compulsory, according to the statutes in NH</a> and every other state. If one is placed somewhere against one&#8217;s will, that is imprisonment. Many schools in the U.S. have fences, some with barbed wire. I&#8217;ve seen them. In New Hampshire, parents who don&#8217;t send their kids to government school or jump through the state&#8217;s homeschool hoops, may be charged with a violation in criminal court. If the parent is found guilty and doesn&#8217;t pay the fine, jail will result.</p>
<p>If government schools are so great, they shouldn&#8217;t be forcing people to attend them at the threat of a cage.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s long past time to end the state&#8217;s monopoly on education. Why should any students be subjected to tyrant administrators? They and their parents should be free to leave and keep the school portion of their tax bill and not have to answer to officious bureaucrats regarding their child&#8217;s unschooling or homeschooling.  Parents have the power today to change the system by withdrawing their children and money.  However, the risk is the state will steal the parents&#8217; home from them (the euphemism for stealing is called a &#8220;tax sale&#8221;), so most home-owning parents won&#8217;t take that risk, preferring instead to beg school boards for relief.  Meanwhile their offspring are having to put up with little tyrants like Wagner while trying to learn something.</p>
<p>Maybe the next principal will be better or maybe not &#8211; it&#8217;s a crapshoot and the students are forced to be there whether they like it or not.  Live free or die?</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://freekeene.com/2014/07/14/take-keene-police-to-court-over-ccw/"><![CDATA[<p>On July 9, 2014, <a href="http://freekeene.com/2014/07/11/derrick-j-denied-concealed-carry-by-kpd/" target="_blank">Keene Police Chief Ken Meola sent me a letter denying my application for a Concealed Carry Permit</a> in New Hampshire. As his reason for denial, he said I, &#8220;have had several contacts with the police for assualtive or threatening behavior.&#8221; None of my arrests disqualify me from owning a firearm, however the law allows the police to exercise discretion by denying a person &#8220;who is unsuitable&#8221;. That could mean anything!</p>
<p>I am an activist who runs his own peace-centric podcast twice a week and blog at <a href="http://PeaceNewsNow.com" target="_blank">PeaceNewsNow.com</a>. I am obsessed with peace, and have never been assaultive or threatening in my life! If I can be denied because of this baseless accusation, so can you! <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/gunrights" target="_blank">Please donate today</a> to pay for my attorney because this is a precedent-setting case. Can the &#8220;suitable person&#8221; clause be used to disarm peaceful activists? If I lose, the government will have even more reason to deny people their rights. If I win, the police will have to walk out of court with their tail between their legs, and they&#8217;ll think twice before denying the next activist.</p>
<p>I have already put up my own personal money ($2,500) as a retainer for the best lawyer in the business, <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&#038;ion=1&#038;espv=2&#038;ie=UTF-8#q=evan+nappen&#038;tbm=nws" target="_blank">Evan Nappen</a>. He&#8217;s defended countless others and has a track record of success in cases of this type. A simple Google search of his name will show that I have chosen the right man for the job. I&#8217;m in this to win, so if you care about securing and enhancing gun rights in New Hampshire, <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/gunrights" target="_blank">please donate now!</a></p>

Garret had recorded <a href="http://freekeene.com/2014/07/02/tragic-end-to-long-standoff-in-keene/">video of the scene</a> and posted it to Free Keene.  Youtube recently pulled the video, but it was <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=0b7_1404945698">subsequently uploaded to Liveleak</a>.  The Union Leader&#8217;s <a href="http://www.unionleader.com/article/20140709/NEWS07/140719977&amp;source=RSS">Meghan Pierce filed this report</a> on the free speech controversy.  Did Garret go too far?</p>
<blockquote><p>KEENE — The Free Keene Blog is taking heat for posting footage of a recent standoff that ended with a man shooting himself to death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Most of the heat’s online,” said Free Keene blogger Ian Freeman, who started the blog in 2006.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Free Keene blogger Garrett Ean shot and posted the footage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Community members, especially family members of the deceased, are upset about the posted video, City Council member Randy Filiault said Monday.</p>
<p><span id="more-27873"></span></p>
<p>“The family asked them to remove it from online and they didn’t. They’ve alienated people (who have sided with them in the past) on this one,” Filiault said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On July 1, a man shot himself to death during a 4 ½-hour standoff with police on Ivy Drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The man, Matthew Snow, 34, of Keene was immediately taken to Cheshire Medical Center, where he succumbed to his injuries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Freeman said while he does have editorial access to the blog, he rarely exercises it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“FreeKeene.com is a news site and an activist’s site,” he said. “We do report the news from our perspective.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ean said Wednesday that, though is he an activist, when he covers an event such as the standoff last week, he is there as an objective journalist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police were actively dealing with the standoff situation and family members of Snow had declined to speak to a news crew, so Ean said he focused his efforts on capturing the standoff on camera.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His camera was not focused on Snow during the actual shooting, but the shot can be heard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What I happened to capture, what you see is not all that graphic, it’s what people know is going on that makes it disturbing,” Ean said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ean has been confronted online by people offended by the posting of the footage, as well as on the street by relatives of Snow, but he stands by releasing the footage, he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certainly it’s important for the public to hold police accountable for their actions, and while they seemed to do many things right, they perhaps could have handled certain aspects of the standoff differently, he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The standoff had started after Keene police officers tried to arrest Snow on an electronic bench warrant —for receiving stolen property and for a parole violation. It seemed to Ean, Snow feared returning to jail, and the entire time Ean was watching, Snow never pointed his weapon at anyone but himself and never appeared to be a threat to anyone but himself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I felt he was treated as though he was more of a threat to others than he really was,” Ean said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After he shot himself police “are seen rolling him over to handcuff him and then rolling him back over so the paramedics can come in,” Ean said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people who have commented on the Free Keene blog that the footage is offensive also say they are shocked by seeing police handcuff the man, Ean said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I thought it was pretty clear he was clearly very critically injured,” he added.</p></blockquote>
