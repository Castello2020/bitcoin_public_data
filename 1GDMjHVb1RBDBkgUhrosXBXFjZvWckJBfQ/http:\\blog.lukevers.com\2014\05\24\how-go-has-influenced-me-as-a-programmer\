        <h1 class="post-title">How Go has influenced me as a programmer</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>I've been a web developer longer than anything else, even when I didn't know it. Back when MySpace was still a thing I was writing HTML and CSS even though I had no clue what I was doing. I never thought that I could make websites or web applications for a living--I didn't even know what a web application was. I just wanted to be a musician, and if I could make my MySpace page look nice that was good enough for me. </p>

<p>Back in high school I took two different programming classes my junior year for no apparent reason. I had once searched online "how to write video games," and similar others, but every 15 year old kid has also done that before. I wasn't really sold on the idea of programming yet. In school we started with C++ in one class and Java in the other. That's when it all started.</p>

<p>Towards the end of high school I was introduced to Go from a friend. The syntax was much different from what I was used to, and it proposed a challenge to me at first, but any good programmer needs to learn that syntax is not scary.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Syntax is not scary</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were fewer gophers at this time, although I'm sure if I looked on freenode or elsewhere I could have found a bunch. My friends and I learned from each other, and from the community online. The amount of explanations and documentation has been wonderful. I feel like I've never been a big contributor because I haven't written anything in Go that is noteworthy, but I want that to change.</p>

<p>There are a lot of gophers in the world now, and we have all written a lot. Most of my Go projects are more of a learning experience than something I expect people to use every day; a lot of what I write has been done before. They generally never get completed because I realize that I'm doing something the wrong way. When I find out the correct way to do something, I try it out and then once I understand it I move on from my failed attempt at a project and take what I learned from it. </p>

<p>Go has taught me that it's okay if you're unsure of the best way to do things at first; you'll get there eventually. Not only that, of course. Learning Go has opened me up to other languages and thought processes that come with each language.</p>

<p>Even if Go is not your primary language, I think that every programmer should try it out. The worst that can happen is you don't like the language, and you move on learning what you have learned.</p>

<p>The Go language and community has helped me learn more than I ever have before over the past few years, and I hope that won't ever change. </p>
