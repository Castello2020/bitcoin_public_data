Wolfys Mod
Bandits: Phoenix Rising mod | Released May 8, 2008
summary news reviews features tutorials downloads videos images forum The goal of the mod is to update Bandits and make it more open and give it more of a "instant action" feel, and more game options, weapons, cars, maps and hopefully whole new modes, such as Mechs, Tanks, etc.
The long term goal is to make Wolfys Mod a platform for vehicle simulations.
Simulations of Tanks, Mechs and Cars, etc, separated into different game modes with their own maps, weapons and settings, including good documentation that makes it easy to add your own vehicles, weapons and maps.

A small window with options should show up when you start the game. Have you installed the Bandits patch before you installed the mod?

Dear sajber,
I downloaded the v.04 (Beta 4) and I have some small problems. In the third mission where you need race with the wolfies my car is moving so slow and the wolfies are winning. By the way the weapons and the cars did not come in my game.
