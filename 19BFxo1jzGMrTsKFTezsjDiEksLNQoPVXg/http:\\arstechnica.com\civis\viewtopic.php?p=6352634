USAF weather dude working near Ramstein. Living overseas is amazing (as I post from a hotel room in France) and the compensation is more than I was expecting... but I'll probably be force shaped out next year. I have mixed feelings about the "clown college", so hit me up privately if you have any specific questions.

Visi: I'm going to Australia for a year in November. They're crying out for IT people. My friend applied for his Visa last Monday morning. He filled in a form on the embassy website, and by 3pm that day he had an email saying his visa was approved. It's a one year "working holiday" visa, with an option to extend it for another year. You can only work for one company for 6 months, though. Perfect for working for a bit, saving every penny, then going travelling until the money runs out, rinse, repeat.Join me. Skoop

And let's be clear, the "could you" is not so hard to achieve. There are plenty of jobs out there where you can work 9 to 5, and have the time to attend classes. If your current gig is not such, then it shouldn't be beyond the wit of man to change it, if you have 10 years in IT and can demonstrate the knowledge that that should bring.

Let me be a little more specific; I make an "ok" salary of ~$43k/yr. The reason I can't afford to go to college, is because my work schedule is 7am - 9pm, with almost zero exception, 6 (sometimes 7) days a week. When I was laid off from Earthlink, I was unemployed for 6 months while I looked for work. The company that hired me is the only company that even called me after ~70 some resumes that I sent out. Needless to say, the job market for IT in Los Angeles is not overly friendly. Also, it is fucking expensive to live in L.A. If I were to go back to school, I'd have to quit my job. Quitting my job means losing my apartment, as I'd have no income. Like I mentioned before, I do not have anyone that I can "crash" with, either. I have no family, and I have no friends with extra space or room for a student....and I am not about to give up my current job to go to school, when I cannot be guaranteed of landing a job for income while I'm schooling. Abandoning my current job without lining something else up first is simply foolish.

You've said that you're 99% sure that a layoff is coming. I think it's fair to say that most of the posts with constructive feedback about school have been made with that in mind. When the hammer drops on you, all this business about your apartment and your work hours and crashing with someone becomes moot. Are you ready for less expensive digs, part-time or night work, and school?

In terms of spending power, isn't 43k in LA like 20k in most places in the country? Have you thought of just moving to a cheaper city, or do you like LA too much?

No criminal record, not even an arrest. No debt to speak of (save for 1 credit card, almost paid off)No college degree. Over 10 years work experience in my fieldNo communicable or other diseasesNot a religious wackjobI think I'm good on everything except the college degree. The problem I'm facing, however, is that I'm between a rock and a hard place; without a job, I can't support myself. Without a college degree, it's impossible to find a job...but to get a college degree I need to find some way to support myself... ...and it begins all over again.

Damn... Honestly, I'm going to have to go with the "go back to college" thing one more time.You said it yourself Visi, you can't get a job without the degree. Maybe you can find a job or 2, one that will give you tuition reimbursement?You could always head towards the midwest, or maybe New Mexico? Its hella cheap to live around those areas.

I saw this thread the other day, but figured that it must be a piss-take.Choosing between Australia and New Zealand would be largely a matter of preference. NZ is a little colder, a lot smaller, and in my experience even the more significant cities had a bit of a 'country town' feel to them (but it's a few years since I've spent any serious time over there, and that may have changed).NZ citizens are effectively treated the same as Australian citizens in Australia, and one of the problems that NZ has is that many of its bright young people come over to Australia to work.Australia has a skilled migration program. I'm not sure about all the details, but you can read about it here. I have a mate who works in immigration (although its the bit concerned with kicking people out, not letting them in), so if you have any specific queries, I might be able to get them answered.Having recently tried to employ an IT person, I can tell you we have a massive skills shortage in Canberra (although being from LA, Canberra might be a bit chilly for you). If you can do any of the following, you have an Occupation in Demand, which helps:Computing Professional - specialising in CISSP 2231-79Computing Professional - specialising in E-commerce Security (non-programming) 2231-79Computing Professional - specialising in Network Security 2231-79Computing Professional - specialising in SAP 2231-79Computing Professional - specialising in SIEBELWhilst I'm not entirely sure that Canberra can handle the Visi, feel free to ask me any questions about life here or in Melbourne.

Go for it. You will probably test out really high which will open up quite a few jobs for you in the military.Want to blow things up--Tanks or EODWant to work on engines -- Helo mechLike radars--air defenseLike sats--sat communicationsLike the good stuff.-- Nuke school in the NavyWant a real challenge - Special Forces, Seal TeamI spent 13 years in and had a blast. I got to fire pistols, tank rounds, a patriot missle and my favorite, Machine Guns.

Career enlisted Navy with 12 years experience here.PM me if you want to discuss it.For Navy IT pukes, they have one catchall "job", or Rate: Information TechnicianThey work in two areas essentially: radio/comms and IT. In one section, they run the LAN, do trouble calls for user and hardware problems, and admin the servers onboard ship. The other section handles the software side of communications.The Navy has contracted out all of it's shore installation IT chores to EDS ($4 billion and counting it has cost EDS to date; I gould go on for days about how well it isn't working), so unfortunately IT is now a mainly shipboard rate. That is, they are assigned to a ship more often and for longer stretches of time than they are assigned to a shore installation.The Navy is also in the midst of a 33,000 person drawdown, so advancement to the next higher paygrade is getting pretty tight in some rates (mine, for instance. )We don't deploy as a general rule as much as our bretheren services, but we do go, sometimes for 10 months at a time. 6-7 months is the average. However, except for a few cases, we don't go anywhere particularly hazardous. No roadside bombs can get you while you are 35 miles out to sea, for example. That being said, the Navy has started to send individuals in country to Iraq and Afghanistan, performing admin and supply puke type jobs so that some soldiers can get some slack in their rotation schedule.Staying in the L.A. area is out, though, since Long Beach Shipyard is closed. Closest would be San Diego, or Naval Air Station Pt. Magu up by Santa Barbara.

It is only just slightly harder to find your type of people anywhere you would go, but GO WHERE THE MONEY IS. You're young enough to really haul ass on this.

What about getting a degree overseas? I know for instance for Belgium it's reasonably simple to get a time-limited visa to study, and well, uni here is cheap compared to the US...Sure it'll be time-limited for the course of the degree, but that can always be changed after the fact. Also remember that once you get a visa for a .eu country, it's fairly easy to hop between coutries here.The thing I don't understand is that from reading what you wrote, it sounds like you're tired with your living situation (and I bet a lack of friends contributes greatly to that), unhappy in IT,you want to study, so what's holding you back? Even if it's moving to the bible belt, remember, you can do tat for a few years and save up and then move elsewhere or something?

One of the main reasons I'm "fed up", is with the current sociopolitical climate in the USA. I hate it. It's based on religious dogma, superstition and selfishness. I'd much rather attempt to immigrate to a country that falls more in line with my own personal philosophy than (unsuccessfully) attempt to integrate myself into the populace of the USA. As far as studying abroad, well, that intreagues me too. Why not? I love learning, and I love "adventure" (so long as I have a roof over my head and stable income). In regards to Boston...Sure, why not? However, I can't imagine the cost of living is that much lower than in Los Angeles. What other information do you have for me, JSClark?

Get the fuck out of LA.Move someplace more tolerable, and -cheaper-, San Antonio is booming at the moment. 2Wire is shoving a call centre in there, and theyre likely to be looking for techs soon, including full IT staff.150k mortages in SA are coming back at $600 a month..... with 0% down and 600 credit score. Visi, you have no concept of how many freedoms you actually have in the US. Im currently up to my neck in personal / married life shit with my american wife. Im from the UK, I dont -ever- want to move back there, its too small, too on top of one another, too goddamn assbackwards. It`d kill me inside a year.You think the dogma is bad here, good luck in the UK, in Ulster you have the protestants going for the Roman catholics, on the mainland you have the pakkies, the blacks, the chavs, the wideboys and all kinds of racial tension and problems. Youve got the smug cunts in the south, vs the grim up North, the sheep fucking welsh and the Manaical scots. You have political bullshit on a level that makes your head spin. Arcaic laws and legislation, taxation that makes no fucking sense, gas that costs more per litre than you pay per gallon in the US.EVERYTHING is smaller and limited, you know how you go to the store and theres an isle for cereal and 200 different choices, in the UK, good luck over 15-20 choices. The TV is limited unless you get -limited- cable or satellite tv and then its 6months to a year behind the US for popular shoes. BT has a monopoly on the telecoms (still), good luck getting stable high speed and not paying out the arse for it.Denmark, fantastic country, great healthcare system, but from friends living there, immigration is causing huge tensions. Full of lego and small island, lots of lovely women around. France, lovely people bar the parisians, paralysed by political nonsense and a general malaise for the on french.Italy, not been there, political turmoil that boils over, fanatical soccer fans.Spain, even more fanatical soccer fans, lovely weather, far too many sweaty brits on holiday, political nightmare, terrorist problems.Germany, the finest cars in europe, a mad motorway/freeway system, great beer, great food, absolutely no sense of humour.Switzerland, everyone has an automatic weapon in their closet, crime is almost nil, anal to the extent that your neighbours will sic the police on you if you dont wash your car or rake up your lawn.Nordic regions, Sweden, Finland, Norway, fucking cold 6 months a year, very little between them and the north pole than the odd horny reindeer, highest suicide rate in the world, simply because for 6 months a year theres nothing to do but drink and fuck, and theres only so many gorgeous blondes you can handle. Oh and 60% taxation rates, great cars too.Belgium, chocolates, french fries with mayoinaise and Hercule Poiriot, fucking weird people.Holland, fantastic country, great infrastructure, lots of high speed around, lots of immigrants fucking it up. Silly taxation rates, great healthcare, one of the few places in the world you can get stoned legally and then go visit whores legally.Monte Carlo - youre not rich enough.Lichtenstein - I think they play soccer, thats about it.Portugal - Small and mostly like spain, only more brazilian .. if that makes sense. Fanatical about soccer, far too many sweaty germans on holiday there.Why not try Canada.

First off, the degree thing is crap, at least domestically. If you really have ten years of solid, provable IT experience (and given that you say you're 25, I think it'd probably be best to underestimate), you CAN get a very well paying IT job. You just need to be either actively looking now or get the fuck out of California. I have no degree, nor even a high school diploma, but I'm making much more than what they're paying you even though I'm only claiming six years of experience. It's tough to "break in," but once you land a "real" position, you're made.It takes a lot of bullshit to get to that point, though. I was unemployed for a full year and then had to work in a non-IT field for six months before I was able to get back in IT and double my salary.If you do want a degree, I agree that going overseas is a much better idea than attending some $150k domestic diploma mill. Also, don't discount the Foreign Service. Someone already mentioned it, and it's an amazing deal if you can swing it. I'm not talking Foreign Service Officer, either, just standard IT specialist positions.They pay for your (ridiculously nice) housing and since you'll be posted overseas, the first ~$80k you make will be tax-free.Military is always an option as that door is not likely to close in the future. If you do decide to join, though, I would suggest considering using the opportunity to learn a new skill, as opposed to further specializing in IT. You only live once.

Thats basically outside the "495 Belt" (or, the suburbs West of Boston). There is housing that is just as cheap in/around Boston, but don't be suprised to hear about murders going down around you. But there is cheaper housing than that, in decent areas of the Central - Eastern Mass area. As of late, I have been checking out Craig's List, and seeing some nice places (and we're talking 2BR apartments that take up whole floors of multi-family houses) for about 600-800. It's all about looking around the area and determining what is best for you, as I'm sure that you are aware of that already.IT related: From what I remember from your past posts, you seem to have a heavy knowledge when it comes to IT. If you want, I may be able to hook you up with a guy that might have some work for you. Granted, its on an as-needed basis, but it may work in your favor. Also, as I said before, I work for a prestigous job board, I may be able to help you out there as well if you are truly interested.And I know you stressed the fact about not really wanting to go back to school, but have you considered part-time? check out www.wit.edu <- that is the school I attend for night classes towards my bachelor's degree... about 6k/year for tuition alone. Wentworth is one of the better technology schools in the area, and I have heard various recruiters telling me about the students that come out of the school. My friend's father works as one of the top-notch software developers for Intel, and he says he will take anyone with a Wentworth degree before any other school. But enough about that pimpage I say, if you have the time / coin, come out for a week to check it out and see if things might/will work out. Sounds like you should have better luck out here than in LA.

Hm. How about a job at NATO? That's the job listing for the HQ in Brussels, there's other stuff available...Mind you, traffic to and from Evere sucks, which would make you feel right at home (I swear putting the HQ in such a bad traffic spot is their primary defense mechanism or something ). Have you looked into jobs available at American embassies around the globe? Do you speak a second language? Are you willing to learn a second language?darkseid mentioned Switserland (Paging Vlip! paging Vlip!) and iirc there's a few peculiarities with regards to Switsrland. one is that if you want citizenship after moving there, it's a process whereby (iirc) your neighbours and fellow citizens vote on if they're going to allow you citizenship. I also know someone whose daughter lives there, there's some other gotcha's I can't remember at the moment.Wih regards to Holland...well, our social security is better than theirs, and we can get high legally too I found this link an interesting read too about US vs EU differences, fwiw, although I certainly don't agree with everything said in it (like the amount of hours worked, see the recent discussion on amount of work hours versus productivity we had here somewhere...) With regards to savings, you'll need some money to move overseas anyways... Some cost of living info, in general, here.

Arcaic laws and legislation, taxation that makes no fucking sense, gas that costs more per litre than you pay per gallon in the US. You're completely out of your tree.

He filled in a form on the embassy website, and by 3pm that day he had an email saying his visa was approved. It's a one year "working holiday" visa, with an option to extend it for another year. You can only work for one company for 6 months, though. Perfect for working for a bit, saving every penny, then going travelling until the money runs out, rinse, repeat. The United States is not a part of the working holiday program.

Wow, they give you no vacation time?? @_@uhh, yeah, dude, save up some cash, and come out this way to feel it out. You are going to get laid off anyways, so either way, they are going to get rid of you. Not to mention, I could never work for a place that demands you 14 hours a day to tend to their server farm, only to get barely enough to pay my bills.In terms of school, there's Mass College of Art (which is right across the street from Wentworth), which is also another good school from what I hear.
