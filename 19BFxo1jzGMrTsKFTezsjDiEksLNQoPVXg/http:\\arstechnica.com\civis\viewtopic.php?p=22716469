I have cable, but still don't want HBO. I wish HBOGo would allow an online subscription only. I'll probably do what Semi's doing. Maybe.

I have a problem. I've read all the books except the most recent one, so I'd like to hit the book thread, but I know there will be book 5 spoilers in there... I'm slowly reviewing the books via Audible in the car (on book 3 now) but I'm probably 120 hours of commuting away from catching up. Damn.

I'm 1/3 of the way into Storm of Swords for the second time myself. I didn't bother with Game of Thrones. I timed it right the first time, I bought all five and had them read before the show aired. Now I'm hooked. Never the same. Write faster, fat man.

I caved and added HBO to my U-verse. I wanted to add that and the premium HD tier channels and the process got botched somehow, and wiped out all my HD channels... so I went on to the online support. This nice guy gave me the HD back, HD premium tier for free for 6 months and waived the HD monthly cost for 6 months as well. All in 5 minutes. HBO was 16 bucks, but free for 6 months. Yay for online customer service! Jesus, HBOs on demand is a lot of stuff.

If HBOGo were available that way, chances are that it would be the same cost as an HBO package anyway. And isn't HBOGo bundled into the HBO subscription in the first place?

Well it's moot now since I subscribed, but if you think of it as you would subscribing to netflix streaming but no discs, they are two different services through different means. No reason why they couldn't be priced separately. But they don't and yes, it's only available currently as bundled with the HBO subscription, which is why I wished it wasn't.

FYI, those of you that DVR this may want to check on it. Apparently it comes on a different HBO channel than last season for me (Directv). I'm glad I checked because it wasn't going to record tonight's episode and was set to record it tomorrow at 5pm!

I think the casting of Stannis is very well done. Melisandre doesn't look as curvy and sultry as I imagined her. Brienne came out perfect.

Does the Khaleesi still have an army behind her? It didn't seem like it from the visual we saw in the opener.Maybe we should revive the 2 threads (for book and non-book readers) for that question. I was just curious if I missed something from the finale last season.

Mainly just her servants and guards and some miscellaneous slaves that she set free.

While I enjoyed the episode, it was a bit disappointing for me. I agree with dedfish and Anacher that season premieres for shows based on books as expansive as these ones should be 2 hours long. The whole Dragonstone part was most disappointing: there was little introduction or explanation as to why things happened, and if I recall correctly the books Cressen and Melisandre's toast was a "Han shot first" kind of moment. There were some good moments, and Tyrion stole the show as always, but the whole episode felt too much like a videoclip to me. Hopefully the following ones are not so insanely fast paced, or badly put together.

Loved it. I don't envy the writers their job of trying to weave together so many storylines, but I can't see any way they could have done any better.I've seen excellent TV shows with just as many storylines (The Wire, for example), but I'm not sure that I've ever seen one with so many different locations.

Agreed that this needed another hour. It suffered from trying to get too many stories into 1 hour. Should've either left about half the stories out for next week, or made it 2 hours. And I too would've liked a bit more exposition on Dragonstone, Stanis, and Melisandre. The opening scene on Dragonstone didn't have enough anticipation, excitement, and dread to it. Also, Crastor's not nearly creepy enough for what I imagined. But the acting and visualizations are top notch.
