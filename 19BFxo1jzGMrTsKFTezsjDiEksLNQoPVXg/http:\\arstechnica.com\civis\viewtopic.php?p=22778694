Quote:Why? Because he wears the black? He had a small part in a single chapter of Storm of Swords and suddenly everyone knew he had to be Benjen. Not sure why.Because his identity is being hidden. Because, yes, he appears to have been from the Night's Watch. Because Benjen is the only black brother of consequence that we know to be missing. It would be kind of anticlimactic if his former identity was revealed to be some stranger of little consequence. The bit about him being killed long ago is probably the bit that I was remembering that made me doubt that it's Benjen, but I'm pretty sure that Martin wants us to believe that it's Benjen at this point.

He slew some knights when Renly died, but the only battle I can think of is the Battle of the Blackwater (when he dresses in Renly's armor).

Loras did take part in that battle though.

It's not that southerners are poor fighters so much as the people joining up with Renly were treating it as a game, stopping at every castle on the way to have picnics and hold tournaments. I think the comment also cuts at how poorly suited and ill-prepared they were for the upcoming war and winter. And it helped show how Catelyn had been molded into more of a Northerner than she originally appeared when compared to true Northerners early in the series...it's all about perspective.Ok, I saw Ep3 and I think the Margaery/Renly scene helps show, in way that wasn't obvious in the books, that she wants to be Queen. It may help put future events in clearer perspective (i.e. why she would even agree to marry Joffrey, then Tommen, then whoever else comes next...) and make her appear less a pawn used to simply join the Tyrells with whoever may be closest to the throne at the time...

I like the changes they made with her in this episode. My wife and I both only remember Margaery as really only being there at the tourney, and having little to no impact on what was going on. She definitely comes across as more of a player in the show. Which I think will make her more believable when she's living at Kings Landing.

Renly can't be a good king because he has no thirst for battle. A king who doesn't want to fight for his throne won't last very long.

So, question. In A Dance With Dragons perennial über-stalker Quaithe pays a visit to Daenerys and says:Quote:No. Hear me, Daenerys Targaryen. The glass candles are burning. Soon comes the pale mare, and after her the others. Kraken and dark flame, lion and griffin, the sun's son and the mummer's dragon. Trust none of them. Remember the Undying.

I could have sworn Varys was described as having a perfumed odour in the first book at some point, I might have to check again. If he changes clothes when he's out and about, he might wash the stink off too.

I'm confused. The last episode, where Melisandre gives birth to her shadow demon, were they under Storms End or is that the demon that kills Renly? If so, they are skipping a lot of parts in the book and just confusing me. Anyone care to clarify?

If you think about it, storms end is entirely unnecessary for the story.I also think, taking out the extra travel for Arya, and the other stuff is a good idea especially since it gave us time to see more joffery is evil and Rob's falling in love which was kind of abrupt in the book.

I'm getting so very frustrated with this bullshit.Words, words, words, nothing happens. Words, words, travel words, nothing happens. Travel words, a brief description of something actually interesting that is too short, after which again nothing happens.I'm 40% of the way through ADWD and I don't know why I still bother. I've found much that resonates with me in MotherJones' review of the book:Nick Baumann of Mother Jones wrote:A writer who has become obsessed with travel timelines and minor details will produce a book that seems, well, obsessed with travel timelines and minor details. [..]The problem is that most of that travelling and scene-setting is boring [..]And by the end of A Dance With Dragons, neither Victarion Greyjoy nor Tyrion Lannister has even met Daenerys Targaryen in person. They've basically spent the entire book traveling.This is just outrageous. Already I'm bored with Tyrion's interminable journey and Daenerys' interminable dawdling. Now I learn that all those people who were supposed to reach Daenerys, don't. Neither will the Others--from what I've heard--assault the Wall before the end of the book. Seriously, what's left that's interesting? I can't wait to see how many thousands of pages Spoiler: show
Davos' quest for Rickon
will take.GRRM has indicated that he could, if he felt like it, write some good fantasy, as opposed to only good palace intrigues. I want to learn more about Valyria. I want to learn more about the Others. I want to know more about the gods in the books. I want to know what that book in Oldtown is all about. You know, the one that was alluded to around 20% of the way through book 5, in relation to the key that was stolen 1300 pages before in the prologue to AFfC? Yeah. I wouldn't mind some more fantasy and some less absurdly convoluted references.I swear, I'm very tempted to just read a synopsis of what happens and throw the book on the fire.Anyway, two more quotes to finish this post.David Orr of the New York Times wrote:This series is long. “A Dance With Dragons” comes in at roughly 9,574,622,012 pages, and smart money says the final two books in the series will make this one look like “The Old Man and the Sea.” Such length isn’t necessary, and it hurts Martin’s prose and his plot mechanics.Nick Baumann of Mother Jones wrote:Thankfully, there's a solution readily available. It's called editing.Haha, as if.

"The Hedge Knight" ones are prequels to A Song of Ice and Fire. "Sand Kings" is pretty friggin' awesome science fiction, IMO (not in the ASoIaF universe, obviously).

Overall a great episode, though I enjoyed last week's more. The scene with Tyrion and Lancel was brilliant. I lol'ed at his delivery and expression at "An anointed knight at that!" A couple thoughts regarding book-to-screen choices, though:
Spoiler: show
Didn't the shadow baby birth scene come much later in the book? I want to say during the battle of the Blackwater, but that doesn't seem right, either. It's been a while since I read aCoK.Also, while I'm excited to see Qarth, I couldn't help but be disappointed that we didn't get to see the Dead City that Daenerys and her khalasar camped at to recuperate.Was Arya already saying her "prayers" before she hooked up with Jaqen H'ghar?I was really saddened that we didn't get to see more of Brienne this episode. I hope she gets a lot more screen time later on with Catelyn. Also, I'm disappointed that they seem to be either downplaying or completely ignoring the fact that she's in love with Renly. Also noticed that they aren't the "Rainbow Guard", though since there is no subtlety whatsoever about his sexuality in the show, it would probably be too over-the-top to have a bunch of knights prancing about in multicolored cloaks like they just came out of a revival of "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat".

Travel words, a brief description of something actually interesting that is too short, after which again nothing happens.I'm 40% of the way through ADWD and I don't know why I still bother. I've found much that resonates with me in MotherJones' review of the book:Nick Baumann of Mother Jones wrote:A writer who has become obsessed with travel timelines and minor details will produce a book that seems, well, obsessed with travel timelines and minor details. [..]The problem is that most of that travelling and scene-setting is boring [..]And by the end of A Dance With Dragons, neither Victarion Greyjoy nor Tyrion Lannister has even met Daenerys Targaryen in person. They've basically spent the entire book traveling.This is just outrageous. Already I'm bored with Tyrion's interminable journey and Daenerys' interminable dawdling. Now I learn that all those people who were supposed to reach Daenerys, don't. Neither will the Others--from what I've heard--assault the Wall before the end of the book. Seriously, what's left that's interesting? I can't wait to see how many thousands of pages Spoiler: show
Davos' quest for Rickon
will take.GRRM has indicated that he could, if he felt like it, write some good fantasy, as opposed to only good palace intrigues. I want to learn more about Valyria. I want to learn more about the Others. I want to know more about the gods in the books. I want to know what that book in Oldtown is all about. You know, the one that was alluded to around 20% of the way through book 5, in relation to the key that was stolen 1300 pages before in the prologue to AFfC? Yeah. I wouldn't mind some more fantasy and some less absurdly convoluted references.I swear, I'm very tempted to just read a synopsis of what happens and throw the book on the fire.Anyway, two more quotes to finish this post.David Orr of the New York Times wrote:This series is long. “A Dance With Dragons” comes in at roughly 9,574,622,012 pages, and smart money says the final two books in the series will make this one look like “The Old Man and the Sea.” Such length isn’t necessary, and it hurts Martin’s prose and his plot mechanics.Nick Baumann of Mother Jones wrote:Thankfully, there's a solution readily available. It's called editing.Haha, as if.Unfortunately, if all a reader thinks that has happened during that time is "they were traveling" then the reader is very likely skimming the book and/or not paying attention anyway.

It too was long, but the whole thing was over and done with in 3 books, not 5 and counting.fitten wrote:Unfortunately, if all a reader thinks that has happened during that time is "they were traveling" then the reader is very likely skimming the book and/or not paying attention anyway.Shall I summarise the book for you by chapter or by character? Bear in mind, I'm only 40% done.Tyrion: travels first by palanquin, then by boat, then by horse, then by boat. Drinks and broods.Daenerys: fails at suppressing insurrection, raising dragons, being decisive. Wants sex but doesn't know how to get it.Jon: Recruits more men than he can feed. Politics with Stannis.Bran: Travels north, hides in cave. Regularly mind rapes Hodor.Davos: Gets caught. Gets released.Melisandre: Magic is hard.Quentyn Martell: Acquires aliases.Did I omit much?Look, I'm still reading the book. I've read all of them in quick succession. I like high fantasy and high magic settings more than the opposite. I'm not very fond of intrigue. So what I'm saying is I'm somewhat outside the target audience for the books but am still somewhat enjoying them.That doesn't change the fact they're plodding and prolix.
