The season's first episode of Prison Break was downloaded through BitTorrent almost a million times in under 24 hours since its network airing, even though it was available for free from the networks online.Read More

I'd like to see the actual numbers that watched the episode on Hulu and Fox.com.I for one like to collect my favorite shows, so I tend to download them. For convenience however, I watch them on Hulu when traveling or when I'm stuck after hours at work. I am pretty pleased with that site.

Also, streaming to clients outside the US is prohibited, at least on hulu.com. I wonder what the percentage of non-US downloaders is - probably not too shabby.Edit: I just checked fox.com:"Thank you for your interest in FOX.This service is currently available to viewers living in the United States."

There's a simple solution that CBS has been doing for 2 years magnificently: put it on the cable and satellite companies On-Demand feature.I think the big reason is people hate watching TV/movies on their computer monitor, they'd rather x-fer it to their TV somehow.

@zeb600 That's exactly it. I'd take a wild stab and say most of those downloaders are from outside the US. Just a few years back a TV channel over here had to cut down significantly on the delay between the US airing and the local airing of Lost because significant amounts of people caught it on Bittorrent instead.

I downloaded it because the streaming service is not available outside of the US, and it'll probably be a while before i get to see it subtitled in spanish on cable, it takes from 6 to 8 months on average.Long live p2p!!

Oh come on, the problem isn't that you need to be connected to the internet to watch - it's that they take *FREAKIN FOREVER* to post the episode on the streaming service. I'd regularly wait 24+ hours for new BSG episodes to show up on iTunes - when an HD torrent would be available two hours after the episode aired.Yeah, I know they don't want to cannibalize their network affiliates' ad revenue by simultaneously making the episode available online, but come on, they can do a lot better than they have been doing. I should be able to get the episode an hour after it's aired on the west coast.

Another issue is that people are familiar with torrent sites, and go to them first for new episodes. I didn't even know the show was available for steaming (although it sounds like it wasn't for me as I'm in the UK).If the channel is going to stream it for free anyway, why not just upload a .torrent themselves? Do a deal with a few BT sites for some advertising maybe, or tack a trailer on to the end (be warned - if you put annoying ads in your version becomes worse than the capped one, so no-one wants it)...

For me, video quality has a lot to do with it. I don't like the free streaming from networks as it is usually poorer quality than what I can get from P2P. I will even wait for a series to come out on DVD since that is even superior to some of our "HD" channels (NBC, for one, is very compressed on TWC here in San Antonio; I know, OTA, FTW).

I'm already paying for cable and DVR service - why should it matter that I want to download an HD copy to play on XBMC or transcode for use on my iPhone? The streaming services available are great and a step in the right direction but it only benefits me if I want to watch the content at my desk...

I think if they made Hulu easily usable through boxes connected to the TV like the Roku Netflix box, Xbox 360, or PS3, even including the ads, they'd be making a step in the right direction. Add in a lot of the new IP connected current generation HDTVs, and you'd catch even more people.I have an HTPC that allows me to full screen it on TV, but that's not convenient for most that are possibly going to already have a console or other option.Add in the already mentioned "On Demand" options ala CBS and I'd bet it would reduce torrenting.

Same boat here. I pay for cable as well as a PVR device. I personally don't see why I can't take the eps from my PVR and watch them on the go. Seeing as they wont let me do that I download them.P.S. Not to mention I'm in Canada and can't stream as its US only.

Yeah, a small cadre of morons are happy to pay two bucks an episode of network television.If the networks want digital distribution to be viable, they're going to have to lower the price, for as long as the files are DRM'ed, these purchases are nothing more than a long-term rental. People aren't stupid.

Zeb hit on this Jacqui, but I'm willing to bet that at least half of those downloaders are from outside the US. These shows premieres in the US months before they run anywhere else, and with so many hardcore fans discussing their favourite shows on the internet, you have no interest in waiting for your local station to air the show.I can easily think of 5 or 6 of my friends in Ireland who will definitely have torrented this episode the minute it became available on torrent websites. This is not because they don't want to watch TV anymore, or that they don't want to watch advertising, or that they love the convenience of downloading. These things are all nice bonuses, but at the end of the day they want to watch the show as soon as they can. They have no interest in waiting for the publisher to release the show to international channels, and then for Sky, BBC or whoever to pony up the cash and free up time in their schedule to display it. So they download. The publishers of the show make no profit from their viewing. The international viewers don't give a shit because they've been given the short end of the stick for as long as they've been fans of TV. "Fuck 'em!", they say. They're perfectly justified.

If the networks seeded a non-DRMed avi file of their episodes, with commercials, I would watch their commercials, don't care. The ad levels in the streaming videos are a lot less offensive than all the dreck added by local stations.

Precisely. Not a US IP? Go hit your favorite torrent tracker, you untermensch you. And not only the shows are often released in other countries months after they air in US (if they ever are), in many countries they're released with atrocious dubbing that pretty much destroys the show for anyone fluent in English. Even when you don't speak the language, subtitles are a million times better than dubbing unless you're illiterate - and networks generally deny you the choice. No wonder P2P networks are growing - they're often the only way to watch something.

Hulu and Fox.comBoth US only. A good number of those downloads are likely going international, especially to the countries where it won't show for months.

Like someone said before. If the networks seeded non-drm version of the videos and threw in ads I don't mind and would glady do that over going to the dark side.As a few of us know Hulu and Fox don't offer the streaming to people outside of the US, arguably a good chunk of the people that enjoy the shows.

And if the networks look for global ad revenue, they might actually make more money. Intel is an international brand as are many others.

I stream hulu all the time (and torrents for non-hulu shows, and surfthechannel for yet others). I just hook my laptop up to my TV to get the big screen running. I have no issues. Hulu is a great service. I do notice a degraded quality in the video, but the distance I sit from the TV, it's not intrusive, even w/ 20/20 vision.

Open EZTV in the morning, download the .torrent to my WHS box uTorrent pickup folder, watch the episode in the evening after work. Don't really care about the ads, but this (or eMule) is the only way I can get my hands on House, Dexter, Stargate: Atlantis, or Battlestar Galactica. Unless I choose to wait a year and pay $150-200 or so (including delivery and taxes) for the boxed set.

What country doesn't have Coca-Cola available for sale?There are some products that are available pretty much world-wide. Inserting ads for these products into a program that is torrented would make sense.Frankly, the shows are going to be torrented by someone, and there's little chance that it will be stopped. The content owners are missing a chance to make a little bit of money selling ads to be placed in those torrents.

Considering that it already has universal and global market penetration, I'd say that is a waste of money. Besides, advertisers like to target their ads, and an ad channel where viewers are completely random people from all over the developed world whose only common point is interest in a particular show is kind of a... niche market, I'd say.

They could easily seed regional versions with local ad content. The lower latency would likely make these faster to get, as there would be more traffic over local ISPs fiber and less over the wide internet (as long as a fair number were online in each region).EDIT:AND if they could try to collect demographics info (I'm sure they would not be smart enough to JUST ask for demographics, instead of trying to get your credit history and dental records), maybe a simple form to submit before they let you download the *.torrent

I can think of tons of things that are sold all over the world. For example, cars, drinks, alcohol, tires, shampoo, soap, candy bars, toothpaste, razors, fast food, pizza. The list can go on, but the point is that the network execs are old farts living in the past. They don't understand what the current generation wants, and most younger people don't have time take their lame surveys. If they just bothered to ask their grandchildren and their friends, they might actually get somewhere. I think portability is #1 issue here. How many people would like to watch the shows on the bus, subway, plane or train while they are commuting to/from work because they don't have that much time at home or they would rather spend it with their family.

Regarding the business model of free, non-DRM, easily portable shows with no commercials, placement advertising is a good option. The real problem with this sort of distribution is not how to place the ads, they have had that one figured out for decades, the real problem is the entire industries reliance on Neilsen ratings for determining how much to charge for said ads/placements. The simple fact is that they haven't figured out how to charge for this type of distribution yet.Regarding streaming sites, well I have been using Hulu since it was beta and watching streaming video on network sites long before that. They are decent ways to enjoy video, but if the networks really want this to take off they need to find a convenient way to allow playback on televisions, they need to make more material available (one of the biggest complaints that I hear regarding Hulu and other sites is that show X is not available or episode Y is not available). This particular point makes absolutely NO sense to me. They make money from ads only when those ads are viewed. People are more likely to view those ads if the shows that they want to watch are available. To not make some of the most popular shows available is both idiotic and asinine. I believe that the primary reason that they do this is because they hate giving up the "scheduling" aspect of their control. They still want to mandate what people watch and when even if they can't do it by the minute anymore.Finally, they need to push for better broadband across the US. I have a broadband connection which runs at around 850 Kbps this at times causes the streaming video from Hulu and other networks to stutter or freeze every once in a while. It finally got so bad yesterday that I contacted Hulu's tech support. Here is their response:quote:We're sorry to hear that you are experiencing difficulties with Hulu'sservices. Unfortunately, it seems like the bandwidth on the networkdoes not meet Hulu's minimum requirements. You can review our minimumrequirements at http://www.hulu.com/support/technical_faq#reqs . Dueto legal reasons, Hulu currently does not buffer more than a smallportion of the videos, we also do not support downloads for the samereason.We apologize for the inconvenience and we are mindful of our users whomay have lower bandwidth than necessary, and we hope to solve thisproblem as we expand in our methods of distribution. Okay, 850 Mbps is not that fast any more, but give me a break. Where I live it is the best I can get, and there is a large portion of the US in the same situation I am in. Add to that the tyrannical caps being introduced by many ISPs to eliminate their competition, oops did I say that out loud? I meant restrict the abuse of their flagging infrastructure due to those damn pirates, and people who don't want to pay for overpriced cable, oops did I say that out loud also? Seriously, isn't that illegal?So, couple this relatively high bandwidth requirement with the remaining DRM which will not allow sites like Hulu to buffer adequately and I think that the networks are basically getting what they deserve when people steal their stuff. They still have not figured out that DRM is not useful and actually does little to do anything but drive people to steal. Honestly, who is the brain-dead idiot who thinks that the low quality streams from Hulu are ripe to being stolen when it is easier to go to P2P and download HD quality shows.In effect, the networks are their own worst enemies in this regard. Yeah, they made a step in the right direction, but then hampered that step with their own idiocy and resistance to true innovation. And until they finally decide to give people what they want without DRM they will continue to lose this battle. Period.

Yep, Who the heck wants to watch a show streaming from their laptop?? Not to mention the problems associated with connections buffering, inability to rewind, etc.I can setup an RSS feed bittorrent client to automatically pull down new XVID encoded episodes. They go right into my external HD and are instantly available on any UPnP device on the wiFi network, which in my case is a playstation 3 connected to an HDTV. Works flawlessly... Would I pay for that in addition to my cable and DVR service ? possibly... Would I switch to free bittorrent downloads from the studio with their advertisements inserted? sure, as long as the quality was HD and they made them available soon after the espisode airs.Just like others say, if we are already paying for cable and DVR service, what is the difference between Tivo'ing a show and downloading a bittorent copy to watch?? If the studios made them available (with ads) but WITHOUT DRM and legally available than I'm sure a lot more people would take them up on it versus online streaming that you can't watch on your TV or paid iTunes downloads...

More interested english-language internet-savy viewers live outside the US than within it, as long as Fox and Hulu have region restrictions, torrents and other unauthorized forms of online distribution will be more popular.

Torrentfreak pick numbers out of the air. Downloads for Prison Break might be around a million but over a week or more. Not in 24 hours. And obviously, Hulu isn't going to appeal to anyone outside the US.

We actually just downloaded our first episodes over bittorrent this week. We started watching a show on Hulu, and got through the first season. We enjoyed it and then went to start season two. What? episodes 1-4 aren't online anymore but 5-7 are? I want to watch the show...but can't? makes no sense. So I downloaded the 4 I couldn't stream (minus ads and in much better quality). Then we watched the rest of the ones online. Talk about creating an artificial scarcity in the market- the consumer will go to who can supply the content. I don't mind the ads on Hulu to not use the site- but I do mind not having shows when they say they will, or when they pull it for asinine reasons.

As was mentioned before the "US only" crap really sucks and is likely a driving force behind the p2p numbers. Whatever happened to the "global village" concept? Oh yeah I forgot it was vanquished by IPR and naked greed. Oddly enough lots of Americans live outside the US and want US products and NOT products from the local market they are in either for language or format reasons. What is worse is when one try to buy something and gets a message saying 'sorry you are not in a valid market'. I take that message to mean "please feel free to download this product since we dont want your money".Regarding the comments that a million downloads is a random number. I think not, in fact I think it is an understatement. For example if one checks just the public ezTV site they can see over 200k DL done in less then 20 hours.
