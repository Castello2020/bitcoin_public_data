              I've been fighting with this since Middle School.  What and Why is the uncertainty principal in quantum physics?<BR><BR><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle" TARGET=_blank>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle</A><BR><BR>From what I've gathered over the years, it is due to the difficulties in combining the math for particles with the math for waves - one must either look at the item of study as a wave, or collapse the wave-form in order to treat the object as a particle; limiting the scope of the equation to the strongest signal area (the 'standing wave') at the expense of all the outlying points otherwise covered by the wave function.<BR><BR>Wave-particles are not waves or particles, but can exhibit the properties of each depending on the situation at hand.  The equations we have to predict the behavior of each (as verified in lab experiments) are extremely good at what they do.<BR><BR>But neither set works to completely predict a wave-particle at all times, and the problem is compounded by the fact that figuring out the data for one set makes us less uncertain about the other, due to the localization property of Fourier transforms.<BR>"the more concentrated <I>f(t)</I> is, the more spread out <I>F(w)</I> is.  In particular, if we "squeeze" a function in <I>t</I>, it spreads out in <I>w</I> and vise-versa; and we cannot arbitrarily concentrate both the function and its Fourier transform."<BR><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform#Localization_property" TARGET=_blank>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform#Localization_property</A><BR><BR>So what this means is (in high school physics terms) that we can know only two of the three at any given time: position, direction, and velocity.  What this also means is that the more accurately you measure the two known items, the less accurate any information about the third will be.<BR><BR>I understand all that on a book-learnin' level, but it all feels like wood to me, instead of marble (in Einstein's terminology).  It doesn't feel smooth.  Since wave-particles are not waves nor particles, why do we limit ourselves to wave math and particle math, and the uncertainty that exists between the two?  Might there be an as-of-yet undiscovered math that describes wave-particle behavior perfectly?  And if some new Newton were to come along and invent that math as Newton invented calculus, would the localization property no longer apply, and would the Heisenberg Uncertainty principal fall by the wayside?<BR><BR>Or am I missing something key about the whole concept, and Heisenberg's principal is not one rooted in math, but in nature itself?  Is the principal actually suggesting that until a particle is "measured" by interaction with something else, that its waveform is not determined?  That prior to a particle striking a photo sheet, no 'particle' even really exists?<BR><BR><BR><I>NOTE:  I am not the bestest at math, which may very well be where my problem lies.  any explanations that tend toward English will be more understandable - the more formulas, the more lost I will become - I have no degree in physics, and thus much of the basic formula functions are not in my vocabulary.  Pop-sci books, Feynman's Lectures and books, and wikipedia are my level of Physics knowledge.</I>  Thanks!

              One way to visualize it is to think of the particle you want to observe as a croquet ball in motion, and the only way you can "observe" the ball is to whack it with your croquet mallet.  Your very observation changes what you see.<BR><BR>Perhaps now is a good time to post the link to the <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7oGc" TARGET=_blank>What the bleep</A> video that talks about this same thing.  Entertaining, informative, and more than a little bit creepy.

              TO add to this, I have a question: In the Schrodenger's cat example, after the allotted time, and you don't know if the cat is dead or alive, are we supposed to believe that the cat REALLY IS in a superimposed state of being both? Or is that just a macro example of a quantum phenomenon, and the cat really is eoither alive or dead? I think the latter, but always wanted it verifies by someone smarter than me on the topic, whcih is anybody <img src="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/groupee_common/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" width="15" height="15"><!--graemlin::)-->

              I'm not really sure about this... <img src="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/groupee_common/emoticons/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" width="15" height="15"><!--graemlin:;)--><BR><BR>I recall Wikipedia's article on it to be quite good, but I can see if I can find something better at a later time (at work now).<BR><BR>As for Schrodenger's cat, I recall it was originally supposed to illustrate the absurdity of quantum mechanics.  There is no way a cat can be both alive and dead.  <BR><BR>Over the decades it has evolved to illustrate that an object (the cat in this case) DOES (not can, but does) exist in a superposition of states until it is measured, then one single value will be seen (e.g. alive/dead).  Of course, this goofiness is keep in the realm of the very small due to Planck's constant being tiny.<BR><BR>EDIT:  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle#Derivation" TARGET=_blank>This derivation</A> illustrates that there is nothing inherently special about Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, as ANY two (Hermitian) operators can be shown to follow that relationship due to the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality.

My subsequent explanation was a bit murky, as it assumed a quantum cat. <BR><BR>As you reach a certain size/number of atoms(or particles, or objects, etc..)/energy level the statistics of QM converge on certainty and classical mechanics takes over (is recovered (?)).  (As an aside, this is why Bose-Einstein condensates are interesting, they represent a macroscopic entity that acts as a quantum one)<BR><BR>While it is statistically possible for you to go and walk into a solid wall and completely tunnel your way to the other side, the realistic chances of it ever happening are 0.  Yes, the true probability is non-zero, but it is so close it becomes one of those "it'll take 10 times the lifetime of the universe for it happen once" events.  This was what I was referring to when I said this "goofiness" (referring to the odd effects of the quantum world) disappear in macroscopic objects because h-bar (planck's constant/2 pi) is so small.  If it were a larger value, then we would experience quantum effects on larger objects, if it was big enough we'd see these effects on macroscopic objects and then the world would really be screwy.

To elaborate on this a little, a particle can be in a well-defined, or pure state, yet still not have a well defined position and/or momentum.<BR><BR>As an optics guy, I always resort to photons to explain things.  Photons have a polarization, which is just the direction the electric field oscillates.  I can have a vertically polarized photon, which is an exactly known state.  If I put it through a vertical polarizer (A device which only lets through vertical polarization), it will go through 100% of the time -- I know the state exactly.  If I put it through a horizontal polarizer, it will be blocked 100% of the time.  I can also have a horizontally polarized photon, which is likewise well defined, and is transmitted/blocked by the horizontal/vertical polarizer.<BR><BR>The trick is, I can also have a diagonally polarized photon.  This is yet another pure, completely known state, it is just rotated 45 degrees.  I can use a diagonal polarizer, and it goes through, again, 100% of the time.  The trick is, now if I measure this photon with a horizontal or vertical polarizer, I will get either answer (blocked or transmitted) with 50% probability.<BR><BR>It isn't that I lacked knowledge of how horizontal or vertical my photon was -- it simply was in a state that wasn't well defined as horizontal or vertical.  This happens because 'horizontalness' and 'diagonalness' are what we refer to in a technical sense as 'non-commuting observables.'  In more plain language, that means that they can't both be well defined for a photon.<BR><BR>A small minority of physicists try to hold on to the notion that my diagonally polarized photon 'internally knew' whether it was going to be vertical or horizontal -- a local hidden variable theory.  However, these theories have been almost (but perhaps not quote) conclusively disproven by Bell inequality tests.

This is yet another pure, completely known state, it is just rotated 45 degrees. I can use a diagonal polarizer, and it goes through, again, 100% of the time. The trick is, now if I measure this photon with a horizontal or vertical polarizer, I will get either answer (blocked or transmitted) with 50% probability. </div></BLOCKQUOTE>This exaplanation, I like it.
