Fraud alert on my debit card. That's annoying. There was a $3.60 charge listed as a knife company that's been bankrupt for 3 years, and supposedly at an address in a California town that doesn't exist.

One week ago, one of my friends informed me that she and her husband were getting divorced. Two days ago, my dad rang me up to tell me that my stepmum and he were getting a divorce. Today, my sister told me that she and my brother-in-law are getting divorced. All of them want to talk about it.What the hell? I fucking refuse to be support for all of you.

WTF was I thinking scheduling movers for just 9 days after deciding to move/signing a lease? Oh that's right, I was thinking I need to get away from the mice and the dog-pee-scented carpet. But still, packing an entire apartment in 7 days? Do-able, but OMG mode right now. 1.5 days and half the apartment left to pack.

For the first time this spring, the Weber has been lit. Meat has met fire, before going in mah belly! Grass-fed rib-eye from a local farm, new potatoes, frisee salad, roasted red peppers. And Sam Adams Noble Pils, which is mighty tasty for a pilsner.

Read this fun, front page article about drying cell phones. Saw it was written by Casey Johnston. Saw it had some embedded video. Thought, ':sigh: How many posts in the comments thread before some mouthbreathing tool vomits out a bunch of sexist and/or objectifying crap?' Opened the comments and started reading.
