This training I'm in is rather dull; and it doesn't help that I slept like shit last night (I really need to stop myself from drinking caffeinated beverages after about 4PM)...if they'd only turn off the lights in here, I could catch some Zzz's

I moved this past weekend. Neither the heat, nor the humidity, nor the monsoon downpours could discourage me. I'm really sore now, though.Tomorrow, I should be able to get the cable and internet hooked up. Yay!

Attached a Sony CT-150 sound bar.The TV just sits on a stand, but the brackets work for wall mounted too. Can also munt the bar below the TV.One thing that I may not adjust to is that it kind of looks like there's a bow tie on top of the TV. If it remains a distraction, I'll try some other arrangement or find a way to camouflage it.

Spend the weekend in Lauterbrunnen in the mountains. The camp ground/hostel I stayed at was full of tour groups of mostly Australians and some Canadians touring Europe on a bus. Getting drunk every night.Left my camera lying around the bar. When I got it back it was full of a number of various amusing drunk pictures of random people. Very cool stuff.

Walked into a Bestbuy and though hell froze over. There was a bin of HDMI cables for $10 bucks reasonably priced in plastic bags. Right next to their $30 cable with the same store brand name.
