An accidental plague that wiped out cities in World of Warcraft has drawn the attention of epidemiology researchers, who are negotiating with Blizzard about future studies. The next virtual horror might be intentional.Read More

Well, all those New Plague quests you do for the Forsaken kinda end abruptly...actually doing something like that (Northrend, anyone?) would be totally awesome.

Trouble is, the quests still have to exist for everyone. That's why if you think too hard about WoW, it doesn't hold up in the slightest. That said, I still love the game. If only I had more time to play...

The plague that happened didn't have anything to do with a quest though. It started in a raid encounter. Usually it would be over shortly after the encounter. However, in this case a player or pet was brought into a high population area where it spread to players who could not even access that encounter. Once in that dense population it spread uncontrolably and because characters would die and come back only to be rerinfected and killed by it, it had nearly unlimited hosts.

It should also be noted, that once it was determined what caused it, there were folks *purposely* spreading it to as many people as possible.I would hope that wouldn't be a behavior replicated in the real world.

I was online when it happened and it was hilarious. From what I understand, there was an encounter in Zul'Gurub where players would get infected with this short duration disease that did wicked damage and was highly contagious to any other players standing too close. The idea was the infected player would run away to prevent the deaths of his raiding buddies.The thing was pets could catch it too and die. When the player re-summoned the pet it would still have the disease. It was never meant to leave Zul'Gurub but, due to the pet bug, it spread life wildfire in whatever area the pet was re-summoned.There were corpses all over the main cities. People dropping dead in waves, respawning, and catching it again.I question the value as a 'pandemic simulation' though. It wasn't a heroic battle against an encroaching plague. It was more like, "I think I'll go to the bank and WTF?! I'm dead?" There's only so much you can extrapolate from the cartoony magic of a bugged MMORPG.

Something like HPV or even HIV could be a useful thing modeled by the "invisible to users" plague.

holy s#it...what is this world coming to??? i was going to post something funny about wow and selling vaccines on ebay...but "the gift" totally just ruined my day....can people seriously be so fked up in the head that they think that getting a disease as horrendous as hiv could ever be considered a "gift"???i cant even begin to imagine trying to explain that to somebody that is dying with aids...much less so in cases where it could have been transmitted though any other blood to blood contact, not necessarily through "sinful..." endeavors.wow...just wow (no pun intended at all).-c

I don't think that's the case - there are diseases that spread through hosts who are unaware, and that are not disruptive until later, and this could help simulate those drawing on human behavior that might not yet be accurately modeled.

I started reading the general chat and once I knew what was going on, I laughed my ass off.The bug was with the pets but if I remember correctly you had to dismiss your pet while they were infected, leave the ZG instance and then when you called your pet back they still had the disease. If they were with you when you left, the act of leaving the instance canceled the disease.I always thought it was a great idea to add to the game. The big problem was that it was lethal almost immediately to lower level characters, which is why the AHs and Banks were stacked high with corpses. I think it would be cool if they unleashed something like this occasionally just to make things more interesting. kcisobderf

I think that there are a lot of interesting possibilities with this. Primarily around other non-lethal but annoying effects of diseases. Like a social disease that is carried by some enemies, and once transmitted to a character it is only transmitted through contact with other characters (like trading). The effects or presence of the disease does not appear for say one hour and once it manifests it starts lowering stats, lessoning the effects of healing items or spells. The character can still play, but is just plain weaker.The more interesting diseases would be hard to simulate in a game without seriously angering gamers. Like Herpes, something that is incurable and has a huge social prejudice against it... It will be interesting to see what the developers of WoW come up with.

If smallpox struck Portland.A sim study done a couple of years back. I tried to get a grant to do a similar study here in the border region of San Diego/Tijuana (the company I was working with at the time was a public health consultancy), but the funding never came though. I'd still love to do something like it-- fascinating stuff.

Call me cynical but this sounds like nothing more than cheap CV-padding for junior professors and post-docs desperately seeking that elusive tenure-track dream job (not to mention a juicy NIH grant in the meantime).Yes, these things very well could be simulated in a realistic/useful manner, but WoW is not the vehicle for doing it. As the Penny Arcade strip referenced above not-so-subtly alludes, people tend to be very much not themselves on the 'net -- let's face it, that's the very point of RPG games, ain't it?.

I, too, hovered over the 'links'. Bravo sir, bravo.Also, the Zul'Gurub debuff wasn't the only one that was able to be 'brought out' so to speak. I was never able to recreate this event, but I had it happen to me once. Basically, in the Upper Blackrock Spire instance, a hunter is typically called upon to 'kite' the last boss out of the room, so the other group members can kill the adds much easier. That particular boss doles out a nasty debuff called 'conflaguration', which does a lot of damage over a short amount of time, and affects others in range of the person affected. I had kited that boss, and during the fight my pet had beeen hit with conflag, typically something that would kill him in a quick hurry. But, I had just gotten out of 'pet range' and my pet despawned with the debuff. I didn't think anything of it until later, when I was sitting at the auction house, and called him out for some reason or another, and there he was, on fire, running around all crazy like. I do believe I killed at least 5 alts before he bit it, almost killing myself in the process. I found it terribly amusing, but it wasn't something easy to reproduce.

Also interesting to epidemiologists would be the trips that people had to take into the cities to visit the auction house, knowing there would be a plague there. Kinda like people risking going outside to gather supplies when there's a real epidemic on.

Great idea, except:- "Death" in game is not the same as death in real life.- The average player in a battleground in WoW dies what? ten, twenty times in half an hour?- Its very unlikelly to have a plague in the real world where all the victims are unaware that they are infected.- The infected players feel no physical disconfort from the disease. There is no way you can come close to an even remotely accurate model of an epidemic under these conditions. As a player though, it would be great to see some epidemics running around. But only for the fun factor, since i don't believe there's any real use for WoW by "epidemiology researchers".EDIT: Also... invisible plagues = more work on the server = slower game.

Since you do not pay a penalty in WoW for death its just a minor annoyance. More accuracy could be dervived from a more challenging game i think.

I agree, it's going to have to be annoying and persistent after death, which is worse than lethal in WoW.Maybe you just plain sneeze all the time, maybe it gives you the 'drunk' effect? Whatever, it can't prevent you from fighting (I don't think making you weaker would go down well with players) and there's got to be a process you can go through to get the cure that takes a bit of time. I think infection must be visible to players and others within a few minutes, or it will be too hard to control.Maybe they put magic gates up at the entrances to certain areas that won't let you through if you are infected and make it part of the storyline.
