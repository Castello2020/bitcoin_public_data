The Sam wrote:I know it's heresy and a rejection of a core flavor and texture agent in the world of cooking...but no, usually I don't care for onions.The flavor is fine--I like roasts that are cooked with onions, I don't mind if onion powder is used. It's the texture that I can't stand. It's that way with most foods that I don't like.In some contexts, I'll put up with them. A very small amount of grilled onions on a burger is fine, although if I have the ability to customize a burger I'll ask for it without. Same for meatloaf--onions aren't a deal-breaker as long as they're not huge chunks, but given my druthers I'd just as soon avoid them (my mom has made her signature meatloaf with onion powder instead of onions for three decades now because I'm her favorite, much to my father's disappointment--he loves onions).And I like onion rings, of course. Everyone likes onion rings.But yeah, generally speaking I don't care for them. Tomatoes are much the same way. Tomato sauces? Yum. Tomato soup? It's a required accompaniment to a grilled cheese sandwich. Tomato juice? I drink it regularly. An actual tomato? GET THAT REVOLTING PIECE OF SHIT AWAY FROM MY MOUTH.This describes me quite accurately- I don't care for onions in most cases and if they're present in large quantities, I'll pull them out (i.e. a giant slice of raw onion on a burger), and if I have the choice, I won't have them there at all in the first place. If there's a small amount of onions, and they're not overpowering the rest of the food, I'll live with them.Tomatoes, on the other hand, have no place near food unless they've been processed into a sauce/juice/paste/soup. Especially if they're the raw, artificially ripened half-green tomatoes you'll get at a restaurant, or stewed so all that's left is a vague tomato flavor in a big chunk of mush. I've had some raw straight-from-the-garden tomatoes that I've enjoyed, but unless I watched the tomato being picked and sliced up, it's not worth the risk of taking a bite.

My roommate is allergic to onions, tomatoes, and garlic. He may be a vampire.I like to cook, and I've just made it second nature to avoid onions in anything I make so that I always have a guinea pig food taster for pretty much anything I cook. So for me, onions are definitely a No. I can't even remember the last time I had one in anything.

It's days like this that I start to think I don't even know Ars anymore.After years of wacky recipes and cooking challenges, I've learned that it matters just as much what you put in your food...as what you don't. A decade ago, I'd have never thought it possible to make alfredo sauce without milk, or pancakes with cabbage, or lemonade without lemons, or (as in this case, a week ago for a chili cookoff) amazing chili without tomatoes, onions, or garlic. But it's all there, you just need to be willing to be adventurous. Or at least to have a multitude of rubber ducks (tasters) to throw into the shark-infested bathtub of culinary experimentation.

I'll never put onions on a sandwich, a burger or a pizza. But they're a key ingredient in many foods that I adore. So... yes, with reservations?

I like onions when they are called for. Here are a few occasions where they aren't called for and this Korean run deli for some fucking reason puts onions in their sandwiches because they're trying to be fancy.Menu.Turkey BLT Sandwich. Fine. Turkey. Bacon. Lettuce. Tomato. and then Onion. What the fuck.And their "Classic Pastrami Sandwich" Pastrami. And the rest goes non-classic. American Cheese and onions.The minds people have.

I really like green onions on a chicken pizza with white sauce, for example. Scallions are great in a salad. I guess I'm just super picky about what onions I'll eat on different kinds of food. But keep those onions the fuck away from my burgers and sandwiches.Red onions are fantastic in a red sauce or in stir fry with sweet and sour (and red pepper and Sriracha).

It's totally a texture thing for me with onions. If I'm making a soup or tomato sauce, I'll use them, but I'll puree the everliving shit out of it with the immersion blender. I don't mind adding onion flavor if I'm making something, but the texture is what gets me. I can't do them on burgers or sandwiches or anything like that.

But the texture of any onion whether cooked or raw, just makes me gag.Honestly I think it has a lot to do with growing up, I didn't like them at all, but my mother was really big on onions and whether I liked it or not I was forced to eat them.

Yellow onions that you'd use in a bolognese sauce or something? Yeah, don't use those raw. Spring onions or sweet onions, though, don't overpower at all, provided you use them sparingly.Man, now I'm jonesing for a sandwich - white bread, mayo, strong cheddar, tomato, spring onion, salt & pepper.
