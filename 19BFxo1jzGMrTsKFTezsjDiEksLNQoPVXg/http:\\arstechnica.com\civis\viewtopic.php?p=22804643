It's not so much they seem to commit more crimes, but the crimes seem to stem from arrogance and a sense they can't be touched.I can put it like this: police departments often have specific protocols in place to address specific players. The procedures stipulate that if 'X' gets addressed, do 'Y' to avoid the media shit storm that follows. Not necessarily because X deserves special treatment, but because the media attention that follows pulls police resources away from actually addressing other crimes. For example: when I was in Dallas there were binders addressing the following interesting topics:A plane crash at or near Love FieldIndustrial accident at a facility near downtown DallasHAZMAT situation on Interstate 35Tony Romo gets arrested for driving drunk

Funny, someone mentioned getting butthurt about the chili meme at ARS ( ), and that reminded me about my thread four years ago. I was going full steam ahead with the chili booklet, and then I got hit by a triple whammy.1) Any money I collected for the chili booklet was taxable income (money would not be going to an official charity)2) my brothers ex-wife found out the balance of the account and started harassing my mother for my brothers insurance money (and ultimately the chili booklet money would be going to her - so I was not as invested in increasing the value of that account)3) The print job was absolute shit (not that my editing skills were awesome), and I just did not have the heart to fight for a better jobThat kind of made the entire process moot, and just the other day I found the box with 200, or so, of those booklets. I am still torn on what to do with them. Keep one, and shred the rest? Do some sort of mailout? Maybe I will give them a viking funeral in our firepit this summer.

You've already paid for the printing job, terrible or no, right? As long as they're legible, give them away. Gift one to your Sekrit Santee when the holidays roll around. Offer a copy to your local public libraries (they usually have a section for "local authors").If they're illegible, use them for paper mache, create a life-size model tyrannosaur and park it on your brother's ex-wife's lawn in the middle of the night.

I've mentioned a few times I'm planning on moving in the next few months. I'm planning to stay in the US, but I'm not at all opposed to moving out of the country either.A coworker says I should more to Pakistan cause its the best country EVER!!! ... but she's from Pakistan, so she might be biased. I might move out of the country but, um ... just not sure about there.

They're the best!------me: that new guy is a pretty good DBAher: that's true, but the BEST DBAs are from Pakistan-----Me: I went out to this one place and had a great croque-madame sandwichHer: french food is ok, but you need to try Pakistani food it's ... wait for it ...

Guilty Pleasures: I sometimes like to go on Piratebay and see what the top 100s are. Things I have learned:- Porn has trends I have never been able to define. Currently MILFs are becoming more popular. Eh, they deserve love, too.- Wow, people who download music have little to no taste in music. Really? You want to fuck over the RIAA for LMFAO? Such a shallow victory.- I am surprised they only have one shakycam video of The Avengers as I type this... with Dutch subtitles and missing the first 15 minutes (if the comments are to be believed). I heard it's out in Europe and the Pacific Rim already (one of my Aussie friends said it's incredible), so what's the holdup?- There is a lot of DJ/music recording software out there. But who wants to install dodgy software from a torrent? I'll have one virus with my mp3 encoder, please!

With all the terrible shit happening in this town (okay, all around our world), it's easy to understand why we sometimes seek out the diversions that "news of the weird" sites and services provide. Albuquerque contributes frequently. This week, it's our hotdog vendor wars, which have turned violent! (This story blew the moth invasion right out of sight, for the weekend at least.) For non-serious news, the Huffington Post does okay - this is a fun article:http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/27/hot-dog-vendor-eric-kilmer_n_1457930.htmlMore sources, via Google News:http://www.google.com/news/story?ncl=deVaWi66rkSLQVM&hl=en&vanilla=0

Enslaved AfricansEnslaved Africans sounds more respectful than slaves. If you were an enslaved African then you were an African who had been enslaved. If you were a slave then that was what you were. In fact you remained a slave even after being freed because you were known as a freed slave. It is all about nouns and adjectives. Who you are and what adjectives are used to describe you.

Sadly, I had to fix the VPN (on my side) to get to the broken Desktop (actually a VS 2005 R2 Virtual machine) to fix a Linux OpenLDAP database, which has severe security restrictions limiting access that the Desktop is part of. So I had to troubleshoot a Java app, then troubleshoot a shitty VM system to fix a corrupted desktop from a snapshot (luckily we all have roaming profiles so I didn't lose any actual data), then use that to puTTY into Linux and figure out what the hell went wrong. Long story short, corrupted database, backups permissions issue, all fixed, things running normally.I was actually going to use the term "post coital bliss," but figured that was more VR language so thanks for blazing that trail for me. The worst part about being paged from a dead sleep and then forced to use strong mental skills is that you can't fall asleep for some time afterwards. I am goddamn tired, dude.

I just convinced my wife to allow me to buy a 10M HDMI cable that will trail around the living room walls in cord covers. "So that we can watch movies from my computer".Of course, in reality, that sentence actually meant "So I can play PC games on our 46" TV instead of my 20" monitor. And in 3D if I feel like it.

I think I may have finally turned the corner on this recent case of con crud - not only did I manage to get through the entire night without coughing, which I haven't been able to do for a couple of weeks, but I managed to sleep until 7:30 this morning (which, for me, is "sleeping in").
