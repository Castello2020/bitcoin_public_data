Holy crap, I wish I could have paused the TV for a screenshot!A local company called Register Law Firm (http://www.registerlawfirm.com/) just aired a commercial about bankruptcy, showing scenes of how people need to have yard sales just to make it. Then they flashed a stock photo... of the First World Problems lady!!I did a little "bwhahaha!" out loud, and raced to post it. Just because.For reference:
