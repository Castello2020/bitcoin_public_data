Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, I humbly submit the following pieces for your consideration: Exhibit A : The header picture for the following science article Exhibit B : The original: Goatse from which Exhibit A borrows heavily. Although the author tried to endear us with Schroedinger's cat, I submit, Ladies and Gentlement, and your Honor, that we've been Goatse'd against our will. The lounge shall demand retribution.

I highly suggest you put a NSFW tag on the goatse link. I know what it is. You know what it is. The vast majority of the internet knows what it is, and not to click on it at work. But, invariably, there will be one person who does NOT know what it is, and will click on it at work. Also, pussy.

From the angle of the elbows it is clear that were looking at a man from the front end holding a box. Thus it is not a goatse reference. Equilibrium restored, complaint reject with prejudice.

The 2nd link directs to a site that is not arstechnica, yet is of great educational value for the general public.Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, could we please get back on topic? Shall I gather tar and feathers or bacon and maple syrup for the defendant's sentence to be carried-out?

Actually, it's not clear that any number of people claiming the link is OK would be enough to get me to click on it. Because pretending the link is perfectly inoffensive is exactly what I would do if it were just goatse.

Ten years later, those 6 letters will evoke a deep-seating revulsion, a deep dark horror from the deeps that my mind runs screamingly away from. Not even 2 girls 1 cup had quite the same impression on me (yeah, I don't know whatever possessed me to look that up the first time I saw a reference to it)

I guess that makes cleaning/wiping even easier.

Based on Aurich's response I suspect it wasn't intentional, but he obviously allows his goatse obsession to influence his artor maybe some of you guys are stuck in the gutter.

There's a scene where a girl steps back onto a roadway and gets hit by a bus. She's just there one moment and then BAM! nothing but a mist of blood the next. I've seen the effect used since, but I think they were the first (the movie is 11 years old now).Anyway, when the movie was being screened for a test audience before release, people laughed at that scene. The directors didn't understand why; it was gory, and not in the least bit funny. They came to realize that sometimes, when people see something so horrific that they have no idea how to respond, they laugh. It's like the brain's version of a BSOD.Having (unfortunately ) seen 2g1c, I think it's the same phenomenon.
