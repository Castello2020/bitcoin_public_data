Do not read this story, it's too depressing.It's the usual (and I hate to say 'the usual' - but these stories seem to pop up with regular frequency) pedophile cop story but then there's this paragraph:quote:On one wall is a "Star Trek" poster with investigators' faces substituted for the Starship Enterprise crew. But even that alludes to a dark fact of their work: All but one of the offenders they have arrested in the last four years was a hard-core Trekkie. emphasis addedSo, anyway, I have nothing interesting to say about it. It's just one of those weird bits of random data that just pops up from time to time, and......well, like I said, I don't really know what to make of it.(I suppose this will be inflammatory to Trek fans, but I would like to caveat that I'm a pretty big fan myself, so it's not like I'm picking on anyone.)The cop theorizes that "It has something to do with a fantasy world where mutants and monsters have power and where the usual rules don't apply," Bulmer reflects. "But beyond that, I can't really explain it."But that could be said of a lot of people into the various type fantasies and sci-fi's that people are into......Just a bit of weird in what is otherwise a tragically awful story. (You may not commence posting your revenge ideas on pedophiles. I'll let you decide whether your fantasty barbarism is any less tragic and brutish than the pedophiles themselves. I feel the same way, but I don't feel good about it.)

I read the story, and you're right; It is utterly demoralizing. I am depressed.quote:"We arrested a bad guy last week," he said. "There were 1,000 images on his hard drive. Can I pay you enough to sit at this computer and look at every image? There are babies raped and sodomized with romantic music playing in the background. You are never the same person after you see something like that. It's soul-destroying." It sure is.

Not that surprising. I'd guess that a large percentage of the "secretely, they're fucking nuts" crowd is into fantasy/sci-fi. And Star Trek is easily accessible, being a television show (ass opposed to books- because nobody reads anymore). Plus, there is the whole social (demented and sad, but social) aspect of Star Trek, with the conventions and local "crews". It's easy for the freaks to congregate.

From Boing Boing:quote:Ernest says, I have now spoken to Detective Ian Lamond of the Child Exploitation Section of the Toronto Sex Crimes Unit and he claims they were misquoted, or if that figure was given it was done so jokingly. Nevertheless, he does claim that a majority of those arrested show "at least a passing interest in Star Trek, if not a strong interest." They've arrested well over one hundred people over the past four years. Det. Lamond claims they can gauge this interest in Star Trek by the arrestees' "paraphenalia, books, videotapes and DVDs." I asked if this wasn't simply a general interest in science fiction and fantasy, such as Star Wars or Harry Potter or similar. He said, while there was sometimes other science fiction and fantasy paraphenalia, Star Trek was the most consistent and when he referred to a majority of the arrestees being Star Trek fans, it was Star Trek specific. And the other comment worth reading:quote:Boing Boing reader Mr. Spocko says: As you can see, based on my pseudonym, I'm a fan of the show Star Trek. First of all, I'm not defending pedophiles. I think what they do is disgusting and they should be caught and punished. Out of all the info in that tragic article about pedophiles you chose to pull out this piece of information devoid of context. "All but one of the offenders they have arrested in the last four years was a hard-core Trekkie."The writer, Maggie Farley, didn't talk about other characteristics they have in common. She might have said, "All were users of the Internet.or All were hard-core digital photographers. What if she had said, "All but one were hard-core Republicans? or All but one were hard-core readers of Boing-Boing?" Would that have raised your hackles and made you want to know actual details of such a sweeping claim? I read your website, I understand your desire to find the unusual, the amusing, the controversial. But pulling this information out of that story without context and the statistical relationship to the entire twisted population at large seems to me to create connections were they might not exist. Does it mean anything that the people trying to crack these cases have a poster of themselves in Trek grab hanging on the wall? Might the writer also have said, "All but one of the team tracking these pedophiles was a hard-core Trekkie?" Police need ways to find these people, maybe that comment will help them do that, but might it also stigmatise a group of people who are innocent of such morally repugnant activities and simply make them guilty by association? I quoted the whole text b/c I couldn't have said it better myself.

quote:Originally posted by AnakinOU:correlation != causality Although they slightly hinted at it, they really didn't say there was a causal relationship between the two activities. But the fact that such a high percentage of the guys they caught were also hard-core Trekkies seems to scream out that there's a common thread in there (obsessive behavior, etc).Edit: Ah, one problem is that they didn't really define what a hardcore trekkie is. If they counted someone who simply watched the Trek shows then it's probably bias on the investigative side.

Which is so weird, because, first of all, Star Trek isn't filled with mutants and monsters, but with aliens that have reasonably drawn out social structures. A lot of Star Trek deals with how our culture interacts with theirs. (Hint, it usually doesn't turn out good.)More so then a lot of sci-fi Star Trek at least touches on issues of ethics. So I'm like "WTF?"

jesus christ how does someone rape a 3 month old? how is it even possible...why did you link it saying don't look...the forbidden cookie jar always gets opened...not "the" most depressing thing ive read, but a good 2nd or 3rd...its also strangely nice to know that this isn't something new that has just started and yet of course its disturbing that its not ever going to stop...guess its just the natural greed and self-centered at all cost base mentality *some* people get their minds into...Editthe most depressing "thing" I alluded to is actually similar, except it has to do with environments where the "guardians" of children force them into a similar mindset, where similar astrocities occur, but at the hand of children themselves against other children...) I remember haveing a huge shit fit over it a while back...(on ars)

First off if you can imagine it, someone has done it. Period. There are people in this world so distrubed or caught up in their own fantasies they can't tell reality from fantasy. They don't see the people they hurt as human beings, just objects with no emotions who exist only for their pleasure.Secondly, I dunno what's with the Trek connection. It seems to point the finger at scifi types and feed the stereotypes.What in the hell does the world have against scifi fans? It's ok to be obessed with sports or cars or reality TV or who Britney Spears had sex with..but you like Star Wars or Farscape or etc, etc you are a socially inept loser with real phychological problems. Crap. (Not to say these people don't exist because when several of the Farscape cast came to Atlanta, a couple of the disturbed fans, tried to get Gigi Edgely and Paul Goddard to have an orgy with them) But the point being I dont think is by en large representative of scifi fans generally. I LOVE good TV/film and I tend to LOVE LOVE ++ good scifi I am however like most, grounded firmly in reality.Sorry I had to get that off my chest.

I read this article when it ran in the paper version of the Times earlier this week and wondered if the Trekkie bit would make the Lounge. I guess so!As an update for people who read the whole article they announced today that they aren't releasing the victim girl's photo yet, but they are releasing the photo of another girl who I guess was there but not abused (they think) or something in hopes that it leads to a link.I have no problem with 18+ porn, you want to look at it go right ahead. As a father of a baby girl though no punishment is too much for people who rape babies and children. Castration should be a minimum. Sorry if that got SBy.

This article is very disturbing, especially when one thinks of the scale on which this is happening.The filth must be cleansed. Their corpses will burn in the ovens. Let the Grand Purification begin.The Star Trek bit is silly, though. I wouldn't think it to be a defining factor.

You're forgetting - this is a newspaper. They want to sell copies. It's more sensational to say "Trekkies will rape your kids!!!!oneone!" than it is to say "Some very sick human beings have perpetrated vile acts against against children."Remember - as geeks, we're still subject to misunderstanding and ostracism - and as long as the ante of sensationalism keeps rising, so will dumb shit like this.It's easier to create an 'other' who can be identified as an enemy rather than to admit that there's an internal cancer that needs healing.

Well, one thing that Star Trek has going for it that isn't necessarily present in a lot of other genre's: a complete respect for another way of life, no matter how strange or odd it may sound. So, a pedophile that believes he is only "showing his love" for his victim would want to imagine being in a world where noone's culture/ideals/lifestyle is considered different than anyone else's.And, I'll do my best from refraining to steering this into the soapbox by not mentioning how relative morals and ethics can quite quickly lead down this path...

Actually, that article warmed my heart. With all the stories you see (and repeated on Ars, etc.) about asshole cops, stupid victimless laws, and general disrespect for society, it's refreshing to see that at least some of our* criminal-justice talent is focusing their talent on reducing actual human suffering. I just hope that Gillespie's apparent passion for rescuing children in need instead of "omg illegal f1lesh4ring" is based on fact and not LA journalistic bias.Also, the Captain EO poster gave a nice chuckle.*broadly; I suppose those Canoodians can count for now JoS Metadi

quote:Like always, the media misquoted and distorted the truth. The word "always" in that sentence is a generalization even more unfounded than the mistake in the article...Anyway, while mass-media exaggerations always suck (there it's justified!), I don't see why we should bristle at the notion that pedophiles may correlate with geeks. The association with Star Trek in particular does seem out of place, but the presence of Trek fandom in your psyche means wildly different things to different people. I have a feeling that for the pedo crowd, it's a "gateway drug" to geekiness in general: love of Trek-like technology -> AOL -> teen chatrooms is an obvious enough possibility, but there are myriad ways for that tree to branch into "dangerous" areas:technology -> hardware -> spy gear -> voyeurismtechnology -> discussion -> scifi/fantasy -> anime -> hentaitechnology -> internet -> P2P -> private pedo exchangestechnology -> internet -> Usenet -> international sex tradeDidn't the evangelists of the 90s talk endlessly about how technology was a "universal enabler" for all people and interests? Why should we be even remotely surprised?

I wonder if the underlying connection between Star-Trek and child-sexual predation is actually technology.I was actually reading an article in the Age today (it's probably on the web site, but I can't be bothered finding it) which was talking about some child porn found on a computer at a community centre. They quoted the head of the police unit responsible for investigating such things, and he mentioned that, despite hundreds of arrests for posessing child pornography, they'd never had any evidence that any of it was locally produced. Most of it seemed to come from Eastern Europe, apparently.Presumably, peadophiles have always had ways of copying and distributing their pictures, even before computers. But I could imagine that they would be highly-motivated early adopters of things like email, encryption, P2P networks, and so on. Who would be surprised to hear, for example, that peadophiles have private BitTorrent trackers for distributing pictures and movies (I have no idea if they actually do, mind you)?There is a lot of overlap between other early technology adopters and Trekkies. I remember the script for Star Trek: Generations being the hottest items on every (non-Internet connected) BBS when it appeared a few months before the movie was released. Hell, in its early years UseNet was essentially a dedicated Trek-discussion network. Maybe paedophiles, moving in techological circles, are no different to other tech users (I don't want to sullie the work 'geek' by associating it with paedophiles, but I'm sure some of them will refer to themselves as geeks) when it comes to catching the Trek bug.Just a theory.Edit: After having just read Richard Berg's command above properly, I'd have to say that I believe that it's paedophile -> geek, as opposed to the other way around. People tend to be be born paedophiles, but being a technology geek seems to be a learned response.Edit2: I think we're actually arguing essentially the same thing (my brain isn't working very well this afternoon!).

I suspect it has more to do with how they catch them. The easiest way to find a pedo these days is online. Heavy internet users would probably be more likely to enjoy scifi, hence the Star Trek interest. I can't think of a single child abuser/molester I've had to deal with at work, that wasn't a stereotypical red neck nascar type fan. Should the media start saying the same things about them?Edit: essentially what despair said

The funny part is watching people react to him.Quite sad, really. Probably the same reason for dressing in all black, wearing funky clothes, tattoos, and piercings-- just things to make people acknowledge his otherwise pathetic existance. It's so much easier to get negative attention than positive attention, and it's still attention at the end of the day.I truly feel sorry for him. If he's anything like this irl, his only friends are just people who hang out near him waiting to see the next stunt he pulls. They'll laugh just as hard the day he says the wrong thing and gets his ass kicked.
