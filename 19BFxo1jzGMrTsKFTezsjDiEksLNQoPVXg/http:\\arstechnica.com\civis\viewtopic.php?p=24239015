A little background:I started at my current job 6 months ago, as a Systems Administrator. We're a small IT department; 3 'admin' staff including the IT Manager, a Solutions Architect, a bunch of developers and the Head of IT who runs the whole department and is also relatively new to the company.In the last year or so we were bought out by a large US corporation and are currently totally hamstrung with what we can afford to do - i.e. nothing, as we're forced to stretch our budget cycle out to 18 months and wait for the US to begin their new fiscal year.Given that the company has always underfunded IT (Despite it being, basically, a data-driven company) this is stretching us. There's a freeze on headcount, or expenditure of pretty much any kind, unless it's very small beans or absolutely vital.I am - so far - loving the job. I'm getting to do far more than I ever did in previous roles, and have already achieved a huge amount in the time that I've been there, for very little outlay. I have big plans, once we get some cash.I joined the company during a reshuffle. One of the role changes was a developer moving off to concentrate on DBA duty for a non-IT team that does a lot of data manipulation. He also happened to be the 'Security Officer' (read: Information Security Manager with very little to no actual power) for the company, which is ISO 27001 certified.I joined with a CV mostly built in .gov and .mod establishments and, as such, was the most 'Security' knowledgeable guy they had on board. To back this up, I'll note that most of our file shares currently have 'Everyone' set to 'Full Control' and I've had to redesign the AD from the ground up to include Capability Management and Role grouping, etc.(Rather than try and persevere with a spaghetti of the existing file system, I'm just going to design an entirely new one when we get more storage).I was asked to add the 'Security Officer' hat to my role. I had a sit-down with the developer who was doing it, had a brief 15 minute chat and that was that. I figured, in the immortal words of Top Gear, 'How hard can it be?'Last week, we had an ISO27001 Surveillance Audit. I spent the whole day in a room with one of the auditors, and I think I would have liked it more if he'd actually bent me over the table and inserted a series of large objects into me. That's what it felt like, but I'd at least not have walked away feeling totally fucking useless.The upshot was that, whilst our ISMS covered most of the bases, it was clear that as a company we were woefully underprepared. The previous 'Head of IT' had gotten the company certified by hook or by crook, without real thought being applied to a lot of things that were produced for it.The auditors expected that I was the 'Information Security Manager' and thus gave me a proper drubbing for not being up to snuff (though they did say afterwards that, considering I'd been in the role 5 months, it was quite impressive). I pointed out halfway through the day that this was not my main role, outlined what that main role was, and the general impression was 'Um, you can't do this part time'.In order to do justice to the role, I reckon I would need to give up about 50% of my time - at least in the first year - to getting everything shipshape. The auditors panned me for not knowing legal procedures and precedents where they were required. They insisted I know far more about employment law and procedures than I did (i.e. nothing - I assumed that's what HR was for), and so forth.I'm an IT guy. I got into IT for specific reasons, and I took this job because I believed I was going in to contribute a huge amount to their IT setup, and get a whole lot out in return.The money is not good. In fact, it's the lowest paid IT job I've ever had by some margin.The business now appears to anticipate that I will add to my already-overstacked workload and assume a role that I have no meaningful experience for, no real desire to perform, for at least 10k per annum less than someone would be paid if they were doing it as a full-time job.So, I'm planning a sit down with my two managers.I intend to outline the work that will be required to get us fully up to scratch (we have a full re-certification in November). I intend to assert that this goes far beyond how the role was originally sold to me, as well as my displeasure at facing the possibility of having to sacrifice up to 50% of my time doing actual productive things that I enjoy and that are making a real difference to the way the company's IT is working.In all honesty, if push came to shove and they said 'This is now your role and you have to do this', I would be looking for another job straight away. Naturally, that's not the angle I want to play this with.Does this seem fair enough?I'm certainly not wanting to come across as an employee who says "I only want to do stuff I like", because I'm more than happy to take on any required role - as long as it is within the scope (roughly) of the job I signed up for.It's become abundantly clear that the ISM role is much wider than that, and it's a role I do not wish to perform.

"The auditors suggest that 100% of my time be focused on X, rather than Y and Z, and suggest that another employee be assigned those tasks. I would really like to see us pass the next audit in six months and I am OK with 100% of my time being devoted to this." If they have anything in the report about you being underpayed, be sure to toss that in there as well sweetpepper

is there anyone at the company who knows the legal and employment side of the Security issue?

Not particularly. We have free legal advice from the company we effectively outsource our HR management to (we have one HR person / PA to the man at the top).Apparently it's a legal requirement for us to have a Data Protection Officer (who knew?) which was only stipulated by the legal team of our now-owners at the time of buyout.There's certainly no on-site legal personnel.We could get the 'on call' people in and say 'tell us what we need to know for this standard' but, again, this is something that should surely be done by the management of the company, not a Systems Admin?

You joined a company in the middle of restructuring. That pretty much explains everything. Things are going to suck.

Outside of an incredibly rare Superman moment, no amount of fiddling on the part of someone viewed by the business as a costly underling (that's you) will fix this.Find another job.

The biggest indicator is the under investment in IT in general. This mean that they see IT, and by extension the employees in IT, as a cost of be minimized. You don't want to work for that kind of organization.

yeah, i agree a SysAdmin is not the right person to ask to do this enormous thing. there should be someone overseeing it always, not just for the audit, and then it should involve multiple people who are experts in their area ( HR, building security, IT systems ).i hope it's just that they misunderstood what was required. in which case, you should be backed up by the audit report, that this is beyond the scope of your experience, and requires a LOT more investment. if they're deliberately trying to fake their way through a serious creditation.. i'd start looking for a new job in any case Drizzt321

And presuming you aren't bent over by upper-management for trying to actually fix things in order to pass re-certification, look at it as a way to get this very difficult thing done and get an amazing point to put on your resume if you leave in a few years.Alternatively, if as sweetpepper says, they try and put wallpaper over gaping holes and expect you to sign off on it...jump ship and GTFO. They'll hang you out to dry in a moment.

It's an interesting dynamic at the moment.Old management are out, new management are in, in certain areas. There's appetite for change in some places, unwillingness in others, but no money to actually do anything.That should change come June, and the woeful lack of underinvestment will be addressed with our 'wish list':- New servers- More SAN- Tools for the job (System Center, Varonis, etc)- Training- Etcetera.From an IT point of view, it's currently a sucky time but is getting better.I was discussing with a colleague today, who admitted to me that I've achieved a huge amount in the 6 months thus far, and have great ideas for the future. He also admitted that, if I were to give up my time for something else in a significant capacity, those things would never get done because nobody else has the capacity for it.We're a three-man team - myself, the aforementioned colleague and my immediate boss who has been requested to move away from Sys Admin duties and into actually 'management' duties.Both have been in the place a long time and their skills are significantly outdated.I think I'll have to sell that quite hard.Re: getting re-certified, I certainly believe that our Head of Department and the president of the company itself would like things to be ironclad. Things before were certainly done with an 'it'll do' attitude, which is how we are where we are now.I could certainly easily get us through that way. The other way would take a lot of time and effort, which I'd rather be putting towards actually getting our shockingly outdated, outmoded systems up to snuff.

The auditors, after telling me that I needed to entirely re-write and re-structure the ISMS, said that I should be the 'steward' of the ISMS, not the author. Also that I can't audit the work I actually do. Given that I'm implementing 99.9% of the security enhancements in IT itself, that leaves us with a problem!

i think it's odd that no cash from the acquisition got allocated for your operating budget from jan-june. someone should have foreseen that little snafu. i guess i haven't seen a lot of acquistions up close, but the ones i have, it comes with money to help change/integrate processes.

I agree. As far as I'm aware, there was 'some money' left in the pot. Unfortunately, the division that we've been subsumed into made a loss this year, and as a result the entire division has been slapped with a moratorium on spend and new staff. As a new member of such division, even though we had nothing to do with the state of affairs, we too have been hit with that, so any money that there was, can no longer be spent.It's all pretty ridiculous, not to mention incredibly dangerous given that we're beyond the limit on stuff like backups.I've now been here six months and achieved a lot for very little (i.e. zero) money, simply using what they already had, but hadn't leveraged. If this is still the case in another six months though, then it's bad times.I'm still psyching myself up for a chat with our boss about this whole thing before we break for Easter (in about an hour).

Well, I just had a frank discussion with our department head and he completely agrees with me. As far as he's concerned there is zero value for him in me changing my priorities or job role, and recognises that IT as a function inherited the 27001 stuff almost by default - and that needs to change.Stress headache is subsiding!

Great news! Hopefully you should get things moving forward on a positive path, and having your Dept Head will certainly be a powerful force for that now.

I think your company really needs to consider whether they want the ISO certification at all.

We don't. A customer (who is now worth 50% of overall business) demanded that we have it before we dealt with them.Withdrawing now would potentially cause more damage than good.Following a discussion with my Dept Head and the Quality Manager, we've pushed back on the 'business' somewhat and the QM is now taking up a lot of the strain - as it should be, realistically.
