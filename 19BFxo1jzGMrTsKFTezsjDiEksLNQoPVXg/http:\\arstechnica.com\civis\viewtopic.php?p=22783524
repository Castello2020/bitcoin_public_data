I never have liked Star Wars. It also doesn't make for a good game when everyone runs around with a stupid light saber as a weapon. The graphics are also lame looking. Diablo 3 looks like the previous Diablogames with the very outdated Birdseye view that I can't stand in any game, plus it's not a true mmorpg.

After playing through the Diablo 3 beta last night, I can't help but feel like the D3 engine is more suited to TOR than TOR's own engine.

Me and quite a few friends started playing at release, most of us have grown fairly tired of WoW, I stopped playing it quite a while ago myself.I didn't make it past lvl 25 or some such, the game just didn't have "it".To me it failed for several reasons:1: The environments, maybe if you're a huge SW lore nerd you'll know what they're about, to me they were boring, no real ambiance, boring textures, basically I never felt any immersion.2: Combat, I started a sith warrior, I played a prot warrior in WoW and I liked it so I figured I'd go Juggernaut in TOR. The combat always felt sluggish though, timing skills was borderline impossible and frustrating and attacks lacked "punch" for the most part.3: WoW-clone, I expected TOR to be influenced by WoW the way WoW was influenced by EQ. I didn't expect it to be a clone right down to the skills. I didn't even bother learning the named of the skills because my friends already knew the WoW skills and since they were for the most part exactly the same I just kept referring to them as Heroic Strike, Last Stand, Shield Wall, etc. Basically, stop making WoW clones everyone, WoW is the best WoW, make something that's not WoW!4: The UI was horrible. I hear it's improved, but when I played it sucked, there's just no other way to put it. It was worse than the WoW betas.I could keep listing stuff, but the one thing that matters in the end is it just didn't feel right. WoW at release had lots of flaws but it had something that made me keep playing even though I got frustrated(any other old time warriors remember the parry-bug from early WoW?). TOR just didn't have that so I stopped.Oh and Bioware, voice acting is a waste of money in an MMO. It's a very very expensive gimmick.

The Star Wars universe isn't that interesting and having the game play out during the old republic era certainly doesn't help. If the game is still around in a year or so I may take another look though, Bioware has done quite a few good things with the game too but just not enough to keep up a constant interest. I did play the game for about 2 months after release which is more than I normally do for new MMOs, usually the included 30 days is enough to get bored so ToR did better than I expected (depite being Star Wars)Currently there are other MMOs higher on the list to check out though. It looks something like this: Tera -> Rift -> STO -> Aion -> (MoP) -> ToR; but I may just forget about WoW completely. I'm not even considering D3, for single player time killers I need more obscure games. Mainstream is overrated.

Another MMO that tried to be WoW (just look at the classes and skill trees and tell me otherwise) and fails because of it.If a developer starts a new game with very similar mechanics, it's not going to get a lot of people to switch over. The social draw isn't that great either because obviously people rather play a game that is already being played by more of their friends.A true contender to the MMO throne will have to either introduce an unparalleled level of polish to WoW-like mechanics (unlikely, considering how long Blizzard has had to refine their own game), or do something completely different.

Again, the problem with this game is that Bioware crafted an amazing single player experience from level 1 to 50, but then the game completely changes at max level into a traditional guild-centric raiding MMO. The PVP is heavily slanted towards those who raid (because they will have the best weapons/armor and own your face into the ground) so if you enjoyed the single player experience but aren't part of a raiding guild for whatever reason, you have nothing to do at 50.The problem with this is mainly that the high-end raid content is catered towards more hardcore players, but there's not enough content to keep them around for long. No meaningful content has been added since shortly after launch; and my guild (former hardcore raiders with a casual schedule of 2 nights a week for 3 hours each) had gotten completely geared up in Rakata gear by mid-February. Almost all of our subscriptions have since lapsed; most of us moved on to Mass Effect 3 for a while, and Diablo 3 is right around the corner.That, in essence, is the problem, and why there will probably never be another game that reaches the heights of WoW again: there are simply too many other great games to play. WoW was kind of a perfect storm of being a noob-approachable social game that was fun to play at a time when there really wasn't a whole lot else going on in PC gaming besides bad console ports. There are so many other good games to play now that no game is going to get the time to mature like WoW did. Diablo 3 will be fun, but all but the most hardcore players will beat it in 2 months and move to some other game.I don't think the industry can support another WoW; it was a one time phenomenon that is unlikely to repeat itself. Casual social gaming is just too pervasive these days. The market structure is totally different, and it's a lot more of a long-tail market than it has been in the past.

It saddens and frustrates me to write this, but it is clear to me that developers cannot get past 'the box' created by WoW's success. That box equates most succinctly to a 3D online environment where the goal is to acquire unneeded gear through repetitive tasks that are mislabeled as 'content'. It is like spending a year painstakingly researching and building a custom tricked-out car (character leveling/progression), and then only being allowed to drive it around a circular race track over and over (end-game 'content'). No matter how many race tracks they build, ultimately the experience is boring.The solution? A radical departure that until accepted by developers, will keep us in generation 3 (in fact, I still think we are in 2) of this genre that I so love. Simply put, developers must give the ability to create content to the gamers. ID did this with Doom in the early 90s, and we have reached a point where I feel it must occur in the MMO space. Taking all the creative brain power of all the current developers currently in business, they are barely a drop in the ocean compared to the potential creativity of the gaming community as a whole. I predict that the developer that can successfully tap this resource will both create something truly remarkable and completely dominate the next generation MMO space.Otherwise, we are stagnating, and regardless of how polished an old model game is (SWTOR), gamers will chew it up, spit it out, and move on.I would really like to know how the rest of the community feels about this.Also, should any developers actually be listening to this, I have tried to contact you with strategies to make this happen, but no one will listen. Please, all I think most of us want is a great gaming experience that replicates how we felt when we became addicted to our first MMO. Let us help you make this happen.Sincerely,Freon

Everyone is on the "make an MMO!" bandwagon since WoW went bonkers. Just because WoW is successful doesn't many any other game is successful. I might argue that WoW is not only serving the majority of the MMO market, but it is also killing the MMO market (at least for other games, for the time being). MMO's are repetitive and get very boring after a while for most people. WoW having such huge popularity means that normally non-MMO players play WoW and tire of the MMO play style. World of Warcraft's popularity was more a fluke than an attainable rule in the MMO market. There's a reason the market was almost completely ignored before WoW.

Quote:There are a lot of technical faults with TOR and a lot of poor design decisions as well. The game engine is just not good enough, it cannot handle even a medium sized amount of players without stuttering (and yes, my system is up-to-date in terms of both hardware and software), and the less said about ability lag, the better. It's still present even after all this time, the controls just don't seem immediate and you feel frustrated half the time. The game also stops rendering the screen every time a UI element is brought up, say for example bags. If you're autorunning forward and open up your bags, the game stops for a split second as it stops rendering the scene in order to draw the bag on the screen, it gives the game a very pedestrian feel.All of these issues were fixed by 1.2 or before, some of them long before.

Is there ANY game that people will play forever? In single player land, Torchlight was OK, but once the main quest was over it was difficult coming up with reasons to keep killing enemies that would never end. I was playing DC Universe Online for a while (free, of course, although I popped $10 for the Green Lantern DLC) but once I realized that eventually I was *expected* to do PvP and accept a role as a tank (just a different skin than another game uses) or something, I bailed. Similar with Mass Effect 3 multiplayer: unless there's a new Achievement or twenty, why should I keep doing it? There's no REAL glory to be had, no matter how many times you kill the really really tough bad guy you've killed hundreds of times before.So I think all games have an expiration date, variable between users, and SW:TOR is no different. If there's any fun to be had all by yourself, some addicts will find it. I just prefer games that don't require me to live up to the expectations of teammates, or pay on a regular basis so I can keep doing it. Servers that eventually will go away are things I try to avoid. Don't remind me that eventually my console will also die: I already worry about how many consoles I need to buy before they are discontinued, to play the small fortune in games I've already bought and refuse to liquidate, until I also die...

mhungry wrote:Remember when a million players was considered god-like status for an MMO?Yep, right up until WoW was released and they blew through a 6 month allocation of servers and copies of the game in under two weeks.I don't know where this "WoW started slow" stuff is coming from. It's utterly wrong and completely revisionist.I remember prior to the release of WoW it was commonly accepted that there was an MMO subscriber pool of roughly 1 million players. That was fairly static, and as new games released they just stole part of that finite pool from other games - but ultimately, few truly new players were ever added.Which is why Blizzard so massively underestimated the demand for WoW. They expected it would be big, but no one, anywhere, predicted it would be even a third of what it turned out to be. Within a week or two of release Blizzard was scrambling to get their projected year's worth of server growth up and running inside a month because the demand was just that high.In any case, I'm still playing WoW, though mainly just to raid at this point, and even that is almost entirely for the social aspect of it. TOR caught my attention a bit, but with the last decade or so of Lucas's shenanigans I'm generally burned out on Star Wars as well. So I've taken a "wait and see" approach with TOR. I figured if it was still doing well after about a year I'd maybe check it out, but as with most other MMOs since WoW, that's starting to appear unnecessary at this point.

- The moderation/PR team is their own worst enemy- The voice acting/story is great, just like a candy bar, however you cant live off it. They have no meat. WoW, wither you like it, played it and hate it, hate it for no reason or love it to death, balanced or horribly lopsided had this 'meat' quality, and sustained it. Though I personally got bored of it and didnt like where things were going, it had a longevity that this one does not. I have not played Wow for months and personally waiting for GW2.

Just my 2c, but, like any genre, MMOs do not appeal to everyone, and many people who have been into MMOs get tired of constantly chasing the everpresent carrot on a stick in front of them. But unlike other games/genres, people generally only subscribe to one MMO at a time. There could be an MMO saturation point, where most of the potential audience has been reached by current MMOs,

From the posts above, it seems lots of folks either didn't really play much, can't remember, or certainly haven't played post-1.2 patch. Most MMOs before now have basically taught players that levels 0 to MAX-1 are to go through as fast as possible so you can hit MAX and run dailies over and over and over or go into a random dungeon group finder and play the same dungeon over and over and over and over. SWTOR is the first MMO where I've actually been enjoying the 0 to MAX at least as much as hitting max. Granted, SWTOR also went the nasty way of dailies and if you PVE, you'll do the same missions over and over and over. I've not found an MMO that has been as fun 0 to MAX and I've played quite a few of them.

Got a sorceror to 50 by the end of December. Enjoyed the leveling process but at Max level its like entering a time machine to classic wow, only with glowbats and blasters. Wanted it to replace wow but looks like I will have to turn to Guild Wars 2 to do that.

I've been playing MMOs since 1997 with Ultima Online and I can tell ya you can't really measure a game's staying power till the next game comes along. This is nothing new since EverQuest came out and gave all the people tired of being "PKd" (player killed since UO was a free for all) a place to run off and play in. Warhammer Online did amazingly well the first few months till WOW: WOTLK was released and went from them bragging about 800 man battles straining the servers to ghost towns on all servers (good article at the Escapist about it).SWTOR's customer retention is going to be tested quite a bit this year. A lot of the newer titles are starting to come up. TERA in May. Diablo 3 in May. Secret World in June. Guild Wars 2 at some point. Right now we're still in the "lull" of releases (last major MMO title was SWTOR) so it's kind of odd to hear all talk about it already losing people.I think it has to deal with all the press that we heard about SWTOR being different from other MMOs in that there's more emphasis on story. Bioware developed SWTOR to be focused entirely on the story for the player. As a general overview (no spoilers) the story goes: Class Story / Planet Story / Flash Points -> End Game Flash Points -> Raids. As they patch in additional flashpoints (such as in 1.1 and 1.2) the story continues. This ultimately lead to two problems:1. How often do you keep playing once you beat a game? It's the classic "On-Rails" vs "Sand Box" argument (and SWTOR is "On-Rails" as it gets). The "train" eventually stops and it's exceedingly rare any company could ever keep up with the train to provide new content fast enough to keep people occupied.2. Such a huge amount of development time was focused on story, they really missed some marks with MMO gamers. They had to scratch their entire PvP reward system because it was just awfully designed. They left out basic features that MMO gamers have come to take for granted over the years.Free To Play goes out the window when the main attraction is your story. It would be like them giving away Dragon Age or Mass Effect games as free to play with the expectation people would want to buy the DLCs. I can't see them ever doing it. It won't matter however as I'm sure they'll make their investment in the game back and then some. MMOs can drop a ridiculous amount of subscribers and still be viable.(As a final note, I am still playing the game. I treat it as a multiplayer version of KOTOR and am playing the story lines I want to see and then will probably move on for Diablo 3 and Guild Wars 2. Their new legacy system helps this goal tremendously.)

Just remember that this game was created for EA to make money. EA doesn't care if it is good as long as it can make money. When you put the business side first, the fun becomes strained. If they made it fun, then the money would roll in.

99.9% of MMOs at launch, Lack of End Game content. WoW was quite new for everyone to explore, had Stratholme, Scholo, BRS Upper and Lower. Molten Core for hardcore raiders. I took a break from WoW after release when hit 40 or so since time zones lining to instance with friends was never happening and instances were the most fun for me. 2nd time i came back I had a ton of fun gathering for groups for casual dungeons. Part of it was shouting, gathering the group and traveling. Nowadays its so quick to do stuff that you run out of things to do in other games due to a lot of these convenience, but it also allows people with little time to play the game.Dark Age had a lack of 45-50 PvE content, but if you could grind it out at least there was RvR. Although still not much lv 50 PvE.Honestly surprised so many still sticking to WoW with last content patch so far ago. I still play since there is stuff I do with others but there is a lot of people who have played x5 more than me still playing x5 more than me.

I think I've just gradually soured on the feeling of how much it distorts the Star Wars universe. In the first trilogy, only one guy could do lightning. In the second trilogy, a second guy could do it, and the high-level jedi could neutralize it. In TOR, every noob sith has lightning, seemingly since shortly after the cradle. They tried so hard to balance the two factions -- which I appreciate, but it means they eviscerated all the ideas that made sith and jedi different. I think one thing that would have been hilarious is for the sith apprentices to kill their masters whenever they seem weak. (Tough fight, but you look like you're gonna squeak through, then wham! your companion nails you, so he can rule the galaxy with his *own* new apprentice, whom you only meet now, as you're lying on the ground, gasping out your final... Well, I can dream)

Too much slow running in between quests. I couldn't get myself to level past 20 (though I did play about 10 toons to the high teens). Combat was too similar to every other previous MMO, so that didn't catch me either.I'm currently hoping that Planetside 2 is as fun as the first one was.

I have to think that most of the people praising SWTOR haven't gotten a character to 50 yet. It was a fun game up to that point- sort of like a new KOTOR or Mass Effect game, with a few time-wasting frustrations thrown in, and some group content to show off the multiplayer aspect. The real weakness in the game is that the game pretty much ends there, and doesn't have much replayability. End-game is a poor version of WoW, with worse balance and less polish. Playing another character on the same faction is like replaying a single-player game right after finishing it- most all of the content that you can do is exactly the same as for your previous character, and everything's extremely linear, so you can't choose to do different content on your alts to vary the experience at all.The voice overs and cinematic cutscenes do tell a story and make leveling a character a lot better than WoW, at least for your first character. You can feel immersed in the world a lot more than reading a window of text telling you why you need to kill 20 boars. However, when trying to play alts, I found I like leveling multiple characters in WoW much more- I can quickly skip all the text and get to killing stuff. In SWTOR, I have to space-bar to skip through 10 lines of voice-over gobbledygook that's telling me why I need to kill 20 rakghouls, and select dialogue options at a bunch of places that make no difference. Just let me get to killing those enemies and move on, please. WoW also has multiple zones for most level ranges, and more content than is required to reach max level, so I can play my characters through different zones and do different content. SWTOR had one zone per level range, with a linear path of quests to get through the zone, and unless you level up by repeatedly running flashpoints or battlegrounds, you go through exactly the same content for each character, minus the 10% or so which is your class quests.Essentially, SWTOR is a reasonable game to play through once. It doesn't have great end-game content, and it doesn't have good replayability for additional characters(alts). I don't regret buying the game- it wasn't Skyrim, but it was better than a number of other RPG's I've bought. However, it doesn't have anything to keep me engaged after the initial playthrough, which is a key part of what an MMORPG needs to justify subscribing and paying $15 a month to play. It's not a failure as a game in general, it's just a failure as a monthly-subscription MMO.

The continual argument though that "oh it took WOW years to have endgame and not suck" doesnt wash with me though, its not 2005 anymore, none of this stuff is even somewhat revolutionary as far as game designing for an MMO goes, to not have these things in place fromt he start, or at least solidly planned out on a game with this size budget [and srsly like 100million no endgame and immovable UI?] is just negligence, poor judgement, or outright hubris on the part of the dev team.

The idea of spending $50 on a game and then having to pay even more just to play the damn thing is bullshit. The pay-to-play business model is doomed because of poor people like me who often struggle to keep a roof over my head, food in my belly, and gas in my car. In fact, I think most games (with the exception of Skyrim) are ripoffs, and I'm not even counting MMOs in that group. Most recent and glaring example is Mass Effect 3. If the game cooked dinner, cleaned house and went to bed with me, maybe I would be tempted to change my stance.

Quote: I WANTED TO BE THAT TROOPER IN THE CINEMATIC! Too bad, that trooper was Commando, not Vanguard. Quote:The combat is also very buggy, or was I haven't played 1.2; Animations were slow to happen and would delay the ability usage, so instead of playing I was watching my character trying to catch up to what I was actually hitting. Which causes you to hit a button and not get an immediate response which causes frustration and much cursing at Bioware for failing to get that fixed before launchOh trust me, it's much much MUCH better. Only one thing annoys the shit out of me - off GCD skills sometimes activate GCD, so annoying and game breaking... >.>Quote:run through a phased, empty hangar that serves no purpose, enter a phased, empty orbital station that again serves no purpose, enter your ship, plot a course to the new planet, enter the phased, empty orbital station, enter the phased, empty hangar, and then go to a flight path to where you want to go.Got a little better - there's an option to port straight to your ship and skip station, still annoying as hell.Quote:I DO enjoy the space combat missions very much. I wish they would add more or expand that part of the game.Oh god. Did those on my first char from 16 to 35 daily. Even tho it's very easy exp and I've leveled all 8 classes to 40s atleast, I skipped them on all my alts. So effin boring and stupid..Quote:Mounts need to be overall faster, and the training costs much cheaper. They decreased those costs with 1.2 but not nearly enough. It really shouldn't be any more expensive than any other power. There are three levels of mounts, but each level is only 10% faster than the one before, which makes no sense, especially when considering the training costs.It's fine. Later level mounts do not dismount from one friggin dot tick, they take noticably more damage before dismounting. Besides, now that they removed white color crystals and korealis mounts, there's nothing to spend money on, AGAIN.Quote:timing skills was borderline impossible and frustrating and attacks lacked "punch" for the most part.Timing is fixed and as for animations - you were only 25. Impale skill from level 30 talents and then Shattering Blow skill from talents at level 40 have some WICKED SICK animations. Really, above and beyond anything WoW has to offer. Or Sith Marauder - Rupture, Annihilate have also some wicked animations. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqAZwyigk0I first 13 seconds, when he jumps and then crushes target with his strength, body mass and inertia. Ig you think that this lacks punch while WoW has one...Quote: The UI was horrible. I hear it's improved, but when I played it sucked, there's just no other way to put it. It was worse than the WoW betas.Improved a little, still sucks and will suck without addons (which are nowhere in sight..).

I let my subscription lapse. Mostly it was for RL reasons, but I can't really pin it on any one thing. I selected a low population server without paying attention and it was very hard to get into end game content. It also seems there wasn't enough to do end game to keep me interested. I might revisit the game in a few content patches. Meanwhile I hope they allow character transfers or start merging nodes to help with the ghost town feel of some of the nodes.

For me it was the nerf to Ilum.I only wanted to play for large scale PVP.There was some, then it lagged, then they nerfed to fix the lag, then they nerfed to fix the nerf to the nerf of the nerf, and I heard you like nerfs to your nerfs ya dig.Basically, large scale PVP to them was 8v8 in the sandbox. Not 50+ vs 50+ in an open world.Ilum failed because of its size too. Lets cut the zone to 40 people a side, and then make it so huge that all 80 could be in the zone and if they stood apart could not see anyone else on screen if they seperated. Basically, they broke rule #1 of MMO's, if you're going to correct, do it in small amounts, not a giant pendulum swing from A to B, because in doing so, you just sweep out both the people who wanted A and the people who wanted B. Instead of satisfying either side, they pissed both off.

As yet another ex-TOR-player.. After my first month, i quit for two weeks, then got myself a 2-month timecard but i hardly touched the game again. I do however have some indications why i did not like (continue) playing the game.Let's start first with what i liked:*The setting - a bit of tech fantasy, with slight magic mixed in.* One- and two person 'mini dungeons'* Combat, cc & class balances* Roleplay guilds - never seen active RP at this level in WoW* Be able to chat with enemy factionThe stuff i disliked weighted heavier though:* No cross realm pvp* No cross realm dungeons* No dungeon finder on the same realm. Party-searching and travelling like vanilla wow* Travelling in general - endless walks to/from spaceship* No realm-wide communication channels, not even in towns - general chat limited to planet/spaceship* Harsh and irreversable class choices at level 10 - pick either heal/dps or tank/dps roles, impossible to mix heal/tank on 1 character* No duel spec (Remember rift - they had no less than 5 specs - and interesting setup of talent trees, too!)* No addons, so painful auctioning of stuff, and targeted healjobs* Easy but unchallenging profession skillups* A month after release, half of the realms were simply too empty, so i felt like rolling on the wrong realm* A bunch of nagging details in the game - in a failed effort to make the game more challenging - too much to summorize.* Quest(mission) interaction gets boring over time, making me press space bar repeatedly just to skip the dialogSummorized: I's spoiled with wow. Blizzards dungeon, raid and pvp finder tools - queue up, jump in, and play. Flying mounts, teleports, summons, active guilds, endgame raid content. It may sound like details, but it are not. Blizzard is per-minute just more entertaining. Even if i log on and don't do a thing, i can have a good time chatting to friends and guildies. I can brainlessly mount up, fly around a bit, gather a bit. With TOR on the other hand, you better have a plan or you get bored. While leveling, that plan is obvious. Once reaching max-level though, there's like a big black void bubble around you, unless you got a guild to pull you.Now, for the declining numbers - Blizzard was already declining because the cataclysm expansion is getting outdated, so in a way TOR came at the right moment. However, after a month, TOR got boring, and with WoW i am (like many others) waiting for the next expansion thus playing less frequent too. So, i'm not surprised the numbers are declining on both. But i also know that WoW bringing new class changes and a new class will have a higher chance to grab my attention than a TOR expansion, even if TOR fixes most issues i mentioned.Apologies for the long post.

This is a strange article. Citing commenters as sources? Is there any verification conducted to know if there is a potential bias in these comments (one way or the other)? Acknowledging in the title that this is an opinion poll, and actually using a poll to report numbers of a large sample would make it feel more credible. Sorry to be critical, I just found this to be a strange piece and would like to see Ars *not* go further in this direction.
