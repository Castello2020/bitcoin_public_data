Ooh, I just found out about this last night because I wanted to see if Lloyd was gone from Coronation Street forever. I think the entire run is on netflix, I might have to watch it now!

The last few seasons of the originally series were really really bad. Once they brought back the original ship/crew and they were thrown into the brig the entire series was ass.I can't imagine why they're bothering to bring it back now.

You're acting as if I'm not a fan. It was one of my favorite series. It started sucking, it got canceled, and now all the actors are old. Color me unexcited.

I'm with Saint here. The series could make a comeback but I'd rather they stop using the original actors.

Or it just needs to radically change with the times, comedy-wise, and reinvent itself.I pretty much agree with Saint: it was a fantastic series but the format was getting pretty tired towards the end, so I'm not exactly filled with hope at this point. With the actors being so much older now, they're gonna need to make some major changes to get off of that downward trajectory. I hope they can pull it off!

S9 was actually pretty good for what it was. I loved the Bladerunner references. Here's hoping this one doesn't suck either.

If it's Grant Naylor again, it might have a chance. More Doug Naylor-only? ... Eeeeeh.(Edit: Looks like it is still Doug Naylor-only. Pity. Also, who the fuck names a television channel 'Dave'?)

Unfortunately I'm with Saint. And you can't tell me I'm not a fan. Though that shot of them on a cramped little bridge gives me a tiny bit of hope. I loved the episodes where they were all stuck on Starbug living off of dog food and "urine-recyc".

I've got to agree with Saint here. Although I'm a big fan, the last few Naylor-only series were nowhere near as good as the Grant Naylor ones.

I'll watch the new episodes but I'm not holding my breath that they'll be very good.

This is news? Robert Llewlyn announced this on his twitter feed ages ago. Posted some BTS pics and stuff whilst they were filming in Shepperton too.I'm looking forward to it, I definitely don't want a reboot like some of you crazy Yanks do. New is not always better y'know fellas..Bob said it should be on Dave (a UK digital TV channel) sometime around Sept/Oct this year. Details to be confirmed.
