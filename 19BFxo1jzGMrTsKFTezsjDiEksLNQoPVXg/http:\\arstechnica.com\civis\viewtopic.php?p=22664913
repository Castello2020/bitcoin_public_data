In my short time here on earth, I've noticed that the single most unlikely way to ever win an office pool based on March Madness brackets is to use logic or probabilities. The winners generally use things like "Who has prettier uniforms?" or other such nonsense to pick winners.This year, our free office pool rules allow every person in my family to enter, so I'm thinking of having fun trying to come up with odd ways to pick winners, and let my kids pick their own brackets.So, some obvious ones to start, then I'm opening up for suggestions:How close the team lives to my hometownThe apparent ferocity of the team's mascots.Uniform colors

Pick the team with the most vowels. Or be fancy and pick the team that's closest to having a prime number of vowels.Team with most/least undergraduate degree programs.School with the longest official URL.

Locate an available parcel of land approximately 600' by 500'.Grade the land, and install a top layer of red arkose.Acquire 64 t-shirts (fuck that play-in bullshit).Nominate a child to puffy-paint the team names on the shirts (one team per shirt, no repeats).Recruit 64 gentlemen of ill repute.Assign shirts to the gentlemen (one shirt per gentleman)Fisticuffs.

Chronological according to school founding/openingApproximate ranking from 10/20/30 years prior, new contestants receive a random ranking from old teams not represented in the current bracketsMy personal favorite is alphabetic distance from a randomly chosen name/word: choose a team at random (blind fold + dartboard is helpful), then using the first letter that team's name rank the rest according to alphabetic distance.Example: Randomly select team "Magpies". They are the overall winner. Team names with N and L come next, O and K third, etc.. Variations: alphabetic distance by star player's last name, coach's last name, etc..

Well I know how to pick a winning racehorse. The one with the erection as they're being led around the circle before going out to the starting gate will either win or finish dead last.Every. Time.You might be able to translate this method to football...

The vast majority of methods are stupid.The results are that the likelihood of a stupid method winning is greater than 50% on shear chance alone. It doesn't mean that your odds are better if you use a stupid method.

Most systems give bonuses for correctly predicting underdogs. (E.G. In ours, in the first two rounds, you get to add the seed of predicted team to your point total if you win, so correctly predicting a #16 seed team to win gets you 16 bonus points.) If you predict the #64 team to win the first 2 rounds (and they do) you get big, big points.

The last time I played a bracket (I don't follow basketball/college basketball at all) I simply went by which team sounded more familiar to me. (This was back in the late 80s, mind you). So, for example, if it was "Minnesota" vs. "Duke", I'd pick Duke, because for some reason they sound more like a 'basketball' school...meaning I probably have heard more about their basketball team than Minnesota's.I won the whole thing quite handily.

While picking an upset correctly will generally add massive amounts of points to your scores, there are some more logic based things you can do with a little research.1. Preseason rankings will (barring significant injuries) give you a good idea of how good a team is on paper. Useful for tie breaking picks between two similarly ranked teams.2. Teams that have to travel less are more likely to win against equal teams.2a. To a lesser extent, teams that travel well - these would be big name teams that can make any game seem like a home game if it's on neutral territory. Duke for example.3. Teams that finish the regular and conference tournaments hot (last year's tournament is a great example of this) seem to be more likely to win.4. Barring upsets, small name teams seem to be less likely to win. The lower seeds are more likely to have to travel and won't get much support outside of their home area. For example, Temple is basically the only Philadelphia area team and I expect that they will get minimal road support.

Not terribly applicable to this instance, but I remember when I took a stats class in college, the professor mentioned how the Army ran this massive long-term study, where they wanted to see if there was any indicator as to who would develop into great leaders. So they monitored a bunch of different traits in recruits during boot camp, and tracked their career paths. In the end, they tried to correlate the soldiers who became leaders with a specific trait identified in boot camp. The one thing that stood out with a huge correlation: all the natural leaders preferred chocolate pudding.

Using an online bracket, I click through the matchups as quickly as possible while only considering the vague impression each school name gives me from the brief comprehension I had of NCAA basketball back in the late 90s, which was probably the last time I actually watched a college basketball game. We'll see if I can defend my Ars league championship this year.

I'm #7 out of 39 in the company! Stupid guesses RULE!** I also used a bit of rrrhal's strategy as well. Sort of. I gave special preferance to Gonzaga, just because their name sounds like, well, gonzagas. . .

We used to do a weekly football pool (NFL) at work. One year, the winner, a person who NEVER followed football, won by picking based on mascots vs. mascots and always picking the Seattle Seahawks.She had an incredible accuracy record. The following year, the same plan failed miserably.In fairness, the Seahawks sucked both seasons.

At this point, picking entirely at random probably would have yielded similar results to the logic I applied. Sure is exciting to watch though.
