I honestly did not know he was still around! I loved his books as a kid, and I often point to his room of toys whenever my wife comments on all of the things I have around my home office.http://io9.com/5916175/rip-ray-bradbury ... chronicles

Awww, damn. I can't say I'm surprised (he was 91). But the world is a little less shiny without him in it.

When I interned in CA in 1997, my roommate was a high school English teacher. He had some connection to Ray Bradbury and got him to come to the school to speak. I got to go, and I took along a copy of Fahrenheit 451 for him to sign. My roommate had a crappy Mazda 323 hatch, and since Ray didn't drive anymore, he drove him home and had him sign the dashboard with a Sharpie. A great storyteller will be missed.

People always talked about the "Big Three" of sci-fi (Asimov, Clarke and Heinlein), and while I agree that those three deserved the honorary title, I always thought it should be the "Big Four" and Mr. Bradbury should've been on that list too.The four of them, along with Vonnegut, really lit my brain on fire as an adolescent. The world seems dimmer without them, but fortunately I've got dozens and dozens and dozens of their paperbacks lining my shelves to brighten my evenings.

As far as I'm concerned, Ray was the true father of science fiction, and only Stanisław Lem could give him a run for his money. Asimov was a poser and neither Clarke nor Heinlein are even blips on my radar.Here's to the finest short story writer of all time. I drink in your honor tonight, Ray.Fucking sand in my eye...

Very sad, but he had a good run. I love his writing still. And "Something Wicked This Way Comes" was one of the first novels to ever scare the piss out of me, when I was a kid. I'd take that over Stephen King any day of the week.Jakal wrote:Ray was like The Expendables versus... well... the 2001: A Space Odyssey of everyone else.Please, please tell me that you did not just favorably compare Ray Bradbury to a summer popcorn action flick while simultaneously dissing one of the greatest movies ever made. You meant to say Quote:Ray was like the 2001: A Space Odyssey versus... well... The Expendables of everyone else,right?(Edit the 2nd: Not that I agree with your dismissal of Asimov, Clarke etc. to be valid, but I will listen to an argument that Bradbury was a better writer than them.)

Fahrenheit 451 is a classic. As Bradbury said many times, and I didn't get until later in life, it isn't about censorship. It's about a culture abandoning ideas in favor of simple-minded, overheated politics, wars and toys. Every year culture moves closer to one in which contemplation is no longer socially acceptable. I sometimes think of the guy who gets hunted down as a suspicious character for being weird enough to take a walk alone. (Among the scenes of helicopters chasing Montag.) I know the feeling. Try walking to work for pleasure and see how much ridicule you get from the cubicle gallery. Or admit you don't watch teevee.Quote:Here's to the finest short story writer of all time. That would be Hemingway, at least in English. Bradbury's short stories are often good though, while some of his other work is a little stilted and silly, the way sci-fi prose usually is. But F451 is built to last.

In general, I don't care for short stories. Mr. Bradbury is the one notable exception. "The foghorn" and "A sound of thunder" are two I remember fondly.

Every year, in fall, I re-read "The October Country." His early works are rough around the edges, but have moments of real beauty in them (and "The Lake" is a classic, no question).He was better with short stories than with novels. Even 'The Martian Chronicles' is more of a collection of stories than a real novel. "Something Wicked This Way Comes" is great, though... I'll probably revisit a bunch of his stuff that I haven't read in a while. I'll find my copy of Dandelion Wine and of The Illustrated Man and read them again. What better way to celebrate his life?

For a science fiction author, Bradbury had a strong antitechnological streak. He didn't care for the internet or for e-books (and he was ambivalent about TV and hated to fly).Which, when you read his stories, makes sense. He wasn't interested in the trappings of scifi, he was interested in people and in stories. His outlook never changed much from his 13-year-old self from the early part of the 20th century.

I knew this day was coming eventually, but it still hurts bad. The Martian Chronicles is still one of my favorite books, and everything else I've read by him has been thoroughly entertaining. It's really too bad to hear of his passing.As much as he was against e-books, I do hope his works get released now in e-book form. His writing is amazing, and I'd love to keep a copy of a few of his works on my phone/iPad for downtime reading.

The last of the great Sci-Fi trio of grand masters is gone.I loved all three of ABC, but few books had as much of an impression on me as Fahrenheit 451, and a bit later, The Martian Chronicles.

When I was a kid I must have read The Martian Chronicles close to a hundred times. Plus, I was constantly pestering librarians to find out if any more stories had been released. I have never read it as an adult. I think I will have to remedy that.
