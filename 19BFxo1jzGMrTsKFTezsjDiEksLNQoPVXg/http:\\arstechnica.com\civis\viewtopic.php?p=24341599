Re: Varys and the crateThe guy inside isn't a pedophile. He just used Varys's body parts for a ritual. Let him go afterward (and possibly treated the wound). So it wasn't personal for the sorcerer until Varys got ahold of him...even though he was Varys's primary motivator for years.More speculation: the sorcerer threw Varys's man bits into a fire? Betcha the he works for the Lord of Light...and that the Brothers Without Banners are likely nowhere near as noble as they claim (likely, and they said nothing of Stannis's sigil...only the warring lions and wolves) or they're being deceived into thinking the Lord of Light's one of those nice, chummy gods that doesn't murder people using shadow creatures birthed from redheads overnight.

The Targaryens before her simply came in and used dragons to burn everyone into submission because they could. Honestly, I've no sympathy for her if she tried the same.I expect more of the same. She wants to be queen because she feels entitled to it.She at least has slightly less sense of entitlement than her brother did, and she does actually care about the people she leads (trying to help the Dothraki who stayed with her, freeing the Unsullied, etc).Yeah, she feels entitled, but she also sees her birthright and power as a responsibility as opposed to simply being a privilege (like Joffrey.)

A few bits of idle speculation:1) Arya still has that coin, right? She has to go find the shape-shifting assassin guy, she has to. Otherwise there's no reason for her to have it.2) I'm also guessing that all the Stark males will be dead by the time the series is done.3) I think Cersei is going to try to kill Margery, and fail, and will reap the consequences.

And I'm not certain she'll ever get karmically punished for it.

This is a gentle reminder for those of you who have read the books to please not speculate on the future of the series in this thread. I'm not calling out anyone in particular here but some of the comments, even if they have no spoilers in and of themselves, can act as spoilers for the more perceptive viewers who have not read the books.Feel free to make your comments of this nature in the book+show thread, even go so far as to have fun with what you read in this thread. Any of the non-reader viewers who venture into the book thread do so at their own risk so you can talk this thread up there as much as you like.

Hell, didn't she try to have Tyrion killed?

Going after Margery without a battle going on is a little less subtle. Like...Hodor in the godswood less subtle.No one ever expects Podrick. nquinnell

The war is happening NOW. People are dying NOW. Becoming a shape-shifting assassin, I assume, would take at least a decade to learn. I can't see her taking herself out of the game like that.Now, I'm assuming the coin lets her ask a favor or something from the assassins, but jeez, its only been like a week since she got that. That's a gold-shiny-highest-standard-ace-in-the-hole to play so soon. As far as Arya knows, all her family is still alive and well (except Ned), so blowing that coin wouldn't be prudent at this juncture. I can more logically see Arya finally getting to the wall, just as the Walkers get there, and her using that coin to save herself or something. Or she gets a splinter and dies of a staph infection.

I'm so very confused about Theon. So...he's held captive and tortured by someone. They might be Stark men, or they might be Greyjoy men, or they might be the gay, sadistic rednecks from Deliverance. So far, so good.One of them is actually a spy in service of Theon's sister. He frees Theon, kills his pursuers, and offers to take him to his sister. So far, so good.But the spy leads Theon right back to the same torture chamber. W T F'in F?So maybe we say that it's because Theon said, "My father died at King's Landing" thus proving his lack of loyalty to the Greyjoys. So that verifies that his captors are Greyjoys. But why the hell did the Greyjoys need to free him, kills their own, then lead him back to determine his loyalty? It makes no sense at all.

Okay, here's my question:You are selling an army of slaves. 8000 of them. What idiot wouldn't prepare for the person buying them not to go, "Hey, thanks for the slaves, I'm now going to attack you." I mean, seriously, even if he didn't expect her to free them or speak Valyrean, shouldn't he have simply made the deal outside the city walls, with an emissary doing the payment, and keeping back a quantity to slay the attackers if they come in after him?Talk about a fucking moron.

I would say he was heavily underestimating Danaerys because she was a woman, and thought she wouldn't be that conniving or backstabbing. Sometimes those kinds of thoughts will hamper reasoning.

Yeah, I thought at least he was going to have the dragon chained to some huge boulders or something first before handing over 'the whip'. I just figured Dany would then just have the army kill the master and then free the dragon. Maybe it's just the way the TV show was but it seemed painfully obvious she was going to leave with the army and her dragon. I guess the only twist to me was she spoke the language. Kind of cool, not sure how much it mattered. I guess it shows she could keep her cool and play the game while being insulted to her face, not something the Lannisters could muster apart from Tyrion.

The best part of this episode is it bumped her way the hell up the "Badass" scale. In fact, I'd vote she's way over Jamie at this point.
