              Meh. Parsing based on the distinction between technology and magic, the narrative type, mechanics, whatever, is just silly. What it basically amounts to is whether a book &quot;feels&quot; like science fiction or &quot;feels&quot; like fantasy â€” or whether the author or publisher doesn't want it to be classified as either. Genres are stupid for this exact reason. <br /><br />Margaret Atwood writes some fantastic science-fiction-like stories, but she insists she doesn't write science fiction (and was quoted as specifying martians, teleporters, and intergalactic space travel as particular qualities of sci-fi). Instead, she says she writes &quot;speculative fiction.&quot; It gets her on the &quot;literary fiction&quot; bookshelves in the stores anyway. But there's no reason someone who browses the sci-fi section shouldn't give her the same chance as someone who browses the literary fiction section. This is just one example.<br /><br />Genres suck.

The distinction becomes less useful as we move away from physical bookstores which need to divide by genres for browsers.<br /><br />For the original question, I'd say science fiction even though a certain amount of mysticism is involved.

Hell even Amazon.com has mixed stuff up.  As much as I hate labels I want to read about technology and interesting speculation on how it will evolve and the sociological implications it would bring.  Not a story about a big quest for some magical bauble.  <br /><br /> In that respect Genres are great.<br /><br /><br /> Since we are kinda on the subject of Dune (or were) I couple years ago I read somewhere, someone comparing Dune (in movie form) to another movie that was drastically different but when you looked deeper was actually pretty similar.  Does anyone have any clue what that movie may be? I'm not even sure it was Sci-fi.

Still, it's pretty good, considering it was written a long time ago.<br /><br />As for Dune... I'd say it's more fantasy.  More appropriately, it's science fantasy. (As opposed to science fiction)  It uses the future and future technology/science to set up an epic and the rules behind the universe.  The prohibition on using computers for space flight (along with it's life-prolonging effects) sets up the need for Melange and its importance.  It's a plot device necessary to make the motivations for control of Arakis realistic.  But in the end, it just sets up the universe.  Science isn't really used to carry the story forward or solve the main problems.<br /><br />Star Trek is most definitely science fiction because of how it uses science not only to set up the universe but as a way of carrying the story forward and even solving the main problem.</div><br /><br />Yeah, Melange couldn't possibly be a substitute for some other substance we'd need to sustain our economy and society, like Oil, or Power.  Totally not.<br /><br />It's science fiction, but really it's just allegory.  It's practically the middle-east and the constant warring and fighting to control oil by outside powers retold with different names.  All of the rest is window dressing.<br /><br />Calling it fantasy seems a bit off to me, given it's direct correlation to our recent past and current time frames.  There are obviously several things which are not substitutes for something already existing (i.e. facedancers) but frankly, that's the science fiction part.  I'd argue that most of the technology, philosophy, etc is plausible.<br /><br />I don't really think you start getting into anything remotely LIKE fantasy until you have the Quizatsadurak (not sure how the fuck you spell that), and even that is just a plausible extension of the powers of the Bene Jesuit.

              Definitely more in the science fiction side than the high fantasy side. Aside from the examined and consistent future technology, the trans-humanism themes examine the concepts of noticeable evolution. The only time I saw fantasy explore this theme was Tomas of the Riftwar Saga, but that was magically-induced change into something that already was... A lot of the trans-humanism in Dune is to become something completely new.

              Dune is a mix of sci-fi and fantasy. There's a decent amount of &quot;magic&quot; there, but it's the kind that was common in sci-fi of the 60s-80s, driven by the idea that just maybe LSD trips were more than the mental equivalent of pushing on an LCD screen to see the pretty pictures. I consider it real sci-fi because most of the non mental stuff was based in science. All the tech for living in an extreme desert environment, the life-cycle of the sandworms, the reasoning for not using computers, etc, it's all sci-fi, pretty hard sci-fi for the time. Terraforming and environmentalism weren't pervasive like they are now, 99.5% of people didn't think that the environment was changeable. Even things like the mentats were grounded in science, without the ability to use computers there almost certainly would be a lot of effort put into utilizing savants.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The Foundation Series is interesting, but when you read it now, you realize how incredibly out-of-date it is. Still, it's pretty good, considering it was written a long time ago.</div><br />Asimov was one of the best futurists and idea men sci-fi has had, but he wasn't a particularly great writer. He was better than most of his contemporaries, but there's a reason sci-fi was a second class literary citizen for a long time. All I can think of when reading him or Clarke now is how dated it feels. A part of that is that they are a victim of their own success, we're pretty much living in some of the sci-fi they imagined, which makes it seem mundane with details that are &quot;off&quot;. &quot;Why is he giving some awkward description of what a satellite is?&quot; Checks publication date. &quot;Oh, satellites didn't exist then...&quot;<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Science fiction or fantasy? Really? <br /><br />Who the fuck cares?</div><br />The Internet!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And genres are the bane of literature. Would you enjoy Dune any more or less if it were &quot;high fantasy&quot;, &quot;science fiction&quot;, &quot;future fantasy&quot; or whatever? Would it be any less or more or a classic? Would you think any differently about the themes? I certainly don't think so.</div><br />The discussion here is a thought exercise, because, &quot;why not?&quot; Genres serve an extremely important purpose in the general sense though, because they steer people towards the kind of books they enjoy. Sometimes there are books that don't fit in any of the slots, and that's ok (most books hit multiple genres these days), but generally when you go pick up a &quot;sci-fi&quot; book with spaceships on the cover you have an idea of what you are going to get. Aside from the fact that the lines can blur, fantasy/sci-fi is considered one section in the bookstore because the demographics for both are more or less the same, and genres are about getting books in front of the people who have the most chance of liking them.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Funny. I think &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot; is easily the best book in the series. It's the only one I occasionally will re-read.</div><br />The thing with the dune books is that they were all pretty great (the second and third are definitely the weakest), but they were very different kinds of books. If you went into GEoD expecting Dune, you were going to be sorely disappointed. It's the same thing with Ender's Game to Speaker for the Dead, SftD is fantastic 80s sci-fi, but it's nothing like EG.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It's science fiction, but really it's just allegory. It's practically the middle-east and the constant warring and fighting to control oil by outside powers retold with different names. All of the rest is window dressing.</div><br />I would argue that the allegorical fight over the spice is the widow dressing, and the other elements are the meat of it.

              More generally, I classify something as sci-fi if the science is plausible or believable, and if it's the motivator for the story. A true sci-fi story can't be told without major modifications if you stripped out the science. It's about exploring the human condition when confronted with future-tech and the dilemmas it brings. If there's no real science there then it might as well be magic (SW) and it's fantasy. Boiled down, fantasy is just sci-fi without any attempt to ground it in reality. <br /><br />Sci-fi itself is a thing because grounding in reality generally ends up making things a lot more interesting and unexpected than if you just make shit up. For example, trying to fit real quantum physics into sci-fi books has produced a lot of crazy and interesting story elements that would be dismissed as unbelievable nonsense if they didn't have the science backing. The same thing with relativity, there is so much sci-fi that gets mileage out of relativity, whereas no fantasy author is going to come up with something that complicated and bizarre.

              <div class="quotetitle">Dac wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The 'argument' or point of view over what constitutes Science Fiction, and what comprises Fantasy, has been mulled over many times over the decades.  <br /><br />The bookshelves in shops (back when bookshops were the only way to get books) were filled with fantasy, and interspersed within were 'Proper' SF authors.  Heroic/Fantasy fiction abounds, and seems to be devoured by the paying customers, whilst SF is still 'nerdy/geeky' and never quite as popular to be able to give it the same shelf-space as the burgeoning Fantasy section.<br /><br />As with diverse musical 'forms' (rap, hiphop, dance, ska, rock, jazz, etc), there are shades of SF which any aficionado could rattle off, but most 'mundane' people would shrug off as 'it's all the same to me, mate'.  <br /><br />There will be people who cite Clarke/Asimov/Heinlein as 'SF' and Tolkien as 'Fantasy'.  There's work out there like (the hateful) Ray Bradbury or the distinctly odd John Wyndham, classified as SF, but it's hardly science, and mostly suggestion, wordsmithery, literature.  All shady unknowns and mayhap, rather than descriptions of glowing dials, hardware, and coruscating ravening beams of hyperdyned destruction.<br /><br />I like my SF to be 'diamond hard', Neal Stephenson, Iain M. Banks etc.  A lot of readers prefer softer SF authors, Anne McCaffrey, for example.<br /><br />There's nothing to be gained by pigeonholing authors, or specific books, into what -you- believe is their correct nomenclature. There is nothing to be had by forcing a group of people to agree that X is SF and Y is Fantasy.  It's all very arbitrary labeling, and in many cases, simply misguided.<br /><br />Classify Pratchett's Discworld as Fantasy? More like comic genius.<br /><br />What about Piers Anthony's and his Xanth books; overwrought puns and puerile teenage masturbatory rubbish, if it was labeled 'correctly' <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Whatever the wider readership thinks what 'category' books should be in, at the end of the day, it's only a label.  The books themselves are what matters, and a good story trumps categorization.<br /><br />Dune is a damn fine story.</div><br /><br />I prefer to think of fiction as historical, speculative, satirical or fantastical.  The setting really has little to do with this, and is a second adjective you can throw in to add flavor.  So Game of Thrones is a combination of medieval fantasy, as it has mostly &quot;real&quot; political games with a bit of fantasy magic thrown in to color the world.  Neal Stephenson writes satirical speculative future fiction, as most of his work is based on playing out technology and politics to make points about human nature.  Dune is a hybrid of medieval futuristic satire, using spice in place of modern resources to comment on politics and religion.  Something like Old Man's War is fantastical futuristic satire.  Dragonlance or Battletech or Star Wars are just fantastical, with the appropriate setting adjective thrown in. <br /><br />The old &quot;fantasy&quot; and &quot;scifi&quot; monikers fail to encompass what the other is trying to achieve.  Are they trying for just a good story, or are they trying to make thematic points?  Both are okay, but reducing to simply setting fails at giving me any idea as to what the book is.<br /><br />In my opinion, the best fiction uses science or fantasy to explore topics relevant to our current lives.  By choosing a fictional settings and constructing science or magic, a good writer can focus the themes of his work on the specific issues he or she wants to address.  World-building in the name of the message.

              Both my favourite local stores separate scifi from fantasy.<br />Dune imo is scifi primarily.   I agree that God Emperor is the best one, though I thoroughly enjoy the last two as well.<br />&quot;Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genre of science fiction by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific themes&quot;, something which the Dune doesn't do, with the possible exception of the Voice (which was a plot device ignored from book 2 onwards iirc?)

There's some good classics in that vein too (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_troopers" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Starship troopers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armor_%28novel%29" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Armor</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_Earth_%28novel%29" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Battlefield Earth</a>) I occasionally drift into hard scifi (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold_series" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Manifold</a>). I do appreciate the Mars trilogy for its discussion of the sociopolitical ramifications and scientific speculations of terraforming Mars, but <span style="font-style: italic">goddamn</span> is it boring. I don't like leaving a series unfinished, but this one is becoming tedious for me.  <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/sad.png" alt=":(" title="Frown" /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Paul M wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">No bookstores I know of separate out Science Fiction and Fantasy.  They're all in the same section for a reason.</div><br /><br />This right here pisses me off. One reason I hate going to Brick and Mortar shops is due to this mindset. I don't want to wade through a huge selection of books about scantily clad people riding dragons and swinging swords to find my future military scifi. There can be <span style="font-style: italic">some</span> division. I can't remember where it was (been a while since I was in the market for dead-tree books), but I do remember being in a large book chain that had a subdivided scifi section. It was there that my faith in humanity was slightly restored. Fortunately, preferred recommendations (like on Amazon.com), combined with going completely digital, have made this argument moot for me.<br /><br /><br /><br /><img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyuui7AVb11r95m39o1_500.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Also:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.demotivationalposters.org/image/demotivational-poster/0908/books-demotivational-poster-1249878054.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br /><br />-mhacÂ³

He's got a particularly 90s way of looking at things that just seems very dated now. In general he's also way too preachy for me now, and most of his books and stories end up seeming like the same thing with different setpieces. The science in the Mars trilogy is pretty good, but there's less of it than I remembered, and it seemed a lot less impressive this time around.

I switched to Slow Glass Books as my preferred vendor of SF which was pre-sorted into 'SF' and 'Fantasy'.  Dune would have been in his SF side.  I don't know if Justin is still running Slow Glass Books.  Since 2010, I've been an Amazon/Kindle worshipper.  Bookstores have gone the way of the dodo around here; Borders opened up, many bookstores closed, then Borders closed down 'overnight'.  Nobody cared, because Amazon was so much better for a while.  Then they had the 'readjustment' and suddenly Amazon titles 'for Australians' were 20-100% more expensive than the very same item for the US market.  That shit's still going on, driven by Publishers greed and the harsh reality of the world market.
