              Okay, look, I've already stopped reading this thread. Why? Because I'm watching the show and haven't read the books, and I don't want to see your hypotheticals. Not interested. Which is the whole bloody point in the first place.<br /><br />If you cannot understand how that works, then yes, stay out of the show thread. It's that simple. If you think you're capable of not dragging the books in, for any reason at all, period, end of story, then feel free. There's no magic gate that will stop you. We can't ban posters from threads btw. Not technically possible.<br /><br />There really isn't anything else to say about it.

              @Starbuck79:<br /><br />You seem to think there were no spoilers at all in the thread in the run up to the moderation. I can spot two. They are minor but they are there. What has happened in both cases is this: Some detail which is left unclear in the show but is clear in the books has been clarified by a book reader. That's still spoileration, because every tiny detail in this story can turn out to be critical.<br /><br />@Xaiax: did you really just post spoilers in a discussion about how best to deal with spoilers? The ironing is delicious.

If you do that then you have margin to make sure everyone's happy even if they draw the line a bit farther than someone else.<br /><br />But we know from experience that they can't. Even if they can individually they can't as a population. And if you have moderators go after people that can't after the fact, then you create untenable amounts of work for moderators and effectively guarantee people will be spoiled.<br /><br />There are only two possible outcomes:<br /><br />-Nuke the site from orbit and ask lots of people to refrain even if some of them could contribute positively.<br />-Accept that there is no possibility of a safe TV thread.

Again, if the only options to discuss the show are 1) be careful about what I do and do not say and 2) have the entire spoiled for me.  I'm going to do the first until a Mod officially tells me to stop.  So far, none of done that nor is it the official moderation in the thread.<br /><br />I find it amusing for people who don't want to be spoiled demand that others go to a place they are guaranteed to be spoiled.

It's seriously uncanny. It's just been tried so many times with abject failure every single one of them.<br /><br />If we don't have serious preemptive moderation then the TV people leave and you still don't have any place to talk.

Can't you just read the thread? Or is the urge to participate and show the ignorant savages that you know better way too strong?<br /><br />Outside the internet, let's say, in a bar, if you hear a conversation you are not part of, do you get pissy if the participants politely ask you repeatedly to stay out, then finally tell you to please walk the fuck away?<br /><br />Do you really believe you are entitled to be part of every conversation you can read or hear?</div><br /><br />Why do you feel entitled to tell people they can't participate in a discussion?</div><br /><br /><br />Dude, its just MANNERS. If the main participants of a discussion politely ask you to not be a part of it, just stand back and listen. Is it so hard to just listen (or read) some times? Or do you have a need to make everyone around you know what you are thinking?</div><br />You know what?  I once started a thread about an internet friend who died.  It got trolled immediately by one of the biggest cunts in the forum.  I asked the mods to just lock the thread.  Their response was &quot;just because a thread doesn't go the way you want it is no reason to lock it&quot;.  And &quot;wahh wahh someone on the internet doesn't like what I like&quot;.  No moderation of the troll.  No indication that the &quot;owner&quot; of a thread had any say about the posts that it attracted.  A big &quot;FUCK YOU&quot; to &quot;manners&quot;.<br /><br />What makes a thread about a fucking TV show so special?  Especially when most people are being very careful already, and some people who don't actually know anything are just <span style="font-style: italic">assuming</span> they're spoiling?  <br /><br />You know what else?  I don't even expect a response that makes sense.

              I read the books, twice. There are definitely some dirty book readers in the TV thread. A few instances have even  been dissected in the book thread. And a fleeting reference in one brief scene of the show is no justification to elaborate or foreshadow. Frankly I think ffifield underreacted. Griefing a thread titled no spoilers should merit a temp ban. <br /><br />Also, I don't think there's such a thing as appealing to some conclave of moderators. From long observation, it's seems like the rule is first moderator on the scene makes the call, with an extremely rare staff intervention the only real recourse.

So, why does your opinion matter?</div><br /><br /><br />Actually, I am able to participate in both threads, it would only take two minutes if I wanted to. As to my opinion and my skin, I have been a member of this community for thirteen years, mostly under another nickname. I stopped participating in the Lounge because I don't like what it has become (exampled by this thread, and by your elitist post.) Did I kick and scream about it? No, I simply stepped back and engaged in other discussions in other parts of the forums, and other boards. <br /><br />All that anyone is asking is to PLEASE be polite and abide by the wishes of the people for whom the discussion is meant for, some of which include close relations of mine (hence my getting involved.) I am being abrasive because it seems to be the only way to get it into some thick skulls that their self centered BS is really getting out of hand. Look at this, three pages of what amounts to &quot;The mods made me feel scolded, I don't like this, someone has some explaining to do!&quot;<br /><br />I'm bowing out of this one I'm not even gonna remember it when I get back from work next week, but please, can you just pretend that the books don't exist when you participate in that thread? THANK YOU.

As to my opinion and my skin, I have been a member of this community for thirteen years, mostly under another nickname. I stopped participating in the Lounge because I don't like what it has become (exampled by this thread, and by your elitist post.) Did I kick and scream about it?

It was a simple observation that you are arguing about people's ability to post in a thread that you cannot, at this time, participate in. Not only that but you freely admit that you are flouting the rules by having 'another nickname'.<br /><br />To use your bar analogy, it is like you are the guy watching two people duke it out inside, and the bouncer yells at them so they walk outside to settle their differences. You start yelling at them that they should not be fighting, and that you are only trying to be the voice of reason. Yet, you are not willing to pay the $5 cover charge to go in, and try to be the peace maker there. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/wink.png" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

I can't imagine how that could possibly be construed as a spoiler.</div><br /><br />Without being too specific, it is exactly that. When a poster who hasn't read the books speculates about events, it's just that -- speculation (based on knowledge gained by watching the show). When an individual who, in the same thread, confirms that they read the books and speculates about the same events it isn't really speculating because they know exactly what happens ahead of time. Let's make a sports analogy and say that a buddy of yours is a Canucks fan and says something like 'I bet tonight's game is gonna be great' (based on hypothetical previous games that were good). Now let's say you recorded the game and your same buddy says the same thing but you know that he watched the game the night before. It's like that but much worse. I don't want to elaborate further without risking actual spoilers, but the linked post and the following few cover it nicely (IMO).

It's that simple. If you think you're capable of not dragging the books in, for any reason at all, period, end of story, then feel free. There's no magic gate that will stop you. We can't ban posters from threads btw. Not technically possible.</div><br /><br />The forum software may not give us the option of topic-level bans, but we have in the past instructed problematic posters to stay out of a particular thread at the threat of a forum-wide ban.  So it's hardly without precedent.<br /><br />I've still yet to see a retraction and/or clarification in the actual thread that the last moderation did not, in fact, ban book-readers from participating so long as they can refrain from posting book materials and/or spoilers.

I'm guessing you've moved on by now though.

              It stopped working during one of the forum changes some years ago.

No one brought this up, but it doesn't require any book knowledge <span style="font-style: italic">at all</span>.<br /><br />So, is that kosher to point out? It's a 100% factual observation that could be pointed out based on only watching the show. (And, point of fact, I have no idea if it's even relevant in the books. Maybe there's some other part in the books I haven't read that make all of this irrelevant. It's not based on as-yet-unshown information, it's purely from what's been shown in the show.)

              XaiaX, you missed the point.<br /><br />What has, or hasn't happened in a future book, IS a spoiler.  You are not helping your case here.  You wrote &quot;X hasn't happened yet in the books.&quot;  THAT is a spoiler and a prime example of something that has no business in the &quot;Show Only&quot; thread or this one.<br /><br />I'm intentionally being vague so as not to repeat your spoiler.  You could have easily provided hypothetical examples to  demonstrate your point. There was no need to bring ANY spoilers, from the show OR the books into this discussion.  You also assume that everyone in THIS thread has seen season 1 &amp; 2 of the show.<br /><br />Until the mods do otherwise, the purpose of the Show Only is to avoid ANY mention/reference/acknowledgement of the books existing is off limits.  Book readers are allowed to post as long as they accept those limitations.  Lets keep the same in this thread as we talk about those rules.

              I posted a moderation comment in the show only thread which I hope clears up any confusion about who may participate. In a nutshell anyone may participate in it but for the purposes of that thread the books do not exist and any reference to them in any way shape or form will not be tolerated.

Anyone with an HBO subscription has access to these and anything posted their would be part of the &quot;canon&quot; as it pertains to the show. Also, HBO isn't likely to spoiler their own show since most of the viewers are non readers, so any material they post will be relevant to the program and the pre-history revelations they make aren't likely to give away future events. HBO is pretty good at this kind of thing.<br /><br />As for those that are viewing the show by, uh, other means... well, they're on their own.<br /><br />One thing I didn't mention was that I really liked the way some of you, when clarifying a point that was in the show, are using a You Tube clip to remind thread participants of what was said. Nobody can argue with a clip from the show.  <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/wink.png" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
