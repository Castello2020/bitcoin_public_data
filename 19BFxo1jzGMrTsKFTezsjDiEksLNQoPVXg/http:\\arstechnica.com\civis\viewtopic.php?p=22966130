Last night I was out with my rugby team and didn't feel like getting drunk. I had 3-4 beers and then started drinking water. This blew people's fucking minds. I had several people ask me why I was drinking water. One guy was basically personally offended that I wasn't drinking. Eventually someone was so upset that I wasn't drinking that they bought me another beer, which I guess worked out.

It is the "let's talk about why this picture is or is not funny" thread.This is a failure of the medium. The only way to prevent discussion in a forum meant for discussions is to either alter the software or have vigilant moderators. Perhaps a thread where pics come from other threads -- a collection of images voted up as "funny", with no discussion possible. But this would take a change in the forum.

I've been spending the evening modelling furniture and trying to make them fit on our balcony using Google Sketchup. In what is no surprise at all, the ones that would give us the most room and the most seats come from IKEA. I swear that they're in kahoots with the building contractors.

I no longer have a TV as of this weekend. I'm pretty happy about this because now I can be a giant douche and drop the "I don't even own a TV" line all the time.Of course, I still watch a bunch of stuff online (or Netflix DVD in a laptop) so I'm not really following the spirt of the thing, but I don't feel the need to undermine my new found condescending douchiness by bringing that up. Welp, I'm off to call up my step father ....

My problem is that I have a TV, but I get to watch it a lot less often than I'd like. I probably only get to watch our TV about 7 hours a week -- where I'd probably watch it closer to 20 if I wasn't limited.
