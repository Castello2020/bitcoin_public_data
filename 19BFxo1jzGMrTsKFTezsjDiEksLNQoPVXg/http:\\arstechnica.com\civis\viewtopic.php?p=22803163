TV is on in the background. First thing to catch my attention? Some TV series where the detective asks the kid "So, you're probably into Starcraft right?" To which the kid says, in a tone that suggests nothing else than "bitch please", "actually I'm into basketball".Sigh.

Looking at an apartment that sit on church st. which the main drag (pedestrian outdoor shopping area) in our town. We'd have a few giant windows that face some of our favourite bars. It's a 3 bedroom and between my roommate and I, we could afford it without a third. This could be awesome.

Hey, this is random: If I open this thread from My Threads by accidentally clicking the thread title and starting at the beginning of the thread, I see smilies as images. But if I open this thread from My Threads by clicking the icon that indicates unread posts, or by clicking on the name of the last poster, and start back through the pages, I see no graphical smilies - as per my board preferences, because I fucking hate fucking graphical smilies. Does that seem right to you?

I have a co-worker who will leave her tea in the microwave, and then just leave. Often out of the office. This happens about five times a day. This morning it happened while she was having a conversation in the hall. beep beep beep. beep beep beep.I fixed it by calling the person she was talking to using Google voice (the first call is a private number). I am debating calling this co-worker from Google voice all day long at three minute intervals.

It has been decided that April 27 is passive voice day. It will be found to be difficult to write in passive voice. It will be annoying to both grammarians and stylists.

I have asked this person why she does it, and the response is, 'uh yeah, HA HA, I do that ALL the time don't I? HA HA'. What I forgot to add to the story is that I called down the hall to let her know her tea was ready. She laughed.. like I had made a funny. What pisses me off more is that with our old microwave, we could turn off the beep. I did this one time, and the same person turned it on - to remind her that her tea was waiting. I have seriously debated disabling the speaker in this current microwave with a screwdriver. Twelve

I do the same thing at home. It needs to sit and seep a while after it is heated, so there's no need to rush and grab it at the alarm. But sometimes I find a cold forgotten mug of tea when I go to heat up something else.

Some issues, like multiple arrests, will have an effect, but teams usually think talent trumps all.Alternate answer: If you max DEX and STR, you have to dump INT and WIS, usually. Or, in a point system, you have to add disadvantages to afford the high skills and attributes.
