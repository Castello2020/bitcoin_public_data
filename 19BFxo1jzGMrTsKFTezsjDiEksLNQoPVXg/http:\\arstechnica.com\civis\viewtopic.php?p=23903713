Hello, I have a major infrastructure upgrade due shortly, and I'm wondering if now is the time to instead consider switching to Cloud services for all or part, rather than follow the more traditional path (which I've done several times).This may go to the heart of whether the IT industry is headed in this direction, or is already there.For background I'm talking: 1000 users, 20TB of data, two data centres, application level data replication across these data centres (DFS-R, Exchange CCR, SQL Mirroring), a mix of VMware and physicals, traditional SAN, netbackup to tape silo. Very few business apps, mostly email, file, print. No regional sites, all well connected min 1gb/s. All circa 2008 tech and all soon due for replacement. PCs are all standard win7 office 2007.Should I consider a cautious upgrade to some Cloud services? A radical move of everything to the cloud? Will users revolt? Has anyone else been in this place and thought this through? Thanks

I'd consider using cloud for exchange and backups if you don't have regulatory issues but probably keep everything else local for now unless you have to spend a lot on power or cooling upgrades.

I'd say now is the time to do due diligence and talk to hosted providers to see how their capabilities align with your wants/needs and see how digestable the pricing models are. Most of them can help some sort of fake ROI breakdown. You might get a more honest idea from companies that have the capabilities to either do hosted or help with your infra upgrade since they'd be more agnostic in helping determine which direction is better for you.

PCs are all standard win7 office 2007.As a guess, you probably have enough equipment in place that a migration to an external cloud will be more costly than keeping it in-house. I believe the two big differences are likely to be uptime (how good is your DR plan?) and security. Also, as previously mentioned, be sure that any compliance regulations are followed (easier to verify for in-house). Finally, please remember to check the customer service aspect of the cloud service (both to admins and to users).Considering the changes in server capabilities in the past few years, you should probably look into increasing your level of virtualization (cut down on the number of physical servers). The net result should be a smaller footprint, with lower power and cooling requirements.You might also be able to do some sort of desktop virtualization.

The regulatory stuff is something I'm struggling with - the backup issues mostly. From what I can gather, most providers offer only a few weeks restore capability. What happens when someone accidentally deletes something and only finds out a few months later? Or if we need to perform an audit on someone's email from a few years ago?Balanced against that is an increasing number of new senior management who only seem to want iDevices, gmail, and Skype. Is Corporate IT devolving into just the provision of a big Internet pipe, wifi, and contracts with Cloud providers?

I think there's something to be said for dipping your toe in the cloudy waters. There's probably quite a few non-essential systems you are hosting yourself that would be really good candidates for a cloud service instead. Moving everything off in one lump is a pretty bad idea, as there's quite a lot of adjustments to be made.

You might also want a contingency plan in case your hosted solution provider sinks, like 2e2 is currently doing.More broadly: You should have a prepared plan how to go about firing your provider, just like you should have one for any other supplier of goods and services to your business.

It's interesting to me how much people make out of the "cloud" thing. It's not the hardware that's the difference, it's who has control of your data and if they can provide the level of security your .org needs.Well managed infrastructure is almost infinitely scalable so it makes sense that eventually my compute/storage/communicate resources will be hosted by someone else. I expect that most companies will slowly cut off the lower levels of the software stack as IT evolved. There is little reason for me to keep a VMware guy on hand if I can trust Azure/Rackspace/whoever to fill that role. My business does not rely on VMware, it relies on the services IT can provide. I hate the thought of that eventually being someone in Accounts Payable who manages the IT budget but for SMB I think that will be the eventual outcome (from an infrastructure side, development will likely move closer to primary business roles - think Marketing people writing their own dashboards or Finance creating their own reporting).Might take another 100 years though.

If the regulatory side is okay, I would move your email over in a heartbeat.I'd also look to see how much more you could move to virtualized serers; if you can reduce the physical server count, that saves you the capital outlay plus the operating expenses of power, cooling and DC footprint.TR

I'm sure but at the same time even the Feds have heavy use of off the shelf software and standard protocols. Eventually market forces will win out. Even the Fed uses water/power/Emergency services from the public pool. I'm not saying plan on this stuff going away any time soon but don't lock yourself in assuming it will always be there.

From my experience the specifics of Cloud migration come down to three factors, corporate security policy, budget and user performance expatiations. As you’ve no doubt discovered in your search for an answer, the best solution involves considerable analysis on your part- and that’s a good thing. Few organizations have been happy with the “put everything in the cloud” approach. Your investment in planning is critical to successfully make what will probably be the single most complex and important change to your IT environment.One approach that works well is to deconstruct all assumptions about how to host IT services, especially those that have been long considered sacred. In your example, you mentioned moving your Exchange systems to the cloud. If you’re going to do that and accept the implied total dependence on your WAN link for even inter-office email, do you want to manage servers at all? Would a hosted Exchange platform be a better choice? Latency-tolerant storage is a no-brainer. Cloud storage is cheap and good.It will depend on your organization, but breaking long running services into their base features in a matrix will help. In the Exchange example it’s pretty simple: users connect via fat Outlook, mobile and OWA to Exchange in the sky. If those are your functional requirements then the specifics of the implementation are wide open and you can consider many more options than just pushing your Exchange infrastructure onto AWS/Rackspace hosts. If you have multiple services integrated into AD authentication providers linked to your Exchange, then those should be additional requirements in your matrix.Policy will also set some limits. Legal may, for whatever unfathomable reason they choose, throw up a wall of objections to some data being stored outside the premises. A cloud provider may have a perfectly acceptable solution, but your time investment to get sign-off may eclipse the actual technical migration. In that case you may elect to keep some systems on premises. The great news is that all major cloud providers provide extended network solutions to allow interoperability between on-site and cloud hosted systems.Which brings me to my final recommendation- monitoring. As we’ve seen several times in the last six months, cloud provider DevOps at AWS, Microsoft and others have killed customer environments. Worse they haven’t had timely answers when parts of those environments have been broken, and your management will demand the same level of infrastructure awareness as you have with on-site gear. “This is all the AWS dashboard tells me”, won’t be an answer that builds faith in your cloud migration project. Make sure you’ve implemented your own network and systems monitoring for all cloud systems just as you do today in your local hardware and apps. There is no substitute for blinking lights, reports and charts.It’s a great time for IT, Good luck! Patrick Hubbard, Head Geek, SolarWinds

I can see that apps need to be latency and probably bandwidth tolerant to ensure success. I may need to do some testing to see if users would be happy with something like gmail in a browser, as opposed to perhaps keeping outlook and going office 365. I've read that gmail via outlook is painful.Is there any acceptable cloud based equivalent of mapped drives and file shares though? Does google drive cut it, or would hosted sharepoint be more functional (and complex)?Other business apps I anticipate will be the trickiest. For the traditional n-tier app I may need to keep SQL close to the middle/business logic tier, but use a browser front end to that. I'm thinking a hosted VMs may be better there. AWS or Azure maybe. Or I just keep that in house on VMware. But then I'm back in the business of dealing with SANs and Netbackup which I'd dearly love to see the end of.

With 1000 users, you may find gmail and Google docs don't give you the manageability and features you expect. There's a reason Microsoft earns billions on Exchange/Outlook (Office)- it's pretty good. If your users have been on it for some time, especially if they use group collaboration features like the calendar, integrated AD for SharePoint, common access control using AD groups, meeting room assignment, they may not be happy with a move to Google services. Additionally, recent changes to Google office should make you consider the possibility they may make changes to the offering that put you in a bind down the road.The great news there is you can keep all your users on fat Office clients, and invisibly relocate your mail service to the cloud, either to a hosted Exchange provider where they do everything for you in a SaaS model and you pay per user, or you move your existing environment to the cloud. There are trade-offs to both. Latency as a user experience issue will continue to be more a factor of the speed of the back-end system interconnections, not the "last mile" between the Exchange Transport Role, or Mail Store service and users Outlook clients. In many cases you can actually get a performances boost on the back-end with cloud vs. older gear sitting in your data center. On the storage side, there's no way around noticeable dings to file share performance of cloud vs. a local NAS or SAN. Light only moves so fast, and routers are busy. Properly implemented however it may not be too bad, and there are some great solutions to make it easier. Proxies are available that connect your LAN to cloud storage, and allow you to present normal enough looking file shares just has you have today. Many also integrate with your directory services (AD or LDAP) allowing you to maintain RBAC even though the "share" lives on the cloud. For your n-tier you're already using virtualization, so it will come down how tightly connected they need to be. If most of your network traffic in the data center is inter-server (Ex: web based apps talking to databases from Apache/IIS), as long as you push the whole pile to the cloud, performance shouldn't suffer. The great thing about VMware is you can now find cloud providers who offer cloud VMware hosting, so you can transport VMs you already have.As for backup, that's one place you should absolutely consider cloud. Services like S3 and Glacier are great examples, and offer 500 mile DR, multi-site replication, business continuity and cost advantages. Basic S3 can look a lot like a remote file share and Glacier is 1/10th the price using tape backend. It's slow to read, but for backups if you just need to write the data daily and only recover in a rare emergency, it's good.One thing you will spend more on is your WAN connection. You'll need not just more bandwidth, but low-latency connections and traffic optimization. You may need to upgrade your edge and firewall hardware to ensure smooth service and look into CBQoS and other traffic policy tools. Of course NetFlow is also a must to make sure your critical cloud hosted apps aren't killed by YouTube traffic. Also, some ISPs may have shorter routes to your cloud provider.The great thing with cloud projects today is many other folks have done it- it’s no longer just being edge, thought leadership noise from vendors. Google is your friend, and there are some great "wow I learned about the cloud from that" blogs out there.

Segregate which functions can or should be performed by SaaS or genetic outsourced services, which can move to an IaaS cloud, and how difficult it would be to put those services into an outsourced VMware farm versus a more advanced and highly abstracted SOA infrastructure like AWS.Specit wrote:I can see that apps need to be latency and probably bandwidth tolerant to ensure success.

Thanks for all the tips everyone, basically what I've taken away is:1. A cautious and partial Cloud migration may be best.2. Focus on the Internet/WAN, latency, routing, etc. Stop YouTube from bringing down email. Stop a single huge email attachment from knocking out critical services.3. Plan for the *next* move, away from this Cloud provider to the next. I.e. in case of issues, a rapid move is best.4. Ensure the data ownership, regulatory issues are ok.5. Go cloud backup (I'm still uncertain who is in the market here though, and how this works). 6. Possibly keep the MS Fat clients that users are accustomed too. Which may mean Office 365. 7. Virtualise everything else. Consider a cloud VMware provider.8. Monitor everything in the cloud with the same (or more?) intensity that we do now for in house stuff.9. Contract management is key (but tricky with the big players who may be ambivalent to such a small customer. A financial penalty for non performance may just give us a refund of the very small part monthly fee). Did I miss anything?
