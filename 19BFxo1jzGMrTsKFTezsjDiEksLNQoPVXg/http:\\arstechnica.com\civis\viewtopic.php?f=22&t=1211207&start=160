              Weird. I think think that Windrunner is probably one of the best beginner heroes. Her animation is decent, she has a good escape spell, she has simple last hitting with powershot. I think she's actually one of the most scalable heroes.<br /><br />Drow has such an annoying animation, though, I can understand not liking her.

A *click*  This will only work if the creep is below half health.</div><br /><br />You mean just a regular right click?  I swear I have tried that on a friendly creep but it didn't let me so I try all those ctrl/shift/alt click combination...<br /><br />And.. I thought about Windrunner but her shackle seems to be hard to use (requires proper line up for maximum effect).  I guess I will try Lich and SK next.

              The problem with a lot of the ones mentioned as easy for a noob, is that they are often extremely squishy and slow. Drow can be powerful of course, but she's a mid hero first and foremost. Without that level buffer, she doesn't hold a lot of power over other heroes.<br /><br />Skeleton King and Tidehunter are sort of the exceptions out of those listed. They're both tough and won't die easily. Then again, they're both melee, so if you're not familiar with the controls, you may be better off starting with a ranged. I'm personally not all that comfortable on int heroes (aside from a couple of supports, like Warlock and Dazzle). Don't know why, but I've been pretty bad with them for a while now, despite my ability to play some carry agi heroes to much better effect.<br /><br />In the end, you might want to pick one of those noob heroes for the first few matches to get a handle on the game. After that, I recommend simply picking a few heroes you think are cool. I suggest having a pool, such as a couple str, a couple agi, and a couple int's, so that you have options. Once you have a few of each that you're semi-familiar with, take some time to really learn them. I personally can't stand lich, and I'm bad with drow and Windrunner (and don't particularly care to get better with them right now <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ) Just my 2 cents.

              i think lich is one of the easier ones to start with.. he's tanky (especially for int).. easy skills, decent animation.. <br />and very forgiving in terms of regen.. essentially unlimited mana.. build tranquil boots for health.  <br />i think for new players, one of the easiest pitfalls is constantly returning to fountain for health/mana.. lich is pretty strong in that area..<br /><br />his ult is devastating in low skill games... and in the right lineup in all skill ranges...<br /><br />lich + faceless, tide, puck, magnus etc.. very strong

Drow Ranger is really powerful once you get her passives levelled and some +agi items. Only keep Frost Arrows autocasting (you know you can autocast some spells by right-clicking them yeh?) when you're attacking heroes, and open with your silence ability. Pretty brutal damage.<br /><br />Otherwise it's probably worth trying a bunch of heroes in the Limited Pick game-type to see what makes sense to you. Viper is similar to Drow Ranger - simple with nasty damage late-game. Windrunner is a common suggestion, but I find her damage annoyingly low for an agi hero. Enchantress is good fun with a powerful heal over time and a surprisingly damaging ultimate. Zeus is a one-trick pony int hero (lightning bolt! lightning bolt!) whose ultimate gives you the hilarious ability to kill-steal heroes right across the map <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/big_grin.png" alt=":D" title="Big Green" />. Avoid stealth characters (bounty hunter, riki) like the plague IMO, they seem to be squishy and very difficult to use well.

              Sniper's another one. Passive that increases his range means he can attack from a relatively safe range. Aoe &quot;siege&quot; damage ability that also slows heroes. He's a powerful compliment to a group fight, until he steals all the kills. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/razz.png" alt=":p" title="Razz" /> Lots of long range damage, and easy to kill people with. If a good melee hero gets in close on him though, he's probably done for. If you think that's a possibility (for example, they have a Lifestealer that is doing pretty good, he will definitely haunt you later), then pick up an early-mid-game shadowblade. It'll pay off big when you can get a kill or two, then make a silent getaway when they try to focus you.<br /><br />Actually shadowblade is great on a lot of the heroes mentioned. Due to their extremely squishy nature, it can add an extra level of protection for you (if you make the money to pick it up in time) and an extra layer of frustration for the enemy.

              I think after a few practice sessions on Invoker you could do reasonably good. it's nice to have that little cheat sheet (the sideways question mark above the ability bar) makes it fairly easy to get a hang of at least a few of the skills.

AoE is something that's limited to a few important heroes and roles and generally speaking you won't find it often. More likely you'll find people with select chain-lightning style attacks, small AoE patches, penetrating line attacks, or large targeting areas that hit random targets within.<br /><br />With strong single target DPSers like Drow, the important thing is to always kill the support or carry in the back of the fight. Never attack the first guy in, because that's the one who's going to be the best at surviving your attack. If you kill off the nukers and disablers in the rear, you're going to quickly overrun the team fight because the enemy will lose their ability to keep pressure on you. It's quite possible to single target DPS down an entire team as Drow or Sniper, there's no need for AoE at all.<br /><br />Though if you're alone and you see more than two people coming (or one person and no other enemies on the minimap) then don't fight. RUN. Not fighting is just as important as fighting and as a solo carry you should never be diving a team unless you're specifically built for it.

If you can reliably pull off a 3-spell combo, you'll probably be better than most pub players at Invoker. Mind you, pretty much all his skills take good positioning and practice to use anyways (almost all of them are skillshots and/or delayed effects), so I'd recommend practicing in bot games a bit before matchmaking.

If you can reliably pull off a 3-spell combo, you'll probably be better than most pub players at Invoker. Mind you, pretty much all his skills take good positioning and practice to use anyways (almost all of them are skillshots and/or delayed effects), so I'd recommend practicing in bot games a bit before matchmaking.</div><br />I think the difficulty for me would be more about selecting the best spell for each situation from his repertoire on the fly, but it's a good challenge to have. I like the idea of having the flexibility to make it hard to predict how you'll act.

              There are two main types of Invoker players.  Gankers (Quas/Wex) and solo target destroyers (Exhort).  Gankers usually run the Tornado/EMP/Cold Snap exclusively.  Occasionally they'll throw out an Alacrity or two and use Ghost Walk to escape, but most of the time they're roaming lanes.  STDs (heh) mainly use the whirlwind staff (brain fart on name) into Sunstrike, Meatball, then Deafening Blast combo.  That usually drops any hero before they come out of the stun of the DB.  Then they use the Forge Spirits to farm/push lanes.<br /><br />I used to play a lot of Invoker, and the main issue I always had was remembering which spell was going to be cycled out when I could run two invocations. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/razz.png" alt=":p" title="Razz" />

              Thanks Kilgaine, I haven't seen it or don't believe I'm looking in the right place.  I went into my profile under &quot;My Guilds&quot; and all options were dithered out.  I'll be on tonight.  Also, when I clicked in the guild boxes nothing was there nor would come up.<br /><br />Finally got my second win.  Boy that took a long time!  I had to go back to Windrunner (Match ID 246836764).  I messed up a lot of mek charges.  They came in late during the team fights.  I have to work on that.  The SK on the team had a bad mouth, but if you could ignore that he was organizing people decently to get us the win.  I commended him in the end.  Most of my powershots were SPOT ON!  I messed a couple, but most of my kills came on fleeing heroes.  They usually take a bee line straight for their base.  That makes it easy to predict the arrow.<br /><br />Steeljaw

              Good games last night with WhiteGoblin and Andy FB. Sorry if I was a little sour in that first one. Been losing so many lately, and not close losses, but complete blowouts, where often everyone on the team is bad (including me). That first game we played was my first Abaddon in like 5 years. I feel like I did ok, despite some early deaths. But wouldn't you know it, I simply get crushed, and I normally see Abaddon (and his team) doing the crushing. I was paired with Slark. We had a few &quot;almost&quot; kills early that failed, so I'm sure that hurt us badly, but then again, Slark  just didn't seem like he knew how to play. Every time I shielded him he ran back behind the tower and avoided all damage, so it wasn't like we had a decent chance at ganking anyone. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/facepalm.gif" alt=":facepalm:" title="Facepalm" /><br /><br />And dat smoke... Haha...<br /><br />Second game made up for it though. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

If you're not a member when I log in next then I'll cancel your current invite &amp; send you another one.  <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Update:</span> See you're logged in but not part of the guild yet so I canceled the one issued yesterday &amp; sent you a new one.

My team won the first two games handily, and I thought &quot;Hey, I'm actually pretty good at this for a newbie! Teams communicate and coordinate! Awesome! Maybe I can just DOTA well...&quot;. Yeah... that bubble burst pretty quick <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/razz.png" alt=":p" title="Razz" /> Now I'm desperately trying to settle on a hero that I'm happy with, and trying not to get too upset about the games that end up 3v5 because 2 people AFK...

              ^^ I had a really weird match-up yesterday where the game matched five random pub players (myself included), none of whom had more than about 60 wins, against a five-man organised team where each member had over 200 wins. <br /><br />Probably fortunately, one person on the pub side failed to connect properly and we all got dropped out. Still, wtf?

              <span style="font-weight: bold">Holy Crap!</span> First match of the day and we just got roflstomped by a Meepo. I mean sure I was on a team that only spoke Spanish minus the ability to say &quot;fuck you&quot; in english but this Meepo... By the time I hit level 10 he was 20, by the time I was figuring out how bad the language barrier really was he was 25. Pudge on my team (obviously mid) couldn't keep a stable connection so kept dropping out then one of the other guys thought he was good enough to micro his character &amp; Pudge at the same time. Needless to say that was total feed failsauce, actually I don't even care about any of that, this meepo... off the charts. We were the only two in the game that had compendiums and he out played the shit out of everybody, I mean hands down he was the game. Their Spirit Breaker couldn't even keep up with this guy. ROFLMAO! <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/scared.gif" alt=":scared:" title="Scared" /> <br /><br />Okay, now to go research Meepo &amp; watch that replay as soon as it becomes available.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Update:</span> Daaaamn, I knew Meepo was considered one of, if not the hardest character to play in Dota but after reading some guides, watching some vids, and doing a basic reevaluation of him I'm pretty impressed by that player. The remapping of your keyboard alone just to play him is intense. I'd like to say &quot;oh yeah I'll pick meepo up, start pwning&quot; but there's a good deal of pro's even recommending to stay away from him unless you're extremely well skilled in micro with a huge APM. (actions per minute) My ability keeps slowing the older I get, I have to crank out coffee to even try to keep a glimpse of competitive APM in any title. Whew, this will be an uphill battle.   <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/big_grin.png" alt=":D" title="Big Green" />

              Was asked in game to share the sources I was referring to for Meepo. By all means I can't recommend picking him up unless you're going to be dedicated to hours of training in practice matches but sure, lets get some linkage going. Here's his <a href="http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Meepo" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Dota Wiki</a> page where you can read about his basic skills &amp; story. Here's the DotaBuff ranking by games played page showing him as the <a href="http://dotabuff.com/heroes/played" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">third to last</a> character in all of dota. Likewise here's his actual stat page showing his <a href="http://dotabuff.com/heroes/meepo" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">44.04% win rate</a> appearing in roughly only 4% of all matches played. Off DotaFire here's <a href="http://www.dotafire.com/dota-2/guide/an-in-depth-guide-to-meepo-meepo-meepo-meepo-and-meepo-5298" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">an amazing guide</a> covering most aspects of Meepo play. Off that guide you can find youtube videos like this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOupXlnITs" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Blink Poof Tutorial</a> &amp; one of Wagamama playing him going <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxnKhVDh7Kc" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">43/3/6</a>. (it's a cut eight min video with music cranked over it, heads up) Just a note before asking, <a href="http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Wagamama" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Wagamama</a> is a professional who started in 2004 &amp; is currently the captain of QPAD Red Pandas. (a team based in Sweden) Not enough high level action for you? Here's another cut eight minute video, this time of <a href="http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dendi" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Dendi</a> from Natus Vincere (Na`Vi) going <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFlH_EJgefU" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">33/2/6</a> as Meepo.<br /><br />God damn what a monster! While my skill level is sooo far off from proper Meepo play I have gained a lot of respect all a sudden for the few I've came across. I have also earned a proper fear of coming across another. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/big_grin.png" alt=":D" title="Big Green" />

              Had a great game as Lich, despite a terrible team and an eventual loss. His ultimate absolutely wrecks team fights, and ended up turning a 3v1 gank around into a triple kill <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/big_grin.png" alt=":D" title="Big Green" /> good times. Completely destroyed by a sniper who managed to get 6 levels on me tho (and I was the highest in the team due to sitting in bottom lane by myself - did I mention my team was horrible?).

              Spent the last day trying to learn Meepo.. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:" title="Rolleyes" /> <br /><br />The micro required for farming multiple camps at once isn't really that hard. It's that damn Blink Poof combo that is going to be the death of me. I don't know how long I can sit in lobby matches trying to get my twitch memory down for correct execution. Have remapped my controls a few times trying to make it easier which does nothing but force me to rememorize everything else again. Done properly; <span style="font-style: italic">Control Group 2, Poof Activation, Left Click Area, Control Tab Group, Poof Activation, Left Click Area, Control Tab Group, Poof Activation, Left Click Area, Control Tab Group, Poof Activation, Left Click Area, Control Group 1, Blink Activation, Left Click Target, Earthbind Activation, Left Click Target, Poof Activation, Left Click Target, Hold Control, Right Click Target, Release Control</span>. Or alternately if you've got better keyboard skills then me then you can bypass Control Group 1-2 swapping to a single group with all five Meepo's counting your clicks / using twitch memory as you roll down through them automatically flipping to blink when you Control Tab Group back from your last to your first. Given it only channels for 1.5 seconds I'm still at the spam &quot;Poof Activation, Left Click Area, Control Tab Group&quot; phase of learning so the additional Control Group helps me not miss my Blink on my primary Meepo by also making him Poof.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure I need to change my keys around yet another time to make it easier on my left hand. What a nightmare, for me that's currently; <span style="font-style: italic">Spacebar, 2, Mouse 1, Tab, 2, Mouse 1, Tab, 2, Mouse 1, Tab, 2, Mouse 1, Mouse 4, W, Mouse 1, 1, Mouse 1, 2, Mouse 1, Hold Left Control, Mouse 2, Release Left Control</span>. Sooo 21 actions not counting release needed in the span of about two seconds. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/scared.gif" alt=":scared:" title="Scared" /> Don't get me wrong, when I get it right, it's beautiful, one of the the sweetest things I've seen in dota. Though the other 90% of the time it's just /facepalm sadness &amp; embarrassment of epic proportion. It's madness I say! Madness!! Most the time I'm fumbling my keyboard like I've had three 10.5% forties spiced up with red bulls for that extra heart stopping power. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/mad.png" alt=":mad:" title="Mad" />

              Meepo is a blast.  What I do is set up control groups.  Group 1 is all Meepos.  Group 2 is main Meepo only.  Group 3 is clone Meepos.  I send the clones into the jungle while I'm run around with main Meepo until I need them.  When I need the other ones, I switch to control group 1 (all Meepos) and then spam tab+Q+click to poof them all to wherever I need them.  If I need to have one run away I just click select them, as there's no way I'm going to remember to set individual control groups for each of them.

              Yeah that's exactly what I've been doing, it's getting the blink combo off perfectly while in the heat of battle that is the difficult part. I mean lets be clear, swapping groups to poof spam is really easy, it's the added complexity of the 1.5 second timing to get back to your main then target a blink, net, &amp; issue a group aggro target that is the hard part. It's neat to see the pro's drop a net on their next target after the blink because they already know the current target is dead half a second later from the previously queued poofs. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/big_grin.png" alt=":D" title="Big Green" /> <br /><br />On a side note, I found N0tail's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBU6cFeDqwA" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Meepo Guide</a> earlier after watching him play him as a surprise last pick in a tournament today. Even the announcer (TobiWan) was going nuts over it! It's not the most helpful guide but it's a nice intro to him for sure. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Update:</span> As asked to provide over steam chat, here's the match: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnOnVbKPFS8" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">The Defense 3 - Fnatic EU vs Baguette</a>.

              Had three games with OwenT last night.<br />First I played as Alchemist and OwenT played Dazzle.<br />We encountered the annoyingness that is Lion, in all his mana sapping glory.<br />He basically shut us down very early on, and then had a farm and level lead on us. <br />Game never got better <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/sad.png" alt=":(" title="Frown" /><br /><br />Game 2: I played Tide and OwenT played Earthshaker. We were in the top lane (dire) against Spirit breaker and some archer that isnt windrunner or drow (?).<br />We actually played pretty decently, but our mid DC'd. It was Drow for us vs Sniper. Sniper then had free farm and started with teh Ganks. Then not too long after someone AFK'd for the rest of the match.<br /><br />Game 3: Three's a charm! I played Alch and OwenT Earthshaker. We were Dire in bot lane. Up against Ursa and Razor. Went really well, between the earthshaker stuns and Alch's conconctions we got a few ganks and controlled that lane. I think the game slightly evened out towards the mid game, but then we pushed on and won. Really fun match to top the night off!

              Wow, what a mixed bag. One game I went in as Drow and pretty much carried the team. Got to 25 and took down all the mid towers and solod the base with creeps. We had one DC and one Lich off farming in the forest the whole time - everyone else was just farming items I think. First time I've gotten an uber item - Satanic is fun!<br /><br />Next game I was on the back foot the whole time due to aggressive laners and an idiot lane partner who refused to coordinate at all. It seemed like we were getting pushed back into our base constantly, and the game ended will all 5 of the enemy team in our base.... and our creeps killing their Ancient. Totally did NOT see that coming, and really have no idea how that happened. <br /><br />Last game we had 2 mates shit talking the whole time (who were terrible, even though playing together in a lane), blaming the team when they died etc etc. One called Aids  <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:" title="Rolleyes" />  Needless to say we got crushed due to lack of team coordination. <br /><br />Ahh well, 2/3 works <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
