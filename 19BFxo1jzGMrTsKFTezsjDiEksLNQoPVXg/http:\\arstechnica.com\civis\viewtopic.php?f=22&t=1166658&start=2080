              His nova only has 4 levels... But still, I've never had a hard time laning against a lich. I think he may have an advantage against a couple of heroes in the very early game. And if you pressure him even a little he breaks. His nova is practically useless against a str with a stun. And I still maintain that his ult is very weak unless you're up against idiots or have initiation, preferably more than one area stun. Even then, it's luck if there is even 1 or two creeps around. At the very least they should make the bounces smarter.

              I ended up pulling an old Windows box out of the closet and it runs Dota better than my MacBook Air does.  So I bought the invite pack on Steam.<br /><br />Wow, there is a whole lot going on in this game.  I can tell it's going to take awhile to even figure out what I'm supposed to be doing at any given time.

              I was also hoping they would port it to Linux as well. I have a laptop that it goes pretty slowly on in Windows, but I thought things might move at least a little more smoothly on the Ubuntu install I was trying on there.<br /><br />It would make sense for Valve to port all of their specifically owned games to work on Mac OS and Linux. Hopefully it won't take them too long. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />And on Lich, yeah, I may be overreacting a bit, he's a useful hero, but I still think he is probably one of the weakest heroes in the game. As a support? His only ability that favors allies is his frost armor, which usually isn't taken until much later in the game, often when the victory is already decided one way or the other. I just feel like sacrifice and frost armor are especially weak given other comparable skills (or given comparable support heroes with more powerful abilities in those slots). For example, Keeper of the Light. His wave has at least as much functionality as the nova (in different ways) so that's a pretty fair trade either way, but his chakra? Way better, as it's useful on any hero. Mana leak of course, isn't really comparable other than being an extremely useful skill, where frost armor is simply an afterthought that can be beneficial.<br /><br />Then there's death prophet, with a wave that has its ups and downs to the nova. Fair enough trade. Her silence is extremely powerful and useful to the team and herself. Neither of lich's other abilities really stack up to that one. Her passive speed/mana ability is questionable, but still very useful.<br /><br />I'm just having a hard time thinking of any other hero with two abilities that really aren't that great. Sacrifice is useful at allowing lich to keep his nova on cooldown, but it just makes his actions more predictable. The only benefit is mana, and it only benefits lich. The deny is decent, but considering how bad his attack animation is, you're banking on that to help you keep your lane from pushing too hard. Paired up with someone else, the deny can help for sure, but it's questionable depending on the kind of pressure you're up against, and only useful for very early game. If you're alone or you and your ally are getting harassed hard, the sacrifice just leaves you more vulnerable.

              Lina is another one of those int heroes I'm just absolutely terrible with, but I recognize that she's strong. It's not even that I'm bad with her abilities. It just seems like I never get the breaks the Linas I go up against get. I can get some good stuns or dragon slaves (wave ability?) and *almost* kill people all the time. Plus, I totally agree, she feels extremely squishy, just dies so easily. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/sad.png" alt=":(" title="Frown" /><br /><br />I think the last time I played her I did good, helped the team quite a bit, but I died in almost every engagement, so despite doing ok, I still did horrible.  <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/mad.png" alt=":mad:" title="Mad" /><br /><br />Yeah but K0DE, they haven't ported HL2 yet have they? Have they even put that on Mac OS? I know they did Portal 1 to Mac OS... It'd be nice to have a couple more of their fps'es aside from HL1. Maybe they're having some kind of issue with the graphics? Newer graphics might be an issue on Linux, because it's not DirectX, it's OpenGL? Or is my knowledge on this subject like 10 years old?  <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/redface.png" alt=":o" title="Red Face" />

They need to optimize the graphics in general, and it makes sense to do the porting when they do that.<br /><br />Not sure about Dota 2, but the Source engine does support OpenGL (they did that work when they ported L4D2), and in fact it will quite likely run faster on Linux. They'll probably still need to do a bit of work, though. It's likely they'll port Dota 2 before HL2, since Dota 2 has vastly more players at the moment (*vastly*), and it'll open up a new target segment for them. I'm betting that'll come around full-open release. Just a guess. Could come sooner, maybe thats what they've been busy with instead of adding new heroes/content.

Manta will destroy the illusions when you activate it a second time, but if you had 2 Manta's, using the second one (after a refresh) would not dispel the illusions from the first. It was a semi-viable (if cheesy) build on Tinker, thanks to his built-in re-arm.<br /><br />Unless they changed it, though, that doesn't work in Dota 2. Doesn't matter which Manta you activate, the old illusions from it will be dispelled.

              No technical reason not to port it to Linux, it's all Source so really porting one *is* porting the other, at least 95% of the way.<br /><br />They could also use DirectX via WINE but I think Valve has said they don't want to go the WINE route. Which is fine with me.

              In my opinion though, he's fairly strong early too. Definitely not a huge factor until a little later, but he can hold his own. And at least for me, his base damage and animation feel good enough that it's easy to get last hits even without a quelling blade. I can't say the same for other melee agi heroes. Jugg for example seems to have low base damage. Either that or I'm just terrible at last hitting with him.

Your team was supposed to feed you kills, towers, creeps, everything and just hold off the other team for 45 minutes, and then you come out and just 1v5 them. That meta doesn't really exist at all anymore, which is why I think we haven't seen her shine since her release in 2.

Once her abilities start maxing out she will print gold if allowed. With a Linken's Sphere, a Manta Style and a Butterfly she will take down almost anything without taking much of a scratch, but getting there is the hard part.<br /><br />You probably haven't noticed her being great becasue she probably doesn't get all the killing blows, just all the assists.

              Medusa is definitely item-dependent, but she can be strong in the lane early as well. If you're smart with the snake, you can get some good damage/mana burn on their heroes early and stunt them a bit. It's a little random of course, but if you know how many hops you have on the level snake you're using, you can get it to hurt them pretty bad, and pay you back most of your mana too. And 1 early point in split shot can help you farm once you get an item or two to beef you up a bit. The last couple of times I played her I used Dota2alttab.com, and their advice says to not even bother with split shot until basically everything else is maxed out. That's probably fine, but a single level earlier on makes more sense. I found myself alone in lane at points where I could have been getting some good aoe on the lane creeps and dropping them a lot more effectively if I had that split shot. Basically ranged cleave on an item-dependent hero? You're gonna want at least a little of that early on. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Just my opinion, but it works.<br /><br />I've been successful with her more often than not. Fun hero to play too, with the tankiness. I used to build crit on her back in the day. And even stuff like soul booster. I was a noob, but it still helped a bit. Last time I had linken's, butterfly, manta, and I think some other speed/damage, but I think a crystalys could be useful early on. It's a cheap damage item, and with all the stat items she uses, her attack speed will be pretty high. Of course, considering she requires several high cost items, I'm not sure there's money/time to sink into something like a crystalys that doesn't give her any stats.<br /><br />E: Also wanted to mention, I've been pretty busy, trying to study for an exam, but hopefully I'll get more than 1 or two games in this week! Once I finish this exam maybe I'll have some more time to play too. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

              That's probably true. I suppose situationally it would be more useful. If you had a few minutes to farm a lane alone for example, or if you had some mid creep you could hit while your lane is pushed out. Could come in handy. Late game of course, last hits are less important, and that aoe helps a bunch more. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Just had perhaps one of my most amazing game I've ever played! Random draft, second of the night where phantom lancer was an option. First game of the night I picked him first before anyone could, and tore the other team up. Last game of the night, I was last pick. No one else picked him, but it wasn't so easy...<br /><br />Top was getting beaten up. We didn't have a great mid (Lina, but she wasn't confident, too squishy against Leshrac). After I died needlessly, I suggested Lina and I swap. Went mid to fight Lesh. He already had two levels on me, and was doing ok at harassing me, but I hung in there. Team was getting demoralized. Our Dazzle was getting shredded by spider, and Medusa wasn't doing anything to help him. I was listening to music and could barely hear my teammates. Maybe that was a good thing, because it was mostly frustration coming across voice chat. I kept just telling everyone we needed to survive. The enemy team started pushing our base hard. I kept telling everyone they were desperate. They were scared, and they had good reason. If we held out we would win!<br /><br />I think I was convincing. The negativity stopped. People started defending. We lost top during a hard split push to mid and top. Managed to hold mid. We kept holding. And kept holding. I built one heart, and then two. I kept defending. Now spider was complaining. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/big_grin.png" alt=":D" title="Big Green" /> &quot;Just end this boring game!&quot; I responded, &quot;If you can't beat PL, just leave.&quot; The challenge made him stay.<br /><br />I kept defending, but with a nature's prophet and spider trying to backdoor, I couldn't push. Earthshaker dazzle and lina weren't strong enough to hold them off alone. We lost bot. I almost lost hope...<br /><br />Then I noticed Medusa crushed their mid. Yep, she was getting strong. Really strong. She started pushing on her own, destroying them. She got a triple kill! I got my butterfly, and made sure no one sneaked in on our base. I even pushed top and bottom tier 2 towers with just my images.<br /><br />Finally, we took a chance and pushed bottom. They were only missing their mid racks, and it took some time, but the gamble paid off. We pushed all the way, killed one of them and took out the racks. We were pushing their ancient while nature's prophet went for our ancient as well. It was a race against time. They bought back and finished off most of us, including me. I yelled &quot;Noooo!!!&quot; and then their ancient fell.<br /><br />Wow, what a game. I really didn't think we would win for at least 75% of the game. I had hope though.  <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/cool.png" alt=":cool:" title="Cool" />  Even at the very end, I wasn't sure if we won or if they did. What an amazing game!<br /><br />Here's the Dotabuff stats. Just over an hour, so it wasn't THAT long, but it felt long. In a good way. It was epic. <a href="http://dotabuff.com/matches/158775365" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">http://dotabuff.com/matches/158775365</a><br /><br /><div style="padding: 3px;">

              Oh, and <a href="http://dotabuff.com/matches/149535813" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">had my longest game ever</a> this week. We were getting beat down early. I mean, really beat down, I think we were down 13-27 at one point but DAMN Kunuka can push if he gets a lot of gear. Ended up split pushing a couple of times, they could not handle it. Even that late in the game I was wiping out a wave of creeps with a single blow. <br /><br />Made up for some serious failboat ults early. Ugh.

He's great at roaming and ganking, but in teamfights all he offers is a good leash skill and then you've got to ult away, lest you be burned down in a matter of seconds.

              I was thinking the same thing K0DE. That makes pipe a pretty serious counter to Doom though, so I can understand why they wouldn't want that I think. I'm sure there are other items that can counter heroes, but probably not so completely as that one could have. I would assume magic resist still helps, as it's not a complete counter, could be wrong though.<br /><br />And yay bristleback! He can be a ton of fun.  <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/big_grin_classic.png" alt=":bigdumbgrin:" title="Big Grin" /> <br /><br />Yeah slark is pretty awesome once you get the leaps down correctly. He has low base autoattack though, and if you get focused he goes down quick. He's not really good as the only carry for a team, but he's a great secondary. Doesn't really need any health regen whatsoever, since once he hits 6 he can just hide and heal up almost immediately. Plus he can move around so quick when out of enemy vision. Very fun to play.

              I've got a Steam friend (Neil Patrick Harris) who's a great Slark. Works well since I prefer support.<br /><br />With me on Dazzle or CM he owns some face.<br /><br />He's one of the few heroes I've *never* played.

              One thing I've noticed is that his leap is great at helping you escape as well as ambush someone, but just make sure you're not crowded around enemy creeps, or it could backfire and diminish the range you leap. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/big_grin.png" alt=":D" title="Big Green" />
