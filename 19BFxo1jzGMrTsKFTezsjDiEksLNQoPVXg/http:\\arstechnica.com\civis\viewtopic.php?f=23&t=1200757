Seems like it's getting progressively worse.Videos stop buffering all the time; requiring almost constant fiddling to restart the buffering. With part of the video buffered, clicking back several seconds causes it to RE-buffer the portion you just watched 5 seconds ago; god help you if that fails, too...It's gotten to the point where youtube videos are the least reliable of all content online. Anyone else experience this?

welcome to how youtube have changed their content deliveryyoure not the only one with buffering, resets, slow performance and moreone potential work around has been to use the mobile / XL sites - http://www.youtube.com/xl which seem to deliver their content differently.

It's weird. I figured it was my ISP being the problem. Popular music videos load 30 seconds at a time until it stops to buffer. Though I just watched a full replay of a final four game in 720p with no problems. Youtube also seems to load more when you mouse over the frame or the window is the active one, no background loading. It is sad.

My old ISP used to throttle YouTube in the evenings. You could have 15 videos playing at once at 6.59, but come 7pm it was buffering city. By 10pm it would be completely clear again. They are no longer my ISP.

Clearing cookies does seem to work for a lot of people. Alternatively you can try opting into their HTML5. Seems to also work for some people.

clearing cookies is also... sub otpimal .. as a solution when it comes to mobile devices.I work at an ISP, believe me we've been driven mildly insane by this apparent 'slowness', as of course it cant be the computer, it has to be the broadband.... No, really, you have 3 laptops 2 phones and an ipad all pulling data down, bbc news and bbc iplayer brings up programs in under a second, youre currently watching a show via netflix, ONLY youtube buffers for 30sec.obviously its the broadband...

The HTML5 setting helped about 25%. Still tons of "stuck video". Very freaking annoying.Might have to try the XL route.

Another option in a lot of cases is to use a VPN to bypass whatever the problem is (ISP or CDN).

I've had a lot of stuttering and it'll even switch the video quality on the fly to the lowest and still not buffer properly. Seems to happen on some days and not others.

So TWC is throttling YouTube’s CDN? That’s not cool.Edit: a couple of posts in this thread on Reddit suggest that it’s probably unbalanced/overloaded CDN servers and not some conspiracy by ISPs to throttle Youtube.

At this point, if a video is more than 5 minutes long, I just won't even try, because I don't want to be clicking back/forward a few seconds every 15-30 seconds, and then having to wait 5+ seconds to see if it's gonna start buffering again.

I tried the blocking method, cookies, and HTML5 fix for my wife's PC. No luck.I tried HTML5 and cookies on my Mac. No Luck.TWC 50/5 service. Shameful that YouTube/Google has switched to such a poor solutions. Months without a fix.

This could easily break stuff that has nothing to do with YouTube and if so, when you come across that broken thing in, say, six months time, are you going to remember that you blocked all those addresses? Probably not. More likely, you won't be able to fix the problem and will end up blaming the service.In other words, this is rather like dropping a nuke on a city in order to swat a fly.

Months without a fix.While I agree that they need to fix it, keep in mind that YouTube has massive bandwidth requirements (between CDN servers as well as to the users), so fixing a bottleneck is not as easy as just turning on more servers. I feel like a lot of the problems are probably caused by CDN nodes put on an ISPs network to help minimize bandwidth over the peered lines, and those are almost certainly more difficult to upgrade than something entirely under Google's control.

Just coming in here to say I see this problem all the time on TWC and glad to see we're not the only ones, but TWC does not throttle. I've seen guides like what were posted above insinuate that, but they don't. Now, it is pretty ridiculous Google allows YouTube to be so crappy, especially with aspirations of serving more premium content and channels.

Even something as simple as letting your ISP have a preferred CDN node but it not having the capacity for the load would kill your performance without any direct malicious intent. Try a VPN and see if that fixes things.

YouTube has often been a big problem for me over the years too. Different geographies, computers, equipment setups, providers - it's been consistently inconsistent for me, even with low/decent latency and triple digit bandwidth capabilities. Pretty annoying, but hey it's free I guess. In contrast, the CDN I use for one of my companies has been essentially flawless over this time.

Up until yesterday I'd never had a problem with Youtube. Now I have to let even shitty, low quality videos buffer for 5 minutes before attempting to watch them. You'd think with 25/25 FIOS that a <500kb video stream wouldn't be a problem.

(The outlines show up and still highlight when moused-over, but there is no content in them). (It also fixed my perpetual buffering issues as well)

Holy shit. Youtube has been a steadily-worsening experience for at least the past year, but setting my firewall to reject traffic from those two netblocks *instantly* cleared things up...at least, so far. The real test will be this evening, when it's usually the worst.edited to add - Nope, spoke too soon. This evening, things are back to pretty much standard: gotta dial most videos down to 360p or 240p for them to play without sucking. Can't get youtube to stream at more than 50-70kbps. If I shift-refresh enough I can sometimes randomly find a quick node that'll stream fast enough to get me 1080p, but for 90% of the vids I'm poking at this evening it's business as usual.

Youtube is unusable for me. I've tried the fixes, they just don't work. I can stream videos from several sites at once but I struggle to get some Youtube videos to work. Between that and the new ad system I just consider it about as worthless as Myspace.

I'm on FiOS Quantum, Youtube in prime time is nearly useless...unless I VPN somewhere. If that's not proof the problem is due to peering dispute I dunno what is.

FIOS here as well. I don't know if it is related to the new iOS YouTube app, but it is behaving considerably worse for me today than usual. Some videos just flat out refuse to load for me today.

It's on a video by video basis for me, some work fine, some are unwatchable. This is on 100/100. Funny thing is if I use youtube-dl to actually download videos I get 8-10 MB/sec on the download, so that's my workaround, download the entire video and watch using MPC.
