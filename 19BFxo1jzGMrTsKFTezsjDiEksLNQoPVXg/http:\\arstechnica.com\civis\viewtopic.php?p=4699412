I've been fighting with this since Middle School. What and Why is the uncertainty principal in quantum physics?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principleFrom what I've gathered over the years, it is due to the difficulties in combining the math for particles with the math for waves - one must either look at the item of study as a wave, or collapse the wave-form in order to treat the object as a particle; limiting the scope of the equation to the strongest signal area (the 'standing wave') at the expense of all the outlying points otherwise covered by the wave function.Wave-particles are not waves or particles, but can exhibit the properties of each depending on the situation at hand. The equations we have to predict the behavior of each (as verified in lab experiments) are extremely good at what they do.But neither set works to completely predict a wave-particle at all times, and the problem is compounded by the fact that figuring out the data for one set makes us less uncertain about the other, due to the localization property of Fourier transforms."the more concentrated f(t) is, the more spread out F(w) is. In particular, if we "squeeze" a function in t, it spreads out in w and vise-versa; and we cannot arbitrarily concentrate both the function and its Fourier transform."http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform#Localization_propertySo what this means is (in high school physics terms) that we can know only two of the three at any given time: position, direction, and velocity. What this also means is that the more accurately you measure the two known items, the less accurate any information about the third will be.I understand all that on a book-learnin' level, but it all feels like wood to me, instead of marble (in Einstein's terminology). It doesn't feel smooth. Since wave-particles are not waves nor particles, why do we limit ourselves to wave math and particle math, and the uncertainty that exists between the two? Might there be an as-of-yet undiscovered math that describes wave-particle behavior perfectly? And if some new Newton were to come along and invent that math as Newton invented calculus, would the localization property no longer apply, and would the Heisenberg Uncertainty principal fall by the wayside?Or am I missing something key about the whole concept, and Heisenberg's principal is not one rooted in math, but in nature itself? Is the principal actually suggesting that until a particle is "measured" by interaction with something else, that its waveform is not determined? That prior to a particle striking a photo sheet, no 'particle' even really exists?NOTE: I am not the bestest at math, which may very well be where my problem lies. any explanations that tend toward English will be more understandable - the more formulas, the more lost I will become - I have no degree in physics, and thus much of the basic formula functions are not in my vocabulary. Pop-sci books, Feynman's Lectures and books, and wikipedia are my level of Physics knowledge. Thanks!

One way to visualize it is to think of the particle you want to observe as a croquet ball in motion, and the only way you can "observe" the ball is to whack it with your croquet mallet. Your very observation changes what you see.Perhaps now is a good time to post the link to the What the bleep video that talks about this same thing. Entertaining, informative, and more than a little bit creepy.

Isn't that the observer effect, a different issue?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect

TO add to this, I have a question: In the Schrodenger's cat example, after the allotted time, and you don't know if the cat is dead or alive, are we supposed to believe that the cat REALLY IS in a superimposed state of being both? Or is that just a macro example of a quantum phenomenon, and the cat really is eoither alive or dead? I think the latter, but always wanted it verifies by someone smarter than me on the topic, whcih is anybody zeotherm

I'm not really sure about this... I recall Wikipedia's article on it to be quite good, but I can see if I can find something better at a later time (at work now).As for Schrodenger's cat, I recall it was originally supposed to illustrate the absurdity of quantum mechanics. There is no way a cat can be both alive and dead. Over the decades it has evolved to illustrate that an object (the cat in this case) DOES (not can, but does) exist in a superposition of states until it is measured, then one single value will be seen (e.g. alive/dead). Of course, this goofiness is keep in the realm of the very small due to Planck's constant being tiny.EDIT: This derivation illustrates that there is nothing inherently special about Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, as ANY two (Hermitian) operators can be shown to follow that relationship due to the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality.

Imagine that you want to measure the frequency of photon at a certain time or point.Frequency is a function of amplitude over time. To measure the frequency accurately you will need to measure it over a certain time, which is likely to mean a certain displacement as well. So you can get a more accurate frequency but the position and time is now more inaccurate.

In quantum physics, there is no such thing as a passive observer. Observation occurs by way of interaction. Interaction disturbs the state of what is observed.

zeotherm: The section of the wiki article you linked had some stuff I didn't understand. I clicked on Hermitian , and adjoint. the former then necessitated that I click on conjugate transpose, which then required further reading on complex conjugate. The latter made we look towards Hilbert space, which made me go read about Transposing in matrix math. And that was only from reading the intro paragraph of each article!!Any chance there is a way to explain that, or should I just buckle down and try and digest it all before I attempt to make any more progress on the OP?

Of course, this goofiness is keep in the realm of the very small due to Planck's constant being tiny. A cat is not a quantum object; you can't have a superposition of states with non-quantum objects. At least, that's been my take on it. The myriad of interactions going on within the at any given time makes quantum-level analysis meaningless, I'd think. Though, I could be quite wrong on this.Besides, just try to shove a cat in a box and not get measurements of its existence!

quote:Originally posted by Feshy:A cat is not a quantum object; you can't have a superposition of states with non-quantum objects. At least, that's been my take on it. Yeah, and as I understand/recall it that was the point of the experiment. My subsequent explanation was a bit murky, as it assumed a quantum cat. As you reach a certain size/number of atoms(or particles, or objects, etc..)/energy level the statistics of QM converge on certainty and classical mechanics takes over (is recovered (?)). (As an aside, this is why Bose-Einstein condensates are interesting, they represent a macroscopic entity that acts as a quantum one)While it is statistically possible for you to go and walk into a solid wall and completely tunnel your way to the other side, the realistic chances of it ever happening are 0. Yes, the true probability is non-zero, but it is so close it becomes one of those "it'll take 10 times the lifetime of the universe for it happen once" events. This was what I was referring to when I said this "goofiness" (referring to the odd effects of the quantum world) disappear in macroscopic objects because h-bar (planck's constant/2 pi) is so small. If it were a larger value, then we would experience quantum effects on larger objects, if it was big enough we'd see these effects on macroscopic objects and then the world would really be screwy. But this is getting too far off topic... EDIT: Apparently I discussed the later in another thread, and got it confused with this one... My bad. I'll leave my comments, but lets try to keep this focused on the OP's questions and not my accidental derailing sckmcck

Well, that's simple enough. Do others agree that this is a worthwhile summation? Not really. This goes back to which interpretation of QM you subscribe to. Fate's description is known as the hidden variable interpretation. Even though we can't measure the position and moment at the same time, the particle still has a well defined position and momentum.Most physicists will agree that this is incorrect. It's not we can't measure with accuracy. It's that the particle itself does not have a well defined momentum or position. The particle itself doesn't know. A free space electron, such as the one coming out of my electron gun, is known as a wave packet. It is actually comprised of a summation of waves of many possible momenta. It's not that we can't measure with 100% accuracy both the position and momentum. Rather, although the electron is still zero size, it is delocalized, and exists in a region of space with certain probability. (this should not be confused with string theory, where particles are of nonzero size.)

Even though we can't measure the position and moment at the same time, the particle still has a well defined position and momentum.Most physicists will agree that this is incorrect. Yes. To elaborate on this a little, a particle can be in a well-defined, or pure state, yet still not have a well defined position and/or momentum.As an optics guy, I always resort to photons to explain things. Photons have a polarization, which is just the direction the electric field oscillates. I can have a vertically polarized photon, which is an exactly known state. If I put it through a vertical polarizer (A device which only lets through vertical polarization), it will go through 100% of the time -- I know the state exactly. If I put it through a horizontal polarizer, it will be blocked 100% of the time. I can also have a horizontally polarized photon, which is likewise well defined, and is transmitted/blocked by the horizontal/vertical polarizer.The trick is, I can also have a diagonally polarized photon. This is yet another pure, completely known state, it is just rotated 45 degrees. I can use a diagonal polarizer, and it goes through, again, 100% of the time. The trick is, now if I measure this photon with a horizontal or vertical polarizer, I will get either answer (blocked or transmitted) with 50% probability.It isn't that I lacked knowledge of how horizontal or vertical my photon was -- it simply was in a state that wasn't well defined as horizontal or vertical. This happens because 'horizontalness' and 'diagonalness' are what we refer to in a technical sense as 'non-commuting observables.' In more plain language, that means that they can't both be well defined for a photon.A small minority of physicists try to hold on to the notion that my diagonally polarized photon 'internally knew' whether it was going to be vertical or horizontal -- a local hidden variable theory. However, these theories have been almost (but perhaps not quote) conclusively disproven by Bell inequality tests.

What this also means is that the more accurately you measure the two known items, the less accurate any information about the third will be. Just a small correction: Direction is a factor of velocity. Velocity = speed x direction. No, you can't multiply the two. They are a vector, intrinsically tied together in physics. There's only two factors related to The Uncertainty Principle (although these two factors affect a bajillion others).quote:Or am I missing something key about the whole concept, and Heisenberg's principal is not one rooted in math, but in nature itself? Is the principal actually suggesting that until a particle is "measured" by interaction with something else, that its waveform is not determined? That prior to a particle striking a photo sheet, no 'particle' even really exists? Your brain is trying to create a distinction between mathematics and reality. In physics, the math is a model of the reality. If we can perform a mathematical function on a model, then we can see what happens if we do the same thing in reality.The difference between the model and the reality is this: We cannot have any concrete information about any period of time in which we did not perform a measurement. Therefore, as far as our mathematical model is concerned, anything could have happened during those times. We cannot make any statements about what happened, therefore the stuff that happened would not exist in a standard, engineering-style mathematical model. This isn't very useful though, so what they do in quantum physics is create a list of everything that could have happened. This allows you (with no small amount of difficulty) to determine all kinds of things about the events that you examined.Unfortunately this means that, when looking at the list of things that could have happened, from a purely scientific viewpoint, you cannot say that any one or all of the possible events happened. The only way to look at it is that they were all potentially happening, so for all intents and purposes, Schrodinger's cat must be treated as being both alive and dead at the same time. You simply don't know until you perform a measurement. i.e. Open the box.Philosophically, this probably isn't how it is in nature. It's just the only way that quantum events can be treated in order to gain any significant results from studying them. Therefore from a scientific viewpoint, anything and everything happens all the time. There may be some kind of Newtonian-style system of rules governing every quantum event that happens, or we may be living in a hodgepodge of random, undecided events, defined entirely by our perception. But it will never be possible to prove this either way. Hence the long list of people who've had their brains fucked by quantum physics. Once you get over these hurdles, and simply realise that you can still glean information from your list of possible events, it gets a lot easier to deal with.That's my understanding, someone with more knowledge is welcome to critique it.

quote:There's only two factors related to The Uncertainty Principle (although these two factors affect a bajillion others). Just to make sure we're perfectly clear here, the uncertainty principle holds for any two observables (like position and momentum) whose operators don't commute. In other words, if the two don't have a common basis of eigenstates, then you'll have an uncertainty relationship.In the real world, measuring one variable collapses the wavefunction into a well-defined state (say momentum). This has the consequence of making any other observable with which momentum does not commute be ill-defined (like position). It drops out quite nicely when you do a Fourier transform from p->x.quote:What this also means is that the more accurately you measure the two known items, the less accurate any information about the third will be. No. Uncertainty is a relation between any two observables whose operators (like P and X) don't commute.I'll try to dig up a more elementary explanation of the uncertainty between p and x using wave packets so you can get an idea of how the math works without having to deal with Fourier transforms/etc.quote:The trick is, I can also have a diagonally polarized photon.
