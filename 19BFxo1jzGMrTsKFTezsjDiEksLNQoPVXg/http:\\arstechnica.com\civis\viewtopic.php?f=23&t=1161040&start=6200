The food isn't bad, but not quite as high end as iPic. However, they have a call button on the seat and can bring you drinks throughout the entire flick. iPic only serves for the first fifteen minutes or so, if I recall.That's where we're headed. We went there to see The Hobbit, and I wanted to try iPic for comparison. After seeing the price tag, however...It's nicer, but the regular seats, while plush, don't recline which was kind of uncomfortable and the lack of mid-movie cocktails was a turn off. I definitely don't think it's worth the cost, which is why we haven't been back since.

Saw Into Darkness tonight. It's shit. More plot holes than plot and more ridiculous deus ex machina than any kind of credible storytelling. The only good bit was Spoiler: show
the twist on the wrath of khan
, but the method of recovery was telegraphed from many, many miles away. Load of shite.Mod Edit: I don't think Andy meant to do that, so I'll just spoiler tag up that bad boy.

I saw this last night as well.
Spoiler: show
While I enjoyed most of the movie, it was rather ruined for me with the whole reactor bullshit. I was actually quite pleased that they had stayed away from WOK and Space Seed largely (except for the line forever ruined by Transformers 3) until the reactor. I liked the initial Tribble cameo, as it was subtle but I did spot instantly that Khan's blood was a "get out of jail free card". I also liked the fact that while Pine was "channeling" Shatner, his Kirk was different. He is more reckless, too inexperienced (that was actually the thing I hated about the first film - he would never have gotten command that quickly). All the characters being slightly different helps.The moment Scotty runs up to Kirk and tells him the reactor is dead, out of alignment etc I knew with 100% certainty how the rest of the movie would go. I was not wrong. I was however disappointed.Now, I'm sure those who haven't seen WOK 50 million times will enjoy it, but me? No. Especially the moment New Spock screams KKHHHAAANNNNN!!!! I just wish they hadn't gone there, because it was never going to beat/replace/improve on the original scene. We aren't as invested in these characters as the originals and it was OBVIOUS they wouldn't let Kirk die. They had set up his resurrection already, and that just removed any emotion of "OMG they killed Kirk" that I might have had. It was well acted, but it was just wrong.Whereas with WOK, I was stunned that they killed Spock. Stunned. And it wasn't obvious (until ST3 was announced/released) that Spock would come back.Cumberbatch was awesome. Really rather good. They didn't make enough use of Robocop though, that was a shame. Pike dying was a surprise, I didn't expect him to go - it does mean we won't get The Cage/The Menagerie however.The Section 31 reference was interesting and obviously aimed squarely at the original fan, as they only really turned up in DS9 and then Enterprise so any "new" watchers wouldn't really know what was being referred to. I had pretty much guessed it was going to be related to Section 31 pretty early on.

I'm so fucking excited.IT'S STAR TREK DAY!Even if this movie is a complete turd, it has a very special quality: This is fresh, newly written and filmed, professionally produced, officially canon Star Trek...and I haven't seen it before. Do you have any idea how rare that is? I spend so much of my Trek-loving life watching and re-watching things I've seen a hundred times (and loving it, for the most part). New Trek is something very special.I've got passes to see it tonight in IMAX 3D, and passes tomorrow to see it in 2D and Real 3D.CAN'T WAIT.Genome wrote:So, is the US getting this today?"Fan sneak" showings are this evening, the official release date is tomorrow.

The way movie releases work in the US now confuses me. It used to be a single date with midnight showings for big enough movies.Now, there's a release date. But two days before that, some people can get passes for sneak previews and the day before, you can catch showings that start between 9-11 PM. But not midnight. Then the film opens the next day for realsies.I'll probably catch one of the showings that start between 9-11 PM tomorrow night.Also, it's been a mistake to even open this thread, because I've managed to spoil myself on shit without opening spoiler tags. So yay to that.

I really miss the wonder of movies from when I was a kid, where all you knew about it was a) what you saw in the 30-second trailer they played during Manimal or Street Hawk, and b) what some kid on the playground incoherently and incompletely told you about it on the playground the next day.Now you have to actively work to not be spoon-fed the entire plot before the movie opens.Sigh.

I think if we can keep putting any spoilers in tags until the day after the North American release (Friday, May 17th) then we're doing what we can. If it's going to be a while before you can see it and you don't want it to be spoiled, it's probably best to steer clear of this thread starting on Friday.I wish there was a better way to do it, but I don't think there is.

Tempting, but I still want to see the movie without being *confirmed* spoiled. Right now I'm only pattern-recognition-spoiled, which, if I'm lucky, will turn out to be not-spoiled-at-all. But the trailers do seem to be telegraphing a lot.

Quote:The way movie releases work in the US now confuses me. It used to be a single date with midnight showings for big enough movies.++ I was talking to my wife about this subject this weekend. We were at a mall on a Thursday night a month or so back, and there were two giant lines for movies coming out on Friday. We were thinking they were for midnight showings, but both had 8 PM showings that night, since apparently it's too much to ask for Friday release movies to actually wait until Friday to be shown. This led to a "back in my day, if you wanted see a midnight showing, you actually had to stay up past midnight" cranky old person talk between us. It came up this weekend again because we were planning when to watch this movie, knowing that it "opens" on Friday, but showings today were cropping up in our search. We were thinking that it was another "Thursday midnight showing, but not really midnight" deal, but then realized that the date was Wednesday, and trying to figure out how movies getting released on a Friday are now getting shown on Wednesdays.Also, yeah, I'm pretty much having to not look at the internet at all now. I was going to check out an AICN review of the movie, and it started out basically like "Here's a review, there's going to be some spoilers in it, and by the way, here's one now!" I got kind of pissed. It's one thing to have a review and say something like "Spoilers after this point". It's another thing entirely to launch into a spoiler in the same breath as your warning that you're going to spoil stuff.

At least they seem to have somewhat gotten away from spending the first 1,200 words of their articles describing some random movie event of their childhood before actually discussing the subject of the article.

Please don't stop using spoilers till after the weekend. I can't make it out to see before then and I think that's a reasonable time frame. (Or make a dedicated spoiler-allowed thread)

Yeah, but this thread is for Star Trek and not just Star Trek Into Darkness. Maybe we should have a Star Trek Into Darkness-thread so we can keep having Trek-discussions in this thread, but that would risk people slipping up and posting spoilers.I defer to The Sam, but I do not think one day is enough.

Alright, here's what we're going to do as a compromise. Please note that I'm not posting this in Tyranny Yellowâ„¢. This isn't an official moderator directive. Speaking for only myself, I hate playing spoiler police. So I hope we don't have to lay down an actual "rules" here and everyone will just play nicely.How about this? Let's keep wrapping spoilers for Star Trek Into Darkness until Monday (5/20). I have to assume that anyone who's a big enough Star Trek fan to want to avoid having to staying out of this thread (or to care that much about having the movie spoiled for them in the first place) is also going to be a big enough Star Trek fan to see the new movie during its opening weekend (in North America).After Monday, all's fair. If you haven't had a chance to see the movie and you don't want it spoiled, steer clear of the thread starting on Monday.I definitely don't want to start a dedicated thread for Star Trek Into Darkness, for the simple reason that the new movie is obviously going to be the dominant topic in the Trekosphere for the foreseeable future. Telling people to re-post their STID questions and comments in the new thread would get old, fast. It makes sense to me to keep it all in one place.Does that sound agreeable?

That's all I ask for! More than fair!I just don't want to read on Friday what I'm going to see on Saturday since I've gone this far without so much as even seeing a trailer. (Though I was in a movie theater last weekend for Iron Man and one started so I had to close my eyes, put my thumbs in my ears and hum loudly until it was over.)(I probably looked ridiculous if anyone saw me.)

Just came back from the 8pm IMAX showing of Into Darkness, and... Spoiler: show
KHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!! Cumberbatch was fucking fantastic and the movie was a blast. Some things were a bit obvious and telegraphed, but it didn't make it any less fun when it happened. They really focused on the interaction/relationship between Spock/Kirk, regrettably at the cost of a lot of screen time for the rest of the crew (save for sexy Zoe). I felt like they kept a good bit of humor, a good bit of suspense, and further expanded the new Trek universe while keeping some things ready to go for the next film (read: Klingons).We all greatly enjoyed the movie, and I got a cool new poster for my cubicle, too!
As far as the IMAX quality itself, I think it's my local theater, but there was a decent bit of ghosting throughout the film, especially on strongly back-lit scenes. Other than that the 3D was strong and used to good effect at times. However after experiencing the Hobbit in HFR 3D, it's hard to go back to 24fps 3D, even at IMAX sizes. It's just really jarring at times due to the shitty framerate.

I liked it. Quite a bit. It's flawed though, mostly by a pretty major plot hole near the end of the movie that colored my opinion of the scenes immediately following it. But the rest of the movie was good enough that I was able to let go and move on.But hey, plot holes and deus ex machina are nothing new to Star Trek. I don't understand how people who throw fits about that stuff can watch any Trek in the first place, let alone justify crapping on newer stuff just because it's new while aggrandizing something else that's just as flawed.I'm not sure where I'd rank it overall on the ST movie pantheon. But it's near the top. It's not first. It's probably not second. But third or fourth wouldn't be off the mark. Even if they hadn't stumbled it never would have been first. But it could have been a solid second if not for the aforementioned problem.The ending made me wish they could just take that cast and make a TV show with them.AnejoDave wrote:

I'm not at all sure how I feel about the Spock Kahn moment.

It was pretty goddamn silly. I actually laughed out loud while it was happening, probably annoying some other people in the crowd, but I couldn't help it. That said, of the group I went with, several of them said it just wouldn't have been right without it and that it was a fantastic callback. Also, I liked the way they reversed the Spock and Kirk scene from TWOK there. It was one of the things that finally broke through Spock's peronal barriers and Spock chasing after and fighting with Khan was pretty great.

I've officially seen in three times now, and I'm done...for a while, at least. I'm sure I'll see it at least once or twice more before it leaves the theater.Aside from my "it's 2/3rds of a great movie" remark, the only other thing I'll say is that of the three formats (IMAX 3D, 2D and Real 3D), I didn't think any of them had a significant advantage over the others. The size of the IMAX screen was nice, but the 3D in both that format and the Real 3D format was really subtle for the most part. I noticed the lens flare more when I watched it in Real 3D, but that was also the third time I'd seen the movie in 24 hours--so I was probably subconsciously paying more attention to things like that.My stubs:They also gave us a souvenir poster at the "fan sneak" last night:I'm writing my review right now (taking a short break for a late dinner), and plan to submit it just a bit later tonight. I will naturally be back to plug it when they post it on the front page Jonathon

If releasing on Thursday was their idea to improve sales... well, bit of a failure on that end. There were a total of 11 people in the theater, including me. A little weird, seeing a new release with that few people in the room.Don't really have anything to say that hasn't already been said. Although... Benedict Cumberbatch. Holy crap. That man is incredible.
