A college student's rant against her small town provoked such intense backlash that her family had to move—but a California court has ruled that you can't cry "invasion of privacy" when people circulate what you've posted to your MySpace page.Read the whole story

That principal deserves to be fired and never hired at any workplace that requires you have human interaction. One of your major roles as principal is to protect your students.

Any negative things she wrote in her 'ode' have been somwhat proved by the reaction of the town. The principal was definatly out of line. Purposely drawing negative attention to a relative of a student at his school is abhorrent.

I have to agree with anavrintobin in that the town is definitely out of whack. I have not read the letter but if she said something bad about someone specific, then they could sue for libel. However, if it was just a rant against her town, it is very disturbing to see that her family has to move out of the town. I am not as much disturbed by the publication of the letter in the newspaper as to the reaction to it. This brings me to an interesting point. How did the newspaper present the story? Is it possible that the girl has a chance under "inciting violent or hateful activities" (this shows that I have not read the newspaper either) ... just throwing it out there. Oh, by the way, if everyone in Coalinga was like those people who sent death threats over a college student's rant, I am glad the family got out of there. If you live there, you should consider moving out too (unless you can do something about it). However, I don't think the ToS helps her in this case. What can Myspace do? Suspend the principal from myspace for a week?

My outlook: If someone wants legal rights, restricts or disclaimers (privacy, copyright, no further distribution and so on) to apply to her words or her social network page, she should say so explicitly. She can post terms of use on her Myspace page. --Ben

Oh, and by the way, how about ... um ... trying to find the person who actually fired a gunshot at her house? Since when does an irresponsible high school principal become a human shield for someone who could be guilty of assault. Shooting at someone's house just because you disagree with them is messed up. (Its not like we are talking about Los ... Oops, almost invited a gunshot to my house too :P) However in all seriousness, whackjobs like the person who shot that bullet at someone's house make it harder and harder for people fighting stricter gun-laws everywhere. I can already see comments coming in arguing for stricter gun laws. Dragonscript

Seems like stupid behavior all around. The principal let his emotions overrule his responsibilities, the newspaper editor was looking to generate outrage, and the student (hopefully) learned a hard lesson about how the Internet works. But then there's this...quote:UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh: "postings that are (say) racist, anti-American, sexist, pro-drug-use, anti-gay, pro-crime, or or anti-religious..." How did that last entry get lumped in with all the others? Screw you, Eugene, I'm an atheist, and resent having my (non)belief associated with that list of 'views that you believe repulsive'. Sorry for the thread hijack, but someone had to call him out on this.

Jesus Christ, surely there is something wrong with someone taking her writing, even from a "public" place like her MySpace page, and submitting it to the local paper as a letter to the editor UNDER HER NAME. How on earth is that okay? That newspaper has some pretty poor ethical standards not to mention the principal.

That is always what I have considered the ultimate chokepoint for Facebook, MySpace and Twitter: you never know who is going to be reading.If you are going to be completely candid, you'll have to write under a pseudonym. The problem with that is that no one you know will find you -- you have to tell them that you are "CoolDude4567." All of these great stories of long lost friends finding each other will never happen.If you do write under your real name, the specter of self-censorship will ruin it. If you assume that everything you post will be read by your boss, your family, the police, your coworkers, etc., etc., you are probably going to end up making bland comments about the weather. How boring.I'm not on any of those social networking sites for that reason. This story only strengthens my aversion to them.

I agree with the court. She posted her comments to a public forum where it was picked up. It is precisely that reason that my accounts are set to private on every social networking site I'm a member of. People need to start realizing that everything they post online is there for scrutiny and sometimes that scrutiny will also result in negative actions. Think before you post!

Everyone beat me to posting what I was thinking. 1. This isn't a privacy matter and she better get a better lawyer.2. This definitely seems to be a copyright matter along with impersonation. Submitting her material without her permission and using her name. I imagine several laws have been broken there.3. The principal clearly should not have his contract renewed because he just violated some very important ethics of his position. However, being a small town he will likely get rewarded instead.4. For all of you wondering about the gunman. Let me tell you how small towns work since I live in one. You literally have about 5-20 people that run the entire town. The police do nothing that they don't want them too. They will not want to have the police do much investigation because either one of their relatives performed the shooting or one of the police officers did. They will close the books on it as quickly as they can. The town willingly goes along with this because "the family clearly got what they deserved".

For starters, I agree that this is screwed up in a lot of ways. However, there's still plenty of blame to go around in favor of this girl. For starters, the principal had no right to republish, especially submitting it to a newspaper under a false name (even if Moreno was the author, she didn't submit the story, nor would she have, it seems). Secondly, while they're both "public", and as a matter of legality probably indistinguishable, it's worth noting that the readership of a local newspaper and the readership of a college students MySpace blog are two entirely different things. Anything I post here, I rarely expect is going to be seen by a massive number of farmers, or florists. (Nature is the opposite of technology, after all.....Wait...) This doesn't mean I don't watch what I say, or be respectful, but it also doesn't mean that I'm broadcasting "to the whole world". Possible access is not the same as practical access.But most of all, the principal, as well as apparently many others in this town, are dicks. The girl wrote what she thought on a MySpace blog. These people are making death threats. I can't believe I'm saying it, but I think that the complaining college student is actually the more mature one in this scenario.Side Note to dlux: You'll forgive me for playing moron's advocate, but I don't think that being "anti-religious" in the context of free speech is the same as being atheist. In a world where this law professor isn't an idiot, that concept should still apply to someone who is writing something decidedly (and dangerously) anti-atheist. It means more being against an idea in the category of religion, which includes atheism, even if atheism is categorized under religion solely by its lack thereof. Now, the day you start saying we should start burning Christians and Jews, and that leads to someone doing it, then we may have a problem.But that leads to the other serious problem with what this "professor" is saying. Being "anti-____" is only a crime when it's done in a way that causes severe physical or mental distress to others. Are you telling me that what this girl did caused more damage than the death threats and gunshots at her house did to her? Seriously? You can't penalize someone for simply being against something.For crying out loud, people.

I'll second that; In fact I don't think we take it far enough, because the *real* crazy people often aren't run out of town (think Jack Thompson, or Bill Donohue, or Ray Comfort, or Ted Haggart). Let people say whatever insane things they want, but hold them accountable for it (preferably not years after the fact).However, the death threats and gunshot to the house in this case are abhorrent; bogus vigilante justice is not the way to do it.I'll also agree with the other folks that the principal's act of taking the web-rant and republishing it in another format (as a letter to the editor in the paper) does seem to be against how most copyright gets treated. Last I knew, artists/writers got a say in where their work gets published. But I haven't read the article, so maybe the newspaper actually picked quotes and added commentary. That's transformative and fair use as I see it.

While tossing up anything online that could provoke a backlash is kinda stupid on her part, the principal and the news papers handling was wrong, and blatantly intended to cause a backlash. Submitting the myspace article as a letter to the editor AS her using her FULL NAME should be illegal as hell if it isn't already. Clearly the principal was butthurt about it and wanted to see her punished, the unethical bitch at the paper was more than willing to participate in his revenge and in doing so ruined the lives of this girls family.

Sorry for the thread hijack, but someone had to call him out on this. There's a difference between being atheist or agnostic and attacking others based on their religion. It's doubtful his intent was a slight towards atheism, and more likely that his statement can be seen as a defense of your ability to defend atheism by outing the words of someone speaking derisively against it. I would suspect that his inclusion of religion was to cast a wider net in terms of a reader's ability to associate with one of the categories listed. A straight white male who doesn't steal or do drugs may otherwise have dissociated himself from this issue. Everyone has religious beliefs, whether the explicitly include or exclude a deity or acknowledge uncertainty.

I would think this case could be handled via copyright. Isn't the act of posting on your MySpace an act of publishing and therefore creating copyright that is held either by the poster or MySpace or both (presumably, this depends on the MySpace TOS). If this is the case, then what right did the newspaper have to republish in an altered context? Clearly, it was not a letter to the editor, which comes with the implied intent of speaking to the readership of the paper, which is not the same as the group of people to whom she was speaking on MySpace. This would seem more appropriately published as an article or editorial about what she had said with reference to her writing and/or cited quotes.

It would seem to me that the principal had something against her younger sister, herself, or even both of them (if not possibly something against the entire family). In that case I could see this being a very clear issue of intentional malice against the family and the girl. And furthermore, you do not - no matter if you find it on Myspace, Facebook, Xanga, wherever - submit said content to the newspaper under any name but yourself. This would greatly further the intentional malice issue, I think. I sincerely hope the principal and editor are promptly put out of a job, though as someone else said, in small towns that's unlikely unless they get on the bad side of the people that are truly in control. Just a note, I also live in a small town, and would hate to think of the consequences should I write what I really think about this place. Violence may not happen, but sometimes violence isn't the worst that can happen. Small towns are actually not usually the nice, friendly places most people imagine them to be.Also, I am very curious in reading this rant, and my guess is that the paper may not have retracted the "letter" unless legally forced to. Anyone have any leads/ideas on how to find it? I just did a quick search of a few things, but to no success.This comment was edited by maxairmike on April 09, 2009 14:48

Can anyone find the full text of her rant. I'm curious what was written. Nothing in my mind justifies the actions taken by the principal and the residents of the town. Actually going so far as shooting at their house??? Someone should give them a refresher course in free speech. I think the town must have a particularly thin skin, or her comments were too close to home, to generate such a violent reaction.

Jabber, in the case you mentioned, Facebook itself sold the content. In this instance, the content was taken without permission from either the girl or Myspace, which is what we think could be the issue.And kushal, that is unfortunately a very believable situation to me. Some small towns are worse than others, and I would like to think that the people in the PD in my town are removed enough from the influencers to keep that kind of corruption at bay, but I can definitely believe it.

The fact that a young girl could not see the possible outcome of her actions is forgivable. For a principal to not properly think his actions through is heinous and sets such a poor example for his students and community.

I have a hard time believing that taking someone's work and, without their permission, transforming it into a letter to the editor signed by that person is some sort of crime. It seems like fraud. Maybe someone more into that kind of law can enlighten us.It certainly should be against any code of journalistic ethics. The editor should at least lose her job.Now, if they wanted to get this "ode" out, the letter should have been signed by the PRINCIPAL and start with something like, "Look what I found on Facebook on a page by <the Facebook name given on that page>. . ."Since she put only her first name on the page, that is the name that should have been reported. Too bad if everyone could figure it out.

While it would be actionable under copyright, that does not address the girl's issue. Her claimed damages are the reaction to, and persecution of, herself and her family. By placing the posting into a local paper which was then distributed directly to the community members, this reaction was caused. At best, demonstrating copyright infringement would get the paper a rebuke, and possibly a small damage payment, but the damage here is not financial, so it would really not be a meaningful or appropriate remedy, nor would it undo the harm in any way.However, this exact same situation could have occurred if the principal or anyone else in the town had simply come across the page and then it was distributed by chain email to all the residents (assuming they email in Coalinga), so it is pretty difficult to argue that the paper's actions are the cause. They were the means, but it likely would have occurred anyway once someone got wind of it. So basically, her own poor judgment caused the situation, and the principal's and paper's questionable actions brought it to light. If she had written glowing praise of the town and the same thing had happened, no one would even bring up copyright.
