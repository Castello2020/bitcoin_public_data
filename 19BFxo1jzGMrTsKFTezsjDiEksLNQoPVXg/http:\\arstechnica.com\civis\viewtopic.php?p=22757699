Traditionally, public transportation has been about using large amounts of infrustructure to move large amounts of people in large vehicles on rigid routes.The obvious problems are:* large infrastructure means government spending and intelligent planning, neither of which are in great supply of late* it only works out with economies of scale, but if you scale to the necessary size and don't succeed it's a huge waste of money that prevents any further attempts at improvement for decades* rigid routes and time schedules lead to low ridership which leads to budget cuts which leads to fewer routes... downward spiral* big ass busses and trains simply aren't efficient when carrying few people* big vehicles require specialized drivers (and unions, and insurance, and maintenance)But I think we have the technology to make it better and we all already use it every day. GPS, smartphones, the internet, touch screens.The city/state has a fleet of mixed vehicles. Minivans, short buses, big buses. All eco-friendly (natural gas, EV with easily swappable batteries, fuel cells, etc.). Riders simply use a public terminal or smartphone app to request pickup location and destination. They get a list of options for wait times and price (depending on what's already headed that way), and possibly a bid from a local taxi company (revenue split with the city). Common pickup and dropoff locations (like bus depots) would be cheaper than custom ones. Making your request further in advance is cheaper, maybe. You are told what vehicle (type, human-friendly ID number) will pick you up and when.Then, the public transit authority computer automatically dispatches an appropriately sized vehicle for an optimized route. Simple statistics guarantee that the big routes will sill be served by big vehicles, but now they'll be mostly full all the time. The vehicles obviously all have net-connected GPS that tells dispatch where they are and lets dispatch reroute the vehicle en route. Smaller vehicles serving smaller routes are obviously not quite as efficient, but they make the overall system much more viable for people who want to give up their cars (or second car).Data mining will allow further efficiency, since you can seasonally mothball parts of your fleet or trade vehicles to other cities dynamically.

Those very things offer consistency which increase confidence in the service. Quote:* big ass busses and trains simply aren't efficient when carrying few peopleBut they are still useful for paying customers. Efficiency is but one goal, it is not mass transit's reason for being.Quote:* big vehicles require specialized drivers (and unions, and insurance, and maintenance)Small vehicles carrying passengers from the public would require the same.People don't ride the bus unless they have to because you need to wait for the bus, you can't just go whenever you want. Oh, and on the way, you have no privacy or comfort. Mass transit works well in very large cities when driving and parking is more trouble/costly than mass transit, and it works for mid-sized cities for those who can't afford cars. I think you want more people to use public transportation in mid-sized cities. I think you want me to save money(?) and travel more eco-friendly(?) than I do now with my own car. Show me how public transportation would be better than owning my own car, in such a location. Sell me on it. If your system, as you described it, was completely operational today, I'd still drive my own car.

Have you either ridden public transit much, or driven it?The current system is hard enough for a lot of people...I'm not entirely sure what problem you're trying to solve, but point to point public transit is *vastly* less efficient than the current "big busses on fixed routes" approach. Fraction of the passengers.I've driven both. As volume picked up, the door to door busses were nearly completely replaced by "big busses on fixed routes." The number of people carried went up, and generally we still got people where they wanted to go.

Montreal doesn't even have bus-only lanes. I want that first.But we do have biodisel buses. And we do have a few routes that use smaller buses out of practicality. The issue with trying to optimize vehicle on certain routes size is you miss out on the randomness or accessibility for the disabled. It's a fairly safe assumption that buses will be more full at rush hour times, but there are always random times when a bus can be full. One of the longest routes here is almost always full no matter the time of day.

Even if such a system could be optimised on the fly to a degree that made it more efficient than static routes (a highly questionable assumption), it's going to be wildly inconsistent for users of the service.A static route and fixed schedule allows people to make very confident predictions about how long their travel will take. If I'm at the train station by 8:00, I will be at the exit point by 8:25.Now consider a dynamic route. I can no longer predict whether the shuttle bus will be at my door at 7:45 or at 8:05. Will the trip take 20 minutes or 40? On average, it might result in less time spent in transit, but averages aren't terribly useful to me when I need to be at work by 9:00am. If I can't be certain whether the trip (including waiting time) will be 20 minutes or 60 minutes, I have to allow for 60 minutes every time.If your primary concern is fuel efficiency rather than user experience, well, I think it's extraordinarily unlikely that any degree of route optimisation could possibly outweigh the efficiency cost of using more small vehicles over few large vehicles.

Looks like you want all the benefits of owning a car without having to own a car. Get over it, public transport is a trade off. Deal. Let's break your argument down shall we?Quote:* large infrastructure means government spending and intelligent planning, neither of which are in great supply of lateDon't know what you're talking about on this one, long term infrastructure projects and investments are happening on scale and on time here.Quote:* it only works out with economies of scale, but if you scale to the necessary size and don't succeed it's a huge waste of money that prevents any further attempts at improvement for decadesSo your argument here is it only pays off it we scale it but if it fails we're buggered so we don't bother trying. Really? Is that it? Thats your deep and insightful commentary? Well, err thanks I guess... News at 10. Politicians scared of failure.Quote:* rigid routes and time schedules lead to low ridership which leads to budget cuts which leads to fewer routes... downward spiralLondon, Tokyo, Paris, Berlin. I'm sure they've all got it wrong. I'll be sure to tell them all at the next one world government and destroy all cars because we hate American individualism and exceptionalism meeting.Quote:* big ass busses and trains simply aren't efficient when carrying few peopleNooo.... Really? I'd never have guessed that! You know that, ok shit, I don't know how to put this to you, but we run less buses at off peak times! *GASP* I know! Can you imagine it? We run more buses during peak periods and less during low ridership periods... *GASP* Shocking I know. But I dunno... let's imagine what's more efficient a bus that can carry 100 people only carrying 10 or 20 and say 1 car carrying one person.... Quote:* big vehicles require specialized drivers (and unions, and insurance, and maintenance)Ok, next thing you'll be telling us the sky is blue. Your point exactly?Quote:But I think we have the technology to make it better and we all already use it every day.

Typical high tech wankerboy fetish. Let's make stuff MORE high tech to improve things! How about simplfying the city planning laws? How about encouraging the use of mixed planning zones so you have residential, commercial and industrial zones all within walking distance of each other so people could... *GASP* I dunno... Actually walk or cycle to work and pick up their groceries without the need to own a car? How about suggesting instead of a stupidly high tech solution you go find some other rights to wrong? P.S. London has massive amounts of public transport infrastructure already in place. I don't see people clamouring for more individualised bus routes or for smaller buses even. How about you look at some existing cases first eh?

I think Scott Adams' amateur taxi idea has more chance of working than the government-provided taxi idea in the OP. Google's computer-driven cars would make this even cheaper, better, and more convenient.

Countering the OP's idea and explaining why you don't think it will work is one thing (see Erorus' post for a good example of this); being a condescending asshole about it (see Hangfire's post for a good example of this) is a different thing altogether.I don't say that as a moderator, I don't think anyone has broken any rules at all. I just think it's worth noting that you can disagree with someone without being a prick. I know that's a foreign concept to most of us, but I assure you that it is actually possible.

Not to get too deep, but I think part of the problem is that from the perspective of cities with adequate public transportation, this seems unnecessary. Coming from a city with completely inadequate public transportation, it makes more sense as a possible alternative, except that the cost of 'taxi' service is so ridiculous as to make it's use impractical for those who actually need public transit.As for the pipe-dream of zoning some everyone can walk/bike to work/store/home, the problem with that concept is that you're trying to transform large cities, with their specialized areas that focus on certain aspects and have improvements geared directly toward those assets (like industrial parks) and trying to transform them all into miniaturized self-sufficient towns. It doesn't work well that way.What we really need is residential mobility, so that people can afford to move to places that are more adequate to their needs as their jobs and purchasing needs change. Rather than trying to shoehorn everything into one place for everyone so that you remove the need for transit, better to allow people to financially move so that they can reduce the problems the lack of door-to-door transit can cause. Centralize work/shopping in particular areas for easy public transit, and residential areas situated between them along the routes with a variety of options as far as cost so that poor people can afford to live on the bus lines that take them to their new job and new grocery store and new school and...The only way a zoning solution works to really make any change is if we start using a planned economy where people are assigned jobs and the like. Otherwise, while work might be available in your neighborhood, your actual place of employment likely isn't there, and you can't afford to move to where it is.-----------------------Public transit in my city is centered around spokes out from the central hub of going downtown. Downtown is a hub of work, but the problem is that the people who generally work there don't live there, they live in the suburbs, and they aren't poor and don't need public transit. The poor who do need it generally can't get it in anything resembling a timely manner so that they can arrive at their work. And if they live downtown? There isn't adequate shopping for basic needs. There's one overpriced grocery store to cover the entire area, and it has limited selections. I can't really blame it; space downtown is expensive and they can't afford to stock as much or as cheaply as the big chains can, and the big chains have no interest in serving downtown, as the people with money live in the suburbs or can easily drive out to the suburbs to buy. Again, it all disadvantages the poor, who's lack of money leads to a lack of a voice as far as what they need.Indianapolis is nothing like London in size or population, but it also doesn't have anything like an adequate public transit system, and there's no real way a London or NYC style subway system here would be self-supporting. The population isn't dense enough to justify the expense, and parking isn't at that much of a premium such that the middle class and upper class workers would really go for public transit over their own private transit.Massive public funding could put up something like an elevated train, but to be self-sufficient it'd have to mostly service the population areas where people had money, and that's precisely where it's least needed.

If he'd read any of the thousands of studies, news reports, background etc etc about it I wouldn't have had a problem, but he didn't. Instead, out of sheer wilful ignorance and deliberate stupidity he proposed a solution looking for a non-existent problem, so I did have a problem with it.

I disagree that a planned economy is required in that situation. If you zone the thing intelligently it'll be self sustaining. But that requires an impartial governmental apparatus, something that seems entirely impossible to achieve with the American political machine.Also, profit? These are essential government services in providing transportation infrastructure. The idea isn't about turning a profit it's about enabling the economy to grow.

The number of people carried went up, and generally we still got people where they wanted to go.I know it certainly depends on location, but yes... I use public transportation every day, unless I elect to walk instead. I don't own a car since my divorce. Public transportation CAN be a little frustrating, but so can driving. Having said all of that, I chose to live where I knew I had good options. I have the option of a shuttle from my apt. building to the metro, a bus route that runs past the property, and two major bus routes within a mile walk in either direction. All busses run to the nearest metro station, approx 2 miles away. From there, I can get almost anywhere I need to go in this metro area of 6 million people. Yes, it takes more time and planning than driving, but I think the costs and availability are well matched here in the DC area. If I really need more convinience/speed, I have options of a taxi or zip car. Bus services in the DC area are *reasonably* well run in my opinion. If ridership on a route drops low enough to be unsustainable, they simply cut back on the# of trips on that route. (eg - during rush hour, there is a bus that passes next to my building ever 20 min. As rush hour tapers off, bus service drops to every 45 min, then there are no buses during the middle of the day on that route, next bus is at approx. 4pm. and run every 30 min, then every 20 through rush hour. At least here in DC, the system in place seems perfectly adequate *to me* and systems requiring greater infrastructure (metro/subway) are in development to cover a wider area as well, with 2 more metro line routes in the planning/construction stages at this time.[just a quick edit. For those who would argue that my case is special because I live in an urban center... well, I don't live TOO far from downtown, but I had 3 deer cross the road along the bus route Wednesday afternoon as I got home... so this isn't a "everyone move to the center of town" solution, this is intelligent management of fixed routes, balancing coverage and schedules.]

These are essential government services in providing transportation infrastructure. The idea isn't about turning a profit it's about enabling the economy to grow.You're missing my point. Aiming public transit at the problems of the middle class is a waste of time. Local governments don't want to get into the public-transit infrastructure game because if they were self-sufficient (that does not imply profit) they'd already exist. The problem is that it's a massive outlay of capital to construct services where the only real need for them is by people who can't afford those services anyway. So, the public would have to pay out a massive amount of money to construct these train systems, and then continue to pay to keep them running, all so the underclass who can't afford them can get adequate public transit.And let me be frank, I support paying taxes for better public transit. I wouldn't, and couldn't, use it, but I still support it. I think it's a big part of what keeps poor people in my area poor. They can't easily get to work, or less expensive food, or anything else. They're essentially trapped near where they are, or if they can get to one of the few remaining bus lines in my area, they can get to one of the places those buses will take them if they invest a bit of money and a giant amount of their own time. Why? Because the bus system here is generally used only by the poor, and it can't maintain itself without public tax money, and no one but me, evidently, wants to pay that.Rezoning? The first problem with that is that as a solution it ignores reality, that things already exist and have a momentum for staying where they are because of the cost of relocating. It also ignores the problem that businesses don't want to relocate into poor neighborhoods where the people don't have enough money to buy the goods they're trying to sell, and the crime is higher so the costs of doing business are higher. That means tax reductions/payments to get businesses to move into these areas. On top of that, it means a massive amount of shuffling and rebuilding, which means more taxes. Then, it doesn't actually solve the problem; people who already have jobs likely won't live near where they work, and the cost of moving to there can be prohibative, so they STILL need adequate transit. The population density isn't big enough to make public transit self-sufficient or efficient, because it has to cover too much area for too few riders, and parking isn't as difficult to obtain for private transit.In short, the costs associated with changing, and the lack of costs associated with not changing, mean that rezoning as a solution will NEVER happen. It doesn't even adequately solve the issue at hand, unless your only concern is environmental. I'm much more concerned about making it possible for poor people to obtain and retain work and remain in their communities with their family and friends than I am in the level of smog. The smog thing would be nice, and in the end it may be enough to get something done IF the cost of land continues to increase to the point where parking becomes too expensive in highly desirable areas AND IF the population density increases enough that riders payments can adequately maintain the system without making it prohibitively expensive. That's a lot of ifs.Indianapolis isn't a small city. It's also not a dense city. Detroit's problems are much bigger than can be laid at the feet of car manufacturers. Short of using governmental force to make something like what you're describing occur, it just won't work because there are too many incentives to resist it from the people who actually have the money to make something happen.Frankly, until you can frame your solution in such a way that the natural economic forces make it viable AND it addresses the problem of the poor and their transportation/employment needs, you're wasting your time.

This is not a new idea. It has been bandied about for a long time, especially in high-density, older metro areas such as DC.http://faculty.washington.edu/jbs/itrans/prtquick.htm

Duh.Look, I like to drink as much as the next guy, but I fail to see how doing more shots is going to get that garden sculpture home.You drink until you believe you're strong enough to carry it home on your back. Then you'll either muster the adrenalin to make it happen, or you'll give yourself a hernia and they'll let you use the ambulance to drop the statue off at your house on the way to the hospital.Why do I have to think of everything?

Tesco and Sainsburys are all positioning smaller "metro/local" supermarkets in city centres. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesco#StoresQuote:Tesco Metro stores are sized between Tesco superstores and Tesco Express stores, with stores averaging 11,000 square feet (1,000 m2). They are mainly located in city centres, the inner city and on the high streets of towns. The first Tesco Metro opened in Neston in 1980. Since then all Tesco branches with a high street format, including those that opened before the Covent Garden branch, have been rebranded from Tesco to Tesco Metro. The Tesco store in Devizes was the last store to finish rebranding, in September 2006. The store had not been renovated for over 20 years.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainsbury%27s_LocalQuote:In 1998, Sainsbury’s piloted its first Local store in Hammersmith. The store opened on the busy Fulham Palace Road, and was designed for the convenience of customers who did not have time to do a full food shop. Research showed that people were working longer hours and more women were in employment than ever before. Customers needed to spend less time on chores such as shopping, so local ‘top-up’ shopping was an ideal solution. As well as a large range of ready meals, wines and desserts designed for people on-the-go, the branch also offered hot drinks and freshly baked goods, alongside Sainsbury’s best selling products. The Hammersmith store also had a cash machine and opened until midnight most days of the week. The Sainsbury’s Local store was also groundbreaking in terms of staff training. In most Sainsbury’s stores, colleagues were trained for specific departments. The small size of Sainsbury’s Local stores meant that staff needed a high level of product knowledge across all departments. Keeping in line with the ‘Local’ concept, the Hammersmith store also employed only local people.Just because things aren't profitable within your preconceived notions doesn't mean they aren't possible.Sainsbury's and Tesco both saw an opportunity for market growth and profits, took it and they reaped the success. It fits in with natural economic forces and addresses the problems of poor inner city accessibility. Next objection please?

This is one of the things that autonomous automobiles may help solve. Perhaps not public transportation (at first) but as a type of taxi service.

Christ, does nobody watch Top Gear anymore?They solved the model boat transportation problem. They also solved the "what do you do when your bike breaks down" problem. They even solved the "how do you get your motorcycle to the tiki bar on that island over there" problem.*sigh*Noobs, the lot of you.

All I know is that, as someone who doesn't drive and wouldn't even plan on ever driving if it wasn't pretty much necessary in my native city, I'll be the first one on the waiting list for a Google Car if they ever sell them here.

Problem solved.(FWIW, w/out a car, I simply do smaller grocery runs after work, or use a small, colapsable rolling cart if I have a lot, and can walk home from the store if I feel like it. For most other purchases... Let's just say the Amazon Prime account has paid for itself many times over.This. I'm very close to pulling the trigger on getting my groceries delivered.

Yes, I should clarify that I'm talking about public transit in the USA, not the world in general. We're a car based society and we have a real problem investing in public transit.Quote:A "fleet of mixed vehicles" with various "eco-friendly" refueling methods, all answering to a central computer, with support for numerous smartphones and kiosks all around the city, sounds like larger infrastructure to me than a bunch of identical buses on static routes.But it can start small and grow as it needs. There's very little pre-building, compared to a full bus system. The software part of it would be amortized among all the cities using it. You don't have to start with custom eco-friendly vehicles. You can start with an off-the-shelf minivan and put the GPS/communication console in it.Quote:But they are still useful for paying customers. Efficiency is but one goal, it is not mass transit's reason for being.The goal would be to use big busses whenever possible. Just instead of pre-planning what the rigid bus routes are a year/month in advance, you can use software algorithms to guarantee that you only use big busses on routes that need big busses. The routes that always need big busses? They'll always use big busses.The popular routes with high ridership will not change. They're the successful part of current public transit.Quote:Now consider a dynamic route. I can no longer predict whether the shuttle bus will be at my door at 7:45 or at 8:05. Will the trip take 20 minutes or 40? On average, it might result in less time spent in transit, but averages aren't terribly useful to me when I need to be at work by 9:00am.In my experience with tradional busses, you still can't guarantee timelyness or trip time very well, once you get past the popular every-ten-minutes bus routes.Quote:Looks like you want all the benefits of owning a car without having to own a car. Get over it, public transport is a trade off. Deal. I'm saying we can make it less of a tradeoff, with the goal of making it easier for more people to switch to using primarily public transit.The rest of your (Hangfire's) points are all basically repeating "wow, public transit and public works in the US is kinda disfunctional." Yeah. I agree. In the US, public transit is at constant odds with the car society and local governments are mostly all looking at cutting government services wherever they can. Cutting public transit routes with low ridership is, politically, much easier than cutting school funding, police, and fire. Then, when that route is cut, there is now no way to get from point A to B when you need to, so you buy a car. Now, you have a car you're paying for anyways, so why bother with public transit at all. Which pushes down ridership on more routes. Those routes get cut. Lather, rinse, repeat.Sometimes, accepting a little inefficiency to make a system more flexible makes the whole system more healthy.I'm not suggesting a free public taxi service that will pick you up and drop you off anywhere, any time. Just something in between that and the current system of completely rigid routes and time schedules. Previous point-to-point systems have a lot of inefficiency simply because call-in and dispatch are manually operated. An automated system could lump multiple people together in a shared route along an efficient path (in theory).The touchscreen kiosks I mentioned would just be a way for people without smartphones to enter pickup and delivery destinations. Much of the time on the traditional routes, this would just be a way for the system to tell them "there is already a bus on the way that will be at $BusStop in 10 minutes". If you want to save money, you could potentially just integrate with existing touch screen systems in ATMs, Lotto machines, movie theaters, etc. But that requires a pretty impressive level of public/private coordination....and if they ever get self-driving cars, a system like this would be pretty useful.Quote:If he'd read any of the thousands of studies, news reports, background etc etc about it I wouldn't have had a problem, but he didn't. Instead, out of sheer wilful ignorance and deliberate stupidity he proposed a solution looking for a non-existent problem, so I did have a problem with it. I did say "Random idea", not "I'm a super genious and you all should bow down to my solution." No need to be an ass.

I imagine the boat would get broken, the painting would get torn, and the sculpture would be problematically heavy.Also:Pertinent.

Has rickshaw car pool been suggested? That would fix obesity also.
