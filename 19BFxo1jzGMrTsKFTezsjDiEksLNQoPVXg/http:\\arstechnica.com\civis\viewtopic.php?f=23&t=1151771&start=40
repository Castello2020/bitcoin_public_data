Well played. Glad it looks like you're going to get your phone back... and yet another story goes on the long list of things that taxi drivers have done to earn my wrath.Yeah, I know not all cabbies would have done this, but some of worst experiences in my life have been brought to me courtesy of some asshat who drives a cab.

I dunno, how many can drivers would keep a phone charged just so a passenger could locate it?

Slightly more than the number of can-can dancers who would do the same.

The dispatch manager did indicate that the driver offered to bring the phone to me if I wanted to pay him to drop it off. LOL. This was the first time I told the manager that I was actually back home and running the operation from a situation room in MT. Goddamn I just wanted to say it, you know? He laughed his ass off and said he'd personally drop the phone at airport lost & found, where I have an incident open and they were notified to expect it. Based on the evidence above, I have to think the driver knew he had it.I realize I'm not quite out of the woods yet, I need to call Lost & Found this morning to confirm they have it and figure out how to get it back. The final GPS update I received was sent last night and shows the phone just outside terminal 1, so this appears to have been sent as the dispatch manager was returning it to the terminal. The phone isn't currently responding to location requests so we're flying blind from here on out!I'd have offered to pay the guy to ship the phone directly back to you. Hopefully after all this work you still don't end up without your phone, now that it's been deposited in the ether of airport lost and found.

Nobody will take any action on the cabbie. (If you can't prove the cabbie intended to keep it and you were to call his cab company and make a big deal about it calling him a thief, etc. He'd potentially have grounds to sue you for slander.)

Yeah, short of crafting some exotic multi-year prank based on the personal information I've gathered, I think we're done with him. I do sorta miss following him around though, after enjoying a quite detailed glimpse into his typical Saturday.

Lack of doing so, especially if you can prove he tried to activate in one of the stores he went to, would go a long way toward showing that he intended to keep property which he knew wasn't his.I'm not saying it's a strong case, but it's far from the nigh-impossibility you seem to indicate it is.

(If you can't prove the cabbie intended to keep it and you were to call his cab company and make a big deal about it calling him a thief, etc. He'd potentially have grounds to sue you for slander.)I disagree. The cabbie was in possession of the phone for ~48 hours without making any attempt to return it to its rightful owner. He could have just as easily returned it to the dispatch manager or the airport's lost & found himself. It's pretty easy to infer his intent was to keep it and figure out a way to activate it for himself, especially since he stopped at several wireless stores. He also tried to hold it for ransom - i.e., 'pay me to give it back to you.' All the evidence he needs is right here with the GPS tracking and witness statements. It's up to the PD and the DA to determine whether it's worth their time and resources to pursue it.It'd be pretty hard to prove slander, since he'd have to prove that the person making the accusation knew that the accusation was false. Either way, California's courts are fruity enough that it's not worth risking it.I agree though that in all likelihood, it's best just to drop it and have a cool story to tell at parties.

He'd probably get more mileage reporting the issue to both the cab company from whom the driver leases that vehicle and the San Diego Metropolitan Transit Development Board.

Very pleased that you got your phone back -- it would have been 100 times easier if you had a receipt from the cab Trip (but by the same logic 'not letter the phone slip out of your pocket in the first place' would be top of the 'do not ...' list.)Honesty and personal Property tales -- a few years ago, I got off a flight from Adelaide -> Melbourne, and whilst I was waiting for the connecting flight to Canberra, I was paged to the terminal I just left -- confused, I went back, and someone had handed in my Palm, which had my name buried in the menu system somewhere. I didn't find out who had returned it but I would have given them $20 for their honesty. Kudos to Qantas staff too. The Palm had fallen out of a bag in the seat next to me when I was packing up to leave (I remember putting it in there), the bag had a flap-covered pocket that was really loose. :/

I called down there and sure enough, they had it. They requested I call it from another line to confirm ownership and what a sweet sound it was to hear that ringer going off in the background. Just need to create a FedEx account and they'll ship it up.And I'll definitely take a stab at a writeup with pictures.

I don't know why Plan B is being brought up... it's too late to use emergency contraceptives to terminate the cab driver. However, I am interested in knowing which app you used. I might have missed it while spending time in Mexico. In a cave. The heat interferes with my reading comprehension. Also, there are crystals. I'm pretty sure they're kryptonite.

So, without installing Plan B, I went to their website, logged in, and did the locate. Within a few seconds, the GPS icon was animating and my location was pinpointed. Kudos to Lookout for some neat software.

Particularly with the GPS running. To get position reports that accurate it must have been using GPS, not just tower triangulation. I don't know about the droid but on my GPS-enabled phones the GPS sucks the battery dry in about two hours - and that's without sending position reports. Maybe Plan B is clever enough to only turn the GPS on every so often?

Maybe Plan B is clever enough to only turn the GPS on every so often?Yes, I believe it only activates GPS when it receives the keyworded text message. Reviewing my Google voice history I see that I requested its location 42 times. Following the first successful request I received a single notification email followed by 6 position update emails of increasing accuracy, spanning a total time of 9 minutes. If GPS were active that entire time I can't imagine those 42 requests would have been facilitated with the remaining charge on the phone, which had to have been below 75% when I lost it.Protip: don't hammer the location requests like I did; your thief might not be courteous enough to keep the phone charged for you!

If you haven't done so already, I'm sure Lookout would love to hear the tale of how Plan B helped you get your phone back. Stuff like this is why they develop products like these to begin with, and I'm sure the developers would enjoy hearing how their app worked exactly as intended.

I have to mention - not all cabbies would have been so, um, casual in their approach to returning the phone. My biz partner and I were in NYC once to deliver a custom seminar to a major client. I had to carry THREE laptops in two laptop bags. The first evening after setup, we cabbed it back to the hotel and between being distracted in convo with him, and the long-ingrained habit of carrying just one laptop bag, I left the other one - my main laptop - in the cab. This cabbie didn't just have a lead foot. He moved that cab as if it had a NOx bottle. By the time I realized I was short one bag he was around the next corner. This was at about 10 pm. About 2 am the front desk called me. He'd come back with the laptop. He said he hadn't noticed the bag (black bag, black cab interior) but his next fare did - and that was a long one and he had another one before he could get back to the hotel. But bring it back, he did. I tipped him pretty heavily!

Definitely contact Lookout and link them to this thread, as they're bound to love this. This is pretty much the best possible publicity they can get for what's clearly an awesome and effective product.
