When my friend was arrested in NY for not paying his car registration he was wearing one dress shoe and one sneaker because his foot was hurting. I recommend this look.--- They do make non-sneakers that are comfortable out of the box that require no breaking in.

Polo shirt, dark jeans, and you'll be fine. The running shoes are a bit iffy though. You could hit up a store and rent some shoes though (Moores?), heck you could rent the whole outfit if you wanted.I pretty firmly dress for comfort first, style second. My shirts are in good repair, not faded, and clean. The closest I get to a "business casual" shirt is a short sleeve button up shirt with a straight cut bottom untucked, or perhaps a casual long sleeve shirt (and no, not the wool sweater over a dress shirt look, I just can't handle that).Again, its all about comfort. I'm not comfortable in long sleeves indoors because I like it to be about 19-21C tops, not 23-25 C like most places in the winter. And jackets / blazers? Forget it.Besides. Even if I were to dress up, my epic beard and middle of back length hair don't really go Wear clothes, be polite, you'll be fine.EDIT: And I have to say, thanks to my Dad for pushing me to get some "walking shoes", specifically Rockports, as my every day shoe. They're comfortable, not dress shoes, flat black, and work with everything except dress pants, but since I don't wear those - I'm good - CG

To Echo: Khakis or Non-Jean Pants (with pockets at the hip only), Non-Athletic/Non-Sandal Shoes - if plain leather, polished. (Good excuse to buy yourself a pair of boots for winter) If Suede... not tatty. A Shirt with a collar (Roll neck sweater works, but be prepared to be accused of missing a beret and mustache)You never know who you might meet, and business casual is pretty comfortable and looks much better than jeans and any athletic shoes IMNSHO.Or A nice pair of Jeans and a collared shirt + jacket + boots looks pretty decent too - but it's not business casual.Also, the lounge is not your for-pay-boardroom.So here's a lesson on problem solving:

I got away with wearing black sneakers with my army uniform most of the time. In bootcamp even. Only once did I have to go get my nice uncomfortable shoes but of course, next time I was wearing the sneakers again.In addition to the obvious benefit of being more comfortable and less blister inducing, they also made me much less noisy...

If you are hesitant as to what to wear, just follow a simple rule of thumb: It's easy to underdress, but it's very hard to overdress.

Over here it would be, although I might consider them to be more "smart casual" than "business casual".Oh, and match your belt to your shoes. Brown belt + black shoes: no-go.

I seriously doubt anyone will care if you're wearing runners. People in Ireland are pretty chilled out. If anyone asks just tell them about your toe injury.

On a more serious note if you are a fan of New Balance they also make a line of more formal shoes called Dunham. I have a pair they are still very comfortable.

I went to a conference last week, and one of the speakers work black slacks with a brown belt and gray tennis shoes. Of course, the slacks were also showing about two inches of ankle. I should have taken a picture as an example of how not to dress.On the positive side, his blue oxford shirt was nice.
