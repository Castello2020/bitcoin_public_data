Once our tenancy was over the landlord would have had to have got a court order to evict us first. That would have taken months and cost a lot, but would still be possible.

Lawn bowls, I think they're called. Generally you have two teams, of one or a few people each. You have a jack (smaller, white ball) that is rolled to one end of a flat, very finely trimmed bit of lawn. Then each team takes turns to roll these large black balls (smooth surface, somewhat heavy - half marked with a red dot, half with a blue dot) towards the jack. They're weighted slightly where the coloured dot is.Aim is at the end of the game (when you've gone through all your bowling balls - usually have 6 per team maybe) to have the most balls near the jack - for pro games they may well add up all the distances and do sums, think I've seen this on tv.Tactics include hitting (well, gently moving is the idea) the jack, knocking other team's balls away, block bowling paths that will allow other team to get easily get good positioning/points, etc. (Due to the weighted part the bowl will curl in when it runs low on momentum and has been rolled with the weight to one side. You can just roll it straight with the weighted bit on a top-down axis and blast everyone's out of the way. I believe this isn't considered good form in the league games popular amongst the older generations who seem to favour lawn bowls, though.)Think that's it, anyhow. Had a mini indoor set when I was a kid - mostly to stop us trying to play pétanque by flinging metal balls around near things made of glass. -c-

Ahum, and apparently I never did post my earlier thought-of response of - hey, AlPak, good grief! Glad it seems kind of settled for now though. Seems a bit mad, even so.

Once our tenancy was over the landlord would have had to have got a court order to evict us first. That would have taken months and cost a lot, but would still be possible.I can answer this one. If, due to whatever circumstances, a landlord has no place to live, and decides that they want to live in your house, they can evict you. So if someone buys your house from your landlord with the intention of living in it, they can ship you out.

If one of the surviving members of the family wanted to take the space as primary residence, they'd be able to evict.

My friend's mum has lived in the same London flat for 40+ years and because of that, the landlord can't evict her and is very constrained in how much he can raise the rent. But I've never heard of that kind of renter protection applying to office space. That's typically governed by simple contract, at the end of which either party can say bye-bye. Maybe this particular contract places an easement on the property so that if it's sold, the new owners have to respect the existing terms. But that wouldn't prevent the new owner evicting when the contract expires.Strange.

-c- wrote:Lawn bowls, I think they're called.Yep. For North American readers, think: curling, but on grass. The weighted balls can curl on their own (so, no brooms needed) and the target area changes slightly for each end (because the target is a small ball that gets rolled down the lawn at the start, rather than a fixed target area).

I'm going to have to study that very closely, but at first glance it does look as though our landlord was acting illegally. At the very least it seems to be implying that we should have been given at least six months notice and not the two that we were given.

I know there was a date cutoff involved in the case embroiling my coworker's family - I want to say it was 1986 that was the important year. Different laws obtain if tenancy began before or after that date.
