I think that's the bank holiday weekend at the beginning of May, anyhow.Anyone else about for a meet-up? Mayhap somewhere with seats and drinks and food for the afternoon, the usual sort of thing. That place in Greenwich was pretty good last time, and can always go for a wander in Greenwich market or nose around the Observatory for a bit too. Or say if you have another inspired Grand Plan. I might wander along to a museum or gallery on the Sunday, if anyone's up for that too.What say ye then, mm? Currently I know of two people who think it's a good idea, so do come along if you're not up to much else. p.s. Was pondering a meet with more notice later on, in ze summery months, and mayhap in a more central (northern) location! i.e. Sheffield or something. So if you can't make the above, shout if you'd be interested in that. mat catastrophe

The Monday 8th onwards I'll be working 3rd shift for six weeks (10pm-7,30am), so it'll be my only chance of daylight and people for a little while - as such, I am tentatively in! -c-

They make you do a night shift? O_o Whatever is in that basement that needs tending overnight? Awright, so far then we are at least 3! More than <3! (Hoho.)

Sounds good to me. If the weather's nice Greenwich Park would be good (not to mention incredibly easy for me to get to. ), and if it's doing that 'orrible wet thing it keeps doing lately there's the Observatory and the Maritime Museum at hand.

Saturday day times are no go for me, unless I give myself the weekend off but I could meet up after 1800 if anythings happening in the evening (I don't drink but would still be up for meeting at a pub or whatever)

I had a notion of starting a meet in the afternoon and then continuing into the evening, with people coming/going as they wished - so it would be good to see you in the evening! Has been ages, too. (And there may well be pubs involved, though I'm usually on the fruit juice + good food combo. )Good thinking, Tim - looks like that might work out nicely then. Ral

Would love to but am busy that weekend.I'd doubly like a more northerly summer meet as I'm up in Nottingham and getting down to the smoke is sometimes inconvenient. Come! We have cheap(er) beer.

Anyway, I'm tentative for the 5th. I can't make it a late one, as I have to be up relatively early to pick someone up from the airport the following day.

Would definitely be up for a northern meat in the summer. Just depends how my shifts work out.BTW I'll probably be in London for my Stag in mid-late July. I'll let you guys know if any of you want to come along. There will be titties.

Another one I'll be away for, down in (hopefully) sunny Cornwall.I must say I'd also be more up for a anywherebutlondon meet, as I just find the place so damned awkward to get to and stay in.

To be a bit clearer, I actually mean The Old Brewery, and I'm not sure it's technically in Greenwich Park. This place:http://www.oldbrewerygreenwich.com/find-us/

Complaining that one of the largest tourist cities in the world is awkward to get to and stay in isn't saying much for anywhere else tbh

O_o A London day "travelcard" on the train is usually pretty cheapish if you're coming in from towns nearish London, no? And then that gives you all day travellings. /pokes aroundAh, unless you're coming from somewhat further afield. Hurm hoom! /puzzledMeeting at the Old Brewery at 3pm sounds good to me. They have food there too, so we can ensconce ourselves without needing to do the usual 5 mile find-food-for-fifteen expedition etc. See you all then!
