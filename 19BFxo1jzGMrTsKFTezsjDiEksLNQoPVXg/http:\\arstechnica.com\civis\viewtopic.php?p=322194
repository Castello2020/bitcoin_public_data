Betting on horseflesh and betting on online poker might seem to be identical activities to most people, but US laws have mandated that they aren't since 2006. Now the EU has cleared the way for a WTO challenge to those laws—will the US's anti-online-gambling initiative go down for the count after just two years? Read the whole story

This just reminded me that I haven't played a real game of hold 'em in quite a while, and I'm logging on to Poker Stars now. Let me know when I can finally play for real online. I can't stand not being able to find a good group of guys to play on a regular basis.

The whole crusade against gambling is ludicrous.

When can we expect the US to get kicked from the WTO. They like to beat everyone over the head with it, but never take their own medicine.

The ethical issue here is not whether or not to allow "citizens [to] throw their money away", but rather whether others should knowingly take it. Just because someone is willing to part with money due to ignorance or addiction doesn't mean that it's ethical for another to accept it with awareness of the the one's ignorance or addiction.That's the real ethical issue with gambling, but curiously that never gets discussed. Perhaps the people doing the collecting are also stifling that awkward and inconvenient discussion?

@VulcanTourist : How is this different to gambling offline? When someone goes to a casino, are they checked to see if they can afford to gamble? If it's an addiction? If they really understand what they're doing? And if they do do that in one casino, is that information spread between all casino's so that that person is blocked from all of them?I doubt it, if casino's could only work with people who understood what was going on and could afford it, they'd quickly go out of business.

Wait. So this is about actual gambling, like poker and craps and so on, and not Citibank?

As long as there is no (or acceptable, such as truthful advertising) coercion, I don't see why not.The 'citizens throwing their money away' may be getting entertainment for their money. People willingly pay large sums for entertainment of all sorts. Why should a risk-based activity be any different?YMMV.

Total straw man. I'm tired of people clamoring for laws because of some ethical obligation, and usually one for which the ethical quandary is most certainly not set in stone (it's alright to gamble in Vegas or some Seminole Indian casino in South Florida, but not on-line?). This would be a sad country indeed were every activity, product, and service that could be deemed addictive were banned due to "ethical" concerns.Part of living in a free society is accepting that you have both the freedom to succeed and to fail. Take away one of those options and you no longer have a free society. Personally I'd prefer legit organizations along with the government via taxes keep taking in the money instead of areas with no gambling concession being owned entirely by the mob, gangs, and other undesirables.

VulcanTourist:Yes, some people have gambling problems. Where does that leave the other 99% of the gambling population who enjoy it, are not addicted, and only do it with money they can afford to lose? You can't ban alcohol because some people are alcoholics.These laws are ridiculous, given many different factors:1. How easy they are to circumvent.2. How they damage the sport of poker in the US.3. That you can bet on a horse race, as long as it's an American one, from anywhere in the US.4. That the Us is missing out on lucrative taxable income since all the poker sites are now hosted outside the US.I for one am looking forward to these stupid laws being repealed so that all the donkeyfish come back to Stars. The games have been too good as of late. p.s. Check out my thread in the Lounge

I believe the reason the US has restriction on online gambling is that too much money would be flowing out of the US. You can argue whether or not people should be allowed to spend their money how they see fit, but it's a drain on the national economy and that's why the restrictions are in place.

Should it be illegal to sell bottled water?

Given that the US ignores WTO regulations and rulings on a fairly regular basis (at least regarding Canada), I'm not exactly holding my breath that sanity will prevail. Then again, with the possibility of America ending up in the poor house by the time this economic slide is over, maybe the government will wisely decide that this isn't the best of times to showcase their typical arrogance.

Since the day the first state lottery went into operation, there has been no possible "moral" prohibition on gambling. Places like Las Vegas and Atlantic City show us there's no "protecting" us from our excesses, either.It all comes down to stifling competition. The trick is, you have to be big enough (like a government) to do it "legally".

"Follow our rules that suit our perogative! Oh hang on that one rule doesn't suit us anymore, can we abstain from that ruleplease? OK great thanks bye!"Might be simplified but it really does come across as superpower-assholeishness (new words ftw). Not saying that my government is perfect at all but you know what I mean.If the US has a list of morals that they want to use their massive influence to uphold then I can understand, even if I don't agree. But to then try and duck out of the obligations they arranged when it suits them really doesn't sit well with me.

Ethics? Why are people talking about ethics? The ban on online gambling has absolutely nothing to do with ethics.It does have everything to do with Harrah's/MGM/etc lobbying for its prevention. Take for example the Lake Tahoe casinos. They've seen a dramatic decline in customer visits over the last decade or so. The sole reason for this is that a number of Native America casinos have opened up in the Western Sierra foothills and now residents of Sacramento and the Bay Area don't have to drive as far to get their gambling fix. Likewise, with the rise in Native American casinos across the country; people don't feel the need to visit Vegas or Atlantic City as much anymore.Tahoe has been able to make up for it by flying top customers in and trading free stays for gaming revenue.Vegas makes up for it by offering world class shopping and dining in addition to the sin. Other than that, people simply don't feel the need to spend a bunch of money on an expensive flight and trip when they can just go to the local Native American joint and get their fix.Now imagine you can gamble from the comfort of your own home. The big gaming companies don't want that, the Native American casinos don't want that, race tracks don't want that...Dear Senator...

Anyone who's bored and wants to see US arrogance in the face of trade committments, might want to look up the USA-Canada softwood lumber trade dispute. The US, on the urging of some lobbyists in western states, has claimed that the low stumpage rates charged by the Canadian provinces for crown lands was somehow an unfair subsidy. Despite provisions in the NAFTA (Free Trade Agreement) and the WTO; despite losing almost every case brought against it; despite the blatant illegality of its actions - the country persisted in collecting billions in tariffs; as each alw was struck down in court, a new one replaced it. The weenies in Canada's government under Stephen Harper finally caved in and agreed to collect their own tariff and limit quantities if the US returned a fraction of theillegal tariffs already collected. We're not talking a major product like Hollywood, or banking, or oil - this is frickin' woodies, like 2x4's and plywood. Pretty pathetic, eh?So don't expect anything different from gambling. A few influential lobbyists with the right ears can work wonders in congress. "The force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded".

It's only a drain on the economy as they federal and state governments are too stupid to legalize online gambling and tax the cr@p out of it like they do everything else. Typical to the anti-gambling mentality is that of, for example, Ohio.... where they repeatedly turn down special requests for gambling even though the state budget is a shambles (like every other state) and they are constantly looking for new "income" sources.What could they do. (1) form a state commission to control gambling... rules and regulations for all. (2) legalize gambling for anyone based on said rules, regulations, local zoning, etc. (3) tax the cr@p out of it (4) special interests will finally give up on their attempts to buy their way into the state. Will this help the addicts...no...it won't any more than legal ciggies and alcopop with their taxes (which have for some time had the major portion of their expense registered in the TAX domain). Is that a problem...only for the addicts; and banning a "legal" activity won't help them in any case. They simply go elsewhere to satisfy their addiction (drugs, tobacco, cigarettes, marijuana, sex...you name it)

In my mind this is the music industry vs. digital downloads, blockbuster vs. digital downloads, thing playing itself out again and will do so everywhere a "dinosaur", the old way of doing something, comes up against the latest craze. Yes there is a group of people who are morally and ethically opposed to gambling, but every facet of our society faces the same criticisms whether the participants are the same or not. Let's be honest, we fight about everything; breast feeding in public, breast feeding at all, breast feeding is porn or not, to the rabid vegans who want us all to eat grass whether by choice or force. The addiction argument is virtually groundless because there are people who are addicted to buying shoes but no one proposes getting rid of shoes or handbags for that matter (sorry ladies). Honestly there are people who live in poverty solely because they are giving all their money to their church, yes church, and no one is complaining there either.Why aren't Vegas and other gambling establishments allowed to go online. Are they even in support of it or would it kill the hotels and shows. This is a lot like Tesla vs. GM. GM had the EV1 or whatever that car was years ago and they forced the people with the cars to give them back so they could destroy them because its hard to say oh this is hard to build when the proof is out there on the highway. Tesla is here today with a car that is everything (sans cheap) that we say we want and they're begging for money. Meanwhile we're propping up the old way of doing things, read GM, with billions in loans even though they seem to be years behind Tesla to market.You would think online gambling would be the panacea for the people saying I don't want gambling in my town because it brings crime and poor people who've lost it all wandering aimlessly or not into traffic. Fine, let the people stay home and do their satan's work, where they do all the rest of satan's work: in the freaking bed room. I don't buy the argument that the digital form is more evil than the actual thing. Horse Racing is legal in the US. Gambling on horse races is legal in the US. Slots, poker and craps are all legal somewhere in the US. Thus, the US doesn't really have a problem with these things.I suspect the real barriers to online gambling are the established players doing everything they can to protect their old school domination refusing to ignore the writing on the wall. One thing you can always count on politicians the world over to fight for is the established player especially when the opponent is progress.

Clearly there's principally the protectionism angle here. IIRC the UK has one curious protection for gambling addicts: you're not allowed to pay with credit cards, so you can't create new debt for yourself by gambling. Not much but it's something.
