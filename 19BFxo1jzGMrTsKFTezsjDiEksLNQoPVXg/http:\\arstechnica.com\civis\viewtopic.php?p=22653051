http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Gently_(TV_series)Holy crap, if there's a book that I am surprised generated a television series, this is it. I read it many years ago being a standard geek-level Douglas Adam's HHGTG fan, and it was amusing. I'll check the show out.Anyone seen it? The pilot was made back in 2010!

...I just realized that I've only seen the first half of this week's episode. I fell asleep to it late Friday night. The first half was pretty good, I look forward to the zany resolution to the case.

I haven't seen this yet but having seen him in several other things,* I have to say that Stephen Mangan is perfectly cast as Dirk Gently.* "Episodes" and "Green Wing", which are both great btw, especially the latter.

I really enjoyed the pilot, and also last night's episode. I thought the girl in it was perfectly cast. She was kind of weird looking but also very pretty but also really odd. Mangan is excellent and a lot of the physical humour they've added is really entertaining. A lot of book conversions forget that this is important for television, but they've done a great job with it. It definitely serves as a perfect silly counterpoint to the new Sherlock Holmes series.

Oh cool, I'll have to check this out when it becomes available. I actually prefer "The Long Dark Tea-time of the Soul", but the first was good fun. Still sad that there never were any more.(Am I the only person who gets a lump in his throat at the very end of the Hitchhiker's Guide radio series (Quintessential Phase)?)

I tried to watch the movie, but it wasn't good.I think the unfinished version of his last book in his series was actually published, at least I remember reading it.Thinking of it, this reminds me that I have to PM Casey Johnson, I am sure she'll enjoy to know that Douglas Adams was published in purple in Denmark. The publisher claimed it was less stressful to read, but we all know it was a conspiracy towards girls.

Apparently not, because they're not publishing anymore.---The first of the HHGTG were the best though. Douglas Adams didn't really write that though, it was a copy of the original BBC radio program. I still have the tapes somewhere (beat that).

The radio program wasn't a work of a single person, so what I meant, he didn't write it in the same way as the books he was the sole authour of.

Hinton's not completely wrong, the last few episodes of the first Hitch Hiker's series were written with the assistance of John Lloyd because Adams could not meet a deadline to save his life (Apparently Geoffrey Perkins also helped.) However the books omit a lot of the stuff that was not written by Adams. This is detailed in Neil Gaiman's book "Don't panic: the official hitch hiker's guide to the galaxy companion". Lloyd must not have minded (or got over it) because they wrote "the Meaning of liff" together later.
