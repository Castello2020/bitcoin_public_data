/sniffAwww..thanks guys! I'm actually of the opinion that sharing knowledge via technical fora such as here at Ars is net positive for all parties. I've learned far more in my 11 years here than I otherwise could/would have on my own. As such, I feel it behooves me to give back whatever knowledge I can...even if I'm wrong sometimes. Which never, ever, happens. Nosir. Not once. Nuh-uh. In fact, the single-most important thing I think I've actually learned here is how to admit when I'm wrong, absorb the lesson, and move on. At least with technical topics, that has become far easier for me. Subjective things such as politics and whatnot...maybe not quite so much, but I have changed my stance on a few soapbox topics thanks to other knowledgeable, more skilled posters who took the time to explain their positions in such a way that I simply could no longer ignore my own cognitive dissonance on the matter. But even *that* was a topic which we argued about once. That's right...we argued here on Ars about whether or not an individual could change their own pre-conceived notions on a topic. Talk about meta...

Okay I think I fixed all the ranks in this thread for now. We'll work on getting et Sub tags back when things calm down. If I see more subs who need rank fixes I'll get to them as I can.
