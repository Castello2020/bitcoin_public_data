quote:Here's something I bet a lot of you didn't know. There's a World Gravy Wrestling Championship. This year Rose 'n' Bowl pub in Stacksteads, Lancashire, hosted the event, which saw the use of 440 gallons of gravy.Joel Hicks, a 30-year-old who wrestled under the name of Stone Cold Steve Bisto won the men's bout on his third try. He told BBC News, "It is a bit crazy - it is the third time I have done this event, so to finally win it is fantastic. The final was really tough and it is much more difficult than you think. My technique was really just to grab hold of the guy and hope for the best." (Wrestling! Gravy Style!) Would you like fries with that? Does the concept of gravy wrestling fascinate you? Have you watched or participated in similar competitions? (more pics)

Gravy Wrestling looks wierd.Mud Wrestling actually is pretty cool to watch, especially if the girls are really, really cute.Jello Wrestling, well, that's pretty fucking hot...Mayonnaise, tends back towards the bizarre.So, the tears of Frosty Grin it is!

Two dudes wrestling in gravy does not appeal to me what-so-ever.

I voted Frosty Grin's tears ( as long as they're tears of unfathomable sadness ) because tears are so yummy and sweet.

What a waste of perfectly good gravy./me shakes head and is just thankful it wasn't spotted dick wrestling.As far was what I'd like to wrestle in, this isn't the VR so I'm not saying. But if Stone Cold Steve Bisto would like a match, I'm sure something could be arranged.

I wrestled in pudding once. I think I'd rather that than gravy or mud. I kind of smelled like a cabbage patch doll for almost a month afterwards though. I wouldn't have guessed that the pudding smell would have that much staying power.

In my freshman year, I had to take a bus to campus that went past a particular strip club. Their sign advertised wrestling in a new and novel food every week. It started off with the usual - jell-o, olive oil - but progressed through mashed potatoes to marshmallow topping, chef boyardee, oatmeal, creamed corn. Now that's sexy*! Ladies covered in tinned creamed corn.*Wherein "sexy" is redefined as "an ill-advised outtake from Lexx.

We did pudding wrestling one time in college. One kiddie pool, many pots of Jello brand pudding, a bunch of guys and girls. I did not participate, but was a happy spectator.

I am not opposed to Gravy wrestling as long as no gravy is actually being harmed.
