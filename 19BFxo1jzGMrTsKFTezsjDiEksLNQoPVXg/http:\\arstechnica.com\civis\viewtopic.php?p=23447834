RIGHT?Nerds are what's wrong with nerd-dom.Let's be clear here, SW isn't "sci-fi" in the sense you must be talking about it. There's not even a whiff of science to be found, and a staggering pile of "science doesn't work that way". It's space fantasy adventure, that's all. The reason people are suggesting Whedon are because Firefly was basically an updated SW at its core, and he just made what's arguably the best blockbuster action adventure movie ever made, the same kind of thing that SW needs. I actually don't particularly think he would be a perfect fit for SW, and I would rather see him do more Marvel stuff, but I don't think for a second he wouldn't come up with a fantastic SW movie. As far as your knock on his writing and directing, I'm sorry you're broken.

Sorry, I should start another thread for my hatred of Joss Whedon.Incidentally, I agree with you about Star Wars not being "sci-fi". It isn't. It's simply a good/evil period piece.EDIT: Don't get me wrong, I like Star Wars as much as the next guy, but if Whedon/Bay were in charge, Shia Labouf would be Han Solo and Jar Jar Binks would be his sidekick.

You seemed not so angry a few years ago. I lost track of where you were and whatnot. I hope you're doing alright. You just seem very angry, and your attack towards people who don't agree with you was juvenile at best. I hope you're well.

As a columnist once wrote, there are two kinds of people who talk about Joss Whedon: Those who think he is a god, and those who are wrong. Although even as a complete Whedon whore, I do not think his style would adapt well to Star Wars.

I don't see why people are so caught up with the idea of replacing actors due to age. It wouldn't bother me to see an older Luke Skywalker played by someone other than Mark Hamill. Just cast right actor for the role, Don't create a different Mark Hamill. And I think Whedon has a keen eye to these archetypes - the princess, the rogue, the young hero, the elder sage.

He has an amazing understanding of character and story (the mastery of which was everything that made the OT great, and the utter lack of which was everything that made the prequels total shit), and he's really good at writing the kind of witty, snappy dialogue that was all over the original trilogy and completely absent in the prequels.

People have long called Star Wars: A New Hope a Western in space.And somehow the guy who created a Western in space would be an abomination to do Star Wars?I mean you don't even have to like the guy to understand how ignorant that stance is.

The Star Wars meets Firefly idea is awesome too; I would like it even better with a sprinkling of BSG in there, too (specifically of the Sharon 'Athena' Agathon variety. )

The problem with Joss Whedon for Star Wars is that so much of his characterization works of wry asides, Buffyspeak, and his reflexive, self-conscious toss-off. It works quite well for The Avengers, and it worked pretty well for Firefly (though I still say Tim Minear was the really vital portion of that duo - he kept Whedon honest.) For Star Wars? You need a real-deal true believer who is willing to sell the power of myth and the magic of the epic. I'll say it again: Brad Bird. Give that man a Star Wars movie, and we'll have gold.Fuck, after the Before Sunrise trilogy, I'd even be interested in what Richard Linklater could do with a hundred million dollars and a galactic romance.

I think his writing style would not translate well to Star Wars. It works for Buffy, for Firefly, for The Avengers, but I think it would stick out like a sore thumb in a Star Wars movie. Just because he made The Avengers doesn't make him an auto shoe in for every movie to be made ever again. The stylistic differences between Whedon and Star War are huge. It just wouldn't work IMHO.

Joss Whedon is a hack. He has a couple of very good tricks up his sleeve, but he massively overuses them to the point where they become banal, then annoying. There, I said it.p.s. I haven't seen the Avengers and I don't plan on it.p.p.s. That should set the thread on fire.
