Is this going to be on ESPN at all? I vaguely remember some of the 2008 games being on ESPN.

In other news, I really hope the whole racism thing won’t turn out as bad as the yellow press thinks (hopes) it will. Having the dutch team greeted by "jungle sounds" during their training doesn’t make me too hopefull, though.

to be honest I don't think it will be. We had all that brouhaha about how many rapes and muggings there would be in South Africa two years ago, but it turned out the Saffos were too busy enjoying the football to bother committing any crimes.

It's a disgrace they are allowed to host the tournament with this going on. Not even got to the first game yet and already there are allegations of racist abuse. This doesn't bode too well. Gives football a bad name. Must do better UEFA.

The progression of events for me this morning:- ESPN3 isn't showing the game live? WTF?- Oh, 11:30 AM Eastern time. Herpderp.- Wait, it still won't let me...ah, I have to sign in to Xfinity to prove I get ESPN. Whatever.- *click* *click* *click* WHY WON'T THE DAMN WINDOW OPEN?? Oh, because you have to use IE. Okay.- Yay, ESPN live. Talking about basketball and stuff. Oh hai, a few shots of Greece and Poland running around before the game starts.- Okay, 8:29...the program's about so start. SO EXCITED!!- 8:30 on the dot: screen goes blank.The fuck?!?!
Spoiler: show
EDIT: Okay, it came back. Let's hope it stays back.

Well, if you're going to have to replace your goalie, I guess having the new guy save a penalty as his first contact with the ball is the best thing that could happen.

A fairly decent opening game, well done that ref having learnt a lot from all those decisions at Old Trafford over the years. Still, awesome to be watching it live at home in HD.

Wow, second dominant goal for Russia! I liked the follow-up goal better for effort, that but the timing on that one was just pretty. I think my favorite part was that Russia's tried that exact pass/shot routine a few times this game already, and Czech Republic just can't seem to effectively defend against it.Is ESPN Live in Spanish for everyone else? [EDIT] Never mind, I've been watching the Spanish stream.

Well done that ref , he has clearly learned that no one ref ever got fired for buying IBM giving blatantly wrong or at least very soft cards or penalty decisions against the away side in the big games, particularly those where the home team is Man U andyfatbastard

I have to say the Czech defence were pretty brutal. The only reason they got back into the game at 2-1 was because of poor finishing from the Russians. Neither of these teams are going to go deep in this competition, that's for sure.

Thoroughly entertaining first half. Denmark is really giving the Dutch a good fight and that goal was pure class. I wonder how van Marwijk will react strategy-wise in the second half.

Surprised there haven't been more goals in this game. both teams riding their luck at the back. If Denmark could get a few quality crosses in they'll wrap this up. They're working positions for crosses brilliantly, just lacking the quality delivery into the box and men in the middle to attack it.

Are they the dark horse of this tournament?' PS Come on Denmark!

Nah if you saw the game they squandered loads of good chances. The ones they scored were very good but as I said they let the Czechs back into the game by squandering lots of chances for the third.

Those odds 5.5 covers my remaining 5 bets. Everything is profit from here. ---Germany - the Netherlands will be awesome, with the Netherlands with their backs against the wall, and Germany wanting points as well.

In completely unterlated news, Argentina won against Brazil 4:3, with 3 goals by Messi. His 3rd one was particularly nice. Now back to the regular 1:0 and 0:1 Euro 2012 game programme…

Such an overrated player.I have a pretty simple rule regarding the rating of players: if they score the goals, they are not overrated. I actually thought Ronaldo was overrated, but last season with Madrid he actually did the scoring his "rating" would let you expect, so he’s likely worth the money. And to be honest, I doubt stopping him is as easy as preventing him from going left. It‘s not like the Primera Division and Brazil’s Selecao are made up of retards who are all overlooking such a simple tactic of preventing Messi from scoring, no? But then, not a great soccer expert here, just watching the Euro and World Cups and Champions League finals. I actually missed both games today (yesterday, technically) since I was out, but I’m definitely watching Spain vs Italy. Should be a nice test for Spain to see whether they’re contenders or not.
