If the "big picture" Steam update wasn't hint enough, apparently here's confirmation that Valve are building their own set-top box hardware :http://www.theverge.com/2012/12/8/37443 ... -steam-boxMy knee-jerk response is that it's just another console I have little interest in, but I honestly wonder where he intends to go with this. If it's not based on Windows, he now has to convince devs en-masse to *also* start writing for some kind of Linux-based....thing. And I just can't see that happening except for tiny start-up indie devs - which will condemn the entire thing to a drawn-out, slow, money-bleeding death.

I posted my thoughts on Valve pushing a Linux based Steambox as being a non-starter when these rumors first came up. I can certainly see Valve designing and branding a "target" gaming/HTPC with a partner (think the Google's Nexus initiative) and holding that up as a baseline for gaming designs. I can't see them entering the full fledged console market though. That's what a Linux based box would have to be.If Valve were to enter the market as a fourth console manufacturer they'd have a steep hill to climb. History has pretty much shown that there isn't room for four consoles on the market, so unless gamers are going to completely abandon one of the existing ones it would be a non-starter. It's made a bit murkier by the fact that Nintendo has been a wide net console, picking up fewer "core" gamers but subsisting on families and "casual" gamers. So maybe there's room for a third console for the core.There's the chicken-and-the-egg problem as well. Linux has traditionally not been supported well by the AAA development community because there hasn't been a huge calling for it. If Valve wants a Linux-based Steambox to take off they would have to put a significant amount of weight behind getting developers to produce those ports so that gamers would be willing to purchase the device. That brings up the question of their Windows support: if developers see a baseline adoption of their games on Windows and are happy with that, then what incentive do they have to add another (potentially costly) port-job to the mix? If Valve deprecates or otherwise lessens their support of selling games on Windows in order to create that incentive then they're putting their entire business model at risk.So, as I said in the other thread (and at the top of this) I don't see this as being a concerted effort to create the One Box to Rule Them All, but more likely a baseline HTPC design that can be sold with their branding and running Windows. The costs of them entering into the console market whole-hog is just too high. Especially against two popular and entrenched console manufacturers. Of course the same could have been said about Sony*...*There are quite a few differences between Valve today and mid-90's Sony. Breadth of product lines, total valuation, cash on hand, etc. As a private company we don't know much about Valve's value, but I find it hard to believe that they have a warchest that's large enough for them to risk failing completely on a concerted console effort.

As I see it Nintendo has abandoned their traditional competition with Sony and Microsoft in favor of appealing to a different set of gamers. It's plausible that a Valve console could compete alongside Sony and Microsoft in the "hardcore" market while Nintendo keeps on pursuing the more casual crowd.

Nintendo's "different set of gamers" is, and historically has been, basically about 20 million gamers in Japan. That's why they don't really care; they have at least half of them and it's enough for them. The 360 by comparison barely gets a look in.Valve's "HTPC" thing, though - it would have to be very cheap - very, very, very cheap. Something like Ouya, which incredibly actually seems as if it will be as promised, is pretty much all the HTPC anyone would really need - very cheap, natively connects to your TV, has a USB port and wifi for external storage, connects to any web-based delivery system you care to name.

I'm pretty skeptical of this as well. I agree that it sounds like just another console so I'm not exactly sure why some people are so excited about it. I'm withholding judgement until they actually announce something, though.

The one thing that could potentially make it work, is the PS4. The PS4 is expected to use an AMD x86-64 (speculated to be "Jaguar" core based) with an AMD Radeon based CPU. Since Sony relied on OpenGL as a graphics target this gen, they'll probably do the same for the next gen. So basically, the PS4 is going to be an X86-OpenGL console. The hypothetical Linux-based Steambox would also be a X86-OpenGL machine. So there's a potential for a relatively easy additional target for PS4 devs.

Sony is buying Valve.In serious world I am cautiously optimistic about this. We just have to wait and see the final product.

PS3 looked better than 360 back in 2006, but Microsoft pretty much wiped the floor with Sony over the last 6 years. Sony may have been ahead a couple times, but I think it's safe to declare Microsoft the winner of that round. And Sony had several advantages. They had Blu-ray, and MS had HD-DVD (cue LOL), they had free WiFi from the start, free online, support for hard drives. Oh, and they had that sweet deal with Portal 2. It was Skyrim that exposed PS3 as the weaker unit, it being able to run the base game, but unlike the 360, unable to handle its expansions.Not that I'm hating on the PS3. It's a fine machine in its own right. But Sony was willing to work with Valve when Microsoft wouldn't. Steam has the market Sony wants. Sony has better developers. The same developers who work with Microsoft are all willing to work with Sony (except the ones owned by Microsoft).The caveat is, I don't think Valve wants to limit themselves to one locked-down console. Every game would have to be able to be activated on Steam for the PC, or more transparently, PS4 games would be Steam games. But Sony doesn't want people to be able to walk in and out of its walled garden that easily. So who knows. But I think you have a good idea here, bad as it may be for all involved. And good. But it's a good prediction.

I think I know what Valve's secret controller will be like.I think they're going to put a touchpad where the right analog stick should be, for quick and precise cursor movement. And a scrollwheel between the upper and lower right triggers.

I would have thought the fact that Valve are producing this Steambox is confirmation the they are no longer involved with Sony. As for attracting developers - just like Steam when it first arrived: If you build it, they will come.Finally, it will only take one big successful exclusive title to launch the console. There are plenty of people, myself included, who would buy a console purely to play Half-life 3. Assuming that a decent % of my existing Steam library would play well on it, with the promise of more to come, it would be a no-brainer.

Steam had a leg up in that it was merely a content delivery service for pre-existing games on Windows. Now devs will have to be custom write for some flavour of Linux. I can't really see devs abandoning millions of pre-existing Steam-Windows customers to make the effort to re-code in Linux too, on the off-chance it will be a success.

Actually, I think its genius. If you look at the gaming hardware market, you really have two choices. You can write for directx and get Windows and xbox. Windows is going its own way and I sure wouldn't want to depend on then if I were Steam. Microsoft is going to start wanting a cut of all software on the platform just like Apple. The other side of the coin is OpenGL. With that you get most of the other platforms. Not only can you support Steam, you could also support any Android games out there. Steam for Linux is just the test bed for the technology that will run on the SteamBox. If Valve adds good keyboard/mouse support to the system, it could attract those PC players like me who hate using controllers in FPS. Plus, being built with Linux, it allows those of us who have Linux desktops to still use our computers. They could even put out a live boot cd just to run steam on your windows pc. There are a lot of options by moving to Linux. Valve needs to be proactive now. The PC games market is not growing. I don't know if I would say its dying, but it certainly isn't doing all that well. A lot of stores like Best Buy hardly sell PC games anymore.

To be honest, there's tons of room for standardized, well-balanced gaming PCs that aren't a horrible value for the money.Let's look at Dell's entry-level Alienware:Quote:$7002nd Generation Intel® Core™ i3-2120 (3M Cache, 3.3 GHz)1GB GDDR5 NVIDIA® GeForce® GT 6406GB (1 X 2GB, 1 X 4GB) Dual Channel DDR3 at 1333MHz1TB SATA 3Gb/s (7,200RPM) 32MB CacheSlot-Loading Dual Layer DVD Burner (DVD±RW, CD-RW)No MonitorNo KeyboardNo Mouse1 Year Essential SupportWindows® 7 Home Premium, 64Bit, EnglishAlienware X51DW1506 Wireless-N WLAN Half Mini-CardSteam Factory Installed and Steam Extra Content240W External Power SupplyA terrible dog of a graphics card, off-kilter RAM size, off-brand parts...Compare to TR's budget build: http://techreport.com/review/23814/tr-w ... em-guide/2Pouring more money into OEMs generally gives you larger numbers in the areas that you'll never notice (CPU Cores, RAM, HDD Space) and little improvement in games (CPU, SSD). Wouldn't a standardized gaming PC around $~500-$600 (that also acts as your TIVO, netflix box, etc) be welcome both by consumers and developers? It would run circles around most OEM crap, offer an excellent target for developers, and be the "Home PC" for the Tablet Generation.

The game's in 1080p, has high-res textures, and probably still plays at a better framerate than the Xbox equivalent. The game when I bought it was also $10 less than the Xbox version.

If you're not tech-savvy, you don't play games. If you are, you build your own. But pretty much any laptop built in the last 4 years or so can do what you say.That's why there isn't room for it. It already exists, and really, without custom apps, not many people really want it as much as they want a dedicated DVR / cable box.

Tivo has managed to stay solvent even though they likely have a tiny fraction of the DVR market compared to Scientific Atlanta (and every other cable-co DVR offering) but we don't know exactly how solvent they are. The majority of customers tend to purchase (or otherwise obtain) the product that has the lowest up-front cost, even if the ongoing cost makes the product with the lowest up-front the more expensive. Tivo's not a great example though, as there is no way for a customer to make a Tivo in any way cheaper than a cable-co provided DVR (upfront cost of purchasing, Tivo subscription and cable card fees all conspire against it). A dedicated console though is relevant. The Xbox 360 costs half (or more) what a much higher specced PC that can play any arbitrary game would cost. That won't change next year when the next generation of consoles comes out. If Valve wants to compete against them they have to hit the $300 base console price. That, in turn, would limit what they can do hardware wise, and (if they're to be believed that they would want an open platform) could cost them ever reaching profitability on the project since people could purchase games from whatever source they want. A Nexus-style target PC (running Windows) could work as a Steambox as it would cost them very little even if no one bought it. A push to Linux and going after the console market would be an all-in move for them. I can't see it being worth throwing away what they currently have on the off chance that five-ten years from now Microsoft might block application purchases from anywhere but the Windows Store.
