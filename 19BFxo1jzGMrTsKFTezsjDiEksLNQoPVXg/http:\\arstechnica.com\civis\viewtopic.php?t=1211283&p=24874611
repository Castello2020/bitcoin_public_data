              I know I am not the only person on ars that eats this way, so seemed about time to give us a thread of our own! If you don't currently eat this way and are interested, please feel free to ask questions and I will answer them the best I can (or you know, someone else will). If you are an opponent of this way of eating, thats fine, but if you chose to partake in this thread, please keep it civil! Discussion is good, arguing raises cortisol levels, which is totally not primal, so lets keep it out of this thread, thank you!<br /><br />I have been thinking about making this thread for a while, mostly because it seems everyone in the weightloss thread is depriving themselves, are hungry and grumpy and posting something like &quot;I realized I was hungry so I ate a block of cream cheese before bed and feel much better now!&quot; or &quot;I wasn't losing weight so I added another 300 calories of avocado a day and dropped three pounds in a week!&quot; just makes me feel like a total troll dick (even if it is true).<br /><br />I am sitting here at work eating grilled flank steak and avocado while everyone else is shoving company bought Hungry Howies into their faces. I was already known as the guy thats eats weird stuff in the department, but the naked pieces of crust in my garbage can are still freaking people out. (hey, I am human, hard to resist pepperoni and cheese!)<br /><br />Some resources for those interested in the lifestyle:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Get-Fat-About/dp/0307474259/ref=sr_1_1_ha?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373478012&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=why+we+get+fat" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It</a> Great read if you want to hear about whats wrong with the modern diet<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Calories-Bad-Controversial-Science/dp/1400033462/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373478716&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=good+calories+bad+calories" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Good Calories, Bad Calories</a> The longer, more scientific version of Why We Get Fat<br /><br /><a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/#axzz2HxsBly74" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Marks Daily Apple</a> Fantastic website with more information than you can shake a steak at!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Primal-Blueprint-Reprogram-effortless/dp/0982207786/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373478553&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=primal+blueprint" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">The Primal Blueprint</a> Book written by Mark of Marks Daily Apple, really changed how I approach life.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.gnolls.org/1141/eat-like-a-predator-not-like-prey-paleo-in-six-easy-steps-a-motivational-guide/" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Eat like a predator, not like prey.</a> Good primer to getting started, the rest of the site is so so<br /><br />There are a ton of other resources, but these are the ones that really stand out for me.

              Yeah, that thread is...depressing.<br /><br />I intermittently bounce into and out of a low carb thing; I'm lucky in that I can do it for four or five months, go back to eating regularly, and not regain (most) of it, but the biggest hurdle to sticking to it regularly is laziness, not cravings--cooking takes time I could be using to do absolutely anything else. I just bought a sous vide machine and I'm pretty stoked there because I should be able to mass-prep chicken and steak for the week without really spending much time on it, reducing time-and-effort by a pretty good amount. That and a crockpot should let me put basically everything on autopilot.

              An immersion cooker for sous vide at home sounds awesome. The only ones I've ever seen are mega expensive industrial units, but the principle mechanism seems easy enough to make a DIY unit pretty easy. <br /><br />As far as the paleo diet is concerned, it makes total sense to me. I am first and foremost a human. My diet and cravings are based on both immediate cultural influence and longstanding primal evolutionary instincts.  One is obviously more pertinent to my biology than the other. <br /><br />Bread and pasta are mostly out for me. I simply do not crave them. When I occasionally do eat those things, they are simply vehicles to carry some sauce or other protein into my system. <br /><br />Give me freedom to eat anything and I'd choose fruits, meats, dairy, vegetables and nuts, in that order of preference. Basically things I could either gather or hunt in the wild. Anything else is superfluous and unnatural.

              I'm currently on a &quot;paleoish&quot; diet.  By that, I mean that the basis is paleo but I'll throw in non-paleo things frequently that I still consider &quot;clean&quot;.  I mean things such as beans, quinoa, and Greek yogurt aren't paleo but I still consider clean.  I've been like this for about 3 years now.  I'll fall off the paleoish wagon from time to time but I'll get back on it because I just feel so much better eating like this.  Also, my blood work is absolutely fine.  I had my blood testing and my total cholesterol was 180 with my HDL at 63.  The are a lot of articles out there that are starting to debunk the paleo diet and the theory behind it may not be sound, but for me, it is working really well and I feel great on it.<br /><br />As for other diets out there, I've read up on paleo, Omnivore's Dilema, Born to Run, and South Beach diets and here is the thing about all of them: at their core, they all promote eating clean, unprocessed foods.  And that's basically the key.  Stop eating processed foods and you will more than likely be healthy.<br /><br />And I just want to say that being vegetarian isn't necessarily healthy because muffins, donuts, cream sauces, and Snickers are all vegetarian yet they aren't healthy.  I know many overweight vegetarians.

I try to keep to the 80/20 rule. I figure if I keep my eating clean 80% of the time, in the long run it should be good to go. So I still have my sushi on weekends, french fries if I go out and a jar of peanut butter at my desk for those moments when I need it.<br /><br />oh, and cheesecake, in my world, crustless cheesecake is totally primal! <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/big_grin.png" alt=":D" title="Big Green" />

              As much as I welcome the Paleo diet more than I welcome any of these &quot;weird&quot; other diets, I have to say I think it would be easier just to burn off the excess calories that you consume. I mean I know I am generalizing it, but generally speaking, if you use up more fuel than you consume, you will lose weight. Am I right?

Am I right?</div><br />In an abstract sense, yes, but like most things in life it's more nuanced than that.<br /><br />You can burn anything, and it's burned, right? Consider coal versus natural gas. You light them, and they both burn. You can theoretically burn them both until practically nothing is left, but <span style="font-style: italic">how</span> they burn, the byproduct of their consumption, and their efficiency are very different.<br /><br />Your body metabolizes different foods different ways. Yes, what you eat will get processed the same way in a macro sense of &quot;something is converted into energy&quot;, but how food is metabolized and the effects of the byproducts can be vastly different depending on what the food itself is.

              As more scientific research is being done, it is becoming clearer that there is more behind the science besides calories in and calories out.  One easy example is the number of meals a day.  If you look at just a simple &quot;calories in, calories out&quot; perspective, then it doesn't matter whether you eat 2000 calories in a day in a single meal, in 3 meals, or 6 meals a day.  However, it is evident that 6 small meals a day tends to be healthier and easier to maintain a healthy body weight.  Same thing behind calories since you can't survive on only 2000 calories of carbs or 2000 calories of protein or 2000 calories of fat.  There are much more complex biological processes and interactions going on inside of the body than we fully realize.  Because of this, i don't think that &quot;a calorie is a calorie&quot; really applies.

              I'm not a strict Paelotonian. Maybe neo-Paleo.  I don't necessarily care about eating what my caveman foreparents ate (do you put ketchup on mastodon?).  But the basics are, pretty much, what we all kind of know: mostly vegetables and some protein.  Hell, we've been told that by the .gov for a while now.<br /><br /><a href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=1152304" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Back in 2011</a> due to blood pressure and HDL levels and &quot;pre-diabetes&quot; concerns, I wanted to learn about low-carb/low-glycemic diets, and Baeocystin turned me on to the some good low-carb/low-glycemic stuff.<br /><br />At that time, I'd already given up dairy due to issues with it.  Dropping starches and carbs did help and I felt quite a bit better.  Blood tests were much better, blood pressure went down.  The doctor was neither for nor against it - pretty much noncommital.<br /><br />I still felt kind of crappy and still had some other issues that kept being an issue but figured &quot;hey, I'm getting older&quot;.<br /><br />Earlier this year, I started wondering about gluten intolerance.  Many of the things I felt matched a number of the non-specific symptoms.  So I thought I'd give it a try.  (No, I did not get my ass to a doctor - that's another thread that would be very boring).<br /><br />Within a month of mostly eliminating gluten, I shed about 20 pounds of water weight.  I went from 179 to 160.  And peed.  A lot.<br /><br />Then I started feeling normal for maybe the first time in 20 years.  Non-specific, low-grade aches disappeared; my mental attitude and acuity got better (happier, less forgetful); stamina/energy greatly improved; a pretty constant low-level fatigue slowly went away.<br /><br />I slipped up, too.  Thought it must be a fluke.  But I'd get symptoms back any time I had anything with gluten (bread, crackers, noodles, etc.). <br /><br />So my diet is pretty much a type of Paleo diet: no starches/carbs (due to eliminating grains), vegetables/greens, and protein.  I do consume sugar to a very limited extent and keep an eye on it.  The bread I eat is potato-based.  Dairy still gives me problems (I'll try some occasionally), but not quite as bad as it used to be. <br /><br />It's not right for everyone and I don't agree with a lot of the strictly Paleo guidelines.  But it has some good info and can help reduce/eliminate processed foods which can be problematic for people for several reasons.

              I've been on a not-totally hardcore version of Keto that has been working really well for me. I'm down about 40lbs since Christmas (I've also upped my exercise levels) and I feel better and stronger. I do miss bread pretty badly sometimes but steaks and bacon help make up for it. Lots of slow cooker meals, Costco runs for steaks and then green vegetables (Broccoli, Asparagus, Brussel Sprouts) as a side. Eggs and bacon for breakfast, but only a few times a week. And water. Lots and lots of water.<br /><br />Hoos - your post makes me want to try gluten-free, I'm already most of the way there anyways. I've always struggled with that low-level fatigue feeling.

              Some of the stuff I write might be a little chaotic because I am doing some other stuff while posting this. Sorry. <br /><br /><br />My issue with the cut the carb out of your diet thing is that I see plenty of Chinese people who eat noodles or rice and they are not fat like us 'mericans. Of course, they don't all just eat rice and noodles, there are dishs of vegetable and or little bits of meat mixed with with veges or eggs with veges, etc (you get the idea). Of course there is also the factor that Chinese people still walk a lot compared to us. <br /><br />Now if we can establish that the Chinese, Korean, and other Asian countries are not aliens and have similar physical traits compared to us, then I think it is not just about cutting this or eating that. What I do notice and correct me if I am wrong, is that the American portion is fucking huge. I mean what passes as a portion to us is a 5 course meal for most other countries (I know I know I exaggerated a bit but you get the idea). I mean I am so used to eating an American portion that when I go to a restaurant and they serve me a normal portion I feel like I am being ripped off. Hell, even Churchill commented on the enormous American portions in the 20s or 30s whenever he came to tour the states. <br /><br />On the topic of carbs, I can safely say that I see the &quot;bad&quot; of carbs. My dad use to have this fucked up habit of eating a giant bowls of rice. Which caused something bad to happen with his blood cells and I think the doctor even said he was pretty close to be diabetic. That is why when I moved back to South Orange, I went to IKEA and bought that little bowls that are the size of my hand. My plan is to eat just 1 bowl full of rice and let that be that. <br /><br />However some of you said you eliminated carbs from your diet, I don't know if that is 100% no rice, no noodles, no flour products, or just a decent reduction. To me I think by going to the extreme of totally eliminating carbs is a little silly. I believe we should go on the road of consuming a moderate amount instead of just going cold turkey on the stuff. <br /><br />Lastly it is funny how we are talking about the Paleo diet now. A few days ago I was actually watching a documentary on the Paleo diet. <br /><br /><br />Lastly, lastly, I apologize if it seems like I am hijacking the thread. I just want to go through some ideas with you guys to see if I am holding onto some wrong ideas or not.

Do you really think that there are so many morbidly obese people in the world just because they are all too lazy and stupid to not eat less? Sure some people process carbs very well, my father in law eats pretty much nothing but carbs and is skinny as a rail, his kids on the other hand, are not as &quot;lucky&quot;.<br /><br />As for carbs, wheat is not the only source of carbs, in fact it is a pretty crappy source of carbs. I eat a ton of veggies, fruit, some sweet potato and occasional rice. All of which are sources of carbs and bring more to the table in terms of nutrients than wheat, which strips more nutrients from you during digestion than it brings.

              Not to derail, but if you think gluten may be an issue, <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.celiac.com">www.celiac.com</a><!-- w --> is a great resource.  It appears a lot of people think of gluten-free as a &quot;dieting option&quot;, it is serious disease for a lot of people - meaning it's a permanent change in diet.  Gluten, like dairy, is in a LOT of processed foods because it's a good, cheap product that adds something to the processed stuff.  <br /><br />Going gluten-free can add up, too, moneywise.  A loaf of gluten-free bread can be $7 or more.  For some things, it's cheaper and maybe easier to make it at home.

              I've always had good results in muscle gain and fat loss when I trade some of my junkier foods for protein and good fats, so I guess these are the same principles taken to the extreme. I have a hard time getting behind any plan that <span style="font-style: italic">eliminates</span> anything long-term, but if it works for you, then great.<br /><br />If any of you are involved in endurance sports, how well do these strict diets work out for you? I'm not asking about how they got you into better shape in the first place, but how an otherwise healthy person performs while avoiding all grains, versus eating basic foods like oats and brown rice with meals.

I have a hard time getting behind any plan that <span style="font-style: italic">eliminates</span> anything long-term, but if it works for you, then great.<br /><br />If any of you are involved in endurance sports, how well do these strict diets work out for you? I'm not asking about how they got you into better shape in the first place, but how an otherwise healthy person performs while avoiding all grains, versus eating basic foods like oats and brown rice with meals.</div><br /><br />I've been doing triathlons for years and I do fine.  A lot of people I know that do triathlons also do lower carb diets.  If I'm in hardcore training mode, I'll eat more fruits and sweet potatoes.  I also do the paleoish thing and eat things like beans to get more carbs if I need them.  Also, if you stick with a diet long enough, you'll retrain your body to rely more on fat stores instead of glycogen stores.  This doesn't switch completely but your body will learn to use fuel sources that are available.<br /><br />Also, another thing to check out is the <a href="http://www.fitfatfast.com/started/" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">metabolically efficient diet</a>.  I know one or two people on it and they like it.

It does not stress what to eat, or the quality of the food, just to keep your carbs low.<br /><br />Of course this is a generalization of the two, but thats the way I look at it.</div><br /><br />I agree with this generalization.  For example, gravy isn't paleo but it is Atkins since it is low in carbs.  Cheese isn't paleo but it is Atkins approved.
