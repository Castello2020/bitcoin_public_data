Gnomes dislike bunnies. Mostly because they have the option to wear a pancake on their head without actually damaging the pancake. STUPID POINTY HAT!

Tape. I'm throwing out my old crap. The last of my VHS and audio cassette collection. Seems like a good idea seeing as I haven't had a working cassette player for about 10 years. The stuff I really want I'm re-buying on a new format (MP3 or DVD/Blu Ray).Three things become apparent;1. Disney's movie release schedule is really annoying. I have some things on VHS that aren't available on... any format right now.2. Some of the music in my collection is cheap. Real cheap. 3. When I'm going through stuff like this with a mind to disposal, the longer I look at something the more I want it.Also, my cassette collection included a compilation from 1988. This was on it. I now have a playlist with each track, including that, on MP3. ColinABQ

I had my sister cart a ton of them off to the local library for me (I gots no wheels, man) not that long ago. They were appreciative. If there's no such opportunity in your area, well, never mind - just thought I'd mention it as an alternative to just pitching them.

Stupid golf ball size hail. I guess at least no windows were broken, and its not hundreds of dents. Now to decide whether the 4-5 dents are worth repairing. Anyone know how much this type of thing costs?

The first tape I bought was the soundtrack to Back to the Future. Now, many years after I stopped using tapes, I want to get a couple songs from the album on iTunes, and none of the songs are available. If I still had the tape, I could borrow a tape deck and record the songs.

It seems soundtracks have a tendancy to get "rare", so I'm seeking that one through alternate means (nope, not piracy, second hand stores). The collector hoarder in me won't let me off the hook that easy. The videos that I know aren't available and the stuff that I originally recorded off the TV I will be converting to avi. I did some a while back, it's just time consuming.

At 10:07pm on April 29th, 2012 ... I just completed my second novel. I did a happy dance for a while. Now I have to start revisions and editing. Then I did thew "spine slump" dance 3-year-olds do when they are bored while shopping with mom.

The painters painting my apt are extremely lazy. There is a small dirt dobber's nest on the ceiling on my patio, and rather than knock it off to paint the ceiling, they just painted the nest. So now, when it falls off or is knocked off, there will be a nice unpainted spot on the ceiling. Doesn't matter to me as I don't own the building, but I'm sure the owners wouldn't be very happy if they knew about it.

This killed the ivy, which then fell off, leaving a weird pattern behind. It was like that for a while until more graffiti evened it out.I don't know why they try and "paint over" the graffiti with just a lot of white, all it does is provide a nice, new, fresh canvas. What they should do is put a complicated and uneven striped/checkerboard pattern of white, black, and red. This would slow the graffiti somewhat and force those artists to bring their own primer, which is a pain.

I'm guessing the complicated patterns are ugly or otherwise undesirable, which is why people paint their property in attractive solid colors to begin with.I wonder if an anti-primer could be developed that absorbs new paints that are applied. I guess repelling paint or slowing the drying process could be just as good.
