After writing here for several years about doing it, we did it. The Skoops now live in southern Italy, in the Puglia Region, the heel of the boot-shaped country. We've taken a three-level apartment house in a small city founded in about 1260 and built to its current architecture in the baroque style in the 17th and 18th centuries. We live about 100 paces from the Basilica of St. Martin, the baroque masterpiece that dominates the main piazza.After selling our house stateside and liquidating most of our stuff, we traveled with 4 large suitcases that just met airline size and weight codes, and two carry-ons. Got a 10-down DSL line turned on in the house several days ago and I'm writing from the mini-ITX box that I built for the very purpose of traveling small and light. We're having a great time. The neighbors and townspeople have been warm and welcoming. Even the gov't officials with whom we've had to deal have been helpful and accommodating. Mrs. Skoop is a dual citizen through her Italian grandfather who emigrated to New York about 100 years ago. Our impressions, not only here but elsewhere in Italy, is that Italo-Americans are thought of with regard in this country. The Mrs.' EU/Italy passport is greasing a lot of skids in the paperwork dept. I have an appointment to get my "green card" application going in a couple of weeks. So far, everything has gone swimmingly. Even the officer with the Commissariat of the State Police we had to see get my appt. welcomed us to town. Eating well, the air is good, it's clear and bright, the wine is stellar. Retirement to the dolce vita. And now, the pics. Our street and the house, some of the town during sunlight and the surrounding valley, some of the Wednesday market, nighttime views, and some of St. Martin inside. Vlip

Though, I think he collected social security, so it's possible he got his citizenship over here which bars me from applying.

Thanks for the good wishes. We planned this for a long time and thus far everything has gone as expected. It's great to be retired. It's even better being retired in a choice location in Italy.

Took her two years to get the docs and another two for her citizenship to be recognized. She found the actual entry papers for her grandfather at Ellis Island, that was a big one. She was able to get his birth record from his home province and the marriage cert from there. And the kicker was his naturalization document which showed that her dad had already been born by the time her grandfather renounced his Italian citizenship. That meant that her dad is an Italian and therefore she is an Italian. The citizenship is already there. You just have to demonstrate it through the records.

If he had a son before he became a citizen, and you can show descent from that son, then you might be an Italian under law.

That's what really stops my daydreaming in its tracks.Retirement. UR doing it wrong.In Italy anyway, the smaller the town the slower, low-techage will be the life. If you're often thinking about retiring to Italy, but you're concerned about being bored, then what is it that you want out of retirement? Go live in Florence or Milan or Rome or Bologna. Then, you can still be in New York, only there will be more Italian speakers than where you live now. But you can speak English there and no one will bat an eye.I'm here in a small city (40K) to eat and live well; travel the Mediterranean, Balkans, the Continent, and North Africa; learn more of another language; go to cooking school in Lecce; hike in the Dolomites; sit in the sun; drink good wine; and surf Ars Technica. Among other pursuits, and being bored is not one of them. I was just in Triggiano last week. Went to a supermarket there on our way back from Ikea.

Soooo jealous.I'd pick Tuscany, personally but I can definitely see the appeal of the South too. I just like a little winter each year to keep some variety. Winter in Lucca is amazing really, a bit of snow on rare occasion, not too cold most of the time and not too humid either so it doesn't feel horrible.Man, I miss Italy. I was there in late 2008 and I want to go back again so bad. Hoos

I'd love to hear the details of you formalizing your immigration. Italy has been one of the places I have seriously considered moving to later in life. I loved it when I was there, and adore going back (though I'm way overdue).Also, have you taken immersion courses in Italian? Were you already comfortable with the language? Acclimating as a resident seems like it would be a lot different than going even as a long-stay tourist.

Choice views, historical or political significance, family connections will add to the cost, perhaps significantly. IF you could get an owner to sell. There's a lot of property for sale in Italy because family sizes are small and the kids want to get out of lesser populated areas because there's no fun (for them) and not much work. But choice properties and those of the gentry will almost never go on the market.

Doing that is much more difficult being isolated out in the countryside. Plus, we don't want a car. We can find whatever we want close in, and the train station is a ten minute walk. Bari, large city on the coast to the NE is an hour and 20 minutes on the train. Bonus: Ikea Bari is on the train line. Much of our household goods came from there. Our kitchen will be installed by them in a few weeks.

Acclimating as a resident seems like it would be a lot different than going even as a long-stay tourist.I applied for Italian citizenship a few months ago before we left. I can do so as the spouse of an Italian citizen. Had to provide my birth and citizenship docs, and letters with apostilles from the states I lived in since 14 which stated that I didn't have a criminal record. Process takes about two years. In the meantime, I have a multiple-entry family visa that is good for a year, that I got from the San Francisco Consulate, which services Oregon where I last lived stateside. Next week, I go to the provincial capital (Taranto) office of the state police to apply for my green card. With that, I am legal to stay in the country and my visa can expire without issue. Eventually, my citizenship should come through and obviate the green card. Re: language, both of us listened to the Pimsleur language course in Italian over and over for several years, and from that got a pretty good basic handle on ordinary daily dialogue, syntax, and verb forms. We also read a lot of Italian language teaching texts. With all of the latinate words that have been incorporated into English, it's really not that difficult to guess at a word, particularly verbs, if it's not clear. Plus, we're both two-time returned Peace Corps Volunteers with a lot of language experience, so we kind of have the knack. Italian is a hell of lot easier to pick up than Thai, Lao, Nepali, or Tharu. 36 posts
