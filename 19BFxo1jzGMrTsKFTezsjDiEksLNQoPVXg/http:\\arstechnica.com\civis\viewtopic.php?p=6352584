              USAF weather dude working near Ramstein. Living overseas is amazing (as I post from a hotel room in France) and the compensation is more than I was expecting... but I'll probably be force shaped out next year. I have mixed feelings about the "clown college", so hit me up privately if you have any specific questions.

              Visi: I'm going to Australia for a year in November. They're crying out for IT people. My friend applied for his Visa last Monday morning. He filled in a form on the embassy website, and by 3pm that day he had an email saying his visa was approved. It's a one year "working holiday" visa, with an option to extend it for another year. You can only work for one company for 6 months, though. Perfect for working for a bit, saving every penny, then going travelling until the money runs out, rinse, repeat.<BR><BR>Join me. <img src="http://media.arstechnica.com/forum/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt="Big Grin" width="15" height="15"><!--graemlin::D-->

              You've said that you're 99% sure that a layoff is coming.

Are you ready for less expensive digs, part-time or night work, and school?

Maybe you can find a job or 2, one that will give you tuition reimbursement?<BR><BR>You could always head towards the midwest, or maybe New Mexico?

              I saw this thread the other day, but figured that it must be a piss-take.<BR><BR>Choosing between Australia and New Zealand would be largely a matter of preference. NZ is a little colder, a lot smaller, and in my experience even the more significant cities had a bit of a 'country town' feel to them (but it's a few years since I've spent any serious time over there, and that may have changed).<BR><BR>NZ citizens are effectively treated the same as Australian citizens in Australia, and one of the problems that NZ has is that many of its bright young people come over to Australia to work.<BR><BR>Australia has a skilled migration program. I'm not sure about all the details, but you can read about it <A HREF="http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-skilled-migration/index.htm" TARGET=_blank>here</A>. I have a mate who works in immigration (although its the bit concerned with kicking people out, not letting them in), so if you have any specific queries, I might be able to get them answered.<BR><BR>Having recently tried to employ an IT person, I can tell you we have a massive skills shortage in Canberra (although being from LA, Canberra might be a bit chilly for you).

              Career enlisted Navy with 12 years experience here.<BR><BR>PM me if you want to discuss it.<BR><BR>For Navy IT pukes, they have one catchall "job", or Rate: Information Technician<BR><BR>They work in two areas essentially: radio/comms and IT. In one section, they run the LAN, do trouble calls for user and hardware problems, and admin the servers onboard ship. The other section handles the software side of communications.<BR><BR>The Navy has contracted out all of it's shore installation IT chores to EDS ($4 <I>billion</I> and counting it has cost EDS to date; I gould go on for days about how well it isn't working), so unfortunately IT is now a mainly shipboard rate. That is, they are assigned to a ship more often and for longer stretches of time than they are assigned to a shore installation.<BR><BR>The Navy is also in the midst of a 33,000 person drawdown, so advancement to the next higher paygrade is getting pretty tight in some rates (mine, for instance. <img src="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/groupee_common/emoticons/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" width="15" height="15"><!--graemlin::mad:--> )<BR><BR>We don't deploy as a general rule as much as our bretheren services, but we do go, sometimes for 10 months at a time. 6-7 months is the average. However, except for a few cases, we don't go anywhere particularly hazardous. No roadside bombs can get you while you are 35 miles out to sea, for example. That being said, the Navy has started to send individuals in country to Iraq and Afghanistan, performing admin and supply puke type jobs so that some soldiers can get some slack in their rotation schedule.<BR><BR>Staying in the L.A. area is out, though, since Long Beach Shipyard is closed. Closest would be San Diego, or Naval Air Station Pt. Magu up by Santa Barbara.

              What about getting a degree overseas? I know for instance for Belgium it's reasonably simple to get a time-limited visa to study, and well, uni here is cheap compared to the US...Sure it'll be time-limited for the course of the degree, but that can always be changed after the fact. Also remember that once you get a visa for a .eu country, it's fairly easy to hop between coutries here.<BR><BR>The thing I don't understand is that from reading what you wrote, it sounds like you're tired with your living situation (and I bet a lack of friends contributes greatly to that), unhappy in IT,you want to study, so what's holding you back? Even if it's moving to the bible belt, remember, you can do tat for a few years and save up and then move elsewhere or something?

              One of the main reasons I'm "fed up", is with the current sociopolitical climate in the USA. I hate it. It's based on religious dogma, superstition and selfishness. <BR><BR>I'd much rather attempt to immigrate to a country that falls more in line with my own personal philosophy than (unsuccessfully) attempt to integrate myself into the populace of the USA. <BR><BR>As far as studying abroad, well, that intreagues me too.

Youve got the smug cunts in the south, vs the grim up North, the sheep fucking welsh and the Manaical scots.  You have political bullshit on a level that makes your head spin. Arcaic laws and legislation, taxation that makes no fucking sense, gas that costs more per litre than you pay per gallon in the US.<BR><BR>EVERYTHING is smaller and limited, you know how you go to the store and theres an isle for cereal and 200 different choices, in the UK, good luck over 15-20 choices.  The TV is limited unless you get -limited- cable or satellite tv and then its 6months to a year behind the US for popular shoes.  BT has a monopoly on the telecoms (still), good luck getting stable high speed and not paying out the arse for it.<BR><BR>Denmark, fantastic country, great healthcare system, but from friends living there, immigration is causing huge tensions. Full of lego and small island, lots of lovely women around.<BR><BR> France, lovely people bar the parisians, paralysed by political nonsense and a general malaise for the on french.<BR><BR>Italy, not been there, political turmoil that boils over, fanatical soccer fans.<BR><BR>Spain, even more fanatical soccer fans, lovely weather, far too many sweaty brits on holiday, political nightmare, terrorist problems.<BR><BR>Germany, the finest cars in europe, a mad motorway/freeway system, great beer, great food, absolutely no sense of humour.<BR><BR>Switzerland, everyone has an automatic weapon in their closet, crime is almost nil, anal to the extent that your neighbours will sic the police on you if you dont wash your car or rake up your lawn.<BR><BR>Nordic regions, Sweden, Finland, Norway, fucking cold 6 months a year, very little between them and the north pole than the odd horny reindeer, highest suicide rate in the world, simply because for 6 months a year theres nothing to do but drink and fuck, and theres only so many gorgeous blondes you can handle. Oh and 60% taxation rates, great cars too.<BR><BR>Belgium, chocolates, french fries with mayoinaise and Hercule Poiriot, fucking weird people.<BR><BR>Holland, fantastic country, great infrastructure, lots of high speed around, lots of immigrants fucking it up.

              First off, the degree thing is crap, at least domestically.  If you <I>really</I> have ten years of solid, provable IT experience (and given that you say you're 25, I think it'd probably be best to underestimate), you CAN get a very well paying IT job.  You just need to be either actively looking now or get the fuck out of California.  I have no degree, nor even a high school diploma, but I'm making much more than what they're paying you even though I'm only claiming six years of experience.  It's tough to "break in," but once you land a "real" position, you're made.<BR><BR>It takes a lot of bullshit to get to that point, though.  I was unemployed for a full year and then had to work in a non-IT field for six months before I was able to get back in IT and double my salary.<BR><BR><BR>If you <I>do</I> want a degree, I agree that going overseas is a much better idea than attending some $150k domestic diploma mill.  <BR><BR><BR>Also, don't discount the Foreign Service.  Someone already mentioned it, and it's an amazing deal if you can swing it.  I'm not talking Foreign Service <I>Officer</I>, either, just standard IT specialist positions.<BR><BR>They pay for your (ridiculously nice) housing and since you'll be posted overseas, the first ~$80k you make will be tax-free.<BR><BR><BR>Military is always an option as that door is not likely to close in the future.  If you do decide to join, though, I would suggest considering using the opportunity to learn a new skill, as opposed to further specializing in IT.  You only live once.

Thats basically outside the "495 Belt" (or, the suburbs West of Boston).  There is housing that is just as cheap in/around Boston, but don't be suprised to hear about murders going down around you. <img src="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/groupee_common/emoticons/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" width="15" height="15"><!--graemlin:;)--><BR><BR>But there is cheaper housing than that, in decent areas of the Central - Eastern Mass area.  As of late, I have been checking out Craig's List, and seeing some nice places (and we're talking 2BR apartments that take up whole floors of multi-family houses) for about 600-800.  It's all about looking around the area and determining what is best for you, as I'm sure that you are aware of that already.<BR><BR>IT related: From what I remember from your past posts, you seem to have a heavy knowledge when it comes to IT.  If you want, I may be able to hook you up with a guy that might have some work for you.  Granted, its on an as-needed basis, but it may work in your favor.  Also, as I said before, I work for a prestigous job board, I may be able to help you out there as well if you are truly interested.<BR><BR>And I know you stressed the fact about not really wanting to go back to school, but have you considered part-time? <BR><BR>check out <A HREF="http://www.wit.edu" TARGET=_blank>www.wit.edu</A> &lt;- that is the school I attend for night classes towards my bachelor's degree... about 6k/year for tuition alone.  Wentworth is one of the better technology schools in the area, and I have heard various recruiters telling me about the students that come out of the school.  My friend's father works as one of the top-notch software developers for Intel, and he says he will take  anyone with a Wentworth degree before any other school.  But enough about that pimpage <img src="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/groupee_common/emoticons/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" width="15" height="15"><!--graemlin:;)-->  <BR><BR>I say, if you have the time / coin, come out for a week to check it out and see if things might/will work out.  Sounds like you should have better luck out here than in LA.

They're crying out for IT people. My friend applied for his Visa last Monday morning. He filled in a form on the embassy website, and by 3pm that day he had an email saying his visa was approved. It's a one year "working holiday" visa, with an option to extend it for another year. You can only work for one company for 6 months, though. Perfect for working for a bit, saving every penny, then going travelling until the money runs out, rinse, repeat. </div></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>The United States is not a part of the working holiday program.
