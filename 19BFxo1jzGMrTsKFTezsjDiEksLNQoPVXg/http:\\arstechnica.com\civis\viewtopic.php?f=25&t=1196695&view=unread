              My career seems to be at a standstill because I suck at / don't play office politics.<br /><br />I have been the technical lead on many projects but frequently my design decisions run up against someone else's prejudices, or who wants my resources who is better at office politics. I try to make my design decisions based on the product constraints and the business needs and keep everything data driven. When arguing a position I stick to the facts and  present the data and method the decision was reached. Unfortunately when presented with overwhelming facts, the typical response has been to trash me behind my back to senior management. I then have to justify myself to senior management where they have been told I'm an idiot and don't know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />So what am I doing wrong and how can I improve?

              My guess is that you are stepping on toes and bruising some egos with your no-nonsense, completely logical way of doing things.<br /><br />I would say learn to schmooze a little.  Talk about sports for a little bit before telling someone you need to steal their people.  Acknowledge that someone's project has value before saying your's has priority.<br /><br />Stuff like that.

Being friendly.  Showing an interest in others.  Being something other than a robot geek.

              AngelZero, you got it backwards. There's a place for politically inept people in the right <span style="font-style: italic">role</span>. Certain roles require it. It sounds to me that PoM here gets positions in a role where politics is part of the job. Switching companies isn't going to do it if he can't find a different role that plays more to his strengths.<br /><br />PoM tell us more about your relationships with your peers and your bosses. Tell us more about the sorts of politically-influenced activities you perform. Heck, remind us what you do.

I am usually the technical lead for software development responsible for architecting the software, managing the software schedule, and breaking up tasks to junior engineers and providing technical guidance. I collaborate with the project managers, marketing leads refining the product requirements. I also work with the technical leads of other disciplines such as the electrical team and mechanical team to define the system boundaries. I also work with QA coming up with test strategies and prioritizing and resolving issues.<br /><br />I would say I have worked well with all of these people, and many have given me recommendations and followed me to other jobs. While i do have an INTJ personality and don't schmooze much, I do interact often and well with others at a professional level.<br /><br />The instances where I had a knife thrown in my back were with other silos in the organization. One instance was one group was developing a cadillac product, our group was tasked with developing a cost sensitive product. The tech lead of the cadillac product wanted us to reuse the work they had done. I evaluated it and it was too costly to use because our product was cost sensitive. During that time the company was being acquired and re-orgs were happening, people were making political moves and unwilling to really stick their necks out.  While the PM and rest of team agreed with me but I was the one that had to defend the decision to senior management. After a month of meetings on the issue without resolve, I quit taking 2 coworkers with me to a new job.

              Reorganizations suck.  I would not make that into a trend. <br /><br />Your description of your job suggests to me that you are putting together the technical part of a project and the PM would then be the one that makes it into a complete project, including things like budgeting and scheduling. Is this the case? A PM would have to own any project you develop or help develop, right?

              The PM maintains the overall project schedule and budget. I maintain a more detailed schedule that feeds into theirs. Resources are negotiated between my manager and the PM based on the schedule and other projects priority. Ultimately the PM owns the overall project but defers to the tech leads on technical details.

              Just remember, the one constant in all of your failed relationships is you. <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/wink.png" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />You might have had the bad luck to always end up at terrible companies. Or you could be rubbing people the wrong way. It's pretty much impossible to tell from writings on the internet.<br /><br />I will tell you this, I can't remember ever being thrown under a bus by someone who I had a cordial working relationship with. I'm sure at some point I got stabbed in the back by someone who was friendly with me and then went to my boss. But I make a real effort to be friendly and pleasant with people, and it usually results in them giving me the benefit of the doubt. <br /><br />Let me put it this way: you have two competing projects that both want your attention. All other things being equal, you'll probably prioritize the project whose PM is always nice and occasionally brings in donuts over the PM who once yelled at you for something that was really their fault and who never apologized for it. <br /><br />It's the way of the world. So you might as well make it work for you. Ask people about their kids. Talk about last night's baseball game. Bring coffee to a meeting. If you find out you have a common interest with someone, talk about it. <br /><br />If you think maybe you're not communicating well with people, join a group like toast masters. <br /><br />It's quite possible that, because you're always looking for a job when the last one went sour, you're rushing into gigs with terrible corporate cultures. But I see absolutely no harm in working to improve how you relate to your colleagues. Even if you still get thrown under the occasional bus, at least you got to enjoy some coffee and pleasant chit-chat before it happened.<br /><br />This is something that I learned the hard way, BTW. I've always had great rapport with my end users. But I managed to butt heads with my boss at my old job so badly that it was pretty much toxic. I steadfastly maintain that I was totally right about 99% of the time. He had no idea what he was doing. But I handled it badly, and it made my work environment almost unbearable. If I'd worked to preserve our cordial relationship, I think I would have been a lot happier there. And I might have had much better opportunities when I was at that job.

              PS. I don't tell other women I like their shoes just to make them like me. I tell them I like their shoes when I actually <span style="font-style: italic">like </span>their shoes. I say hi to the security guards when I'm leaving, because it's a pleasant ritual that makes <span style="font-style: italic">me </span>happy. I bring in leftover baked goods because I enjoy sharing things with my office mates.<br /><br />Don't start asking people about their kids just because you need to tick something off on your &quot;I'm a good coworker&quot; checklist. People will sense that you're being disingenuous and they will usually end up disliking you because of it. If you have a complimentary thought about someone, verbalize it (as long as it's work appropriate). If you need to kill time, shoot the breeze with someone. It makes work more pleasant for everyone.<br /><br />I don't say hi to the security guards for any other reason than I like saying hi to them. But I'll tell you that it will definitely not hurt to be friendly with them if I ever get locked out of my office.

A friend of mine fits neatly into that model and didn't do well with a number of companies at all until he found a particular firm that valued facts/figures/logic over schmoozing.

You're giving off a vibe not of trying to help the project succeed, but of trying to get other people pushed out of your way.  That's not a bad thing for the company if your way is actually right and they're actually wrong - if you can help highlight true incompetence and root it out, bully for you.  But as you've found, being right often isn't enough.  You have two choices:<br /><br />1) Offer solutions that don't threaten your peers, if it can be avoided.<br /><br />2) Anticipate possible objections, and come up with a proactive plan to mitigate them.  As dazd suggested, this might mean you &quot;socialize&quot; your idea up the org chart first before formally presenting it.  Present it with a pro/con analysis and how it will impact other areas.  Just show that you're thinking it through and not just charging ahead like a bull in a china shop, consequences be damned.

Whoops!<br /><br />I think that it's crucial to build up a rapport with people. Which is why I tend to vocalize my &quot;hey, nice shoes&quot; thoughts and ask people about their kids and complain about the Patriots secondary. <br /><br />You just have to be careful... because if you think their shoes are ugly (or their shoes are boring loafers, so it makes no sense to compliment them) or you don't really care at all about sports, it's likely to come across as disingenuous. Especially if you have a tendency to rub people the wrong way. <br /><br />I've also gotten very good at telling people &quot;no&quot; while leaving them with the impression that I'm being extremely helpful. There's a bit of an art to it, but it mostly involves giving them other options and being very firm with them. <br /><br />I'm a work in progress (aren't we all?). I just got a bit snippy with a guy in the office who tends to be rather vociferously wrong about things. I got a little too vociferous and telling him that he was incorrect. He did come back and say &quot;oh, yeah, you were right&quot; but I still probably came off as a jerk in the way I said it. It's something that I'm working on.<br /><br />My mantra these days is, &quot;I don't care about being right. I care about being effective.&quot; You can have all of the facts on your side, but people will still make the wrong decision if you tick them off or make the wrong argument.

              Thanks, Hopers. That clarifies.<br /><br />Pastor, it helps if you think of personal items as another aspect of your project. Project stakeholders (other engineers, upper management, customers) are resources. Convincing project stakeholders is another set of tasks equally important to all of your technical items. To offer an example, a project to open a datacenter might have the following high-level tasks:<br />-Confirm physical structure: raised floor strength, security, fire suppression, etc.<br />-Acquire electrical circuits to provide sufficient power.<br />-Purchase server hardware and racks.<br />-Reserve 150 man-hours for physical installation.<br />-Reserver 200 man-hours for server configuration.<br /><br />A good engineer will thinks of these things. But a good project manager has to add a few items:<br />-Present project proposal to upper management. Obtain signed approval from a project sponsor.<br />-Verify working schedule for human resources in the last 2 bullet points. Contact their supervisors.<br />-Consult with other engineers about their projects. Offer help when possible.<br />-Clarify the project's benefit to co-workers and first-line supervisors.<br />-Request technical input from team members.<br /><br />Each of these are social, personal, or &quot;soft&quot; skills that are vital to your career. If you think of them as just schmoozing or &quot;office politics,&quot; you'll never get a handle on it. If you view them as just another engineering task; if you put &quot;Get that jerk Gary to sign off on this&quot; at the same level &quot;Make sure they installed enough cabling&quot;; then you'll be fine.

One instance was one group was developing a cadillac product, our group was tasked with developing a cost sensitive product. The tech lead of the cadillac product wanted us to reuse the work they had done. I evaluated it and it was too costly to use because our product was cost sensitive. During that time the company was being acquired and re-orgs were happening, people were making political moves and unwilling to really stick their necks out.  While the PM and rest of team agreed with me but I was the one that had to defend the decision to senior management. After a month of meetings on the issue without resolve, I quit taking 2 coworkers with me to a new job.</div><br /><br />What was your relationship between yourself and the tech lead of the cadillac product before everything went down?<br /><br />When and how did you decline to use the cadillac product? Was this in front of members of the cadillac group and senior members of management? Or was this in a private discussion with the tech lead? Or somewhere in between?<br /><br />It's likely that while the company was being acquired, members of the cadillac product group felt they needed to show new management that their product was <span style="font-weight: bold">IMPORTANT AND POPULAR</span> within the company. That may be why you were asked to use their product. They may have felt threatened by your refusal to cooperate with their request and thus fear and hate lead to the dark side.<br /><br />One possible strategy is to publicly praise but always claim lack of bandwidth to integrate the production at this time. If you truly thought the cadillac product was inappropriate, you keep delaying and praising until the crisis passes.

              Here's a good case study for you:<br /><br />There's a guy in our office who isn't in my direct line of command, but he is in a position of authority. He's not my boss, but he can give me projects to work on, and he's usually the one who sends us home early the day before a long weekend. <br /><br />Yesterday, he was flapping around the office, wringing his hands over finding the stuff he needed to work from home today. The weather was supposed to be nasty (and it sure is).<br /><br />Now, the thing is, this guy works a job that he *can* do remotely, which I can't do. And he's definitely higher up in the food chain. So, he was technically correct in getting his ducks together and then heading out. But.... it definitely rubbed everyone else in the office the wrong way. He very much had the attitude of taking care of himself, and not caring about anyone else's safety (he has the easiest/safest commute out of any of us). <br /><br />If he'd said, &quot;let's stay in touch tomorrow in case the weather gets bad&quot; or even just said to drive safe, it would have been no big deal. Instead, he came across as a self-centered douche. It was very much an attitude of &quot;well, I'm going to stay safe, screw all of you.&quot; I'm a big girl, I know it's my job to drive in unless the governor declares a state of emergency. That's why I have snow tires. But when a coworker acts like his own concerns trumps everybody else, people notice.<br /><br />You can be 100% right about something and still have everyone shaking their heads about you.

I try to make my design decisions based on the product constraints and the business needs and keep everything data driven. When arguing a position I stick to the facts and  present the data and method the decision was reached. Unfortunately when presented with overwhelming facts, the typical response has been to trash me behind my back to senior management. I then have to justify myself to senior management where they have been told I'm an idiot and don't know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />So what am I doing wrong and how can I improve?</div><br /><br />If being trashed to senior management for performance, your protection is documentation (at least in any company of any size).  Document what you do, how you do, and why.  Be able to prove your value.  <br /><br />In addition you indicate that you overwhelm people with facts.  Perhaps you do not have the ability/skill set to present information to upper management in appropriate bite sized form?  Usually, the more senior the person you are presenting to, the less data you are supposed to be showing (the implication being the support data has already been vetted/is accurate).<br /><br />If being trashed for your personality, make sure you look at if they have a point in how you interact with others.

Maybe that's the dreaded small talk. Or maybe that's just checking in on a regular schedule to discuss the state of affairs.<br /><br />In a political environment, be proactive about managing your resources and do some 'walking around' where you sync up with important people and what they are thinking. If you had found out that a rival was trying to affect your project plan earlier, you would have had a better chance at damage control. Maybe even going to the guy directly and coming to a compromise of sorts. <br /><br />It's still not too late to go to that guy and discuss how to build the cheaper version with the resources available. Although you may have to swallow some pride and take a few aspirin for the b*tt-hurt.  <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />If you read about how managers and directors in highly effective environments like Apple and Google, you will find there is a lot of walking around and talking, building communications networks and resource allies. That's not to say that everything is peachy, but there is a give and a take.

              I haven't found a good game theory book that applies game theory to how people really think. In order to apply the math, you have to understand what peoples' payoffs are, and that's really not very obvious at times.<br /><br />Ex. I had one woman be nasty to me when she was supposed to train me. Did not understand that in this particular instance, me learning her skill could be a direct threat to her livelihood. This is the 'obvious in hindsight' answer.
