I'm in a bit of a rut lately when it comes to moves and TV and need some suggestions. The more cerebral, imaginative, quirky, visual the better.Some examples of things I've really enjoyed in the past:- Senna- Le Mans- Paprika- Gattaca- Anything from Miyazaki, Kubrick- Little Miss Sunshine- Trinity and Beyond- The Fog of War- Cosmos- Connections- Amelie- Thank You for Smoking- Helvetica- Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex- Cowboy Bebop- The Girl Who Leapt Through Time- Babylon 5I've got the likes of Waltz with Bashir, Moon, and Pi in the queue, along with re-watching the likes of Big Fish, Syriana, The Sky Crawlers, et al. Otherwise I'm running out of ideas...

I suggest 8 hours of straight Teletubbies followed by almost anything else. After that long almost anything else will seem cerebral.

All of these should be available for instant streaming on Netflix.Ink: A low-budget film where there are a few occasional mishaps that draw attention to the fact. I don't think they end up detracting too heavily, though. There are some well-choreographed fights that took me by surprise as a lot of the style and themes are oneiric.Lo: This is even lower-budget than Ink and a lot of the visual quirkiness comes from the fact that it was originally a play. I found the gestalt captivating for what's essentially a dialogue.I didn't see any Korean movies in your list so here are three you might like.Oldboy: I couldn't find an official trailer and the iconic scenes don't work well out of context anyway. Of these, this one is probably closest to what you want for quirky with a lot of visual flair as it has the budget to realize the action. The rest of Park's thematic revenge trilogy is also worth checking out if you find you like this.Mother: The chiastic opening and ending scenes are my favorites. For something slower-paced and dramatic, there's actually a few impactful action scenes.The Host: A hilarious near spoof of the monster movie. There's quite a lot of symbolism and the obvious themes (environmentalism, nationalism) whose presentations grated at first grew on me as the drama developed.

If you don't mind slow pacing, Wong Kar Wai's films are pretty great. Chungking Express, In the Mood for Love, and Happy Together are all worth watching.

Leverage (TNT TV series) note that John Rogers, showrunner, is a huge fan of comics, anime, RPGs, and movie and TV sf in general. Even though Leverage isn't any of the above, a lot of fans of the above do seem to like Leverage. Sherlock (BBC series. There are only six eps so far, so catching up will be easy)

I'd say watch as many Bud Spencer and Terrence Hill movies (they often star together).A lot of Bud Spencers movies pretend to be in the USA, but they're either in Spain if it's westerns, or in Panama if not (Banana Joe is in Colombia).Apart from the epic fight scenes, they're usually also have an underlying theme about fighting corruption, protecting the weak, the nature etc. The nature thing is especially prevaliant in the movies he wrote himself (the later ones).He's a very fascinating character, people probably didn't realise that he was the first Italian to swim the 100 meters under 1 minute, or were at the olympics on the Italian water polo team (or that he wrote the music, flew the planes and helicopters, directed some of the movies etc.).http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_SpencerTerence Hill is also a fascinating character, and I agree with him that My Name is Nobody is the best of his movies not together with Bud Spencer.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Hill---Here in Denmark you can pick the movies up on DVD for 2-4USD new, when you can find them. Or well, you know where they're available.I worked as a translator for quite some time, putting subtitles on English spoken movies. And once had to do a 10 pack of Bud Spencer movies. Worst job ever. All the actors speak Italian, and are dubbed to English, they were easy to subtitle. But Bud Spencer and Terrence Hill spoke English and where dubbed to Italian for that market, and unfortunatly Bud Spencer mumbles. Any ways, try picking one up, say, Banana Joe. Bud Spencer wrote the script for that one.

If you do Downfall (in German with English subtitles of course), you might as well also get the original release of Das Boot (the TV series, not the movie, not the directors cut, the full lenght TV series (if you absolutely can't find the TV series, then your torrent fu is weak, but directors cut is acceptable as a substitution.) and Stalingrad.I can recommend them all.

Maybe Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? Pretty much different from anything else, and quirky. But not really like anything you listed.Then again, it isn't like any movies I usually like, and I don't like Clooney to boot, but I still love that movie.Oh, for imaginative, Secret of Kells. You can Netflix stream it. Absolutely beautiful style.

Probably not quirky by Lounge standards, but I would think that the 5th Element would fit; certainly on the imaginative and quirky fronts. Probably one of the best stand alone scifi films of the last 20 years.

I have another out-of-left-field suggestion. If you like narrative shenanigans, watch Last Year at Marienbad. It is french, surrealist, and 'meta' in a surprisingly modern way. If you dig that, check out Cocteau's Orphee, a 50s surrealist retelling of the Myth of Orpheus.

The weirdness of the movie makes more sense when you watch the extras. They tried to keep the movie close to the book, even bringing in members of Philip K Dick's estate to help them sort it all out. Apparently, Alyssa Milano's family and Philip's were relatively close (she lived on the same street as the Dick children when they were young, and they knew each other I think?), so that helped them all get together to make the movie. The book was his way to work through his own periods of heavy drug use, paranoia, and mental illness. So the story is actually Philip K Dick's commentary of how fucked up his own mind was.

Some more additions:The CellContactThe 13th Floor. Personally, my opinion of why this movie never did well is because it has a kinda slow plot, and it came out at the same time as the first Matrix movie, which pretty much crushed it.Pandorum2001: A Space Odyssey. If you haven't seen one of the all time sci-fi classics, you should watch it. I saw it for the first time a few years back, and it's one of the few movies where when the credits rolled, I went "fuuuuuuuck. I liked it, but I don't know what the fuck I just saw."AIDark CityThe Ninth GateThe Secret WindowBlack SwanI don't know if many of my recommendations fit into "quirky", meaning odd but lighthearted fun, but they are definitely imaginative.

If anime is a valid suggestion, check out FLCL. You can stream the dubbed version on Netflix. I don't know that I'd describe it as cerebral, but it's .. out there.

Have you watched The Adventures of Brisco County Jr. lately? I was surprised how well that held up.Zanshin wrote:2001: A Space Odyssey.

So you're left feeling, "I know I wasn't really supposed to understand that, but I thought that I did for a while."If Lexx is cerebral, I wonder which brain you're thinking with. I tried to watch it on Hulu, and I made it through the first six or seven hours, but man it's awful. It's like the plot writers for Enterprise took the characters from Jersey Shore, studied production values from 1960s Dr. Who, and tried to do a dark gritty reboot of Flight of the Navigator.

Monolith appears to apes: Apes get tasty meat. All the humans in space? They're eating processed crap (even the restaurant on the orbital is a "Howard Johnson's") Then Dave goes through the monolith. Just before he evolves into space babby, he's shown eating a real, prepared meal, with knife and fork.The monolith creators are just interested in making sure we eat well.

So you're left feeling, "I know I wasn't really supposed to understand that, but I thought that I did for a while."Occasionally I'll notice cross connections between things that blow my mind. I was watching some episodes of the documentary series called The Universe (available on Netflix streaming), and they were discussing the current understanding of our solar system, and how it relates to Jupiter. Most star systems that resemble ours tend to be dual star systems, however ours isn't. Stars are basically giant balls of hydrogen gas, where the mass causes enough pressure that nuclear fusion takes place (fusing hydrogen into helium). If a star doesn't have enough pressure to create fusion, it becomes a brown dwarf. Brown dwarves are 13 to 80 times the mass of Jupiter. Jupiter itself is simply a giant ball of hydrogen gas with no solid core. So since Jupiter, brown dwarves, and stars have the exact same makeup, with their only difference being mass, some researchers argue that Jupiter is really a failed brown dwarf, which in turn is a failed star. Spoiler: show
Then I remembered the ending of 2010: The Year We Make Contact. My mind == blown.
You know what? My next recommendation is a documentary. The Universe.

I'm not fond of Pi or Napoleon Dynamite, but I understand their appeal to people who are stupid and dumb and tasteless and broken inside. I would argue that Donnie Darko is objectively a bad and otherwise overhyped movie, but I doubt I'd get very far with that argument. The Cell is amongst the most visually stunning modern movies yet made (also see Tarsem's Immortals and The Fall, which I cited previously... and let's just forget about that J-Lo bit, m'kay?). Tarsem plots are weak, but that isn't the purpose of the movie. If you want to shit on the plot, so be it, but given the request made, The Cell fits perfectly on merit of the visuals/concept alone.Amelie and 5th Element, though? Each is universally recognized as being more or less the pinnacle of its genre. That is to say, you have no idea what the hell you're on about.
