Gurk.. why didn't they do returns as a screen where you 'tick' the stuff to be returned and then submit - letting the backend deal with the negatives? Oh well, can I have that $5M if I write more half-assed code for you? rinciepurr

Finding out that your branch is being dissolved due to budget cuts sucks. It sucks more when you're looking for work and your soon-to-be-previous employer is a staffing agency.

I hate blackberries, cellphones, e-mail, voicemail, 10-4 walkie talking cell phones and generally any communication enhancing devices in the workplace. It has effectively removed the ability or willingness of anyone to make a decision and they all call three people.To make matters worse, one of those three people actually won't make a decision either and calls one of the other two.

Oh, fuck yeah!I got in at 9:30 this morning. My boss had scheduled a 1:1 with me at 9:45. I met and talked with him. I walked out with a unsolicited 5% midyear raise with talk of a bonus at the end of this year as well as a promotion next year. Man, I'm completely fucking stoked about this. This has made my week! I've been busting my ass and I've saved my company $8mil so far this year. Everyone in the upper management team recognized my effort and I'm quite happy with this. Sometimes, it actually does pay to bust your ass and when you think no one is noticing it, they actually are. Fan-fucking-tastic!

I'm going to propose a rule that no system changes be implemented after 3pm on M-W, noon on Thursday, and no system changes on Friday at all. I just had a coworker implement a change at 7pm last night and then left for the night. All hell broke loose and others are having to deal with it.

I'm still having a somewhat rough time that no one cares about most of the work that I do except for me. I get a lot of the "That's nice. I'll look into that when I get a chance." treatment most of the time. As long as the people who most influence my paycheck are happy, I'm happy.

Job searching, especially as a soon-to-be liberal arts grad, sucks. I've applied to a variety of places, but haven't heard anything back. To be quite honest, I'm getting the feeling that I'm not going to either, unless they want to talk to me. I guess it's not normal to get a "thanks, but no thanks" reply.How long does one, or should one, wait before contacting the company offering the job opportunity to follow up on the application?

My company used to have a sabbatical program. It was every 7 years, you would get 8 weeks off. It was announced this morning that it was changed to 2 weeks off every 5 years. The 2 months off every 7 years was a *huge* part for me working at this company even though I don't have plans to stay that long, but if I did that's a huge draw. Also, in this industry, there is such a steep learning curve that it is essential to keep people around that long. At this point, I was thinking about sticking around for a full 7 years, but fuck it now. I'm still going to try to enter physical therapy school in the summer of 2009.

Next year will be 7 years with my company, and I could most certainly do with 2 months off!! Was that in liue of or in addition to your vacation time?My rant?

That's in addition to our vacation time. We start off with 3 weeks per year and 11 paid holidays per year as well. It's nice but it's something that we got used to looking forward to for awhile now. I know several people that are eligible next year and the last day to claim your eligibility is Dec 30th of this year. If they gave a year's notice so they wouldn't screw people over, that would be nice but I know a lot of people that will be getting screwed over by this who have already made plans for next year. I'm betting a bunch of people will jump ship because of this. Unfortunately, I wish I was in the same position because I'm so sick of the crap that goes on here in Corporate America. At least I have a plan to get out of here and I'm working towards it.

Well, I'll filing suit against my bank in the Small Claims Court this weekend I've been looking forward to this, though I was hoping more that they'd cave early. The SCC rocks - true, lawyer-free justice for the people, the way it should be - and normally resolves issues quite speedily. Unfortunately the OFT have setup a test case on the issue (unlawful bank charges) and both they and the FOS have agreed that they will not act any more to help consumers till after the test case. Banks, including mine, that agreed to cooperate with the OFT following the result of this test case have been exonerated from not taking action at this time. Still, that's the OFT and FOS - I still have recourse to the SCC and even if the bank persuade the judge to defer judgement till after the test case resolves next spring I will still have my claim filed. Apparently it's a good idea to file anyway even if the case gets delayed. I stand to recuperate over £2000. That will be used to pay off my outstanding debts and put a few hundred into a savings account.Fingers crossed [Edit] - OFT = Office of Fair Trading, consumer champions. FOS = Financial Ombudsman Service, a government industry regulator who can intervene in disputes between financial companies and consumers.

Well, MySpace finally got blocked at work. No biggie though. The messaging portion used to be blocked but now the entire site is blocked. I'm sure it was because people would still get on they're (sic) all day long and browse profiles, listen to music, watch videos, etc. Facebook is still available though.I also had a great quote today: quote:I understand that the issue is complex.

It's bad enough that I'm handling personnel work for 325 people. It's worse because they're split between two different companies, so I have to deal with two finance departments, two compensation departments, two legal departments, two payroll departments on different HRIS systems, etc.One company has a straightforward system hampered by a few power-trip personalities who choose to complicate the implementation of anything. The other requires me to obtain five signatures from four different administrators just to process a freaking $80 retroactive pay adjustment.I have ordered many sharp pointy objects from Corporate Express. One day there may be bloodshed.

I have to do an annual self-assessment every year.The nice part is that there is a "do not add to my file" option. Since my current job has no vertical movement, and it won't be on my permanent file, I don't have to be paranoid that what I write in it will influence the rest of my career. So I put in jokes, I can tell the truth, and in general don't stress about it. It feels nice while I watch my coworkers freak out.

quote:Originally posted by Auritania:IT people and computer programmers are NOT the people to design your logistics system. Clever and elegant to them always equates to disaster in the warehouse. What pinhead decided that return requests should use the order system with the user entering negatives instead of positives? Think about it.... open shipping window, enter negative quantities and voila! elegant solution to creating a dedicated returns form. Brilliant!! So far 2 out of 3 returns have ended up as orders because people don't remember to put that little negative sign in front. But it gets better!So your return ends up being a ship order. The customer gets double what they don't want. Ok, create ANOTHER return order. Christ on a pogo stick! They forgot that minus sign again on 1/2 the returns!! Now, customers have FOUR TIMES as much to return. But, here is the sexy part. You coders were really clever and coded the system to not print any orders with less than 1 item. Lets see... -100 is less than 1. Hmmm... business is very good! Customers haven't returned anything and lots of them are ordering twice or four times as much as usual!!Ok, pinhead, reality sets in. What's your elegant solution to the problem? Oh, yeah... have someone use PrtScr to get a snapshot of the order screen showing the minus amounts and fax those printouts to the warehouses. That worked really well. All those pretty colors and cool graphics on the order screen? Then don't show up in black and white. Yup. Paper, pencil and fax machine to the rescue. Did I mention that we get the same orders dropped to us randomly every 3-5 days? Or that Tampa is shipping to San Francisco and San Francisco seems to only get orders for Detroit? Detroit doesn't mind. They are being told to duplicate the orders.Your $5M upgrade has been reduced to people faxing handwritten notes to each other. Transportation costs have increased over $400k per month. Customer satisfaction is in the basement. Inventory is so out of control that the system shows $25M less in inventory than what you bought and receivables have jumped from 30 days to beyond 90. Your IT consultants would seem to be the only ones making any money. Their solution? Find new warehouses. Wow. Stories like this make me feel really good about the work that I do.I have a LOT of "digital duct-tape" that I've written and deployed for a variety of reasons, and some of it I consider rather embarrasing, even if it does do the job. Sometimes quality takes a back seat to 'get this fixed NOW' or 'stop wasting your time working on system X'.But even the WORST stuff I've written is miles better than this.

ONE phone call. That's all it takes.One phone call that's both incredibly good and bad all at the same time. It's good to be recognized by an international company. It's good that they have the faith in you to tell you to just do it. It's good that they tell you to charge whatever you want within reason. It's good that they know they can depend on you without hesitation.But... damn. Is this going to be the breaking point? Is this where I will finally be promoted to my level of incompetence? I've got less than 30 days and the clock was started before I even knew there was a clock. Is this going to finally break me? Everyone is positive I can do this... except me.

I'll get it done. But for how long and what cost? My job has put me in the hospital before so there isn't much reason to expect it can't do it again. I wonder if I shouldn't just give it all up and go to work for someone else. I've got enough standing offers out there.I need to find a bit of money, find another facility and start receiving operations within 30 days and shipping 5 days after that. That's on top of keeping my existing 3 facilities up and running. I've quadrupled business in the last 180 days. This little call will more than double that again. One can grow too fast and growing pains can be exceedingly painful. Then, there is the whole chicken and egg thing with the money and facilities. Need the money to get the buildings. Need the buildings to get the work. Need the work to get the money. But that's probably a whole topic itself.

I'm leaving my job, hopefully, in about a year and a half to go back to grad school to start a second career. I'm thinking now about how to turn in my resignation. Should I try to get fired? I don't want to do that. Should I take 2 weeks vacation and on the Friday before I go on vacation, pack up my desk and turn in my resignation? Should I shit on my boss' desk and see what he says about it? What other fun but halfway serious ways should I turn in my 2 weeks notice? Right now, my safe bet is to turn in a letter that says something like "My last day of employment will be $date." I'm not saying thanks for the time or apologizing for leaving or anything like that. I'm just saying that I'm leaving.

Management decided that our latest shipment of equipment should all be delivered in the span of 3 weeks in December. Almost nothing came during the month of November but now it's all here and we have to have 1000 contractors running amok trying to run pipe and electrical to it while engineers have to work 20 straight 12s with no additional compensation or days off (that's thru xmas too). When asked about schedule american manager laughed, "being exempt employee means you are exempt from labor laws". Way to embrace the holiday spirit.If you can't find a PS3 this xmas it's because we hijacked the cargo jets Sony had previously chartered to fly them here. We create stress for no good reason. My review is coming up and none of my managers (plural) even speak the same language as me (literaly, not figuratively). Bah!

^^^^Yeah, that shit that is causing problems for us as well because our Facilities guys can't find anyone to get our tools installed. Our management does nearly the exact same thing though. We either don't have any tools coming in for months at a time or we have 5 tools being installed at once and none of them can get installed fast enough. It's also funny as hell because I have conversations like this a lot.Mgmt: We need ToolX. What's the lead time on it?Me: The lead time is 9 months, but one time we were able to get it in 7 months.Mgmt: Well, we need it here in 3 months.Me: I really wish more decisions were made through logic instead of people trying to impress their boss.

Yesterday I was home sick. In a (thankfully) unrelated turn of events, there was a significant production issue with the site, nothing that took it down but it did hae most of my department scurrying around and staying up late to fix things.Today we got a "good job" email forwarded from our VP. I replied back to my boss asking him to let me know if there was any possible way I could be less useful the next time there's a big issue like this.This is another example of how I'm not really cut out to be a manager.

So I decided it's time to prepare for a job search, because the duties of my current position are 75% payroll, and 75% of that is dealing with the university's payroll setup (which makes me seriously homicidal). Anyway, I was going to take my time in studying the current job market, matching my skills against those being requested, taking a couple months to polish up the critical ones, networking with the local HR chapter, etc. I attended a job seekers group run by the chapter and received some fantastic advice from a career management consultant. Great, come February or March I'll be an irresistible candidate.And then a casual online search turns up a job posting.... it's as if I wrote up a description of exactly the next step I want to take in my career. Whoa. They've been actively recruiting for the position since October, but perhaps it's been difficult to find someone with HR skills and IT skills with biotech/healthcare industry experience. That's me in a nutshell.Resume submitted this morning. Nervous whimpering starts now. Well, not right now, because I have to go deal with freakin' payroll stuff for the next two hours. But after that, whimpering!
