So, although I knew in advance we were going to be keep a few elite Russian hockey players (yes, yes, I understand that my life is much weirder than many people's.) in our guest room for a few weeks while they attend a nearby off-season training, I was a total idiot American and just assumed that they'd all speak English.The first one arrived an hour ago, and his first words were: "Sorry, I don't speak English."What do I do now? (I just down loaded Google Translate on my Android phone, and did my best for a quick "Welcome, here's your room, here's the bathroom, shower, etc.") I also SOS's my friend who claimed to speak Russian, but when he arrived he admitted to just knowing a very few rudimentary phrases, so I've got nobody local that I know who knows Russian.I need to learn some Russian, fast. . .

Otherwise, you could get a Cyrillic sticker set for the keyboard, and you should have no trouble communicating, albeit slowly. I can't imagine you'll be able to learn enough Russian in a short amount of time to be able to say or understand much more than, "Hello," "Goodbye," and, "And now, I am to drink with the guy who send the dogs at the local residents in Zambia.

Watch a Sergei Bodrov, Jr. movie with them. I recommend Брат 2 (Brother 2). It's cheesy in some ways but I've always enjoyed it. There's a nice heavy Rodina theme to contrast with those evil, power hungry Americans. It'll be a bonding experience svdsinner

How soon until the next one arrives? Maybe that one will speak better English.If not, see if you can recruit one of the bilingual hockey players to stay with you also.

(Essentially, they're arriving whenever the team they play for is eliminated from the play-offs.) We made sure that we'll have at least 1 or 2 players that speak English, but we'll have 2-3 that speak no English most likely, plus we are hosting homemade dinners for all 15ish players most nights until early May.So, no question that learning some minimal Russian (at least how to pronounce Cyrillic -- thanks for the link dferrantino) will be needed to be a descent, friendly host.A couple Vodka questions:1) Is there a standard drinking age in Russian culture? (Players will range from 16 to mid-twenties.)2) What does Russian culture say about athletes drinking during training? (IIUC, the American prohibitionists attitude towards alcohol and athletic training is not universal worldwide.) Obviously, these are serious enough athletes that they are each spending many thousands of dollars to come to America to train with top coaches for several weeks of their off-season. I know they (probably) won't want to down a bottle of Vodka before waking up for conditioning training at 8AM the next day, but if a couple drinks is the norm, I don't want them to feel like they are being forced into teetotalism.

Find a version of Rush 'n Attack that's easiest for you to play via your largest television. Play obsessively. Be sure to nervously and/or menacingly look over your shoulder toward your guests at random intervals during game play. Shout "America! Fuck Yeah!" when you reach various milestones and/or defeat bosses.

Oh, and don't forget to constantly obsess over your collection of 1984 Summer Olympics memorabilia. Make sure to ask how many medals the USSR won during those games and feign surprise at the answer.
