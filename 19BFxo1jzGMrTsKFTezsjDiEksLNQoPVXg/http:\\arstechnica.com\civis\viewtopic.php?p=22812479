Spoiler: show
In ACoK, Renly is encamped at Bitterbridge - not too far from Tyrell seat of Highgarden - and is having his tournament when Catelyn Stark finds him. Shortly afterwards, he receives word that Stannis has laid siege to Storm's End, which is Renly's own seat. Renly leaves behind all his infantry and takes his van - all mounted and roughly 20,000 strong, IIRC - and races to meet Stannis at Storm's End, taking Catelyn with him as well. After "negotiations" with Stannis fail, he prepares for battle, but in the early morning, as Brienne is helping him don his armor, and Catelyn is trying to talk him out of fighting his brother, a shadow appears in the tent and slits his throat, slicing right through a heavy steel gorget. Catelyn and Brienne flee, Renly's knights go over to Stannis, while Loras Tyrell goes back to Bitterbridge to take control of the large army Renly left behind. Ser Cortnay Penrose, the castellan of Storm's End, continues to defy Stannis, which is when he has Davos row Melisandre into a cavern under the castle to birth another shadow, which kills Ser Cortnay, and the young knight who replaces him surrenders the castle to Stannis.The shadows are indeed single-use, and summoning them is implied to take away some of Stannis's life force - after two, Melisandre mentions that making a third one will kill him.

God I love GoT Arya. She's an adorable ball of lies and death.Daenerys was much more interesting this week than she has been so far in S2. Lovely tension building with Jorah, and with her dothraki. Kudos to the writers; they may manage to make her storyline worthwhile this season after all.(Also, I love how proud she and Doreah were of their little baby dragon breathing his first fire. So cute)I like the TV show Margaery very much, but what the fuck was with the dress she was wearing? That may be the single most ugly piece of clothing I have ever seen.

I ruined her for myself last night when I noticed she tends to have perpetual duck face, though. eXceLon

Which of course means bead things are coming.Ya, it's going to be bad news for Winterfel BUT it is the right thing to do with th information he has.

Did anyone go back and look at the shadow as it attacked Renly? Catelyn said she just saw a shadow (she only saw it from the back) but Brienne said she saw Stannis (she saw it from the front). I went back and its face looked like Stannis, to me, but I may have been wanting to see that.

I think I saw Stanis too just now watching it again on HBO Go. I also didn't see any animation on Harrenhall which I think is just because the city is dead, unlock Qarth which was introduced in the same episode but has lots of animation.

Just got done watching the episode. I loved the look Arya gave when she saw the Tickler and realized that she actually had the power to kill who she pleased.As far as the shadow is concerned, I couldn't tell much from what I was watching, but maybe the HD version of the episode would have shown it better.Although I do find it creepy in the 2nd pic where the shadow demon is looking at Cat and smiling.

Was this the first time they mentioned Melisandre by name? Or did they use it during the Stannis sexy time scene?

Either way, i'm guessing this could become a problem for Tywin Lannister if one of his new soldiers is allied with a god who is on the "other side" of the war perhaps?

And I doubt Tywin Lannister keeps track of which particular god does every one of his soldiers worship. In the book, it wasn't the Lannisters that Jaqen H'Ghar (the guy) joined anyway, but a mercenary company called the Brave Companions, which was hired by Lord Tywin from across the Narrow Sea.

I meant that Jaquen's allegiances might switch to Stanis at some point due to HIS beliefs, not Tywins. THough being a mercenary he may not care about such things beyond who pays the most.

I don't think they meant to indicate that the shadow actually physically resembled Stannis but that such a move would be done only by Stannis. The shadow just looked like a demon thing. Not a picture perfect replication of Stannis.

Just watched the latest ep. The best scene by far was Maisie Williams and Charles Dance acting the shit out of each other. I thought Renly going was way too early in the ep, made it feel anticlimactic.

It was heavily implied that he joined the mercenaries because he was forced to, much as Arya became Tywin's cup-bearer because she was forced to. Although in his words, no-one's choice is ever taken away from them...

I thought he was referring to the character played by Jack Gleeson who is still alive in season 2. unless there was some kind of dream sequence in season one that I missed.

While they are staying somewhat close to the books there are obviously some changes but nothing too drastic. This does not all for the flexibility for a good character to stay around.Without reading the book I thought the Renly did die a little quick. I was curious about his relationship with Anne Bolyn. In a more traditional show the producers may have decided he was an interesting character to keep around.Take Walter Grogin's Boyd Crowder from Justified. MINOR SPOILER FOR THE JUSTIFIED PILOT Spoiler: show
In the original pilot of the show he was killed at the end. Obviously he was so great the producers decided to keep him around and make him the co-star of the show.
That kind of flexibility is one of the drawbacks of having the main story already written.Not really making a judgment either way, just thought it was interesting.
