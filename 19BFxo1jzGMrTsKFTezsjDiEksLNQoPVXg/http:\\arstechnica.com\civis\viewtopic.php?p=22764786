Quote:Which made me realize...where was Ned when he was reading the book? For some reason, I was thinking it was at the wall, and he was reading it with the Maester there and/or the Lord Commander...but was it actually King's Landing with Pycelle? Or was it in Winterfell with *their* maester?(in the TV series) Ned reads the book in Kings Landing. he asks the Maester Pycelle for it when he starts looking into what happened to Jon Arryn. He takes the book to look at after. It's safe to assume Pycelle told the queen of this as well and therefore she was able to broker a deal with the city watch before Ned could.

Okay, that all makes sense. And with Pycelle shipped off to the wall, he can't provide any additional assistance to the queen in locating or identifying Gendry.Well played, Fat Man.One thing that strikes me as different from the books, is that Cersei and Jaime's relationship is much more widely "known" (or suspected) than it seemed to be in the novels. That could just be my impression, but it seems more like it is tittered about behind many different hands-to-mouths. Spoiler: show
This makes it seem, to me, like Gendry isn't just being used as a foil to prove the incest/bastardry of the Lannisters, but to keep a viable heir to the throne on deck.

Where did you get that Pycelle was sent to the wall?! He's still firmly in King's Landing at this point in the show. Book:

Nor is he ever sent to the wall in the books either.

(and confusing 'black cell' with 'taking the black' apparently)

damnit, I so want to click on those "Show" links but having only started the first book I'm trying to be good.Does the time passed make sense with the books so far? Jon Snow and Robb Stark are supposed to be 14 years old, but the series portrays them as a bit older (like 17/18.)

Bear in mind that Stannis sent out his letter about their incest in the first episode. Everyone in the seven kingdoms has presumably read it by now, with no retort from the Lannisters yet. That follows suit with the book from what I can tell. Several people suspected it before word got out, the majority being Stannis, Lord Arryn, and Tyrion (same as in the book).

There is no question that you might lose good characterization, but if the result of that is we avoid 13 year old Daenerys's first night with Kal Drogo it's worth it. It's already pretty bad with her being as young as she seems.Absent the books, does the TV version of the story gain anything by having them be younger?

I think the one battle that HBO chose to take on was with Lysa Arryn and her son being hungry. That was...unique, but just far enough away from "completely inappropriate" that they knew they could get away with it. Having book-age characters for most of the TV series would generate an uproar even HBO couldn't survive...I'm pretty sure. (survive in the sense of not have to go back and re-do a bunch of things)

I mean, you have all the stuff with Dany that people have already mentioned that would seem inappropriate outside of anime. Kids in their mid-teens going off to war would also be a bit much.Quote:There's a particular scene involving Sansa that now has to be removed.I'll put this in spoilers, since it involves preview scenes:
Spoiler: show
I'm pretty positive they've shown a very brief snip of Sansa on the floor of the throne room, crying and trying to hold her dress together. I'm guessing they decided to keep the scene, but make it PGish.

I think draccy has the right answer. Child actors are hit and miss and they do have the propensity to grow up faster in real life than in the story (see Harry Potter.)On the nudity, far be it for me to turn down nude woman on screen, they could have avoided the nudity all together, or at least for any of the younger characters, if they wanted to. We didn't need to see Dany's wedding night. (awaits scorn and confusion)Again, having only started the first book, i'm not sure how much the sex and nudity play into the story.

By showing her wedding night it shows how Drago treated her as nothing more than property but then grew very much to love her and treated her very much as an equal which pissed a lot of the Dothraki off.

I should have inserted "a graphic representation" of their wedding night. The producers could have portrayed the same sentiment (that of a possession) without nudity. There was no doubt that Jamie was giving Circi a good rodgering in the tower (he's going to deflower her in the tower!) without the actress being nude. In the book the queen is described as being nude ( i have gotten at least that far.) Nudity isn't as important and in some cases in this show seems a bit overused.Not a complaint, but how they cast the actors is at least partially determined by their willingness to be in the buff.

I was reading something about how some actress backed out of a small part on the second season because she didn't realize that it required her to be nude. The part was something along the line of "king's whore". It was one of those things where you really ought to research the background a bit before you audition, because, really? It's Game of Thrones. You're playing a whore. You think you might be asked to shed some clothes?

I'd think "whore on an HBO series" would be pretty self-explanatory. In fact, I'd guess that a clothed whore in an HBO seres would be the outlier...unless the scene has them going to/leaving the client.

The key thing with Gendry is that even if the Lannisters win the war and kill Stannis and Renly, Gendry would have a better claim to the throne than Joffrey. It would only take a few minor lords in Highgarden and the Stormlands who are bitter about the death of their king to find him and rally around him, and there'd be another uprising. That's why Gendry in particular has to die. It's implied by the veracity with which Gendry is pursued, and indeed shown in the show, that he's the eldest bastard and therefore the most dangerous one to Joffrey's rule.Also note that Gendry was suddenly sent to the wall after Robert died. Someone has been looking out for his interests, making sure he got an apprenticeship and was well looked after. Of the people who knew who he was and why he was important, and is alive after Robert's death - we know it isn't Pycelle because he's working for Cersei, so that basically leaves Littlefinger, Varys or someone else, one of the Kingsguard maybe? My money's on Varys. Littlefinger would want to keep someone like that in his keeping, not off to the wall where it would be hard to get him back.

Bastards aren't held in high regard by the commoners or the high folk, regardless of their parentage. Gendry wasn't even acknowledged by Robert.

Spoiler: show
Robert took very good care of the bastards he knew about in the books. He supported them financially, and would often visit them while out on his hunts. It's pretty strongly implied that Gendry managed to get his apprenticeship at the foundry (which is a pretty damn high station in life) thanks to Robert.

Frennzy, I'm unspoilering this and my response as what we're discussing is based on facts already presented in the TV series. So it's not a spoiler.Frennzy wrote:Well, as a Queen's bastard, Joffrey's claim is less legitimate. That leaves the two brothers...each already claiming kingship, so at this point it's up to the Lords and Bannerman to pledge fealty to whomever they feel is the most legitimate claim...and given that Robert was 'generally accepted' as the One King at the time, I would imagine his bastard son would get quite a bit of that support...especially should a Stark or other Lord back him...which is likely given Ned's obvious desire to keep him alive and preserve Robert's lineageAs a queen's bastard, Joff's claim IS less legitimate, except for the part where Perception == Reality. Since everyone perceives that Joff (and his siblings) are fathered by Robert, and Robert himself thought so with his dying breath, and the kids think so, then frankly as far as many are concerned, Joff is the rightful heir. And honestly, most of the people who know AND care that Robert isn't Joff's father have a vested interest in that fact and it's consequences (ie, they can stake a claim to the throne if it can be proven).Fact-wise, the true heir is Stannis, and Renly is playing dress-up and make-believe. Fact-wise, Renly has a better chance of taking the throne, because at the moment he has a fuckton more men, and Joff's army is out right now trying to fight another war. But reality-wise, Joffrey is the true heir to the Iron Throne.Gendry only has a greater claim to the throne if the world can be convinced that he's another of Cersei's crotch-droppings. Best of luck. Ned was keeping him alive something something murder of kids something honor blah blah duty. He knew all too well about bastards and inheritance rights.
