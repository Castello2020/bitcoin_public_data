The Matrix.Neo finally understands that he can control the Matrix and defeats the agents. Then he calls in from the phonebox to declare that he is coming and flies upinto the air.I was left wondering whether they should leave it at that or try to make a sequel in which he took apart the Matrix. I concluded that they could never make a satisfactory sequel. Fortunately they didn't try. (that's what I want to believe and you'll never convince me otherwise)

No Country for Old MenThe Wild Bunch. I just wish the video showed the final walk. They all knew they were going to die.And probably the best ending ever: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly

I'm not sure how I haven't seen There Will Be Blood mentioned, or did I miss it? I almost stood up in the theater an cheered at that ending.

Great list so far. I'd have to toss in October Sky. I loved the sense of hope invoked when the boys lit off that final rocket. It's not just their rocket, it's the town's, and carrying all of their hopes and dreams with it. Just a great, great scene.

If it hadn't been for Marcia Lucas (film editor, occasional screenwriter and wife of George), there would never have been the scene that goes between those two shots, where Indy meets Marion outside the building, and we'd all be posting to this day about how nonsensical it is that Indy goes through the whole film trying to be with her and/or rescue her and then she disappears with no explanation.Just one example of the many ways in which Marcia Lucas rescued a dumb moment and helped it to be great.

Deckard is a replicant.Yep. However, my sole complaint about the later cuts of Blade Runner (I don't think it was in the theatrical release) is the split-second shot of Deckard with glowing eyes. It messes up the film in two ways:1) Because you see Rachael with glowing eyes earlier, now you know Deckard is a replicant. The film works so much better if you're not sure, but you just assume he is from the not-that-subtle connection between his dream and Gaff's parting origami gift.2) It totally contradicts the whole, "It's so hard to tell a replicant from a human that we developed the Voight-Kampff test to help us do it", thing. It makes you think, 'Well, just look for the glowing eyes, you idiots! Job done.'

He was just better at hiding it when he was younger, because becoming successful - thus proving he was better than everyone else - was the most important thing to him. Once he had done that, he was free to be as horrible a cunt as he liked - which he did with just as much fervour and cut-throat delight as he did in becoming successful.

Neither of the two is represented as having a steady moral compass, and the ham-fisted execution of this debate, as far as the movie goes, lacks any real finesse or nuance.

I don't know if it has been mentioned and I forgot about it, but The Full Monty has one of the best endings ever. A great story of a bunch of guys facing hard times and do something risky and, in the end, get their dignity restored.One of my favorite movies.

^^^Ooh, reading that reminded me of another great British film, sadly nowhere near as well known as it should be: Brassed Off. The inimitable Pete Postlethwaite delivers a speech towards the end that literally brought tears to my eyes when I first saw it, as it would, I suspect, for anyone who has strong memories of the miners' strike years and residual anger at the shit those people were put through by the Thatcher govt.

It's just so boring. Must be the plot line, the 'magic' or the time era because I like all the actors.

Dad, who commanded a tender in the 50s, watches and says, "all they have to do is come up six points and the waves won't be half as bad." 114 posts â€¢ Previous 123
