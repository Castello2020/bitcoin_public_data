He had a small part in a single chapter of Storm of Swords and suddenly everyone knew he had to be Benjen. Not sure why.</div><br />Because his identity is being hidden.  Because, yes, he appears to have been from the Night's Watch.  Because Benjen is the only black brother of consequence that we know to be missing.  It would be kind of anticlimactic if his former identity was revealed to be some stranger of little consequence.  The bit about him being killed long ago is probably the bit that I was remembering that made me doubt that it's Benjen, but I'm pretty sure that Martin wants us to believe that it's Benjen at this point.

It's not that southerners are poor fighters so much as the people joining up with Renly were treating it as a game, stopping at every castle on the way to have picnics and hold tournaments. I think the comment also cuts at how poorly suited and ill-prepared they were for the upcoming war and winter. And it helped show how Catelyn had been molded into more of a Northerner than she originally appeared when compared to true Northerners early in the series...it's all about perspective.<br /><br />Ok, I saw Ep3 and I think the Margaery/Renly scene helps show, in way that wasn't obvious in the books, that she <span style="font-style: italic">wants</span> to be Queen. It may help put future events in clearer perspective (i.e. why she would even agree to marry Joffrey, then Tommen, then whoever else comes next...) and make her appear less a pawn used to simply join the Tyrells with whoever may be closest to the throne at the time...

I like the changes they made with her in this episode.  My wife and I both only remember Margaery as really only being there at the tourney, and having little to no impact on what was going on.  She definitely comes across as more of a player in the show.  Which I think will make her more believable when she's living at Kings Landing.

It was about the Lannister's fighting Robb's forces, and here's an army twice as big as that army with a free approach to King's Landing, just sitting around in tourney to make their King feel good about himself.</div><br />Yep. It's not that southerners are poor fighters so much as the people joining up with Renly were treating it as a game, stopping at every castle on the way to have picnics and hold tournaments. I think the comment also cuts at how poorly suited and ill-prepared they were for the upcoming war and winter. And it helped show how Catelyn had been molded into more of a Northerner than she originally appeared when compared to true Northerners early in the series...it's all about perspective.<br /><br />Ok, I saw Ep3 and I think the Margaery/Renly scene helps show, in way that wasn't obvious in the books, that she <span style="font-style: italic">wants</span> to be Queen. It may help put future events in clearer perspective (i.e. why she would even agree to marry Joffrey, then Tommen, then whoever else comes next...) and make her appear less a pawn used to simply join the Tyrells with whoever may be closest to the throne at the time...</div><br /><br /><br />If they keep it up they can eliminate the elder Tyrell lady entirely and have Margery be the primary mover of the Tyrell intrigue.</div><br /><br /><br />Why the crap would you want to get rid of The Queen of Thorns? She's fucking awesome. She comes in, cleans house and is OUT. <br /><br />Like a boss.

              If you think about it, storms end is entirely unnecessary for the story.<br /><br /><br /><br />I also think, taking out the extra travel for Arya, and the other stuff is a good idea especially since it gave us time to see more joffery is evil and Rob's falling in love which was kind of abrupt in the book.

              I'm getting so very frustrated with this bullshit.<br /><br />Words, words, words, nothing happens. Words, words, travel words, nothing happens. Travel words, a brief description of something actually interesting that is too short, after which again <span style="font-style: italic">nothing happens</span>.<br /><br />I'm 40% of the way through ADWD and I don't know why I still bother. I've found much that resonates with me in MotherJones' review of the book:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><a href="http://motherjones.com/mixed-media/2011/08/book-review-dance-dragons" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">Nick Baumann of Mother Jones</a> wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A writer who has become obsessed with travel timelines and minor details will produce a book that seems, well, obsessed with travel timelines and minor details.

They've basically spent the entire book traveling.</div><br />This is just outrageous. Already I'm bored with Tyrion's interminable journey and Daenerys' interminable dawdling. Now I learn that all those people who were supposed to reach Daenerys, don't. Neither will the Others--from what I've heard--assault the Wall before the end of the book. Seriously, what's left that's interesting? I can't wait to see how many thousands of pages <div style="padding: 3px;">

              Overall a great episode, though I enjoyed last week's more. The scene with Tyrion and Lancel was brilliant.

      Didn&#39;t the shadow baby birth scene come much later in the book? I want to say during the battle of the Blackwater, but that doesn&#39;t seem right, either. It&#39;s been a while since I read aCoK.<br /><br />Also, while I&#39;m excited to see Qarth, I couldn&#39;t help but be disappointed that we didn&#39;t get to see the Dead City that Daenerys and her khalasar camped at to recuperate.<br /><br />Was Arya already saying her &quot;prayers&quot; before she hooked up with Jaqen H&#39;ghar?<br /><br />I was really saddened that we didn&#39;t get to see more of Brienne this episode. I hope she gets a lot more screen time later on with Catelyn. Also, I&#39;m disappointed that they seem to be either downplaying or completely ignoring the fact that she&#39;s in love with Renly. Also noticed that they aren&#39;t the &quot;Rainbow Guard&quot;, though since there is no subtlety whatsoever about his sexuality in the show, it would probably be too over-the-top to have a bunch of knights prancing about in multicolored cloaks like they just came out of a revival of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;.
