ModerationObviously discussion of the various facets of managing an IT infrastructure, including naming conventions, is germane to this thread--to a point.But we don't need that discussion to consume the entire thread, and we certainly don't need to engage in hyperbole, personal attacks and snarky condescension over it.So let's put a pin in that topic please.

How about, "everything you've said in this thread?"You are IT. That makes you a support component of the organization. You are not the lords and masters of all you nmap. You support production staff. Production staff says "we need this," you say "OK" unless it is actively dangerous to other business goals (and "we don't want to use a database" isn't a business goal)."The users" that you sneer at are more important than you are. You are there to support them. What makes things "easier to manage" is of less importance than making the users optimally effective (and that often means "making them happy," which is something you write like it's a curse).Quote:f you act like the entitled prick you seem to be there definitely wouldn't be an exception for you.You calling anyone "entitled" is really, really funny. Let's turn that one around: "people have to come beg and scrape for an exception to name their own computers, and if we don't like their attitude we'll just say no!" That's entitlement--that you deserve to be part of the process when you aren't a value-add.There's a reason that "IT" and "red tape" are so stereotypically synonymous. You're demonstrating it.Fine. Here's your machine, named "HURR_DUUR" or whatever the fuck you want. It's now YOURS - it breaks, you fix it. It won't connect to the corporate LAN - wupps, better figure it out yerself, Mr. "But-IT-is-a-cost-centre-I-MAKE-Money!" developer, because our automated scripts just won't be able to process that name, without a lot of development effort to accomodate one special princess and that adds cost and complexity without a gain for the buisines as a whole. We don't have time to take care of one special snowflake, when we've got a snowdrift to shepperd in the right direction.It's about give and take - if you want it all, you get it all. Now go play with *your* machine while we in "IT" make things work for everyone else, at minimal cost to the company, with the best experience possible for our users.Oh, and because you "know computers" through past experience, does not make you an honourary admin. It's our pool and we say who plays in it, because our jobs and professional reputation are kind of important to us.

If a developer wants a playground machine, fine, let them have it, but don't call that machine/environment an SOE, and don't expect Corporate IT Support for your special sandbox, because they ain't geared for it.I can visualise the thrashing of gears "but, I WORK in a way that works best for ME and Information Technology just want to put blockers in my way", on one side, and the 'if Special Snowflake is on MY books, his computer will follow MY rules!'They are incompatible viewpoints.IT can be relaxed, mixed, crazy funtime with amazing output from enthusiastic employees, but that all goes out the window for -corporate- stuff, where SOE is the only sane way to go, and 'development' environments are sandboxed, safe from actual 'production' environments, and vice versa.Of course, it's dependent upon the context. In a 50 person company, such attitudes as Blackened expresses are 'normal'. In a 5,000 person company, not as much, and in a 15,000+ person company, no fucking way.I hope that makes sense on both sides of the fence, as I hope my butchered PNG comes through the vagaries of Ars' current pictar processing process.

So today I got my fun phone call from my ops desk (small office, so IT is one of my hats.)"Hey, I was on my google home page, went to a top stories link, and then I got an antivirus popup. Can you do something here before I click on anything?"I dragged myself over, looked at the popup, and it was a standard IE popup, asking to run a scan for "Windows Antivirus 2012."I nuked the process, grabbed hijackthis off the corptech software share, ran it, made sure the default settings were intact, then restarted IE. Then added the last visited website to a blacklist. Huzzah for users that think before clicking!

Major General Thanatos wrote:Huzzah for users that think before clicking!I know, a rare treat!Best story I have on that was when I worked for a company that had a HUGE database. Like 10s of millions of customer records. One day, one of the billing reps got a popup, "you need administrative privileges to process that request." This was on a simple query. So she asked her supervisor who looked at the popup, closed it out, and re-logged in as the rep to reproduce the error. Simple query, same popup. She smelled a rat, and called the dev team for the database.Long story short, turns out, some 6 months earlier, a DBA had been fired. Apparently, for the years he worked there, he had a "time bomb" in the code which he updated with each push. Hidden deep in some section was a piece of code that went something like, "If after [date], delete all master keys." That needed administrative privileges. Had the billing admin logged in as administrator, even a simple query would have wiped out the database's master keys, rendering it useless. Backups would have also been wiped as they were installed until someone discovered the code in the client front end.I don't recall now what happened to the former employee, but I believe he was brought up on charges. The billing admin got a small award plaque and a bonus for her diligence, and the billing rep got some free lunch.

Wow. That is just scary, and reminds me of why many companies immediately lock out IT personnel the moment they announce their intent to resign (or they get the process started to get canned) and just give them severance pay.

Assuming of course, that the firing offense is the trigger for installing a bomb. I've never gotten myself to the point of wanting to maliciously destroy the property of a company I work for, so I dunno.Now, it's been over 15 years ago, but IIRC, the guy had a 6 month window. My guess is, it was his "insurance" because he probably hated working there, and thought, "well, if they fire me, I am already set for my revenge." Given the working environment, this was very likely. They had a front end code, written in C+, I think, which was maintained in one area on a shared drive (this was before CVS was a huge deal; mixed Windows 95/NT 3.51/Mac environment). Given this subroutine was banal (who would ever check a simple query table?), it was almost innocuous. I am guessing he thought 6 months was enough to make a getaway, but I don't think he actually moved addresses, so I dunno. There was another story, it's been a while, but I think happened in a data center in Germany where someone had a hardware timebomb; some MiniITX system posing as a junction box in the ceiling that connected to their network via an Ethernet cable posing as a grounding wire. I forgot how he got discovered, but I think it was discovered before it went off, or it went off and didn't work as well as the designer planned. Now with something like a Shevaplug, that reality is much easier to implement.[shudder]

The best timebomb I'm aware of didn't harm the live data, it damaged the backups and prevented accurate reporting and recovery. It did nothing to the live database, but it encrypted information from the data warehouse if a request was made through the front-end (publicly accessible) website for a specific record (doing so, though, only after reports were run, so it looked like everything was ok).Turns out, someone decided to hammer the website looking for script vulnerabilities and discovered that one of the urls passed a value. They just scanned through while incrementing that value looking for unexpected behavior. In so doing, they found the secret url and kicked off the bomb.A few months later, the guy (who still worked there) was in a meeting when someone mentioned that there were problems with the data warehouse. He looked and realized what had happened. Unfortunately, since he didn't kick off the bomb from the remote site, he had no clue what value had been used to encrypt the data. He quit before they tracked the code back to him.

In fact, IIRC, he was the writer of the front end for the most part, and no one cross-checked his code until they found a backup of the code repository or something. Where I work now, a former admin, when faced with an unstable system, had put in some code that simply restarted the service if it failed to respond in a set amount of time. Fear of his shitty fix being discovered, he made it a hidden file in /etc/cron.d/ which later bit us in the ass when we set up a replacement system, and turned off the service on the old one. At some point, the old server (which was still on for another reason) just relaunched the service quietly and started to compete with the new server behind a virtual IP. Hilarity did not ensue. Part of the nefarious nature of his service is that it did not announce it had restarted (as per protocol; all restarts, stops, starts. and reloads must be documented), so we had no idea for 24 hours until we accidentally assumed someone else turned on the service, shut it off, only to have it quietly turn back on again.That and hard-coded IPs. I could fucking kill someone who does this in code.

Quote:That and hard-coded IPs. I could fucking kill someone who does this in code.No doubt. My old company had a serious issue with one of their clients. The client had some devices made overseas that were supposed to communicate with a specific website and transmit data. The overseas manufacturer was also responsible for all code that would be on the device. they built those devices to only look for one IP address. Not the actual website name, its IP address.Suffice to say, they didn't catch that until the devices were already manufactured and shipped, so about a year later, we had to help them triage a way to get a firmware update to all those devices (which were, due to the nature of what they were doing, in rather remote location), because their host couldn't handle them anymore, and wasn't being helpful about the IP address they had.

Generally, it only affects the user (and the helpdesk/enduser support person who has to change the account).

And her login was ewhitmoore, so... I suspect typo. It was only when AD integration spelled her name "Shitmoore" on her Windows login we realized what happened.

Fear of his shitty fix being discovered, he made it a hidden file in /etc/cron.d/ which later bit us in the ass when we set up a replacement system, and turned off the service on the old one.This is yet another reason why I always alias 'ls' to 'ls -lah' on any *NIX/Linux box I work with.

The client had some devices made overseas that were supposed to communicate with a specific website and transmit data. The overseas manufacturer was also responsible for all code that would be on the device. they built those devices to only look for one IP address. Not the actual website name, its IP address.Suffice to say, they didn't catch that until the devices were already manufactured and shipped, so about a year later, we had to help them triage a way to get a firmware update to all those devices (which were, due to the nature of what they were doing, in rather remote location), because their host couldn't handle them anymore, and wasn't being helpful about the IP address they had.Sounds very similar to something that happened to me, was this in the MRO supply industry?
