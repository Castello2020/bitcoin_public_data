I could finally work out again last night. 30 minutes on the treadmill, alternating walk/jog (5/3.5 min respectively). Then I did some light weight work, and some ab/leg work (to help ease the back pain from the treadmill)Dammit, it seems like I not making any progress, weight-wise...but I am certainly getting more fit, cardio-wise. Before I couldn't jog more than 1/8 mile at a time. Now I can do a quarter mile pretty easily...and I'm not gasping like I'm going to die when I slow back down. I hate that I've had setbacks twice in the past year, both due to my back. I've got to figure out how to avoid hurting it. I feel like I should be much further along than this.

The next person that uses the phrase "last call for alcohol" in the workplace environment as a euphemism for "deadline" is going to get boinked. On the head. With a rusty crowbar. By me.Stop it. NOW. It's about as funny and as original as Carlos Mencia. Which is probably where you got this lame-ass misuse of the phrase.Bite my Bartles & Jaymes.

My great Aunt just died. She seemed good when I saw her on Christmas. I'm glad I went home. There's only 3 of that generation left in my family.

I got back from my first trip outside of North America last week, and I have been having to fight the urge in these recessionary times to simply quit my job and go back to Europe.Grass is greener and all that.... I have had a strong dislike for my job for a few years now, and Europe was just so different to what I am used to. I'll still stick it our at my job for while longer, but I am starting to seriously think about trying to find a job in Europe (maybe Netherlands?).Meh, I think I am getting depressed thinking about this now...

So my a couple of coworkers were discussing the bird flu and what would happen if it became an epidemic in the US or what not. One coworker commented that you are really in trouble with those things if you are old or young. And I then commented that it would fix social security if it happened. I'm glad I got laughter instead of crickets....

Hey, work. Why did you start sucking so hard? Can we go back to the good ol' days where I only did my own work instead of another department's work? That'd be great.Hey, chair. Why did you think my new corduroy pants didn't look good without the hole in the ass? I don't agree with your fashion sense.

So I was reading an NYT article about Obama's first full day, and I came across this photo. Several thoughts came to mind.I wonder if the more grizzled/experienced photographers trick the newbie photographers into taking really silly shots, by pretending that they'll be really compelling. I like to think so.Do all of these guys think that the guy taking a picture of them is a pretentious dick? At least a little bit?On the flip side, I hope that somewhere out there, you can find something like The Journal of Post-Modern Photojournalism and it'll have a photo of some guy taking a photo of four other guys taking photos of a pen.I had those thoughts last night, but I was already in bed so I didn't get up to post them. Today I was searching for the photo again and I found this photo (by the same photographer), which seems to lend credence to all of these ideas--Doug Mills is tricking the other photojournalists into creating self-referential photojournalism scenes for him to take pretentious pictures of.
