Quote:Looks like Osha's taking that role. Can't say I'm upset by that, but it does lead me to believe that no one has any intention of addressing Jon's parentage -- since IIRC the Reeds are the only ones living who would know the truth. Also I suppose that Rickon will be making the journey with Bran.Well something that popped into my head last night is the possibility that Maester Luwin could survive and take Rickon. That would remove him from the picture, and also take care of Rickon. Quote:OTOH, with the Jeyne character not being Jeyne, and the absence of Riverrun in the series thus far (meaning no Edmure Tully) I wonder what the pretext will be for the Red Wedding. Maybe Riverrun will be introduced next season?Well the pretext for the Red Wedding will still be there. It's not that Robb married someone from another house, it's that he married someone else other than a Frey. I would hope that Riverrun is seen next season. If only because it seems like Robb and his army is just sort of floating around this season. There's no real sense of where he is besides an occasional mention of going to parlay with someone at some place.

I approve of almost all of the changes. Some of the scenes aren't working for me (particularly Danys and Robb / Talisa), but that has little to do with changes from the books.

Honestly, by the time I read Dance of Dragons, I'd completely forgotten about the Reek side-story in Clash of Kings and was thinking he was a new character (I suspected pretty early on he was Theon, but I can't remember how early).

The audition, dug up by The Rabbit, shows Irish actor Tom Sullivan reading the casting sides for Edmure.We’ve had leaked audition tapes in the past (including from someone who actually went on to become cast in the show), but this one is noteworthy because it confirms the existence of a character that has heretofore gone unmentioned on the show. Edmure, the brother of Catelyn Stark, appears way back in the first book, but he was cut from both seasons one and two, leaving some fans fearing we would never see him. Well, fear no more!Winter Is Coming: After years of waiting, you House Tully fans finally have a reason to celebrate! We will definitely get an Edmure and probably get to see Riverrun. I suspect we may get a Hoster Tully too. Still, one question remains, what about the Blackfish?

I've just marathoned through the first three books and am now in A Feast for Crows. It may just be fatigue but man it feels like the story bogged down. I understand there was a desire to allow things to build up but man. does it get better? I have a feeling that much of book 4 will be dumped for the TV series.

AFfC is full of mostly the non-main characters and it's a little slow. Book 5 (ADwD) picks up. And yeah, I figure tons of AFfC will be 'condensed' or outright removed for the HBO series.

A Feast for Crows is generally considered to be the low point of the series. A Dance with Dragons improves a little (by merit of focusing on the more interesting characters) but Martin admitted that he basically wrote himself into a corner and had to spend a lot of time trying to get the plot back on track.

First half of next season can basically be the set up...Robb's marriage, Lord Frey finding out and beginning to plot revenge could be a good, foreboding end to this season.In general I think the changes and subtractions have translated well. The books are big because they can be but there is a lot that isn't essential to the main plot. The more the show progresses, though, the more I'm convinced that Jon is just Ned's bastard...the supposed hints aren't there. The reveal vector isn't there. The need for him to be anything else just isn't there.

Changes I like: Tywin and Arya. Changes I don't like: Most of everything else. Though the omission of some characters are welcome (Penrose, some weirdos in Qarth). Though with Martin being there with the writers and approving changes I'm totally okay with the changes made as I think of it as a very long and post facto editing session with MArtin for him to change and correct parts of his story. Let us hope we get far enough along and through Dany's idiotic resting session in the slave cities and he can write something better than what is in the books. Them totally omitting the Reed kids thus far and not touching on Jon possibly being of Targaryen blood angers me a great deal though.

According to a spoiler in the other thread (and supposedly on IMDB) it looked like we were going to have a White Red Wedding this season. Now it seems that may not happen, darn, I was hoping to see my wife shocked this year. Anacher

So how are you folks liking this second season? I enjoy it, but feel a bit uneasy. Maybe it's some of the changes. I think I'll be sold one way or the other once I see the Bastard. GRRM is so involved with the show, that I don't think they are able to long-term fuck it up. I think pretty much everybody loves the addition of Tywin & Arya. Way better than Roose's interactions with her, except for showing what a creepy fuck Roose was.I can deal with no Jayne Westerling. This is even a larger slap to the face of Walder. She's just some girl.

I wonder if we'll see the bastard's face this season, since he'll probably only show up in one or two scenes at most. It'd be easier to have him wearing a helm than to cast someone we probably won't see again for two seasons; even easier to have him mentioned but never shown on camera.

And even Stannis interacts with Theon, I think. They have to make Ramsay matter. They can't leave gaps if they don't know when the show will end, and GRRM is very involved with the series.

Tyrion describes the song in the book as "rather gloomy". It is that for a certainty.Just picture it. You're Lord Farman of Faircastle. You're giving lip to Tywin Lannister. He sends you an envoy. It consists of a single bard with a lute. He walks into your hall, looks around, says nothing and simply starts singing the song above. (Well, we only have the refrain, but still.)Chilling.

I mean, it's really frustrating to see things in book two that still aren't resolved by book 5, it just brings up feelings of frustration.

So Tyrion will have his scar but keep his nose. Fair compromise. I thought there should have been more blood, to let the noobies think he was dead.

I figured they would do something like that with Tyriion in the series. A missing nose Doesn't make for a good central character on TV.My wife did think he was dead since she hasn't read the books. The episode was good, but a bit confusing if you hadn't read the books. At the end I basically had to explain what was going on to my wife ("who are these guys, now who are these guys, what's he doing here, etc.). It was hard to tell one armor from the next. Good to see Loras at the end. And a preview where Jaquan is still there.

I'm worried they are taking too much away from Tyrion in the TV show. It's Tyrion through the preparations he forces Kings Landing to take, that wins the battle. They took away his chain trick, really emphasized that the wildfire production was Cercei, and the battle in the TV show was won by Tywin. Vs the books where Tyrion had bigger role in increasing the wildfire production, and where Tywin rides in and ends up doing mop up duty. Tyrion's plans being executed are what wins the day, but the resentment builds as Tywin gets all the undeserved glory. In the books, THAT is what drives Tyrion's frustrations going forward. But in the TV show as we've seen so far, I don't know if Tyrion's discontent is justified.

I don't think they're taking anything away from Tyrion. They seem to be going out of their way to show him as the true leader behind the defense. While Cersei did start the production of wildfire, Tyrion stepped in and put it to best use. He got the maps of the tunnels under King's Landing, read up on warfare, and signaled to Bronn to launch the fire arrow. Once the fight was underway, he rallied to morale of the troops to help defend the mud gate. During the show, he seems to be the one in charge. Now that the battle is over and Tywin is back, we'll get to see how much credit he gets for it.I was actually surprised at Lancel this episode. He's always come off as a simpering wimp, but here is seemed to grow a spine and told the queen that her son needed to be out there to keep the morale up.List of characters to be added in season 3 from Entertainment Weekly via Winter is ComingQuote:Mance Rayder: We’ve heard about him all season. A former member of the Night’s Watch who became the “King Beyond the Wall,” the leader of the Wildlings. Daario Naharis: A confident and seductive warrior. Jojen Reed; Meera Reed: A teenage brother and sister duo with special insights. Edmure Tully: A brash young member of the Tully family. Ser Brynden Tully (The Blackfish): Catelyn Stark’s uncle. Lady Selyse Florent: Stannis Baratheon’s wife. Shireen: Stannis’ daughter. Olenna Redwyne (The Queen of Thorns): Margaery Tyrell’s sharp-witted grandmother. Beric Dondarrion: A skilled knight who is the leader of the outlaw group Brotherhood Without Banners. Thoros of Myr: A red priest who follows the same religion as Melisandre. Tormund Giantsbane: A Wildling raider.So we're going to see the Reeds, the Blackfish, and the Queen of Thorns next season.
