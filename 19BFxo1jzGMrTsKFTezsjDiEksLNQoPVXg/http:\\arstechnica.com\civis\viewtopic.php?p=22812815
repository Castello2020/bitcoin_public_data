My officemate is constantly barging in on my keyboard, knocks things over on my desk, talks loudly whenever I'm on the phone, and spends most of the day either preening or sleeping. She never seems to do any work, or anything useful, ever.

I get where Saint is coming from. It's part of modern western society that we give extra benefits to parents, and those that are childless have to pick up the extra slack, whether it's having to cover more hours/efforts at work, or paying more in taxes (I'm a single person with a decent salary. I get no tax breaks. Zero. None. Nada. I pay more in taxes that some entire families, and I'm not rich, just your average middle class dude).Me, I'm ok with it. I'm willing to do more than my share to help parents out, because I don't want your kids to grow up to be dicks.Saint is not ok with it, and he's expressing that here.

There should be something similar to Godwin'ing a thread, except it is where 'parenting' starts to kill the thread. Hey, maybe we could call it ParentTrapping! You guys totally parenttrapped this thread!

I was a writer at a small market TV Station in Flint Michigan.The news director walks into my tiny office one day and lets a giant fart rip, he smiles and then turns to leave and says on the way out "oh man, that one had foam on the end of it!"on another day ...The business manager walks into my office to discuss some biz. During the conversation he casually grabs a paper clip off my desk and begins to scrape the inside of his ear. As we finish our chat, he removes said paper clip, now full of ear wax, places it back on my desk and walks out.I'll never, ever forget those guys.

My cube-mate is considered the most annoying guy in the office. He used to yell "Bless you" when someone in HR sneezed. Note: We do not work in HR. It requires walking through multiple secure doors to get to HR.He says "Bless you my son" if I sneeze. He's jewish. On the one hand, him being jewish is entirely irrelevant. On the other he has a habit of announcing the fact and using it to excuse his exceptionally cheap nature. On the gripping hand he buys tea at Starbucks. He asked me to bring back tea during my visit to Denver. It's $1.50 cheaper in the U.S. I'm not hauling a box of tea through airports & customs so someone can save $1.50 a box on tea. It would have been more likely if he had asked me to pick him up a bottle of booze. (The savings would have been much higher, and the irony(*) would have amused me.).

I mean, obviously they're a coffee place, but if they sell tea then someone's buying it often enough to make stocking it worth their while, right?Or is this one of those social cue things I never really get?

One day my next-door cube neighbor turns to me and says "After lunch I'm taking you over to the gun store with me!" Apparently I was selected to be his squadmate in his fantasy massacre. Lucky for all concerned, his wife wouldn't let him spend that much money. I exaggerate but its funnier this way.

My co-worker last night sent me, another co-worker, and about 6 people who's numbers aren't in my phone a group MMS.DO. NOT. DO. THIS. The next hour was me receiving every single fucking insider joke response. I eventually wrote "unsubscribe" and that seemed to shut people up, yet if I were to complain, somehow, SOMEHOW, I'd be the asshole.
