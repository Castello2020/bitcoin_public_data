              I would think the nephew would have the stronger claim by tradition, as he is male. Women generally don't have any claim at all - she just happens to have three dragons and a pretty decent army if she can every cross the sea.

In the book it was like a giant shadow hanging over the entire book.</div><br />Yeah, but if Jon is half Targaryen, and he's 1/3 of the triple dragon threat, that ends up being a pretty huge deal in the long run.  But, I don't really recall much of it being discussed in the first few books (by that may be because I hardly remember them at all).  So it's possible that the show will pump it up more in future seasons.  I would hope that they pump up the mystery a bit, since, if it does become a big deal, I'd rather there be some lead up to the reveal, rather than just a: ho-hum, yeah Jon is just one of many bastards, no big deal about his parents, la de da, oh wait, HE'S REALLY A TARGARYEN/STARK HYBRID THAT CAN RIDE A DRAGON WHILE IN THE BODY OF A DIREWOLF!!!!!

Dany, because she's a chick, and Jon, because he's a bastard.  Aegon has the clear right to the throne, being the trueborn son of the crown prince.  Had Rhaegar not been killed, he would have become king on the death of Aerys, Aegon would have then become crown prince, and ascended to the throne on Rhaegar's death.  Viserys wouldn't have even had a right to the throne, despite being a prince, since Rhaegar managed to sire a trueborn son that lived.<br /><br />Edit: I don't think that Jon even has a shot at the throne according to the rules, even if Aegon and Dany were to both die, unless they legitimized him, when they were king and or queen.  A bastard is a bastard, even if it is between two houses.  No clue who would have the closest claim then.  I would think the Targaryen line would be considered dead at that point, and the hunt would be on for the next closest Baratheon relative.

              I can't imagine that he isn't.  Especially considering that in the age where there's no DNA testing.  We just have to go on the word of Varys (shakey) and Jon Connington (stronger) that Aegon is who they claim him to be.  But considering how much time they've spent grooming him, I think it's pretty unlikely that they just picked some look-alike as a baby.  Plus, how would they go about proving that he <span style="font-style: italic">isn't</span> Aegon?  All the other pretender people, we've known to be pretenders, since they were either confirmed dead, or we knew that the real person was somewhere else.  All they'd have are the bones of a long dead infant, with no way of confirming whether used to be Targaryen.

It's pretty depressing if you think about it.</div><br />They'll probably time-compress the entire travel between the wall and the cave and not need much conversation.  Just an occaisional glimpse of Bran and Hodor and the wolf travelling through the cold with the occaisional vision from the 3-eyed crow.<br /><br />Also, Coldhands will have to be handled differently.  In the book, it's easy to leave the reader questioning whether it's Benjen Stark or not, since we never actually *saw* Benjen.  In the show, the viewers have already seen Benjen.  There will be little question whether he is or is not Coldhands.

Yes, they all stay together until they get to the wall, but then they run into Sam and Gily there, who escorts Rickon to Castle Black, and then he gets wisked away to safety in the east before Jon gets back.  Osha and Hodor both keep going beyond the Wall, and Rickon goes off to be forgotten like in the books.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also, Coldhands will have to be handled differently.

It's kind of the same thing with Selmy.  Unless they really do him up with makeup, and keep his name off the credits, people are going to notice him when he turns up in Quarth.

              Well first, I was speaking about it as from the perspective of the reader.  You're right that Connington's word to the people of Westeros is almost certainly suspect.  But, he was Rhaegar's best friend.  One would think that he could identify his son when presented to him, even if it has been months since he's seen him.  IIRC, we have had a chapter from Connington's perspective, and there wasn't a hint of deception from him in regards to Aegon's true bloodline.

              Anyway, my point is, with Rhaegar dead, they have no purpose to be there - they'd actually be breaking their oaths by not being in King's Landing or Dragonstone, where Viserys &amp; Dany were - unless there was royal blood in that tower.  And they weren't even mad at Ned, just sad and understanding.  It was Jaime who they hated.

I've re-read the conversation that Ned had with them at the tower, and it seemed rather clear that they felt they should be there.  Of course, that doesn't explain why they <span style="font-style: italic">weren't</span> in King's Landing previously, dying defending Aerys.  That oath about protecting the king is rather moot if the line of thought is &quot;well this king is screwed, let's leave him to die and go defend the next one!&quot;.  Plus, it still doesn't get around the idea that Jon is a bastard.  Rhaegar died before his wife Elia died, so he couldn't have married Lyanna, unless he also divorced Elia in secret.  With his trueborn heir (theoretically) killed in King's Landing, Viserys became king.
