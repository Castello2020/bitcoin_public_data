Don't know how much longer I could've lasted. But I think the one thing we all want to know is: Did you get it? Is the Moonshark gone?And if it is, I demand a photoshop of Aurich's face superimposed on Roy Scheider with the caption "Smile, you son of a bitch!"

It was jarring, not seeing my orange-in-black squares. I felt... deprived.Anyhoo, I saw a moonshark maybe 40 minutes ago. Perhaps it was simply a post-upgrade hiccup.

Maybe they only upgraded the moonshark? Moonshark: new and improved with eye lasers!

I highly recommend using the QuickQuote+Link bookmarklet.

Yeah, so I haven't really talked to the poor, tired tech team much today, they were up most of the night, but the bottom line is we're not done yet. Not sure if we'll need to go offline again, probably for shorter this time if so, but you shouldn't be seeing any real differences from before at this stage. naphini
