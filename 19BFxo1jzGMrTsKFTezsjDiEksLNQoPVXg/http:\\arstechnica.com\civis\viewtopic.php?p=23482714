Some are better than others, but IV has Malcolm Mcdowell, too.(Edit: D'oh. Slow /and/ the wrong installment.)

To be fair, I do remember being incredibly disappointed in Wing Commander IV. After playing Quake, I had really high hopes for graphical improvements that didn't materialize. It felt like the gameplay had taken a big back seat to the FMV.Lots of games of the era were sunk after going too far down the "multimedia" whole. Star Control III, for example. *sniffle*
