I'm a 19 year old university student from the UK who is learning my way around the programming world. Interested in physics, electronics and IT as well. My aim in life to get somewhere in programming or become an astrophysicist, and live into 2100 :D

How to install a private user script in Chrome 21+?
You have to quit chrome completely, not just open a new window from the icon. (this is rubbish of Google btw)

Will the removal of NAT (with the use of IPv6) be bad for consumers?
The answer provided here doesnt overlap with the answers in the question that is given as the reason to close. But at least someone answered the question before you trigger happy people got to it. Once again on Superuser, closing the question has done absolutely nothing...

Bad is a word in the dictionary, what is there to define? Will IPv6 actually mean the removal of NAT? How will IP addresses be assigned?

This is not about the progression, but when it's finished progressing, which should be well documented. Since when is waiting for a problem to occur rather trying to get ahead of it, a better option?

How to choose a modem/router/WAP based on it's various features?
It's not exactly 8 months, but roughly after 8-10 months the connection slows down (not just the internet speed, but like file transfers between local computers) and then it will just stop working every hour or so, and require it to be restarted. (it's been 2 speedtouchs, 2 Belkin N1 Visions, and a Belkin G+ MIMO)
