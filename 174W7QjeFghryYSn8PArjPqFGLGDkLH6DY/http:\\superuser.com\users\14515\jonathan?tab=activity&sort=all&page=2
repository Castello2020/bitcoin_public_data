I'm a 19 year old university student from the UK who is learning my way around the programming world. Interested in physics, electronics and IT as well. My aim in life to get somewhere in programming or become an astrophysicist, and live into 2100 :D

Laptop won't boot from anything except HDD
Ok, so it booted to ubuntu on USB stick, where I updated the master boot record, and checked the ntfs file system, which had no problems, and it had no effect on booting to windows.

Nice Question Jan22

Why do laptops need fans but tablets don't?
I can install Quasar on my jailbroken iPad 2, and it doesn't slow down significantly. But my gran's netbook (3 years old) takes for ever to start Chrome, nevermind running 2 things at once. Is it because desktop OS have been around for ages on many different systems and become "bloated", whereas Android, WP, and iOS are more made for the latest chips?
