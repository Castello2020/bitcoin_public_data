How can I have Windows 8 go to the desktop by default?
@TomWijsman, well he probably means that the new features are marginal compared to how big an addition the Metro UI is.

@Gigili, Thanks (I know, it's just that I desperately needed this answer and it's been too often when people have commented once and then not replied to follow up :))

How do URNs work?
@grawity, @TheCompWiz, so it's like a custom protocol (can't remember the exact name), like on phones you have a tel:01234567890, it should be urn:tel:01296720498, but for some reason the urn: has been dropped (which is more logical given that we don't have uri:http://google.com)?

Typically though you get the extension in a URL which tells you what it is. Why not just write the ISBN number without the urn:, it's not like you could click on that and be taken to the book?

So how can a URN be a type of URI, as the definition of a URI is species how to access a resource. What's the point of a URN if a URL does the same plus some?

How does a CD drive know where to look on a CD?
@Psycogeek, it is pretty good, I read it before asking here, it explains the bumps and that a laser is used to read them, but it doesn't say how the CD drive knows which bumps to read.

How does a CD drive know where to look on a CD?
@Ramhound, well that's not really possible, often the disk will have a higher capacity than the RAM, and if you say it reads it to the HDD, you can read discs when the hard drive is full.
