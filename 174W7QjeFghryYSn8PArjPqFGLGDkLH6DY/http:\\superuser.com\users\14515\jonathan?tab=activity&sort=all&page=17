I'm a 19 year old university student from the UK who is learning my way around the programming world. Interested in physics, electronics and IT as well. My aim in life to get somewhere in programming or become an astrophysicist, and live into 2100 :D

Remote Desktop connection, and browsing locally
Well I'm not specifically watching videos, just browsing the internet and would like to be able to watch videos like on the BBC site. Without having to be at my computer, but also being able to have access to my desktop, files and programs at the same time. I'm not 100% sure but the xbox 360 using RDC for its media center, yet streaming videos from things like Sky Player are normal quality and I guess are done on the xbox not the PC.

Linux that is just a RDP client
Thanks, thinstation is exactly what I'm looking for. A little bit of a side note, is there a way to browse the internet on the local machine, so that things like videos are normal quality?
