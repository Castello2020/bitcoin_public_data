The addon currently gets this information from a server-side list generated by scraping:

The addon also offers a "stumble" button that takes you to a random Bitcoin-accepting site.

If you notice a site incorrectly listed as taking Bitcoin or a site incorrectly listed as not taking Bitcoin, there are two ways to correct the problem:

1. Submit a correction by clicking on the icon and hitting the button. Corrections are reviewed manually, and will be taken into account as soon as I get to it.
2. If a site is missing, list it on &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/d88367a70ef5e531bd9db84382a13a97350ae23a89d357fa1a872837bcd0c25d/http%3A//reddit.com/r/btcbase" rel="nofollow"&gt;reddit.com/r/btcbase&lt;/a&gt;, and it will be automatically scraped and added within 12-36 hours.

Web pages will no longer be able to listen to &lt;code&gt;copy&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;paste&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cut&lt;/code&gt; events to learn what you are copying or pasting, they won't even know that you do it at all. And they won't be able to interfere to push unwanted content to your clipboard when you copy text.

There are legitimate uses for these events (online editors) but these are irrelevant for most people. It is unlikely that you will ever notice the functionality loss.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Wladimir Palant</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2013 02:00:25 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/nocopypaste/versions/1.0.1</guid></item><item><title>Back/Forward History Tweaks (restartless) 1.1</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/back-forward-history-tweaks/</link><description>This addon will add the following customizable features to Back / Forward buttons (when right click or left click and hold):

It can also be installed/uninstalled/enabled/disabled all without requiring a restart, hence the name "Restartless Restart".

Functionality is different for Fennec, to restart Fennec simply enable Restartless Restart, it will always be disabled.

Restartless Restart is similar to the &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3559/" rel="nofollow"&gt;QuickRestart&lt;/a&gt; add-on except it doesn't work on FF &amp;lt; 4, it does work on FF 4, it's restartless, it's 12KB instead of 34KB, it works for the latest versions of Fennec, Seamonkey and Thunderbird.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Erik Vold</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jan 2013 23:36:35 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/restartless-restart/versions/9</guid></item><item><title>Group scheduler for Firefox 2.30</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/group-scheduler-for-firefox/</link><description>&lt;b&gt;Finding a common time for a meeting with ScheduleOnce is a very simple process:&lt;/b&gt;

Automatically opens your selected Websites on specific days of the week, specific dates of the month or year and at specific times. Use the Catchup feature in case you miss your schedule (if you are away) and the Startup feature to open Websites when the browser starts.
The main screen is organized as a table showing the Days of the Week, the address of the Website, the corresponding Bookmark Name (optional) and the Time to open the website. The user can load Websites from the Current Page or from Bookmarks / Tags. Websites can open in a new Tab or new browser Window. You can also choose to open Websites immediately for a particular Day and Time Interval.


0. "My Weekly Browsing" is located on the Firefox "Tools" menu
(and you can choose to add a quick launch Icon to your Firefox toolbar)
1. You can enter the same Website as many times as you like, for example you might like to visit a Website in the morning, at lunch time, in the afternoon and in the evening
2. Websites that have the same day and time are loaded in the order in which they appear in the table, top (first) to bottom (last)
3. You can change the Website order in the table by clicking on the Up and Down arrows
4. To sort by Website, Bookmarks, Days of the Week, Catchup or Startup then simply click on the Column heading at the top of the table
5. You can customize the layout of the table by choosing the number of Rows to Display and the width of the Schedule &amp;amp; Columns
6. Use the Right-Click Menu in Firefox to easily add the current Webpage to "My Weekly Browsing"
7. You can select multiple Bookmarks / Tags to add by using Shift + Click in "Add from Bookmarks"
8. Use the Import function to import a list of Websites from a simple text file
9. "Open Websites Now" will immediately open Websites for a particular Day and Time Interval
10. You can open a single Website directly by using Ctrl + Click in the Website column
11. Optionally close the My Weekly Browsing window when choosing "Open Websites Now" or Ctrl-Click to open a Website
12. A "No Set Time" option for opening Websites without a Time setting
13. A "Focus tab to front" option for bringing the scheduled tab to the front
14. Re-size the Website/Bookmark columns and choose whether to display Bookmarks or Descriptions
15. Option to: Reload Tab if already open
16. Create Groups of Websites
17. Notify in Toolbar instead of opening Website
18. Search for your Schedules
19. Minimize the Schedule Screen down to just Open Websites Now and the ability to launch groups from the miniscreen
20. Re-use a Tab (for example streaming audio)
21. Dynamic Dates (for example http:// www.dilbert .com/strips/comic/{YYYY-MM-DD} = http:// www.dilbert .com/strips/comic/2011-09-03)
22. Open Websites on Specific Dates (for example 11/03/12 = 12th March 2011)
23. Don't load tabs until selected  - if you select this option then the scheduled tabs will be created in Firefox, but the webpages for those tabs will not load until the user selects them.
24. You can synchronize your schedules using the “Xmarks Sync” Firefox add-on.
25. Option for: Same day Catchup if you want to catchup websites earlier on the same day.
26. New tab delay option - for spacing apart the opening of simultaneous tabs. (note: not compatible with the "Don't load tabs until selected" option nor "Reload Tab if already open" option.
27. Option to set an End Date (green icon). After the End Date has been reached (red icon), then schedules will no longer load automatically.

(listit, list.it) 0.5.0.2</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/listit/</link><description>list-it is a simple, free and fully open-source Firefox-based note taking tool to help you manage short important notes to self. It is designed to be simple, fast and minimal so that it is easy to use and understand. We are also constantly finding and improving ways to help you find your notes again so your information scraps don't get lost.

All notes are kept on your computer in your Firefox profile. You can back up your notes to our server hosted at MIT.

list-it can also be used as an tool for human computer interface researchers to study the in-situ use of personal note taking tools. It is instrumented to provide high fidelity activity logging and aggregation/uploading of use data, which can be enabled if desired. These fine-grained timestamped logs of when and where actions were taken (note creation, edit, and access) so can then be studied later to understand note taking practice. 

Our team consists of Max Van Kleek, Greg Vargas, Michael Bernstein and Katrina Panovich, and our PIs are Prof. David Karger and monica (mc) schraefel.

list-it is a collaboration with the University of Southampton and the Nokia Research Center, and is supported by the Web Science Research Initiative and the The National Science Foundation.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">electronic Max</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2011 15:49:24 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/listit/versions/0.5.0.2</guid></item><item><title>Quick Maps 1.9.1</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/quick-maps/</link><description>With Quick Maps you can find Locations on Google Maps in just a second.

When enabled on your Firefox browser, this add-on will automatically identify numbers such as prices and other currency information within the contents of the webpages that you are browsing and make such numbers "clickable" so that you can convert them into another currency or commodity instantly. For example, when you are visiting one of your favorite shopping or auction sites, this add-on will let you click on any price tag displayed on your screen and convert that amount to one of the 180+ currencies available using up-to-date foreign exchange rates right on your browser without the need to open another window or tab.
 
Other popular features of this add-on include:
 &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to select how you want the numbers appear on your browser screen – solid-underline (default), dotted-underline, or no-underline from the add-on options menu&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Auto-populate the conversion amount from the web page that you are visiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify your locale based on the version of the Firefox you are using and configure "decimal separators" accordingly (e.g., if you are a user from the United Kingdom, the decimal separator will be a "period"; if you are a user from Spain, the decimal separator will be a "comma", etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remember your last conversion and use those FROM and TO parameters for your next conversion request so that you don't need to make the same selections each time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to invert the conversion you make and access to daily, weekly, monthly, and annual charts depicting the historical exchange trends of the currency pair that you selected&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smart identification of currency figures (add-on will not highlight every number on webpage; it will omit figures such as time, dates, percentages, phone numbers, temperature degrees, SKU numbers, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;This add-on is a web based service and does not download any currency exchange rate information to your computer; however, it requires an active internet connection. The conversion page that displays the exchange results includes advertisement/sponsor links.
