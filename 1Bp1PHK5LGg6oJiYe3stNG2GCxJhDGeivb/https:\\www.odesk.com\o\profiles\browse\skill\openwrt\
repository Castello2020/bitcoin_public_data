Over the past 6 years working as Technical Support I have acquired a very good knowledge of HelpDesktop support on Microsoft, MacOSX, and Linux platforms. My tasks consisted of keeping our clients clean and safe from viruses and malware, configuring SMB/AFP shared folders, FTP servers, configuring ATA and ATA switch from PSTN to SIP, configuring Firewalls and Mail servers and clients, as well as building up ad-hoc network appliances.
In addition, I promptly helped out customers with any problems they have had.
