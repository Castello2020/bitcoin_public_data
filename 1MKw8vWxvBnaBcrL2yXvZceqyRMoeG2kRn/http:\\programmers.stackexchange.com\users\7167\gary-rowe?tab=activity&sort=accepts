I'm a Java contractor working in the UK. My specialities are in the open source web application development frameworks:
Dropwizard, HAL, Spock
Spring, Hibernate, jQuery
JAX-RS, JAXB and so on.
I'm always updating my skillset, and if you'd like to see what I'm currently working on in my spare time why not check out my personal blog.
