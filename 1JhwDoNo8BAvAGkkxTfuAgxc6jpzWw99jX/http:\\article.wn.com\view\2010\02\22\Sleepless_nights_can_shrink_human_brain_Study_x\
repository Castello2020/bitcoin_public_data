Sleepless nights can shrink human brain: Study London: In a finding that could lead to new treatment for insomnia, a new study has claimed that sleeplessness may actually shrink a person's brain. The University of Cambridge study — the first to link insomnia to a reduction in vital grey matter — showed that those with chronic sleep problems had lower grey matter density in brain areas used to make decisions.

Altena is a town in the district of Märkischer Kreis, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The town's castle is the origin for the later Dukes of Berg. Altena is situated on the Lenne river valley, in the northern streches of the Sauerland.
Altena Castle was build in the early 12th century, as a stronghold of the older Counts of Berg. A short time later a village was founded beneath the hill, with the castle alongside the river Lenne. After the distribution of the Berg family estates in 1161, Altena became the centre of the County of Altena. The first Count of Altena became Eberhard I, Count of Berg-Altena. In 1180, after the death of the first count, the county was divided between the two oldest sons: Arnold of Altena and Friedrich of Altena. The Third son: Adolf of Altena became Archbishop of Cologne. Arnold was provided with on half of the Castle and County of Altena, the Castle Hövel and some estates as fiefdoms of the Archbishops of Cologne and balliwicks of the Abbey Essen. Near the Village and Castle of Hövel, he build the Castle and town of Nienbrügge (Novus Ponte) on the Lippe riverbanks. His family branch renamed themselves after selling their half of Altena to the Archbishop of Cologne as de Nienbrügge or de Novus Ponte, their new principle residence about forty kilometers to the north. The heir of Arnold was Friedrich de Novus Ponte (Nienbrügge) who changed his title to Isenberg after his new castle in Hattingen. He was sentenced to death as head of the conspiration to murder Engelbert I. Archbishop of Cologne, Chancellor of the Holy Roman Empire, Duke of Westphalia and Count of Berg - a close relative - in 1226. The Archbishop was ambushed and slain on his way from his City of Soest to City of Cologne by Friedrich and his men near Gevelsberg in a hollow way. Both had a dispute over the balliwicks of Essen Abbey.

Siddhartha Video / Audiobook - By Herman Hesse [Part 2]
Siddhartha is one of the great philosophical novels. Profoundly insightful, it is also a beautifully written story that begins as Siddhartha, son of an Indian Brahman, leaves his family and begins a lifelong journey towards Enlightenment. On the way he faces the entire range of human experience and emotion: he lives with ascetics, meets Gotama the Buddha, learns the art of love from Kamala the courtesan, and is transformed by the simple philosophy of the ferryman Vasudeva whose wisdom comes not from learned teachings but from observing the River. Hermann Hesse (1877-1962) was a German-Swiss novelist, poet, and painter. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1946. (Summary by Adrian Praetzellis)

---------------- What are theta brainwaves? ---------------
Theta brainwaves are considered extremely relaxing brainwave activity that is commonly associated with sleep and dreaming. Theta brainwaves are high in amplitude and cycle within the range of 4 -- 8 Hz and are usually generated in the brains right hemisphere. Theta waves kick in when we feel emotional, relaxed, daydreamy, unfocused, or are asleep. Theta brainwaves are generally thought of as the brainwaves that are dominant in people with A.D.D., high levels of relaxation, high levels of creativity, and random thinking. The theta brainwave is considered the brainwave pattern that is dominant in deeply relaxed, dream sleep.
Theta brain waves typically range from 4 Hz to 8 Hz. Theta brain waves are associated with the "subconscious mind" and are usually produced in the right-hemisphere of the brain - as opposed to beta brain waves, which are produced in the left-hemisphere and are associated with the "conscious mind." The brain creates theta brain wave rhythms each time you are in "dream sleep." Also, during R.E.M. [Rapid-Eye Movement] sleep, the brain is full of theta brain wave activity.
Nearly 3/5 of your entire time spent sleeping at night involves the production of theta brain waves in your brain. Many individuals also are able to access theta brain waves when they are: driving for a long stretch on the highway, practicing their meditation routine, using a self-hypnosis recording, or practicing other forms of deep relaxation. When you are able to consciously access the alpha brain waves state, you are just one step away from accessing the depths of theta.
What's cool about theta brain waves is the fact that they allow you to connect with your "subconscious mind."

Is China Losing Grip of its Communist Identity Bubble for China Communism Lie
Although China will commemorate 50 years of Communist Party rule this year, communism is dead in the hearts and minds of its people.
Like their former comrades in Russia and Eastern Europe, the Chinese people prefer market riches to Marxist dogma. Now even the Communist Party leaders are conceding that private enterprise is here to stay.
At its annual meeting, scheduled to begin today, the National People's Congress, China's parliament, is expected to amend article 11 of the constitution and officially recognize that privately owned enterprises are an "important part of the socialist, market economy."
The diminishing role of state-owned enterprises, SOEs, and the raising status of non-state enterprises, including private firms, are realities that the ruling elite can no longer ignore. State enterprises account for only 30% of industrial output, but their political pull has meant that they still capture the bulk of investment resources - bureaucrats directed 70% of state bank loans to SOEs last year. With the change in the constitution, private firms hope to be able to compete on a more equal basis for scarce capital.
If the people's congress does approve the constitutional change and recognizes "multiple forms of ownership" in addition to state ownership, the Communist Party will be admitting what the common folk already know: The future of China lies with free markets and private property.
In a 1997 Gallup survey, interviews with both urban and rural residents in China found that the most commonly held attitude toward life was "Work hard and get rich" (56%), while the least popular was "Never think of yourself, give everything in service to society" (3%). Today, unlike the time of the Cultural Revolution 30 years ago, one's own future comes first. And that future is in the vibrant market sector, not in the stagnant state sector.
Nearly a decade after the Tiananmen Square uprising, President Jiang Zemin has made "stability" the No. 1 policy to ensure no deviation from the basic party line. But his increasingly harsh crackdown on dissidents is a sign of weakness, not of strength.
The truth is, the Communist Party of China is weaker now than at any time since 1949. The economic liberalization that began in 1978 has given more power to the people, and, unintentionally, undercut the Party's power.
The dismal condition of SOEs, the deterioration of state budgetary revenues, and the fragile condition of China's banking sector threaten the very existence of the party. That is why China's leaders are nervous.
The decrease in budgetary revenues from the shrinking state sector has been dramatic. Tax revenues have fallen from 35% of gross domestic product in 1978 to 11%. The economic base of the party is in freefall. And to add fuel to the fire, China's state-run banks are faced with a mountain of non-performing loans.
China cannot solve its economic problems alone. That is why it is essential for the West, especially the United States, to continue its policy of engagement and refine its policy of engagement.
The United States should help move China in the direction of greater economic and personal freedom by normalizing trade relations, integrating China into the global trading order, and promoting exchange on a broad front. Congress should not let the bilateral trade deficit with China interfere with that strategy.
Any movement away from freer trade and toward protectionism would only delay China's progress toward freedom and prosperity and harm the global economy. Trade sanctions should be used only in extreme cases and only when they have a high chance of success; too often they can delay real reform.
Likewise, China should be admitted to the World Trade Organization as soon as possible, provided China respect the principles of a liberal trading order, including the rule of law and the principle of non-discrimination.
Congress should recognize that advancing economic freedom in China has had positive effects on the growth of China's civil society and on personal freedom. Today, millions of Chinese are able to travel freely, own their own homes, choose their own clothes, show affection in public, select their course of studies, and work where they want to.
As President Clinton said in his State of the Union speech, "The more we bring China into the world, the more the world will bring change and freedom to China."
Despite continuing human rights' violations, the China of 1999 is not the China of the Cultural Revolution. Although the pace of progress has been slow, China is creeping along in the right direction.
The torch of liberty will burn brighter only if China continues to open to the outside world. It is in the interest of world peace and prosperity that the West not lose the opportunity to engage China and let communism die a natural death.

Did the internet kill our attention span?
Read more here: http://www.vidadbox.com. The attention span of a regular internet user is on a sharp decline - in year 2000 it was an estimated 12 seconds, but in 2012 it has gone to an embarrassing 8 seconds. A goldfish is known to have an attention span of 9 seconds. How much text can be read in such a short time? What is apparent is that the internet use is changing. Internet surfers need engaging content and, amazingly, with such a steep decline in attention span, the average length watched of a single internet video is an astonishing 2.7 minutes.... So why don't you have a video on your website yet?
