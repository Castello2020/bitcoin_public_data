Usage: ./Reddit_Image_Scraper [-l limit] [-u] [-q] subbreddit1|username1|query1 [subbreddit2|username2|query2 ...]
Reddit Image Scraper is a perl script designed to read in one or more
subreddits and download all the images in it that are hosted on the
imgur.com image hosting site. Be aware that this script can chew through bandwidth quickly, especially if given a large list of
subreddits. Please be courteous of the bandwidth of both reddit.com
and imgur.com. Let's keep these two free resouces just that: free.
Prune.sh:
Usage: ./Prune.sh [min # of photos]
or
./Prune.sh -1
Prune.sh is a shell script to help maintain a collection of directories
created from Reddit_Image_Scrpaer. Running Prune.sh with a positive number will delete any directory with less than that number of photos. Running it
with a -1 will list all the directorys and the number of photos in them.
