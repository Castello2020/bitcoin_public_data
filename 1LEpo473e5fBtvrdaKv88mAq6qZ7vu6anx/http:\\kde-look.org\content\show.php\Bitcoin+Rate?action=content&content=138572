Installation:
Download the zip file, unzip it, and type:

if that doesn't work, try
plasmapkg -i btcRate
Then the plasmoid should be available when you select "Add new widgets" from the desktop or the panel. Let me know if it works!
About bitcoins
Bitcoins are a decentralized electronic currency designed for easy exchange of money between individuals over the internet. They can be very useful for people who want to develop simple payment solutions without depending on big players like PayPal. They can also be extremely efficient as a micropayment scheme.
More info: http://www.bitcoin.org/Changelog:Version 0.9 is a polishing and bugfixing release. It fixes the URL and a couple other problems.
Version 0.8 fetches the data in the background to avoid freezing the desktop. A new algorithm for computing the rate is also introduced, which should still be robust but respond faster to changes in the market.
Version 0.7 improves icon placement on big screens.
Version 0.6 adds a daily volume estimate, which gives a more long-term vision of what is happening.
Version 0.5 displays the time of the last update and handle network errors more gracefully.
Version 0.4 adds a tooltip that displays current volume and the last trade price
Version 0.3 improves display and refresh rate.License: GPLSend to a friendSubscribeOther Artwork from joelthelionReport inappropriate content
goto page: prev 1 2 No longer working by lnxusr on: Mar 22 2013 Score 50%
lnxusrJohnny West 0Last visit Apr 29 20140 Friends0 GroupsMore infoSend a messageAdd as friendOther contentsIt no longer displays the bitcoin rate. It started off randomly showing $0.00 every now and then, now it's just blank for the past two days.
Also, there is no file in the .zip newer than June 14, 2011. I even downloaded again, but still nothing newer than that. Did the 0.9 update not get uploaded or something? Why the sudden quit working? Why no comments on here since 2011 as well??Reply to this Needs API URL update by piit79 on: Apr 1 2013 Score 50%
piit79Petr Sedlacek 0United KingdomLast visit Apr 1 20130 Friends0 GroupsMore infoSend a messageAdd as friendOther contentsSeeing the previous comment that the plasmoid doesn't work correctly I had a quick look into the code and tried loading the API URL manually. I got a message that the address needs to be updated. The address on line 51 of btcRate/contents/code/main.py needs to be changed from
https://mtgox.com/code/data/getTrades.php
to
https://data.mtgox.com/code/data/getTrades.php
With this URL the widget works correctly.Reply to this Re: Needs API URL update by AndrewPotter on: Apr 24 2013 Score 50%

Would it be possible to add an option for setting the source address of trading history? For example, I'd like to watch prices on https://bitcash.cz/market/index.php (history list https://bitcash.cz/market/api/BTCCZK/trades.json) rather than MtGox.Reply to this New working version: by dusoft on: Nov 18 2013 Score 50%
