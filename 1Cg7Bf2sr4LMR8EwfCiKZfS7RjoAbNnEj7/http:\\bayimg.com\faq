<ul>
<li>Q: Ok, what's all this?</li>
<li>A: This is our next step in our quest for world domination!!1oneoneone Ok, not really. It's a site were you can upload images for free and show them for your friends and foes. What differs our site from all the other similiar site is the cool user friendly functions. And that it's uncensored. Yup, lets say it again. Uncensored.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Q: What's the big deal about it being uncensored?</li>
<li>A: Well, we really think it is a big deal. Freedom of speech is our foundation. And it doesn't come cheap. You might have heard that old quote by Evelyn Beatrice Hall; "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it." It's really that simple. There are a lot of ugly opinions out there, but demoracy ain't worth much without the right to express those opinions. There is this myth about freedom of speech being a nice comfortable idea, well it's not. It's annoying, appalling and sometimes even dangerous. But the opposite is way worse.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Q: Hey so this is just a new project from The Pirate Bay? Is this just so you can post free pictures of Paris Hilton and Pirates of the Caribbean?</li>
<li>A: Yeah, some of us run The Pirate Bay as well as 100 other cool projects. But please dont insult our taste and intelligence. Though we enjoy any picture of Paris in jail, we'd be more happy to see pictures of: you, you dressed up like a pirate, Hï¿½kan Roswall in a pink dress (don't ask) or anything that would make the world a happier place.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Q: Tag Cloud? Please explain!</li>
<li>A: The tag cloud is a cool cloud that works like a top list of tags. But in the form of a cloud. Tiny words are less frequent tags, bigger words more frequent.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Q: Ok, I wanna remove that silly picture of me as a drunken sailor, that I uploaded yesterday.</li>
<li>A: When you uploaded the picture, you wrote a removal code. Kind of like a password. Now type it in and noone will ever see that picture again!</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Q: Why dont you Pirate Bay guys ever finish a project before starting a new one?</li>
<li>A: We do whatever we want, whenever we want. If it doesnt suit you, you can start your own empire.</li>
