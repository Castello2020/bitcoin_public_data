		<p style="text-align: left;">The Internet&#8217;s so-called benzodiazepine withdrawal support forums (i.e. cults) have super-long lists of possible benzo withdrawal symptoms. The list below attempts to bring those lists together in one giant super-sized list. It contain some duplicate symptoms. There are also symptoms that do not appear on the cult site&#8217;s lists such as <a href="http://www.phobia-fear-release.com/fear-of-butter.html">fear of butter</a>, or the proverbial <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Sz2yP.jpg">McDonalds Filet-O-Fish sandwich</a> that sent someone into a several month long wave, but 99% of the below symptoms are actually found on their sites.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The unfortunate benzophobic members of these so-called support sites are a combination of drug addicts, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Sz2yP.jpg">the untreated mentally ill</a>, or simply dangerous lunatics (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/jl9xRds.jpg">Flick</a>). They&#8217;ve often been pressured by peers into stopping the very medications that have helped them lead normal lives. These sad people have been brainwashed into believing prescription drugs are a giant conspiracy designed by Big Pharma, doctors and psychiatry.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The cult&#8217;s spiritual mother &#8211; Prof. Heather Ashton &#8211; has fostered this gift to mankind. Thank you Prof. Ashton. Bravo.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Samantha, </p>
<p>Yes. Many do. It could be allergies, a cold or virus, from mold, from smoking cigarettes, or hell, even fatal Cystic Fibrosis. If the mucous is clear, you&#8217;re probably okay. If it&#8217;s yellow or green, it points to a bacterial or viral infection. If it&#8217;s chronic, see an MD, regardless of the color.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pro-med, but in this case, it&#8217;s wiser to go natural. I.e., drink water, blow your nose and cough A LOT. Honey and other natural &#8220;remedies&#8221; have been proven not to work, so stay away from that aisle. You can buy a &#8220;Netti Pot&#8221;, but you HAVE to buy sterile water or boil water. You also have to sterilize all parts. You can get parasites or even meningitis if you fail to do this. IMO, I&#8217;d chose a simple saline nose spray + a steam humidifier (or run a hot water shower while you sit in the bathroom with doors closed) + Vic&#8217;s menthol rub + get a sputum culture ran to see if the cause is bacterial, fungal, viral, or something else. I&#8217;d stay away from OTC meds until it&#8217;s cleared by an MD. </p>
<p>You can take Mucinex, Sudafed or Benadryl to clear up the excess mucous, but you have to be really cautious. You have to watch out when buying OTC stuff. You probably don&#8217;t want &#8220;cough suppressants&#8221;, as the mucous needs to come out, and suppressants can interfere with getting the right diagnosis. Also, not everyone can handle each med. If you have high blood pressure, avoid Sudafed and get the high-BP friendly kind (Coricidin HBP). If you have untreated and severe thyroid or heart problems, it&#8217;s advised to avoid Benadryl. It&#8217;s also wise to avoid Cold/Flu mixtures with &#8220;everything&#8221; in them (antihistamines, Tylenol, cough suppressants and expectorants) until you see a doctor.  </p>
<p>As for Mucinex&#8230; They&#8217;re not sure how or even IF it works, but some people swear by it. Avoid anything with DXM in it, which Mucinex usually contains, especially if you&#8217;re on any anti-depressants (SSRI&#8217;s, SNRI&#8217;s, MAOI&#8217;s).</p>
<p>One super easy thing to do is ask your MD for a sputum culture. They often don&#8217;t run them&#8211; I have no idea why. It&#8217;s not invasive&#8211; you just cough up deep phlegm, and that&#8217;s about it. <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003723.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003723.htm</a></p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I don&#8217;t get why you mock people who have experienced benzo withdrawal. I  experienced SSRI withdrawal, it was real, I&#8217;m not nuts, I wasn&#8217;t imagining things, it was horrible. Even Drs. know this is a reality, especially for this kind of medication that has a very high potential of addiction.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Johnny, sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but you have much deeper problems than benzo WD.</p>
<p> These symptoms listed are not posted to ridicule but to point out how an online cult can cause mass psychogenic illness in a group of vulnerable people. Yes, that level of crazy can be pretty funny, even to those suffering serious WD.</p>
<p>You see not everyone is as vulnerable to silly suggestions. Some retain some common sense and thus realize that we can not blame doctors or drugs for every problem we have in life! LOL</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Used to work in a psych ward as a tech about 12 years ago.  Benzo withdrawal can be pretty bad, usually it&#8217;s just mental, anxiety, insomnia but I&#8217;ve seen a couple seizures, probably people taking huge doses, it&#8217;s really not much different than DTs from booze except much milder.  Docs would just give them Ativan every 2 hours but on a few occasions, people wouldn&#8217;t divulge they were on benzos and got really sick.  It can be nasty but all those symptoms?  Nah</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>hahah im not sure if this is a joke article making fun of people in WDs or not, but let me tell you WDs are real. I have just been through a month from hell which I was not even aware was from my Xanax WDs because it was so extreme. Other than the normal problems sleeping, increased irritability and anxiety, I had very severe GI problems tapering only from 1mg to .25mg over 6 weeks. I was on 1mg at night for 3 year. I know I might be a rare case, but my digestive track basically stopped. They diagnosed me with moderate ideopathic gastroparesis and/or functional dyspepsia which is an awful debilitating disease to have where you can&#8217;t even eat really. I dropped 15 lbs in a month and couldn&#8217;t keep food down. I was the one that suggested it could be from Xanax because that it what I originally thought until symptoms got so bad I was in the ER and had about 10k in tests done on me. I am not back at my original dose and can eat a lot more although I still have mild dyspepsia. I guess I owe a big thank you to my PCP who denied me valium for my taper upon my request&#8230;.f&#8217;in dick. Lets see what he has to say now that 2 GI doctors have confirmed Xanax as the cause and hope no nerve damage was done. </p>
<p>Benzo withdrawal is no joke. Look it up and do it right. If you doctor does not agree, switch doctors.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>All too true&#8230; Ive been on and off benzos since I was 16, and now im 23. The wds are terrible, but I was also taking massive doses up to 10mg of xanax or kpins daily. Was also on methadone(2 1/2 years) for awhile and suboxone(2 years). My mom was a nurse and introduced me to oxycodone through stealing scripts from the dr she worked for, along with xanax and ativan which I had took recreationally but never daily. Not saying its her fault but it def. had an affect on me as a teenager and now into my early 20s.. absolute hell. Panic attacks all the time, legs and feet feel like they&#8217;re asleep all day&#8230; urinary release with no control&#8230; its absolutely horrible. Sometimes a .45 to the head sounds like a wonderful idea, but cant bring myself around to it. I think my brain and body have been damaged to a point of no return.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Benzos are no joke, but it is possible to get off them with a reasonable tapering schedule.  I have gone off 6 mg./day of klonopin in the course of a few months.  For many people, like those with anxiety issues anyway (the target group, who are likely to become uber-anxious when dealing with withdrawals), docs shouldn&#8217;t be prescribing benzos in the first place.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I totally agree about how the online benzo withdrawal groups can mislead someone who is tapering or has withdrawn from benzos into believing that EVERY little discomfort they have is related to the withdrawal. I was prescribed xanax back in 1997. Chief complaint: pain in left shoulder blade area. Other complaints: stiff joints upon rising, soreness, and low energy. I was immediately diagnosed with GAD after an xray revealed that my shoulder was fine. I was prescribed a ridiculous quantity (can&#8217;t remember exact number) of the 2 mg. tablets as a 90 day supply and required to see my doc every 3 months to renew the prescription. Prescribed dosage: take 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 or 1 tablet 3 X per day. Can you believe that? I tried taking 1/4 of a tablet and found that it made me feel sleepy and tired which was the LAST thing I wanted since I already felt low in the energy department. And, it didn&#8217;t do a thing to stop the pain in my shoulder. So, that was that&#8230;or so I THOUGHT. I returned to see my GP a couple of weeks later INSISTING that there was something definitely wrong with my shoulder. He asked me if I was taking my &#8220;medicine&#8221;. I told him I tried it, didn&#8217;t help, made me sleepy and tired. He told me that it MIGHT make me tired at first and if it didn&#8217;t relieve the pain in my shoulder it was because I didn&#8217;t take enough. He asked me how he was supposed to help me if I wouldn&#8217;t follow his orders. Okay, he had been my GP for years and had always gotten me well when I was sick before. Long story short&#8230;over a 4.5 year period, he kept increasing my dose until I was up to 6 mgs. a day spread out over 3 doses. All hell broke loose. I couldn&#8217;t sleep more than a couple of hours per night, I felt like I was bouncing off the walls and still felt the same after taking a dose of xanax. I went back to the GP numerous times insisting that it was the medication that was doing this to me. At one point, he told me that I would need this medication the rest of my life and pointed out to me that my anxiety disorder had gotten so out of control that I even feared the medication that would help me! What an idiot I was! I had NO idea what I had been pumping into my system. I came home and started doing some research on xanax and thought OMG! I also ran across the dangers associated with stopping cold turkey and how it should be stopped under the supervision of a doctor and slowly weaned off of. I went back to my doc and pretty much DEMANDED that he tell me how to get off the stuff! He told me that he had done all he could do to help my anxiety disorder, was stopping the prescription for the xanax, and set me up an appointment with a psychologist who of course, was a counselor and couldn&#8217;t even prescribe meds! I saw her, told her my story and she was LIVID! She told me that I could not just stop and that he HAD to give me refills for me to use to taper. I asked her if there was ANY way I could get off the stuff more quickly and she told me that I could always go to detox and that&#8217;s what I did. I spent 6 days there in which the first 4 was spent being dosed with  a longer acting benzo in which they reduced the dose each time until it was stopped at the end of the 4th day. They observed me for the last 2 days to make sure that I was going to be okay. I felt wonderful! I had nipped this thing in the bud, proven my doctor was an idiot, was calmer than I had felt in years, and had NO symptoms whatsoever when I was released around 8:00 pm. I got up the next morning a literally thought I was dying! I called the detox center and they assured me that everything I was experiencing had NOTHING to do with my withdrawal because benzo withdrawal symptoms only lasted 3 days! I ended up in the ER, was labeled a drug addict although I refused any meds they offered, and set up to see a psychiatrist the next morning. I felt a bit offended by that but decided to keep the appointment and am SO happy that I did. He explained to me that the half life of the long acting benzo I was given in detox had worn off and that I was very much experiencing withdrawal symptoms. He told me that I wouldn&#8217;t die but that I could expect to feel pretty rough for some time to come. </p>
<p>I came home and immediately joined a benzo withdrawal group. I managed to feel functional and was able to return to work in 3 weeks. I had no problems sleeping and no panic attacks but I did experience ongoing anxiety but just lived with it and totally gave up coffee. Over the next 2 years, I was diagnosed with acid reflux, carpal tunnel, fibromyalgia, checked for blood clots in my legs twice due to extreme swelling in my calves, and migraine headaches. The benzo group convinced me that all of these conditions were due to ongoing withdrawal. Then, sweat started pouring off of me all night long! By this time I was convinced that I had permanent damage from the benzo withdrawal and FEARED going to a doc because I had started to believe that I was actually DYING. I lived with the sweats and lack of sleep for 6-7 months and finally saw a doc about them. I was tested for everything imaginable. Results: healthy as a horse but my estrogen level was non-detectable! I had a partial hysterectomy in 1995&#8230;2 years before being prescribed that xanax. My ovaries started shutting down after the partial which caused perimenopause symptoms&#8230;the very symptoms that my doc prescribed the xanax for to begin with! I went all the way through menopause into post menopause before I ever experienced night sweats. Have never had a daytime hot flash. I was totally amazed that when I was started on estrogen replacement that EVERY symptom I was experiencing and contributing to benzo withdrawal as well as the other conditions that I had been diagnosed with and prescribed meds for by multiple docs during that 2 year period completely ceased. I NEVER had an anxiety disorder to begin with! And, as far as benzo withdrawal symptoms. Yes, I believe they are real but unless someone has a true disorder in which they actually NEED the benzos to manage, I do not believe that withdrawal symptoms are as broad ranged or last 18-24 months or even the rest of a person&#8217;s life like the withdrawal groups claim. While support groups CAN be helpful, I believe that people need to look for underlying reasons if they feel that withdrawal symptoms have lasted longer than a couple of month and aren&#8217;t improving every day. There are SO many other conditions that mimic withdrawal in addition to female hormonal woes. Thyroid problems are another example. Sorry this was so long but I wanted to share my story for those experiencing withdrawal or considering it.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>When I was on BB, I remember a thread which asked about members ages. I noticed a preponderance of women aged 40-60, which is menapousal age. And as you mentioned menapousal symptoms mimic many of &#8220;benzo WD&#8221; symptoms people complain about, as do thyroid problems.</p>
<p>I have read of symptoms that are so obviously those of common medical problems totally unrelated to benzo WD. </p>
<p>For the record Tom Jones and Filet&#8217;s of Fish make me sick too, but for reasons unrelated to benzo WD.</p>
<p>Finally, if one reads the Ashton Manual the list of potential symptoms is rather short and simple. I believe it was Bayliss Johns who turned the whole WD experience into an epic novel of a tragic heroine who suffered greatly, for years in every way possible yet overcame her plight and survived. This is BB&#8217;s second bible, the first obviously being Ashton. We will have to see if Matt Samet is granted sainthood.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Honestly, the interesting thing about many of the symptoms of benzo w/d (while I do think much of it is people freaking out, which is also normal if you remove something that has artificially kept someone calmer than normal) deal with muscle tension. Why I find this interesting is that there really aren&#8217;t any doctors that specialize in muscles. None. Sports medicine doctors and surgeons handle them in terms of strains, and neurologists do when it&#8217;s a defined neurological disease. But this is also why for years people have said people with muscle problems (think fibromyalgia, MPS, etc.) were told it&#8217;s all in their heads. It&#8217;s actually not, it&#8217;s muscular and CNS related, as the nervous system regulates the tension in the soft tissues. Also, smooth muscle is just as susceptible to tension as any other, so if it hits the bowels, it&#8217;s considered a bowel issue. Bladder, bladder issue. Back, they look for something spinal. But few doctors (if any) actually work in this area, period. If there were doctors that specialized in musculoskeletal issues more, people in this state would get the same care as someone seeking medical help for any other organ. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m just saying that this is why people likely seem as if they&#8217;re experiencing massive problems all over the body. Muscle tension can mimic just about everything. I have, btw, been in and out of hospitals since this began, and every time I get told that in addition to the medical issues not related at all to benzo w/d that pretty much every muscle in my body has stopped reacting normally and is causing a lot of other problems. It helps knowing it&#8217;s just muscles, but it doesn&#8217;t make it any less painful or dysfunctional. For people on BB who are just having minor musculoskeletal problems it really just seems like a cluster of weird symptoms in different parts of the body, most likely. But it does lead to major panic since the body&#8217;s muscles just normally do not feel that way at ALL. Remember, valium, klonopin and ativan (more than other benzos) are prescribed in many pain patients to relax soft tissue, they are powerful drugs for many of those conditions. </p>
<p>Any thoughts on this? I&#8217;d post it at BB but I&#8217;d just get told &#8220;it&#8217;s w/d, stupid, go read your Ashton!&#8221; or worse, &#8220;you tapered too quickly, hahaha!&#8221;. Dammit.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>What a fascinating, useful post. </p>
<p>Thank you for that. I really enjoyed reading it. This is a great example of a fantastic post when it comes to the discussion surrounding these types of things. You are just throwing something very logic based and interesting out there without making any claims against those that disagree. Just a great and likely accurate thought. I am really impressed with that.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thank you Paul, I am interested in all of this and found that no  matter what I wrote at BB I would just get annoyed replies stating that it&#8217;s all just withdrawal, as if the symptoms of withdrawal had no physiological basis, when it obviously does. That leaves muscles, soft tissues, which are the very things that no one ever tests in medical settings. They really don&#8217;t. It takes having an EMG to assess nerve damage to muscles, but muscles will react normally to an EMG without nerve damage. That leaves biofeedback machines, from what I know, and you have to go to very specific neuromuscular doctors or PTs to even get that sort of test. Running to an ER or even primary doctor complaining of any neuromuscular symptoms doesn&#8217;t get anyone anywhere, whether they&#8217;re in benzo withdrawal or not. </p>
<p>If you notice on BB, the people who post who persist in finding a medical diagnosis for their symptoms are generally given diagnoses (which seem to last only as long as the withdrawal reaction lasts) of fibromyalgia, MPS, CFS, etc. Or IBS or other &#8220;syndrome&#8221; diagnoses particular to certain organs. In other words, neuromuscular illnesses that anyone would have trouble getting diagnosis or treatment for because so few doctors specialize in these disorders. However, research into these disorders points to nervous system disruption/central sensitivity, which this particular reaction to benzos is extremely similar to. </p>
<p>I just find it interesting.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Frogger you raise excellent points. </p>
<p>What I have seen at Benzo Buddies is almost every medical complaint gets labeled &#8220;benzo withdrawal&#8221; &#8211; to the point of serious health conditions being ignored until a member gets so sick they&#8217;re rushed to the emergency room. In post after post, members state &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t withdrawal after all&#8221; and then proceed to tell horror stories of disease being neglected because of Ashton ideology.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>M-59, I was just at the doctor, and we were discussing myofascial pain issues, and he said that sometimes it is an injury that brings it on, sometimes just a lot of stress, there are many factors. The nervous system plays a large role. But my foray into having to treat muscle pain and my other issue (which is not caused by w/d at all) is teaching me quite a bit, and every last bit of it relates back to the things I see at BB and how many of these w/d issues are simply muscular tension that the body isn&#8217;t used to. I believe benzo w/d can bring this on, and certainly does initially (that is the warning with most benzos anyway, that cessation can bring muscle tension) but after a while you&#8217;re not still in w/d, you are having a different reaction. The thing is, left untreated it can get a LOT worse. And as you mention, there can also be underlying causes to it that definitely need medical attention! Furthermore, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily require medications to treat! It can otherwise become a self-perpetuating cycle. </p>
<p>If I had not sought medical treatment, I would have ended up permanently disabled. Or at least disabled for years and years.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>hey mike where can i find the archives of all of the things on this site from over the years? i have nothing to do so i thought i would read through a bunch of it. </p>
<p>i watched that latest video &#8220;im a bad girl&#8221; and saw some other youtube links with people all supposedly suffering tremendously from benzo withdrawal and post withdrawal and its put bad thoughts in my mind. i like not worrying about it and not making myself believe psychosomatically that there could be something wrong right now. </p>
<p>that shit on the internet really does need to go. lots of people would be fine if it didnt exist. even me, knowing what i know of this stuff&#8230; it can make me second guess my mindstate because we dont have a reference point to compare it to. Reading this site is the only thing that snaps me back to reality if I ever start worrying about it unnecessarily as a result of those types of sites. Thanks man, for real. </p>
<p>But yeah&#8230; are the archives down or am I just not finding them?</p>

<p>We know that benzo withdrawal exists, no one is denying that. The point of this site is to make it as clear as possible the potential that benzo support sites have to harm people to a drastic degree more than they help.</p>
<p>If it makes you feel any better, Ben, I was on 3 mgs of klonopin for almost 4 years and I tapered off in a couple of months and then completely quit&#8230; and it was nothing, NOTHING compared to opiate withdrawal. Not saying my subjective case should indicate how it will go for you or anyone else&#8230; But I AM saying that a lot of people like me are on those sites so stressed out about what they&#8217;re reading (and believing) that they are experiencing the hundreds of very real symptoms of stress/anxiety itself&#8230; If I were on one of those sites and believed everything I had read it would have destroyed my life, period. The point of this site is to take a stand against these sites&#8230; not to harm the people that have unfortunately become sucked into them or to insult anyone suffering while in BZ WD. Unless Mike wants to correct me as it&#8217;s his site and not mine.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>This White Knight guy is a benzo addict. He&#8217;s just mad that he can&#8217;t live without the stuff. Doesn&#8217;t have the strength or willpower to get off of them.  Either that or a pharmaceutical rep. Lol. That being said, i do think some of the withdrawal symptoms people claim are most likely from something else. Benzo withdrawal is real and you will know it when you feel it. You shouldn&#8217;t have to look for any of the symptoms. They are obvious and fairly intense. I can only speak for myself when i say that i felt way better mentally and physically post klonopin addiction. Benzos are not a good option for long term use. Any doctor will tell you that. There is nothing more pathetic than a guy hooked on downers.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>LOL! Hi Azog, I am not mad at all and I have not use any mood altering drugs, including benzos for many years now, thanks. I am not a big pharma employee. You are clearly not a very observant person. </p>
<p>So you are saying you were pretty pathetic, because you were once hooked on downers yourself? But now you are not pathetic because you are no longer &#8220;hooked&#8221;?</p>
<p>Please tell us more about yourself as you seem to have many &#8220;answers&#8221; for us all.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I was going to tell you, Azog, to simply go fuck yourself with a flaming pineapple backwards, but that would count as a threat to the pineapple.  Hence, just imagine such&#8230; I hate to make harmful statements towards tropical fruit.</p>
<p>Strength and willpower are beautiful things, bub, and you&#8217;re absolutely right on one point&#8230; you only CAN speak for yourself when it comes to just about any topic.  Everybody&#8217;s different&#8230;. I&#8217;m sorry that life isn&#8217;t full of clones of you, because George Lucas could have a field day making a movie about that.  Everyone here always says that withdrawals are a thing&#8230; read before commenting, dude.   Some people do just fine on benzos long-term, even though I do agree with you and doctors that it is not a recommended thing, but think of the alternative&#8230; oh wait&#8230; you can&#8217;t.  You&#8217;re not everybody else&#8230; you&#8217;re not a person whose anxiety and such literally cripple them without assistance from a drug.   Good for you, but as you call others pathetic for being on something that you apparently don&#8217;t require DOES NOT mean that there is one answer for all problems, and yours being the correct one.  Think analytically, man&#8230;.</p>
<p>That said, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re doing fine.  Some aren&#8217;t.  Others are micro-tapering, which is fucking ridiculous.  Prolonging pain&#8230; that&#8217;s a ball, really.  That&#8217;s one thing I learned when I was a chat mod on one of the sites that went down&#8230; everyone&#8217;s different.  There is no one specific rule to whether benzos are helpful or not&#8230; it is an individual thing.  I&#8217;m sure that since my friend uses blood pressure medication to keep from dying, and it helps him immensely, YOU, Azog, should certainly take it!  Why wouldn&#8217;t ya?  It helped my pal!!!!  What are ya, stupid?!  It doesn&#8217;t MATTER if you have heart problems or not&#8230; JUST TAKE IT!!!!!!  Or Micro-taper off of it because some nuts on the web said this was the thing to do because it didn&#8217;t work for them. </p>
<p>Get my drift, AZ? <img src="http://cesspoolofmadness.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>If indeed the cult is forming (whatever that is), I guess let it.<br />
I&#8217;m going through one, and this is a no joke.<br />
Majority of docs does not know about what they are prescribing.<br />
You need all the support and information you could possibly get, and no better place than people who goes through similar.<br />
I know some symptoms maybe not relating to it at all and some symptoms are secondary.<br />
I once heard someone complaining loosing hair and going gray.<br />
I thought to myself, well that&#8217;s just a part of aging., but didn&#8217;t speak it out.<br />
Good thing that I did not speak out, because you see, stress of going through this will surely make your hair fall out and go gray for some people.  When people are down, comforting them is the right thing to do.</p>
