I know I shouldnt bother responding to you.. but despite the fact that they are a large advertising company, and they probably are gathering information on your tendencies, they aren't forcing stupid ads on you. Looking at the main G+ feeds page, or whatever you want to call it, I don't see any ads trying to sell me anything that I "like". Ever notice how when you "like" something on FB, there are immediately links to the left of your page offering you services and pages that are similiar to what you just "liked"? Not on G+.

I guess I don't understand where all this is coming from. You're signing up for a social media site, in which you interact with other people socially. What is the point of using a pseudonym or remaining anonymous, when the whole point of the site is to interact with your friends and acquaintances? How are your friends supposed to find your profile if you are not you? Obviously I'm missing something because lots of people have a problem with this, but I just don't get it.

GAO: leaks at aging nuke sites difficult to detect->

Submitted
by mdsolar
on Tuesday June 21, 2011 @11:24PM
mdsolar writes "U.S. nuclear power plant operators haven't figured out how to quickly detect leaks of radioactive water from aging pipes that snake underneath the sites — and the leaks, often undetected for years, are not going to stop, according to a new report by congressional investigators.
The report by the Government Accountability Office was released by two congressmen Tuesday in response to an Associated Press investigation that shows three-quarters of America's 65 nuclear plant sites have leaked radioactive tritium, sometimes into groundwater.
Separately, two senators asked the GAO, the auditing and watchdog arm of Congress, to investigate the findings of the ongoing AP series Aging Nukes, which concludes that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the nuclear power industry have worked closely to keep old reactors operating within safety standards by weakening them, or not enforcing the rules."Link to Original Source

Videotaping Police From Front Yard Yields Arrest->

An anonymous reader writes "In another episode where police arrest innocent bystanders for simply videotaping them, it makes you wonder where our rights as citizens are? If we can't as citizens police the police themselves, then who is going to do just that? We know that often police defend each other and the accused don't have any place to turn for evidence when the police threaten bystanders that attempt to document arrests."Link to Original Source

If you search around you will find a number of groups working to oust LulzSec. http://lulzsecexposed.blogspot.com/ for one.. they have some "d0x" and a number of chat logs. Having read through the logs myself, there are a couple of people that "speak" for the LulzSec. Though they all seem to have access to the twitter, there are a couple of "main" guys.. and there is definitely 1 or 2 leader figures.

Bloomberg states that this action http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-06-19/skype-fires-executives-avoiding-payouts-after-microsoft-buyout.html"> reduces the value of their payouts. Perhaps people should consider this when working for a company that Silver Lake Partners has a controlling interest in. Vice Presidents David Gurle, Christopher Dean, Russ Shaw and Don Albert were dismissed from the Luxembourg-based company."Link to Original Source

cylonlover (1921924) writes "Using electrical probes embedded into the brains of rats, scientists have managed to replicate the brain function associated with long-term behavior and found a way to literally turn memories on and off with the flip of a switch. The scientists hope their research will eventually lead to a neural prosthesis to help people suffering Alzheimer's disease, the effects of stroke or other brain injury to recover long-term memory capability."Link to Original Source

Sony vs Playbackups.com->

Stevespy writes "Sony is suing @Playbackups.com in the High Court. They are claiming "breach of patent" on the Playstation3, but they are abusing the courts system in an attempt to stop the Independent Fault Reports that Playbackups.com writes on the manufacture defects on the PS3. Customers in the UK can have their faulty PS3 consoles exchanged, free of charge, under the Sale of Goods Act 1979. Sony deny the problems and are acting aggressively against any company publicising the issues."Link to Original Source

Amazon Tests a Home-Delivery Service for Groceries

destinyland (578448) writes "Amazon.com is quietly trying to resurrect the failed business models of WebVan and HomeGrocer — two dotcoms which had offered home delivery of fresh groceries — with a new service called Amazon Fresh. Last week at a shareholder’s meeting, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos fielded questions about the current tests being conducted in Seattle. Bezos admitted Amazon is "tinkering" with the economics of it, adding that "we continue to think about that...We like the idea of it, but we have a high bar of what we expect in terms of the business economics for something like Amazon Fresh in terms of profitability and return on invested capital." No further details were forthcoming, but Bezos still acknowledged that "we continue to think about that.""

First Bitcoin Theft? $500,000 in BTC Stolen

qubezz (520511) writes "A Bitcoin user has lost 25,000 Bitcoins, the digital peer-to-peer currency that is all the rage in digital peer-to-peer currencies these days, which at current exchange rates is around $470,000. For doubters, here is the lo-fi (but still very slow) version of the discussion thread where user "allinvain" has posted the info about the transfers. Theories are still out there about how his wallet got hacked. Lesson: spread your savings, and perhaps transfer your earnings from pools to a super-locked-down non-pool account with an offline key. Quote from victim: Hi everyone. I am totally devastated today. I just woke up to see a very large chunk of my bitcoin balance gone to the following address:
1KPTdMb6p7H3YCwsyFqrEmKGmsHqe1Q3jg. Transaction date: 6/13/2011 12:52 (EST). I feel like killing myself now. This get me so f'ing pissed off. If only the wallet file was encrypted on the HD. I do feel like this is my fault somehow for now moving that money to a separate non windows computer. I backed up my wallet.dat file religiously and encrypted it but that does not do me much good when someone or some trojan or something has direct access to my computer somehow."

Idle Connection Tuning Makes Firefox 5 Faster->

An anonymous reader writes "JavaScript is pretty much a done deal at this time as far as browser performance is concerned. However, there is still plenty of room and especially Google and Mozilla are getting more creative in making their browsers faster. Firefox 5 has received a new algorithm that enables the browser to sort idle connections and allocate more bandwidth to certain content types as some idle connections are likely to be faster than others. It appears that load times of certain elements can be cut in half. Google will add a similar features and squeeze even more speed out of SPDY."Link to Original Source
