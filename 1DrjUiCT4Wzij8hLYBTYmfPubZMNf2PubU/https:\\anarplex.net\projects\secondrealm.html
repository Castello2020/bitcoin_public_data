Services
Anarplex.net offers a variety of services for crypto-tribes and phyles.
Due to current workload we do NOT accept new clients at the moment.
GammaDX
GammaDX is where currently eight darknets and three darknet providers interconnect to enable members of different tribes to directly communicate and cooperate.
What Internet Exchanges are for the public internet, GammaDX is for darknets. It is where most of the tribe's foreign policy takes place - making Anarplex responsible to keep the peace and implement the policies of our clients.
Furthermore Anarplex provides peering services and peer accounting between tribes as well as conflict resolution, network identity protection, subnet translation and mediation of peering negotiations.
DarkNets
Anarplex is specialized in operating darknets - private networks on the internet that are layered on top but hidden from the public internet.
Darknets are the premier tool for communication, business and social life of crypto-tribes, providing a protected space ruled by their own
jurisdiction and policies.
Anarplex serves both in consulting, development, deployment and maintenance of darknets - from ip-space management, routing, gateways, covers, peers and integrated infrastructure services.
Does your tribe look for a new home? Please do not hesitate to contact us.
Nodes & Shells
From simple unix-shells to webhosts, dedicated servers or custom multi-homed datacents - Anarplex provides
initial processing requirements for darknets and entrepreneurs that are active on multiple networks or just want to be less dependent
on single tribes. Furthermore we provide public-facing hosting and gateway services for tribe-related development, marketing, representation and
collaboration projects. From SVN- and Wiki-hosting to full-fledged encrypted webservers - please contact us for a custom offer
Communication
Need XMPP/Jabber, E-Mail or IRC services? We operate various systems both for tribe-internal as well as public
services.
OpenVPN, IPSec or SSH access to your existing darknet? No problem, shared or dedicated termination servers can be procured through
Anarplex, or we help you setting up your own infrastructure.

#Agora IRC Server
Since 2008 Anarplex.net operates an IRC Server for agorists, crypto-anarchists, cypherpunks, second realmers, crypto-tribalists, ...
It was inspired by some leftovers of the Invisible IRC Project community, and two former members funded the initial setup: eCache and Free & Unashamed. By now it has attracted an interesting group of people that hang out and conduct business there.
The server offers all the usual IRC services, like nickserv, chanserv, memoserv as well as the anarplex link bot (#anarbot) in the main channel #agora.
Connect to the Server
The IRC Server is available through Clearnet, I2P, Tor and CHAVPN.
Please choose one of the darknet methods (that is, not clearnet) if you intend to use the server regularly.
