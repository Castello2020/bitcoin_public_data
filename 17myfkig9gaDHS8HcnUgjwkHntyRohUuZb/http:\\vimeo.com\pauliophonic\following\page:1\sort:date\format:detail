I make music videos, commercials, short films, Rob & Big, and hopefully a movie someday soon. I like to eat lots of food that's not good for me and I really don't like exercising. You can imagine how great this combo works!

I was born the day that many people died but also on a day when a few were resusitated. Which leads me here to write these words for you tonight. Don't call it a come-back, call it an everlasting love whose nature is defined by eventuality in an era of need.
So thats how I got into comedy. kschaal Brooklyn, New York

Oh hello. I'm Kristen Schaal. I grew up in Colorado. I wanted to be either a Price Is Right model, or an epidemiologist. "I resist videotape in a way, but I think it's a really great medium. I would like to do something for videotape, I suppose." -Charles Ludlam
