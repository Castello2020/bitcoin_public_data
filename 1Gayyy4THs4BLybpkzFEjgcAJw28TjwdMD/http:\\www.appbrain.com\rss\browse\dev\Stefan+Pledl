Instead of accelerating a massive metal cylinder like on a dyno, the scooter is being accelerated on the street while riding it. Put simply: get on your scooter and ride at full throttle. The quicker the acceleration of the scooter, the greater its performance.&lt;br&gt;So the software has to determine how fast the scooter is accelerating and this is done the easiest way by the digital signal processing of the engine noises. &lt;br&gt;Some of you will think now: &lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;I see, the louder, the higher the performance of the engine, now that&amp;rsquo;s more of the common gibberish!&amp;rdquo; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We all learned early through our mechanics career that this just ain&amp;rsquo;t so. Sound levels really are no indication for performance at all. The SIP HorsePower Dyno can measure the rpm of the engine not by analyzing the sound level, but by analyzing the exact frequency. The faster the rpm increases, the better the performance of the engine (all other conditions being identical). Luckily, the gear ratio of our Vintage scooters remains the same as long as there is no shift of gears. This way, the speed can be calculated from the rpm just as you can then calculate the performance by the change of speed which equals acceleration. To obtain the most realistic performance value possible, it is recommended to enter a couple of values as precisely as possible:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- overall weight&lt;br&gt;- tire circumference&lt;br&gt;- Cw-Value&lt;br&gt;- air pressure&lt;br&gt;- temperature&lt;br&gt;- gear ratio &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you know the Windows programs SIP Dyno and GSF Dyno, you know how exact these measurements are.&lt;br&gt;You can find a couple of comparisons between GSF Dyno, this App and a real dyno (P4) at my Google+ Page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Requirements:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- This App only works if you can shift the gears. So it works for scooters like Vespas or Lambrettas. The method doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with automatic scooters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- This App might not work for cars, which have a good acoustic insulation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- There have been good results with the GSF Dyno and cars or motorcycles. However i cannot test this, since I only drive a Vespa. I will update this if I get some good feedback from guys using this App with other vehicles, but until then I cannot promise any good result.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please be aware that this is a very technical App. I cut the important things down as much as i could and added a &amp;quot;?-Button&amp;quot; on every page inside the App. Please read the information carefully. If you have any problems, contact me and I will guide you through.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Supported by SIP Scootershop GmbH</description></item><item><title>Holo Metronome ( free &amp; easy )</title><link>http://www.appbrain.com/app/holo-metronome-%28-free-easy-%29/de.stefanpledl.holometronome</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.appbrain.com/app/holo-metronome-%28-free-easy-%29/de.stefanpledl.holometronome</guid><comments>http://www.appbrain.com/app/holo-metronome-%28-free-easy-%29/de.stefanpledl.holometronome#comments</comments><pubDate>Mon, 04 Feb 2013 16:31:12 +0000</pubDate><description>Holo Metronome for Android has everything a musician needs when it comes to a metronome.

Easy to set up and plainly audible in your headphones. Setlists for quick access. High quality samples built in, custom sounds can be loaded. Like it silent ?

I used [...another metronome app...] for the longest time in a live setting and it was pretty miserable at times because it doesn't have the focus this app has. I can't thank you enough!&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;by Cobus Alberts:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Don't bother looking anywhere else. This app is by far 1 of the best apps I've ever seen in my life. I've been shopping around for a month now and was just looking at paid apps thinking that those would have to be better. I actually stumbled across this app by accident. You have really put something amazing together here and to make it free... thank you so much&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Google+: http://tinyurl.com/a9tv3c9&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter: https://twitter.com/dakdroid&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Feel like donating?&lt;br&gt;Send a Bitcoin or two :-)&lt;br&gt;1Gayyy4THs4BLybpkzFEjgcAJw28TjwdMD&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Permissions: &lt;br&gt;Wake Lock: to keep the metronome running&lt;br&gt;Vibrate: for vibration...&lt;br&gt;Camera: for the flashlight beat&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Use Audacity to convert your samples from every format to Mono WAV 16-bit PCM.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beta updates from the Playstore!&lt;br&gt;Join this group:&lt;br&gt;https://plus.google.com/communities/113568410006610080217&lt;br&gt;Opt-in here:&lt;br&gt;https://play.google.com/apps/testing/de.stefanpledl.drummersmetronome&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Halloween pumpkin picture:&lt;br&gt;http://www.deviantart.com/art/31DOH-19-Pumpkin-Grin-141346759&lt;br&gt;with license:&lt;br&gt;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recent changes:&lt;br&gt;1.9.02: &lt;br&gt;- fix database export&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.9.0: &lt;br&gt;- bug fixes &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.8.18: &lt;br&gt;- bug fixes &lt;br&gt;- layout fixes for Android 4.4 KitKat</description></item><item><title>MicroDyno -SIP HorsePower Dyno</title><link>http://www.appbrain.com/app/microdyno-sip-horsepower-dyno/com.pledlstefan.siphorsepowerdyno</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.appbrain.com/app/microdyno-sip-horsepower-dyno/com.pledlstefan.siphorsepowerdyno</guid><comments>http://www.appbrain.com/app/microdyno-sip-horsepower-dyno/com.pledlstefan.siphorsepowerdyno#comments</comments><pubDate>Tue, 02 Oct 2012 21:26:37 +0000</pubDate><description>&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Tested and well reviewed in Scootering Januar 2013 by Sticky, author of the Complete Spanners Lambretta manual&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;Sticky: &amp;quot;The fact that it works at all - let alone working this well - is just plain wizardry&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SIP HorsePower Dyno(MicroDyno) for Android -unlike all other Dyno Apps out there- doesn't use the acceleration or GPS sensor, because both aren't exact enough to achieve a good measuring result.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SIP HorsePower Dyno(MicroDyno) can measure the rpm of the engine by analyzing the exact frequency, recorded with the microphone (Screenshot 1: in the middle you can clearly see accelerating in 1st, 2nd and 3rd gear).&lt;br&gt;The faster the rpm increases, the better the performance of the engine. The gear ratio of our rides remains the same as long as there is no shift of gears. This way, the speed can be calculated from the rpm just as you can then calculate the performance by the change of speed which equals acceleration. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To obtain the most realistic performance value possible, you need to enter a couple of values as precisely as possible:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- overall weight&lt;br&gt;- tire circumference&lt;br&gt;- air pressure&lt;br&gt;- temperature&lt;br&gt;- gear ratio &lt;br&gt;- Cw-Value (Tough one, but if you don't change this for different runs, you get repeatable and combarable results, this value moves the resulting curve on the y-axis, so it can be used to calibrate the dyno. If this value is way off the result can be off about 2 PS)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you know the Windows programs SIP Dyno and GSF Dyno, you know how exact these measurements are.&lt;br&gt;You can find a couple of comparisons between GSF Dyno, this App and a real dyno (P4) at www.siphorsepowerdyno.de and in the Scootering from January 2013.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Requirements:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- This App only works if there is no shift in gears. The method doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with automatic scooters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- This App might not work for cars. It was tested on Vespas and Lambrettas which have a 1 cylinder 2 stroke engine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please be aware that this is a very technical App. I cut the important things down as much as i could and added a &amp;quot;?-Button&amp;quot; on every page inside the App. Please read the information carefully. &lt;br&gt;Check out www.siphorsepowerdyno.de or my YouTube-Channel for a tutorial.&lt;br&gt;If you have any problems, contact me and I will guide you through.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Important: There is a software failure in some Samsung Galaxy Ace and Samsung Galaxy Young devices. &lt;br&gt;I included a fix for this, in Settings-&amp;gt; scroll to bottom -&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Samsung Fix&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Supported by SIP Scootershop GmbH&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recent changes:&lt;br&gt;Christmas sale: 0.99 &amp;euro;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.059: RangeSeekBar added, Weather fixed&lt;br&gt;2.057: Bugtracking update, see Update Info in the app&lt;br&gt;2.056:&lt;br&gt;★ Renamed app to MicroDyno&lt;br&gt;★ clearer, more structured Settings&lt;br&gt;★ Option to hide the back button&lt;br&gt;★ Option for multiple runs without editing &lt;br&gt;★ &amp;quot;Trim Screen&amp;quot;: the whole record is displayed as a spectrum, when moving the bars to cut the record the part of the spectrum, which will be further processed is shown</description></item><lastBuildDate>Tue, 06 May 2014 03:38:07 +0000</lastBuildDate><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2014 03:38:07 +0000</pubDate></channel></rss>
