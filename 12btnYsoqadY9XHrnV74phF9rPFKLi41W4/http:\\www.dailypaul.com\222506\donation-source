votes Bitcoin Donation outlet	Submitted by Aphelion27 on Thu, 03/22/2012 - 22:27in Economy
I would like to provide an outlet for anyone holding bitcoins and at the same time generate a donation to Dr. Paul.
What would be the interest in me buying any bitcoins for $4.80 FRN's and donating the FRN's to Ron's Campaign instead of sending them to the Bitcoin seller.
I would post the donation record to the forum along with the Bitcoin address they came from...
Any interest?
Bitoin Address for this would be

kaf
ps.. I already have 700 mhps generating BTC's to convert to FRN's and donate.
