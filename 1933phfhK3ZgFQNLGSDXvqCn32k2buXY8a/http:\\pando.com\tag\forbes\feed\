				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-139534" src="http://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/google-glass-what-a-bargain.jpg?w=900&#038;h=675" alt="google-glass-what-a-bargain" width="900" height="675" /></p>
<p>It looks like Teardown.com has touched a nerve with Google. The tech site dedicated to taking apart fancy technology hardware to calculate its true built cost <a href="http://www.techinsights.com/teardown.com/google-glass/#">deconstructed Google Glass</a>, which is currently priced at $1,500, came up with a component value of just $80. A Google spokesperson <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/04/30/google-glass-parts-estimated-to-cost-less-than-80/?mod=rss_Technology">snapped to the Wall Street Journal</a> that the estimate is “absolutely wrong.”</p>
<p>Teardown priced Glass&#8217; 16GB NAND Toshiba flash memory at $8.18. Its breakdown looks like a fairly routine and nerdy shopping list: processor, $13.96; camera, $5.66; battery, $1.14; and so on. If true, the early Glass sales went out at an 1,875 percent markup. Good business, huh? Apple eat your heart out at those hardware margins.</p>
<p>Admittedly, as Google asserts, this new breakdown might be wrong. But probably not that wrong. Last August, the Topology Research Institute <a href="http://www.chinapost.com.tw/business/company-focus/2013/08/08/385842/Google-Glass.htm">priced out the Google Glass’ display component</a> at $30-$35, which Teardown priced at $3. Topology said that the display was easily the most expensive part of Glass. A deconstruction of Glass <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/computing/158297-google-glass-teardown-futuristic-on-the-outside-thoroughly-underwhelming-on-the-inside">by Extreme Tech that June </a>concurred with this, stating that the tiny, millimeters wide 640&#215;360 display was easily the only exciting part of the futuristic device. It found that for how futuristic that Glass looks, much of what it is comprised of is mundane hardware.</p>
<p><a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/08/08/why-google-glass-costs-1500-now-and-will-likely-be-around-299-later/">GigaOM found</a> Glass to have many of the same parts as Motorola&#8217;s MotoActv smart watch which was released in 2012. Pricing those out and adding in $35 for the display and $40 for the speaker, its most generous estimate of Glass&#8217; cost wholesale was $225. GigaOM’s estimate is three times higher than Teardown’s (it’s method was a lot less scientific), but even if spot on it would equate to a very healthy gross profit margin for Google (roughly 85 percent)</p>
<p>It is not much of a leap in logic, nor much of a hot conspiracy, to suggest that Google priced Glass unnaturally high to tamp down on interest and make sure that the early adopters had a financial stake in supporting the project. Glass’ marketing chief Ed Sanders <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/04/16/where-not-to-wear-your-new-google-glass/">told Forbes as much</a> last month. “The high price point isn’t just about the cost of the device. We want people who are going to be passionate about it,” he said.</p>
<p>Setting a price that high is a textbook way to choke off demand. But Google’s self-selected Explorer program for Glass, followed up with its 24-hours only come-one-come-all sale kept this club exclusive enough anyway. There are other ways to meter access with out pricing it like you would a new refrigerator.</p>
<p>Given the frustrations directed at Google Glass since its launch, that high price is starting to look less like practical economics and more like a messaging mistake, one more thing to help deepen the Glasshole mythology. Google wants us to think that the resistance to Glass has been about standard for any new technology, but the legal, moral, and privacy concerns have been very real. A <a href="http://pando.com/2014/02/18/google-tries-to-make-glass-less-creepy-with-a-warmly-worded-dos-and-donts-list/">ponderous dos and don’t lists</a> issued by Google for Glass hasn’t helped.</p>
<p>For some, Google Glass has become a symbol of tech industry ridiculousness. It is this decade’s version of the Segway. In San Francisco it has even gone past being seen as just a bit silly; in a city where the tech sector has become the whipping boy for annoyance at high rents, Google Glass has become a totem of class tension.</p>
<p>For any frustrated person, the price – that knowledge that Glass user X paid $1,500 for the privilege to look that ridiculous – has heightened this annoyance.</p>
<p>Yes, Glass has more problems than its price tag. But as it inches closer to commercial release, probably at a much more approachable retail price, it represents yet another piece of baggage Glass is saddled with upon (official) arrival.</p>
<p>Let’s just say, Glass has 99 other problems, but an artificially inflated price tag didn’t need to be one.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-132697" alt="wall_st" src="http://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/wall_st.jpg?w=900&#038;h=675" width="900" height="675" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Wall Street is a dangerous place for the average investor. Of course there&#8217;s the ever present prospect of losing your shirt through through bad bets, but there&#8217;s also the all too common reality of slowly bleeding oneself dry through excessive asset management and trading fees.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Three months ago, in December, <a href="http://sigfig.com">SigFig</a> addressed both of these problems with the launch of its <a href="http://pando.com/2013/12/10/sigfig-takes-on-investment-fees-with-automated-portfolio-management-just-10-per-month/">automated investment portfolio management platform</a>. The “set it and forget it” system costs just $10 per month regardless of the size of a client’s assets under management (AUM) and promises to reduce the typical client’s fees by as much as 80 percent. SigFig focuses on creating balanced portfolios constructed of low-cost exchange traded funds (ETFs )tailored to each individual’s personal risk tolerance. Just as important, it automatically rebalances each portfolio as neeeded, to adjust for changing market conditions, something typical advisors either don’t offer or charge through the roof to do.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The reaction among consumers to this new offering has been extremely positive, according to founder and CEO Mike Sha, who says that conversion rates have been 20-times what the company initially projected. (Sha declined to disclose the number of paying customers.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">One factor that likely contributes heavily to this success rate is the fact that it has taken the average user just five minutes to setup a managed account, according to the company. Users who are currently with TD Ameritrade, Schwab, Fidelity, or other do-it-yourself brokerages don’t even need to transfer their assets to a new firm, but can simply connect their existing account to SigFig and allow the company to manage the portfolio remotely.</p>
<p dir="ltr">SigFig has been building relationships with retail investors for years, primarily through its portfolio tracking tools distributed in partnership with premium publishers like Yahoo!, CNN, USA Today, and Forbes. As of December, when the asset management product launched, the company was tracking more than $100 billion in investment assets. That number has doubled in the last three months alone to $200 billion, in part as the company has added partnerships with AOL and Intuit (free asset management when doing your taxes) and in part on the buzz of the asset management platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Assuming the above tracked assets represent 4,000,000 users at $50,000 each (which is likely larger than the average investor’s portfolio), a hypothetical 10 percent conversion rate results in 400,000 users paying $10 per month, or $48 million in revenue per year. Double that if the average portfolio is $25,000.</p>
<p dir="ltr">SigFig has raised a total of <a href="http://pando.com/2013/07/02/sigfig-rakes-in-15m-to-continue-its-assault-on-the-financial-advisory-status-quo/">$17.5 million</a> across two rounds of funding – its backers include Union Square Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, and DCM – meaning it will need to at least add another zero to this revenue figure before its generating the kind of returns that its founders and investors covet. But the early market feedback appears nothing if not positive.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company is attracting a wide range of investors, Sha says, with portfolios under management now ranging from a few thousand to more than $1 million. This is significant because it confirms that SigFig appeals to successful, and presumably sophisticated investors, not just newbies who lack access to other asset management services. The average SigFig user is approximately 40 to 45 years old, Sha says, significantly younger than the typical traditional brokerage client.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That said, SigFig’s flat-fee business model means it’s less concerned with assets under management than it is with growing its number of paying customers. To that end, the company’s partnership-based customer acquisition model is a savvy move. Whereas typical asset managers spend heavily on sales and marketing to acquire new clients, SigFig has been able to outsource much of that cost-center. There are other technology companies looking to disrupt the financial services industry, but none with the cost structure or distribution advantages that SigFig has pulled together.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We&#8217;ve established ourselves as the biggest and best player in the partner space, so publishers turn to us first when the want portfolio tools,” Sha says</p>
<p dir="ltr">Couple this low cost of customer acquisition with removing the expense of flesh-and-blood asset managers and flashy physical office space and it’s little surprise that SigFig can dramatically undercut the industry’s standard fee of one percent of assets under management. Ten dollars per month may not seem like a lot, but when the incremental cost of adding and servicing new customers is close to zero, it begins to look a lot more attractive. And because of the transparency around pricing, it’s not unreasonable to suggest that clients will prefer the new model and, performance and other factors being equal, choose to stay around long term.</p>
<p dir="ltr">SigFig isn’t a get-rich-quick scheme and doesn’t promise its customer outsized performance. Rather, it’s focused on portfolio stability and on building a brand around simplicity, convenience, and price. In today’s environment as the average consumer grows more comfortable with technology and, in many cases, less trusting of Wall Street, it’s a message that appears to be ringing loud and clear.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“When we first started this there was a question as to whether people wanted or would accept technology-powered advisors,” Sha says. “The data is in and it shows beyond a doubt that they do. They’re voting with their wallets.”</p>

<p>Anonymous hackers have <a href="http://pastebin.com/8gbUXLN3">published</a> financial data to support the claim that Mt. Gox, the Bitcoin exchange that <a href="http://pando.com/2014/02/25/the-mt-gox-meltdown-and-what-it-means-for-bitcoin/">suspended operations</a> and <a href="http://pando.com/2014/02/28/mt-gox-files-for-bankruptcy-protection/">filed for bankruptcy protection</a> in February, still has in its possession more than 750,000 bitcoins previously reported as stolen.</p>
<p>The data, which includes a spreadsheet detailing millions of Mt. Gox&#8217;s financial transactions, was purportedly stolen from the exchange&#8217;s servers. It was first posted to Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles&#8217; blog and has been quickly mirrored by Bitcoin enthusiasts incensed by the scandal.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/03/09/hackers-hit-mt-gox-exchanges-ceo-claim-to-publish-evidence-of-fraud/">The data&#8217;s veracity has not been confirmed</a>. Someone(s) might have fabricated the evidence to support a popular theory; they might also have infiltrated the exchange&#8217;s servers to seek some justice for those affected by its lax security. Even if the data originated from Mt. Gox&#8217;s servers, it might be a demonstration of the company&#8217;s inability to manage its books instead of proof it plotted to steal money from users and investors. No one outside the company knows.</p>
<p>But it is clear that Mt. Gox&#8217;s users haven&#8217;t escaped their troubles just yet. Besides showing their transactions, the breach also shows that the exchange&#8217;s security still isn&#8217;t up to snuff. (Assuming the data posted is accurate, of course.) Another hacker&#8217;s claim that he is selling passport scans and other personal information describing the exchange&#8217;s users to make up for losses related to Mt. Gox&#8217;s recent woes is also cause for concern. The controversies continue.</p>
<p><strong>Reactions from around the Web</strong></p>
<p>Forbes <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/03/09/hackers-hit-mt-gox-exchanges-ceo-claim-to-publish-evidence-of-fraud/">describes</a> the data published by the hackers, which isn&#8217;t limited to financial transactions:</p>
<blockquote><p>It appears to include an Excel spreadsheet of over a million trades, a file that purports to show the company’s balances in eighteen difference currencies, the backoffice application for some sort of administrative access to the databases of Mt. Gox’s parent company Tibanne Limited, a screenshot of the hackers’ access to those databases, a list of Mark Karpeles’ home addresses and Karpeles’ personal CV.</p></blockquote>
<p>CoinDesk <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/mt-gox-hackers-claim-release-transaction-details-ceos-personal-data/">reports</a> that some of the files in the hackers&#8217; data might compromise their security and allow the hackers to steal their personal information:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is good reason to believe that, while the data files may be genuine Mt. Gox data, .exe and Mac .app files within the dump are bitcoin wallet-stealing trojans. If you have somehow found a link to the files mentioned here, as we warned below, DO NOT OPEN THEM. If for some reason you have, transfer your bitcoins to another wallet immediately.</p></blockquote>
<p>ZDNet <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/hackers-allege-mt-gox-ceo-still-controls-stolen-bitcoin-7000027137/">notes</a> that the information could be inaccurate &#8212; and notes that the stolen bitcoins have yet to appear on the public ledger meant to prevent fraud with the crypto-currency:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is worth noting that this leak could show nothing more than poor accountancy practices &#8212; one aspect of the company which has been reported as a crucial factor which led to the original cyberattacks going unnoticed for so long &#8212; and the database may only show Bitcoins that were believed to be safe but were already gone. However, since Mt. Gox has filed for bankruptcy protection, the public ledger of Bitcoin transactions &#8212; the Bitcoin blockchain &#8212; has not registered the movement of &#8220;stolen&#8221; coins.</p></blockquote>
<p>The BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-26387800">points out</a> that getting screwed over by Mt. Gox&#8217;s issues was so common that its users had a name for it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;It&#8217;s time that Mt. Gox got the Bitcoin community&#8217;s wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin community getting Goxed,&#8217; wrote the hackers in a message accompanying the data dump. The word &#8216;Goxed&#8217; has been used to describe the sudden interruptions in trading Mt. Gox imposed when it was going through technical problems before its final closure.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Pando weighs in</strong></p>
<p>Pando&#8217;s Tim Worstall <a href="http://pando.com/2014/02/25/with-mt-gox-surfing-the-u-bend-whither-bitcoin/">wrote</a> about Mt. Gox&#8217;s effect on Bitcoin shortly after it suspended operations in February:</p>
<blockquote><p>The <a href="http://pando.com/2014/02/25/the-mt-gox-meltdown-and-what-it-means-for-bitcoin/">overnight news</a> that Mt. Gox has gone down is naturally leading to swathes of speculation about what this means for Bitcoin. So, despite my having been consistently wrong about the currency since 2011 (when I first confidently announced its <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2011/10/18/the-end-of-bitcoin-part-ii/" target="_blank">final end</a>), here’s my addition to it all.</p>
<p>The end result is going to depend upon whether Bitcoin is actually doing anything useful or not.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then, shortly after, he <a href="http://pando.com/2014/02/26/i-think-its-reasonable-to-declare-mt-gox-truly-dead-and-buried/">wrote</a> that Mt. Gox is beyond redemption:</p>
<blockquote><p>Which leaves us with just one last point. There’s also a $350 million hole of missing Bitcoins. We might, if we thought we could make more than that by running the exchange, try to figure out a way to cover that hole. An “investment” if you wish. But that hole is a decade’s worth of the highly speculative profits that are predicted to arrive two years out: that’s not a deal that is going to have prospective resuscitators of the site rubbing their hands with glee.</p>
<p>I admit that I’ve been wrong before about Bitcoin but at this point I think it’s about time to purchase the wreath for Mt.Gox and wave it a tearful farewell.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pando&#8217;s Michael Carney <a href="http://pando.com/2014/02/27/why-bitcoins-trust-issues-are-about-more-than-mt-gox/">wrote</a> in February that Bitcoin&#8217;s problems are about trust, not about Mt. Gox specifically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">The bitcoin protocol <a href="http://nonchalantrepreneur.com/post/70130104170/bitcoin-and-the-byzantine-generals-problem" target="_blank">solves a real problem</a> by allowing digital transactions to be completed outside of the costly and cumbersome existing financial infrastructure, but for the value of this solution to be realized, people have to use it. Bitcoin may have emerged as an anti-establishment financial instrument, but for it to survive and more importantly fulfill its lofty potential, it will need to shed much of its early ideology. Trust is key, and trust does not grow in the shadows.</p>
<p>Mt. Gox’s unraveling doesn’t need to be the end of bitcoin, but it needs to be the end of its innocence.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-125959" alt="Matt Shaw AirPush" src="http://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/matt-shaw-airpush.jpg?w=900&#038;h=643" width="900" height="643" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">The word is getting out about <a href="http://www.airpush.com/">AirPush</a>. A year ago, the bootstrapped profitable Los Angeles mobile ad network was flying under everyone’s radar. Then, last summer, it crossed 100,000 apps in its network (a number that’s now north of 120,000) and announced it was profitable at more than <a href="http://pando.com/2013/07/01/how-airpush-bootstrapped-its-mobile-ad-network-to-150m-in-revenue/">$150 million in revenue</a>. The industry, rightly, sat up and took notice. A <a href="http://www.airpush.com/airpush-ranks-1-on-the-2013-tech-200-list/">No. 1 Ranking</a> on the 2013 Tech 200 list followed and this year AirPush been recognized as <a href="http://www.airpush.com/airpush-awarded-no-2-spot-on-forbes-list-of-americas-most-promising-companies-of-2014/">No. 2</a> on Forbes’ Most Promising Companies of 2014 list. The secret’s out.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Today, AirPush is announcing the first fruits of that notoriety. The company has hired former Google Global Head of Mobile Display Matt Shaw as its first Chief Revenue Officer (CRO). It’s a major coup. Count Shaw, one of the search giant’s senior most mobile advertising execs, as another one of those industry insiders who had no idea AirPush was generating the scale and profitability it has. He knows now, and judging by the new logo on his business card, he’s made up his mind about the company’s future prospects.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’ve had the mobile bug for a while, going all the way back to AdMob,” Shaw says. “I wasn’t searching for a job, but was interested in things that were happening in the space and I was surprised when I first found out the scale of the first-party, opt-in data layer they&#8217;ve built. I&#8217;m interested in figuring out how to activate that to make performance advertising better and smarter.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Adding a CRO is all about the stage of our business,” says AirPush VP Marketing Cameron Peebles. “We have the data, we have the scale, and we have the engineering team. Now we’re ready to address the higher-level strategic questions. We wanted to wait until we could add the right person, someone from a premier team.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In October 2013, AirPush made its first <a href="http://www.airpush.com/airpush-acquires-hubbl-a-leader-in-mobile-native-advertising/">acquisition</a> with the goal of better utilizing its mountains of data. The new asset, a personalized app discovery platform called Hubbl, adds targeting intelligence to the company&#8217;s existing data layer. Hubbl is known for its app hashtagging technology, which enabled contextual app discovery by use case, rather than simply by keyword and rating.</p>
<p dir="ltr">AirPush founder and CEO Asher Delug said of the acquisition at the time, “Facebook and Twitter have created a lot of hype around native advertising on mobile, but the reality is that the technology hasn’t been accessible for mainstream app developers.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">AirPush is already generating nine-figure revenues and is still growing rapidly. The addition of Shaw combined with that existing revenue machine should make turning Hubbl’s technology into serious cashflow all but an inevitability. AirPush has an opt-in database of information on more than 150 million Android users, including details like carrier, device type, and the apps installed on their device, among other detail. That intel is like catnip for mobile advertisers looking to better target their marketing efforts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The first challenge for the new CRO will be to extend AirPush’s platform and its narrative to serve brand advertisers, in addition to its existing performance advertising crowd.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Because the company grew up as a performance company, some of the internal tools are too geared toward that side of the business,” Shaw says. “I’m already working with our team in India to tweak this, for example to talk more about uniques and impressions and things that brand advertisers care about.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Both AirPush and Hubbl scaled through the use of Indian engineering and development teams. A full two-thirds of AirPush’s 160 pre-acquisition employees were located in Bangalore, as was the entirety of Hubble’s 25 person engineering team. Delug explained the strategy last year, saying, 100 employees in India costs AirPush the equivalent of 35 to 40 employees of comparable skill in the US. The decision had tradeoffs, Delug admits, but it allowed the company to scale rapidly and the challenges of remote recruiting and culture building have dissipated as the company has grow in in size and prominence.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Our anonymity in the early years of building the company was largely a function of not raising outside capital,” Peebles says. “We’re fully bootstrapped, but performance advertisers and international brands, the groups we care most about, have always known about us.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shaw adds, “I’m now having the exact opposite problem. Everywhere I go and everyone I talk to, people want to join this team.” AirPush has had almost zero employee attrition in either the US or India, Peebles adds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">AirPush is no longer an unknown, fledgeling company. When you start poaching senior talent from Google and raking in awards, you put a target on your back. That will likely mean both increased competition and inbound interest from VCs and strategic acquirers. The challenge will be to balance these distractions with the need to maintain the things that got the company to this point.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Delug isn’t shy about predicting an IPO as the likely outcome for the company which he still owns 90 percent of (employees own the rest), and has even called a 2014 listing probable. The addition of a veteran CRO fits that narrative, as the company would be wise to add both public company experience within its senior ranks and additional muscle to its growth engine. Shaw checks off both boxes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The AirPush team has already proven the ability to keep their heads down and run fast. Now we’ll get to see what they can do under the glare of spotlights.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><img class=" wp-image-119581 aligncenter" alt="ourboros_inside" src="http://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/ourboros_inside.png?w=415&#038;h=403" width="415" height="403" /></p>
<p>A curious &#8220;interview request&#8221; arrived in my inbox today: A Forbes contributor would like to include my opinions in his post about equity crowdfunding. I was flattered for a minute, but then I realized what was really happening here: An executive who has been given a journalist&#8217;s platform is now asking &#8212; through a publicist &#8212; for a journalist to do his work.</p>
<p>I love the irony. Forbes has outsourced the production of content to non-journalists, who are now turning to actual journalists for content. And the topic? <em>Crowdfunding</em>. It&#8217;s a snake eating its own tail.</p>
<p>Apparently I was chosen to do someone else&#8217;s work for them because a company called OurCrowd is publishing a study in which I&#8217;m included as one of the &#8220;Top 25 influential people in crowdfunding.&#8221; That sounds dubious enough &#8212; I can think of maybe 100 people who are more influential around this topic than someone who has written a <a href="http://pando.com/tag/crowdfunding/">handful</a> of articles about it.</p>
<p>But anyway, since I am already in the study, the publicist writes, why not provide a few insights about crowdfunding? Insights like: what are my predictions for equity crowdfunding next year? And what tips would I offer investors interested in crowdfunding? You know, the kinds of questions I might ask actual experts if I were reporting a story on the topic. Oh, and once I&#8217;m done writing a chunk of the article, could I please help spread the word about it?</p>
<p>This is what&#8217;s become of Forbes. By lending its brand to anyone who can string a few sentences together, Forbes&#8217; contributor network is now little more than a platform for promotional marketing posts and unverified pontifications. (Some of which have paid to be there, via a product called BrandVoice.) It&#8217;s never clear when you click on a Forbes link whether you&#8217;re going to find useful, reliable information, or some random contributor&#8217;s self-promotional musings. Given that Forbes now has <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/lewisdvorkin/2013/08/26/inside-forbes-digital-audiences-crave-the-power-and-purpose-of-magazine-storytelling/">1200 contributors</a>, the odds of clicking on a story by one of the 45 or so staff writers Forbes employs is fairly low.</p>
<p>Forbes introduced its contributor platform in 2010 and has been heralded as a win by almost everyone, except actual Forbes readers.</p>
<p>Contributors get to promote themselves and build a following on the back of the credible Forbes name. In the process, the company <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/lewisdvorkin/2013/12/16/inside-forbes-how-we-played-moneyball-in-2013-10-line-drives-and-10-we-fouled-off/">cracked 28 million uniques</a> in October, a 28 percent increase from the beginning of the year that puts it ahead of WSJ, BusinessWeek, CNNMoney and Bloomberg, according to comScore. Digital revenue at Forbes is expected to rise by 25 percent this year; the company&#8217;s executives are confident enough in the business that they have <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/11/15/forbes-media-for-sale/3579419/">hired</a> a bank to sell it for a reported $400 million.</p>
<p>The contributor network has worked so well that even the New York Times is <a href="http://adage.com/article/media/york-times-native-ad-strategy-takes-shape/245242/">copying the model</a>, despite executive editor Jill Abramson&#8217;s <a href="http://pando.com/2013/05/07/do-not-expect-the-new-york-times-to-go-native/">past comments</a> disparaging native advertising that blurs the line between editorial and sponsored content. The Times has hired away Forbes&#8217; head of BrandVoice, Kopit Levien, to lead the effort. The Washington Post is getting in on the action, too. Last month, Kevin Gentzel, the CRO of the Post, said native ads are &#8220;<a href="http://pando.com/2013/11/13/native-advertising-is-trolling-us-all/">a spiritual journey</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Readers aren&#8217;t confused by the self-promotion masquerading as journalism, proponents argue, because, on Forbes, the author bios of non-journalists are labeled &#8220;contributor.&#8221; This is a lame argument, though. The term &#8220;contributor&#8221; often refers to writers commissioned by a publication. Beyond that, contributors can write whatever bios they want, and many of them have a bio that mimics a journalist&#8217;s.</p>
<p>For example, the bio of the author of the crowdfunding piece (who I&#8217;m not going to name here, because it&#8217;s almost Christmas) simply says &#8220;I write about social, mobile and marketing trends.&#8221; If you look over on the side of the page, the fine print explains that he is the CEO of an &#8220;Influencer Marketing Network&#8221; which is scheduled to launch in nine days. After reading that, I understand the author&#8217;s biases. And, no, I&#8217;m not confused. But I am annoyed.</p>
<p>Of course, I can&#8217;t poke fun at the Forbes contributor network without noting that PandoDaily, in common with most of our competitors, also runs guest posts from industry executives. The difference (apart from the fact that only a very small percentage of our daily output comes from guest contributors) is that guest posts are edited in-house before publication. We also correct errors when we find them, and have even retracted guest posts that we&#8217;ve later learned to be inaccurate or unfair. That&#8217;s the difference between a publication and a platform: When something goes awry with a guest post, <a href="http://pando.com/2013/05/13/social-media-may-finally-be-dying-but-the-bs-around-it-hasnt/">and it has</a>, we take responsibility for it, because we are a publication. A platform which allows anything to be published with no oversight, <a href="http://pando.com/2013/08/28/buzzfeed-has-a-medium-problem/">such as Buzzfeed</a>, <a href="http://pando.com/2013/12/04/medium-gets-even-magazine-ier/">Medium</a>, and yes, Forbes, can <a href="http://pando.com/2013/08/02/medium-isnt-the-message-be-careful-about-how-you-read-whats-published-on-platforms/">push responsibility to the poster</a> when there is an issue. <em>Not our problem. We&#8217;re a platform!</em></p>
<p>The platform-publisher problem is a sticky one which content companies will continue to grapple with, particularly as more publications turn to native advertising and sponsored content to replace dwindling revenue.</p>
<p>In the meantime, according to Forbes Chief Product Officer Lewis DVorkin, the architect of the platform, journalists who cry foul should &#8220;<a href="http://pando.com/2013/04/18/why-are-journalists-hostile-to-forbes-lewis-dvorkin-he-wants-them-to-get-real/">get over it</a>.&#8221; The traditional business models supporting journalism aren&#8217;t working, so &#8220;if you want to keep digging the same hole and not finding any oil, go for it,&#8221; he said at a PandoMonthly earlier this year. &#8220;What we’re trying to do is build a sustainable model.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-112401" alt="baby using ipad" src="http://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/baby-using-ipad.jpg?w=800&#038;h=582" width="800" height="582" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Mobile video advertising is growing at a rapid clip among both global brands and small businesses. But the mobile ad workflow is still inefficient and time consuming, and as a result undercuts many of the advantages that video ads can offer. Put simply, regardless of your budget or available resources, it’s still unnecessarily difficult to navigate the fragmented the multi-platform, multi-device landscape and effectively reach targeted audiences with mobile video.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mobile ad network startup <a href="http://www.mobilefuse.com/">MobileFuse</a> today announced a family of new products aimed at addressing this situation. The first, Vision, is a mobile video ad platform with an open architecture that allows advertisers to skip most of the laborious steps otherwise required to create, deploy, and manage video ads on mobile.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A key component of the newly-announced Vision platform is ViewCelerator. The custom software layer allows creators to wrap their videos in Javascript and thereby transcode a single video add into multiple output formats, regardless of their initial format or file type. These multi-format ads can then be delivered at the optimal size and speed for the device on which they are being viewed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, one advertiser may begin with an MP4 or .MOV format video created for a desktop Web add. Through vision, this same file can be repurposed and seamlessly served as a “click-to-view video” within an iOS app, as an “in-banner video” on a mobile optimized website, and then as a “pre-roll” or “interstitial video” within a Android video app.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unlike traditional ad networks, which typically only allow ads to run on publisher sites with which they are already integrated, Vision allows advertisers to consolidate reporting from all ad impressions, wherever they occur (including outside its platform). Vision delivers quartile tracking, completion tracking, and post-click engagements data.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’ve always been about solving real problems,” says MobileFuse co-founder and CEO Ken Harlan. “This includes the lack of transparency around where ads are running, the inability to quickly and easily create ad units that run where the viewers are spending time, and creating an open platform that allows clients to incorporate existing vendors into their workflow.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are a number of recent studies that support an increased focus on mobile video advertising. <a href="http://bytemobile">Video already accounts for more than half of all mobile Web traffic</a>, according to data from Bytemobile. Moreover, mobile video ad spending, which <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/booming-mobile-video-ecosystem-2013-77">at $520 million will account for 13 percent of digital video ad spending</a> this year, is growing 100 percent annually, according to eMarketer. Most compelling, however, Nielsen reports that mobile video ads are nearly <a href="http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/-1725100.htm">four times more effective in driving purchase intent</a> than traditional television ads and are two-and-a-half times more effective than online video ads.</p>
<p dir="ltr">MobileFuse is not your average startup. With four years of operations under its belt and 40 employees, the company already has more than 500 publishers on its platform. This means that Vision’s advertising clients can reach more than 95 percent of all US mobile devices. The company’s publishing partners include a fairly diverse group of household names like Forbes, MTV, Elle, Fox News, E!, BET, Bravo, and Univision, among others. The company has technology offices in New York City and Boston, with sales teams in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Denver, and Chicago.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over the last year, MobileFuse has seen video add adoption rise from 15 percent of all campaigns last year to more than 33 percent year to date. More than 50 percent of all RFPs (requests for proposal) being submitted today include a video component, according to VP Casey Jones.</p>
<p dir="ltr">MobileFuse is not the only company looking to solve for the ad creation and distribution problem. Companies like <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/10/21/paperg-brushes-off-competition-from-google-continues-to-grow-profitably/">PaperG</a> are taking a similar tact with display advertising, while <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/06/14/zefrs-brandid-makes-youtube-a-smarter-bet-for-brands-than-tv/">ZEFR</a>  is powering brand advertising on YouTube. Even <a href="http://adwords.blogspot.com/2013/09/create-beautiful-engaging-display-ads.html">Google</a> recently entered the automated ad content creation category with its Ready Image Ads (display ads) and Ready Ad Gallery (multi-media ads) products. But MobileFuse is the only company I’ve run across that is creating workflow solutions for the rapidly growing mobile video ad segment. Given the category growth, however, it’s unlikely to remain the only company in the space, if it in fact is today.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Vision and ViewCelerator were created as tools for internal use by MobileFuse’s managed services division, an agency-like team that helps advertisers execute campaigns across the company’s platform. But following several months of internal use and ongoing feedback from external clients and partners, the company decided to commercialize the product and offer it for free to any company advertising within its network. Users simply pay the company for ad-placement. The company focuses on premium inventory and uses exclusively CPM (cost per impression)-based pricing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It sounds deceptively simple, but that’s absolutely by design,” Harlan says. “We think we can democratize mobile video advertising.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-112105" alt="Bitcoin" src="http://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/bitcoin.jpg?w=720&#038;h=449" width="720" height="449" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">On the heels of an unprecedented run-up that saw the price of <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/10/22/bitcions-wild-ride-baidu-and-congressional-shenanigans-send-the-crypto-currency-through-the-roof/">bitcoin spike by 50 percent over a 10 day period</a>, the crytptocurrency is taking it on the chin a bit today.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The downward movement comes thanks to news, first reported by Forbes, that, as of this morning, the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/10/25/fbi-says-its-seized-20-million-in-bitcoins-from-ross-ulbricht-alleged-owner-of-silk-road/">FBI has located and seized an additional 144,000 bitcoins</a> – valued at approximately $28.5 million at the time – believed to belong to jailed Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s already the biggest seizure in bitcoin history and yet, there is another account containing <a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1933phfhK3ZgFQNLGSDXvqCn32k2buXY8a">an additional 111,000 bitcoins</a> that have yet to be seized but are believed to belong to Ulbricht. One explanation given for this is that the FBI may not possess the private key required to gain access to the wallet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As of 2:45pm PST today, the trading price at Mt. Gox was <a href="https://www.mtgox.com/">$190.03</a>, up from an intraday low of $176.60, but still down nearly 10 percent from the $209.00 value at which it started the day.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Prior to today, bitcoin largely seemed to have survived the FBI action against Silk Road road unscathed. The price dropped briefly, following the October 2 news announcement, but has since rebounded and seen the aforementioned price appreciation. At the time, the FBI had seized approximately 32,000 bitcoins worth $3.5 to $4 million at the time and $6 million at today’s prices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The question bitcoin bulls will need to ask themselves then is whether the market will see the same temporary correction this time around or whether this is a sign of more pain to come.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are a few differences between the earlier seizure and today’s. First, the number of bitcoins in question is greater by a factor of 4.5. Ulbricht’s bitcoin holdings are likely among the largest in the world. The total number of bitcoins in circulation today is approximately <a href="http://bitcoincharts.com/bitcoin/">11.9 million</a>, which at current market value represents approximately $2.26 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The 176,000 bitcoinS seized from Ulbricht over the last month represent approximately 1.5 percent of this total circulation. Add in the additional 111,000 bitcoins, and that number jumps to 2.4 percent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Silk Road allegedly generated commission revenue of approximately 600,000 bitcoin over its lifetime on 9.5 million bitcoin worth of sales, but reinvested much of that sum back into the business. There may, however, be additional undiscovered holdings belonging to Ulbricht, that if found would increase the FBI’s holdings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Any time large holdings in a single currency or commodity change hands, it can create instability, particularly when law enforcement is involved. The FBI has said previously that it plans to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/10/04/fbi-silk-road-bitcoin-seizure/">plans to exchange the seized bitcoins for dollars</a>, assuming Ulbricht is convicted at trial or settles. Doing so, if not done thoughtfully and patiently, could flood the bitcoin market and send the price of the currency plummeting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A Reddit thread has been created which <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1nq5z1/now_the_seized_bitcoin_address_is_being_sent/">identifies the FBI bitcoin wallet</a>, and many users are using micro-transactions to send (mostly humorous) <a href="http://blockchain.info/address/1F1tAaz5x1HUXrCNLbtMDqcw6o5GNn4xqX?offset=0&amp;filter=0">public messages</a> to the account.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin has shown surprising resiliency, regaining much of the value lost following the <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/08/23/newly-published-warrants-answer-some-questions-on-the-mt-gox-saga-raise-others/">Department of Homeland Security’s seizure of Dwolla and Bank of America accounts</a> belonging to the world’s top exchange, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, and subsequently propping itself up in the face of the ongoing Silk Road fallout.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are plenty of arguments to make for why bitcoin is a viable alternative currency, including <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/07/12/bitcoins-greatest-value-is-in-the-worlds-least-stable-economies/">freedom from governmental manipulation</a> and inflation protection. But it will need to survive regular interference from law enforcement, and the resulting near-term uncertainty if it is to make it that far.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It would seem that we remain closer to the beginning than to the end of this saga.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-105848" style="border:1px solid black;" alt="Screen Shot 2013-09-16 at 9.12.06 PM" src="http://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/screen-shot-2013-09-16-at-9-12-06-pm.png?w=584&#038;h=459" width="584" height="459" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Former Facebook managing editor Daniel Fletcher and the two founders behind the <a href="http://www.backspac.es/">Backspaces</a> storytelling app have launched the beta version of a platform that aims to help independent journalists get paid for their work. Called <a href="http://www.beaconreader.com/">Beacon</a>, the new platform lets readers follow their favorite writers, and others who publish on the service, for a monthly fee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fletcher and cofounders Adrian Sanders and Dmitri Cherniak want Beacon to foster relationships between readers and writers on a one-to-one basis. Writers can promote their work via Beacon and encourage their followers to subscribe to the journalism available on the platform for $5 a month. (During the beta period, readers get a free 14-day trial period.) Most of the revenue – between 60 percent and 75 percent; the founders say the exact figure will be determined over time – goes directly to the writers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fletcher, who’s in charge of Beacon’s editorial operations, says the platform serves as an outlet for reporters to tell more stories, and also provides a new way of funding it. It launches today in beta with 29 writers on board, most of whom have had bylines in major publications, including Time magazine, the New York Times, the Times of London, and Vice. Some of the more recognizable names include <a href="https://twitter.com/ionacraig">Iona Craig</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/joshuafoust">Joshua Foust</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/t_mcconnell">Tristan McConnell</a>. The roster has a bias towards freelance international correspondents.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Beacon’s founders see the platform as a venue for hosting the sorts of stories that are important but aren’t a perfect fit for traditional outlets that demand specific criteria and news pegs before agreeing to pay for certain content. For instance, Fletcher has enlisted the services of an Afghanistan-based reporter whose stories tend to make the mainstream press only when bombs go off. Beacon, which is in the process of fundraising, will be a place to host other Afghanistan-related stories that would be of interest to anyone who wants more than just war stories. Similarly, if you’re interested in reading stories about women in Vietnam, you can follow <a href="http://www.theinvestigativefund.org/reporters/jeanfriedmanrudovsky/">Jean Friedman-Rudovsky</a>. If you’re more concerned about stories from the frontlines of international conflicts, then you can pay to support <a href="https://twitter.com/CarmenGentile">Carmen Gentile</a>’s work.</p>
<div id="attachment_105847" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class=" wp-image-105847 " style="border:1px solid black;" alt="Screen Shot 2013-09-16 at 9.11.25 PM" src="http://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/screen-shot-2013-09-16-at-9-11-25-pm.png?w=584&#038;h=429" width="584" height="429" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Beacon&#8217;s news feed.</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">In the mode of modern media startups, Beacon’s design is clean, crisp, and blessed with generous helpings of white space. The story view, which is typically laid out with a large picture at the top of the page, looks a lot like <a href="http://www.medium.com">Medium</a>. It’s also responsive, so the layout adapts to the size of whatever screen it is being viewed on. When logged in, users can peruse writer profiles or see a news feed of the latest stories, with the most recent dispatch from their writer of choice pegged to the top of the page. Sample headlines from early Beacon stories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">“In Peru, Citizens Square Off Against a Gold Mine”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">“Could a Video Game Defeat Hunger in Africa?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">“The Cost of Cheap Shrimp: Forced Labor in Thailand”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">While the list of writers for the beta version is selective, they each have open access to the platform. Beacon is taking a hands-off approach, which means the writers are responsible for their own editing and headlines. It’s also up to them how often they post to the site.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We want them to submit stuff they think is valuable and is worth paying for,” says Sanders. “If people keep coming back for your stories, you get to keep telling them.”</p>
<div id="attachment_105849" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class=" wp-image-105849 " style="border:1px solid black;" alt="A Beacon profile page." src="http://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/screen-shot-2013-09-16-at-9-13-00-pm.png?w=584&#038;h=460" width="584" height="460" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A Beacon profile page.</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">Fletcher, who before joining Facebook worked as a reporter for Time and social media director for Bloomberg, wants Beacon to help writers step out from behind their bylines to build relationships with readers beyond just cultivating a following on Twitter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While it is a worthy mission, the difficulties Beacon will face are numerous. For a start, there’s that asking price, $5 a month, which is a good deal more expensive than Andrew Sullivan’s The Dish ($2 a month), NSFWCorp ($3), and The Magazine ($2), to name a few. Considering readers are hardly deprived of online reading options, getting people to pay $60 a year for yet more reading material will be a tall order. The free Medium, which is also fashioning itself as a platform, even though it <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/08/02/medium-isnt-the-message-be-careful-about-how-you-read-whats-published-on-platforms/">also behaves like a publication</a>, will be one major source of competition for attention spans.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It might also turn out that some of these reporters need their editors. By having direct access to the publishing platform, their raw copy will be exposed. For some reporters, that’s fine because they’ll be adequate self-editors. For others, it will result in substandard work that could degrade the overall reading experience on the platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In holding up first the most virtuous forms of journalism and asking readers to dig into their pockets, Beacon also runs the risk of positioning the reporters on its platform as charity cases, appealing to people to pay up <em>for the good of journalism</em>. Such an unintended effect might prove helpful in extracting a few dollars at first, but for longterm success Beacon needs to host content that people feel they simply must have access to.</p>
<p dir="ltr">International reporting, while vital, has never commanded a large audience and in the print era was always subsidized by more lucrative sections of magazines and newspapers, such as sports and business. Sanders says Beacon writers don’t need to command huge audiences to be able to make decent money from the service; they just need a few hundred really dedicated readers to support them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Of all the models for new media, the platform is the most seductive. Platforms, which require demand significant investments on the technology side but fewer human resources, are more scalable and less hands-on than publications. They facilitate rather than generate content, so writers and producers effectively serve as the platform’s key product lines on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Platforms also offer the potential for the owner to make money in three different ways: from advertising that is attached to the easy traffic (although Beacon has no plans to carry ads); from consumers who, one way or another, pay for the product; and from people and groups who want to buy and sell goods or services through a marketplace hosted on the platform. In those senses, Beacon is of a kin with <a href="http://29.io/">29th Street Publishing</a> and <a href="https://tugboatyards.com/">Tugboat Yards</a> (which was founded by PandoDaily’s board chairman, Andrew Anker), both of which are also attempting to help independent journalists make money from their craft.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Still, no one media company has yet managed to get a platform just right. Media platforms tend to be either free-for-all affairs that attract lowest common denominator content and are prone to being manipulated by interest groups (BuzzFeed’s <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/08/28/buzzfeed-has-a-medium-problem/">fits into that category</a>), or partly moderated forums that blur the distinction between endorsed content and unsolicited contributions (<a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/08/02/medium-isnt-the-message-be-careful-about-how-you-read-whats-published-on-platforms/">Medium</a> and <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/173743/what-the-forbes-model-of-contributed-content-means-for-journalism/">Forbes’ contributors model</a> fit into that category). Then you’ve got social networks such as Facebook and Tumblr that have tried to force their social platforms to also be venues for journalism, with <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/04/10/the-trouble-with-tumblrs-journalism-experiment/">disappointing results</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Beacon emerges from that tech-media milieu. With Backspaces, which has now been put on the backburner, Sanders eventually came to realize how difficult it is for the common user to tell a good story. At the same time, Fletcher was <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2013/03/facebook-managing-editor-steps-down-says-site-doesnt-need-reporters079/">picking up on</a> Facebook’s inability to masquerade as a publisher of journalism, which it doesn’t need to do because it already has a billion content providers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Beacon, however, thinks there’s an opportunity for a well-controlled platform that attracts premium content. Says Sanders: “It just seems weird to me that there isn’t a platform play for quality.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">So far, it hasn&#8217;t been proven that such a thing can exist. Beacon, at least, is an interesting attempt to find out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-89981" alt="Life on Bitcoin" src="http://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/life-on-bitcoin.jpg?w=584&#038;h=438" width="584" height="438" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin has received heaps of attention recently from tech early adopters and the mainstream media alike. It’s been a wild last six months which has seen the value of the virtual currency grow more than tenfold and then fall half as much, as well as the government intervene in a series of suspected fraud and money-laundering cases. The cryptocurrency has been hailed by many as a potential future global currency, but amid all this fervor, it remains little more than an intellectual curiosity to most. That is, those who own bitcoin, have used it to complete a transaction of any sort, or are even aware how to do so are firmly in the minority.</p>
<p>Austin and Becky Craig, documentarians and soon to be newlyweds, are taking on this challenge firsthand with an ambitious plan to live only using bitcoin for the first 90 days after returning from their honeymoon on July 27. The Provo, Utah residents are entering this project without any pre-experience using bitcoin and without making any prior arrangements for how to handle life’s everyday transactions: rent, food, gasoline, etc. The entire adventure will be captured by a documentary film crew, the <a href="http://thegoodline.com/">Good Line</a>, and the couple will also post daily vlogs (video blogs) detailing their triumphs and struggles. The final film will be called “<a href="http://lifeonbitcoin.com/">Life on Bitcoin</a>.”</p>
<p>The couple are fundraising to cover the costs of producing the documentary. They launched a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bitcoinlife/life-on-bitcoin-a-documentary-film?ref=recently_launched">Kickstarter campaign</a> today with the goal of raising $70,000 – donations can also be made using bitcoin directly through <a href="http://lifeonbitcoin.com/">film’s website</a>. The incentives offered range from a DRM-free HD copy of the film, to signed memorabilia, to face time with the creators, to various producer credits.</p>
<p>It’s an ambitious project with more unknowns than knowns. The couple set out five goals for their 90-day adventure. The first, which they describe as the baseline, is to live their everyday life using only bitcoin, meaning paying for rent, furniture, groceries, cell phone, Internet, restaurants, medical, insurance, a plumber, etc. In many cases, they will rely on a financial intermediary to deliver payment in a currency acceptable to the end-recipient, but their hope is to negotiate as many direct bitcoin transactions as possible and to prove that a bitcoin-only life is possible – even in the Provo, UT, where the Craigs say there is &#8220;relatively little bitcoin adoption.&#8221;</p>
<p>The couple will also need to receive all income in bitcoin, or not touch those funds received in fiat currency until after the 90 days have concluded. Both Austin and Becky are creative professionals – Austin starred in the Orabrush “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFeb6YBftHE">Bad Breath Test</a>” video which received more than 60 million views on YouTube – meaning they will be dealing with many clients and paying multiple vendors, each of which will present their own challenge.</p>
<p>Beyond this, the goals get more ambitious. The couple is committed to taking a road trip of at least 1,200 miles round trip using only bitcoin. The trip will require that they buy a “reliable but cheap” car, pay for gas “even if [they] have to barter with farmers,” obtain insurance, and stay in hotels or camp along the way. They have set two related stretch goals of traveling to another country and traveling across an ocean. Both will require the cooperation of airlines or their ability to charm their way onto a private plane.</p>
<p>The Craigs aren’t the first people to go bitcoin only for a period of time. Forbes journalist <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/05/09/25-things-i-learned-about-bitcoin-from-living-on-it-for-a-week/">Kashmir Hill lived on bitcoin alone for a week</a> earlier this year and described the experience as &#8220;living on the fringes&#8221; at times. But while that brief experiment was revealing, it pales in comparison to what Austin and Becky are taking on. Unlike a single week, there are very few transactions that can be put off over a 90 day period. At the same time, Hill lives in San Francisco, which is ground zero of the prototypical <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-03-10/demographics-bitcoin">32.7-year-old white male libertarian</a> bitcoin early adopters. For better or for worse, taking on the same challenge in Utah will be an entirely different experience.</p>
<p>As someone who has used bitcoin in the digital world but never in the physical world, I’m fascinated to see how this plays out. Austin and Becky will need to get really good at explaining what bitcoin is and why anyone would want to accept it. If they can manage to cross this chasm of education, they’ll then have to make it painfully simple for bitcoin newbies to get setup and accept their payments.</p>
<p>There are several intermediaries available that could help facilitate life via bitcoin. For example, <a href="http://pizzaforcoins.com/">PizzaForCoins.com</a> will allow the Craigs to place a delivery order from their local Dominoes and pay for it using the virtual currency. And a variety of sites allow consumers to purchase via Amazon using bitcoin. But these intermediaries are akin to cheating the system, and the couple plan to avoid using them wherever possible. For this experiment to work, they will need to prove that the world is as willing to accept bitcoin as they are to live using it exclusively – or fail trying.</p>
<p>The biggest risk in this whole experiment is the fluctuating value of bitcoins. Over a 90 day period, it&#8217;s very realistic that the Craigs&#8217; buying power could vary by as much as 50 percent in either direction. If this move is in their favor, then it will be a major bonus. But the realization of this volatility alone will be enough to cause concern, let along ending up on the wrong end of a changing exchange rate.</p>
<p>The next area of concern is the ever-changing regulatory environment. The US government <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/05/15/us-authorities-launch-their-first-attack-on-bitcoin/">sanctioned the world’s largest bitcoin exchange</a> less than a month ago and have been taking similar action against other nodes in the virtual currency ecosystem. And while <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/05/17/bitcoin-is-legal-but-mainstream-adoption-will-mandate-playing-by-the-rules/">bitcoin is legal in principle</a>, there is no guarantee that it will survive in its current implementation or that access to the critical infrastructure will be uninterrupted for the duration of the experiment. For the most part, Austin and Becky will be powerless to over any changes in this environment and will have to adjust their plans and their methods accordingly.</p>
<p>Whether the newlyweds will live a life of luxury or one of squalor remains to be seen. But regardless of the answer, the results of this experiment will be instructive about the state of bitcoin and also the gaps in the market ripe for solutions from entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>We know you love our <a href="http://video.pandodaily.com/pandomonthly/">PandoMonthly event series</a>, but we also know it&#8217;s a challenge to set aside anywhere from one to three hours to watch the full video. So in addition to making the audio <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/pandodaily/id587932480" target="_blank">available on iTunes</a> to listen to on your commute, today we&#8217;re launching yet another way to make it easier to enjoy this series: &#8220;PandoMonthly in 90 seconds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our inaugural video is a mashup of the best moments from last week&#8217;s Fireside Chat with Forbes&#8217; Chief Product Officer Lewis DVorkin, hosted by Adam Penenberg. In the video below, DVorkin discusses why journalists shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of advertisers, why journalists need to create their own brands, and why the business model for journalism is &#8220;broken, forever broken.&#8221; DVorkin&#8217;s way may not be the only way, but by sheer volume and pageviews at least, the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network/2013/jan/29/forbes-digital-lewis-dvorkin" target="_blank">Forbes model appears to be working</a>.</p>
