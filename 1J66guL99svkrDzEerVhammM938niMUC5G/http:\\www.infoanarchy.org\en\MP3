Shortform: MPEG1-Layer3
An audio format that allows audio files to be compressed to approximately 1/12 of their original size with little noticable quality difference. This format is lossy, meaning some audio data is discarded, removing sounds that cannot be heard or are barely heard by human ears.
This format is the most popular for encoding and sharing music on file sharing networks such as Napster and WinMX. It was created by the Fraunhofer Institute of Erlangen, Germany. This format is several years old and a new and improved version, MP3Pro, was created by the same company. Other formats of similar quality and low size are available that do not have trademark and patent issues such as Ogg Vorbis.
