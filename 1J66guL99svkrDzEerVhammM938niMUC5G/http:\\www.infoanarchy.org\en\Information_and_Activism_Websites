Because many of these web sites touch on hot topics, their content and sometimes they themselves are Dangerous. Many of the websites listed here are also found in various wiki topics. This website and this wiki discuss a number of activism issues, and several activism-related websites are linked throughout it, like Open Source, GNU, Peekabooty, etc. InfoAnarchy is currently interested in the Copyright Term Reform debate.
There are a number of websites dedicated to the telling of truths not commonly known and dispelling current myths. Some of these are media channels featuring "watchdog journalism", while others re-publish documents as they become declassified. In particular, the less abrasive or completely anti-authoritarian form of anarchist is interested in this sort of free information philosophy.
[edit] Advocacy Groups Some advocacy groups work with the legal and political framework to achieve goals. These include the political organsations tha lobby government for on behalf of a particular group, community or cause. These groups try to improve the link between technology and law by swaying public opinion with good public relations while paying limited respect to enforcement of intellectual property such as copyright.
