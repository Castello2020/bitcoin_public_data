[edit] Send a ZIP or RAR file The fastest way to encrypt your mail is to ZIP a separate text file, add a password, and send the file as an attachment. While there are more than one standard of password-protection on zip files, the absolute easiest way is to use the same ZIP program that your recipient uses.
Negatively, you must have a shared password, which may be possible to be overheard or guessed. Other encryption systems do not have this problem but are often more complicated for the average user. In the absense of other security methods, this is ideal.
Check your software help guide for information on how to add a password-protection but find out what software your recipient uses (such as "WinZIP" or "PKZip" products as they add incompatible security. Although different ZIP programs have different ways of doing this, most have an option for "portability" that is almost universally accepted. Many ZIP utlities are now incorporating strong encryption AES standards as implemented by WinZip, into their programs. RAR also uses this strong encryption by default and often provides better compression but is not as ubiqious as ZIP.
[edit] Strong Encryption AES encryption is much stronger, but less compatible with older zip utlities than the original Zip 2.0 encryption standard. AES (both 128 bit and 256 bit strength) encryption provides government-strength security to zip and is suitable for se
