This is a Dangerous topic.
This page is intended to list and categorize people and organizations
that have played a role in the fight for or against strong restrictions
on copying. Here you will find law professors that support short copyright
terms, artists that allow sharing their work, developers that have
created innovative file sharing tools, activists fighting for freedom of speech -- but also authors seeking the death penalty for copyright
infringers, politicians in the deep pockets of the content industry,
coders creating tools for tracking copyright infringers, and so on.
Feel free to add your own name to the list where appropriate, and amend
it with other helpful information. Please also help to create subpages
for the persons listed here.
