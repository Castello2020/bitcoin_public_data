Activism
From iA wiki
See also: DIY | Framework
The opposite of pacifism. Activism is about modifying or doing one thing to achieve something else. Activism is often part of a broader framework for social change.
The goal of activism usually involves resisting and then halting unjustness. There are privacy and anti-censorship advocates, amongst a huge range of activist individuals and organisations. Activism can begin with an idea or arise from abuse. Actions taken by activists are not always seen as a good thing or even seen as justified by a majority. One reason may be that meaningful activism can be trumped by too much zealotry.
