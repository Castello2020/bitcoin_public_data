Best Compressed Audio Format

The "best" audio format depends on your needs. To balance download speed and hard drive space against quality, this page looks to chronicle some of the tests that have been done around the Internet. While not all are up-to-date, they do provide a good swath of audio formats available.
As a result of these tests, this document assumes that Ogg Vorbis is the best so-far in audio compression, based on tests listed. There are exceptions to OGG's superiority, including on portable devices where OGG is not commonly available. MP3 size-quality performance is among the worst but it's quality (when encoded with LAME) is still considered high and its compatibility is unmatched.
Variable Bitrate Compression: Whenever possible, it is better to encoded using this setting (usually noted as "VBR"). The only time Constant Bitrate Compression (CBR) should be used is when providing music that people can listen to while they download from you. This is called streaming media and it is usually only necessary when operating an Internet radio station.
Whether using CBR or VBR, both allow for some representation of quality. Unless otherwise noted, the general rule of thumb is a quality level between 96 and 192 bits per second.
