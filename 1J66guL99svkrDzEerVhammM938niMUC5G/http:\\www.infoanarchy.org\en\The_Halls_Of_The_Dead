See also: File sharing for some excellent "live" clients
This page lists projects which have officially or apparently been abandoned, usually for around 6 months. Some of these are still functional. We feel your pain.
If you have additional information on any of these clients, please feel free to add them. Even adding things like final messages or dates would be cool. Also feel free to add a wiki page for any of these items if you need more space to write.

Exeem Advert supported filesharing program that never got out of beta. It got some inital momentum because members of the suprnova.org forums were given invitations to join the network when it was started.
Yoink! - Very simple UI, file sharing only. Required IE5. -- From their homepage: We regret to announce the closure of the Yoink Download Community. The community has continued to grow over the years, beyond our ability to sustain it financially. The cost of the server bandwidth has grown too costly for this project to continue any further. We would like to thank the millions of people that have downloaded Yoink and enjoyed trading free files with the community. We hope you enjoyed the experience, it has been a fun couple of years.
Mactella - We are pleased to announce that the Gnutella community no longer needs CXC, that it is thriving and alive with energy. We haven't gone out of business, but we're doing other things. There are better clients out there than Mactella. We recommend LimeWire. There are people selling our GPL'd application, and we'd prefer to stop that. A note that if someone really wants Mactella, the source is still available. Mactella source 648k, for v. 1.3.5 (Stuffit 6 archive)

Media Enforcer - (Windows) - This is a project by a true copyright-believer. It is supposed to search multiple services and automatically report infringements. Aquired by BayTSP, the project status is unknown, but it is a safe assumption that the project got pulled in-house for use by this company as a service - Nov 2002.
JNap - (Java) - Searching-only client. Programmer thinks Napster sucks.
Snap - (Perl) - Napster libraries for web interfaces. Programmer lost interest.

Clip2 - Home of the Reflector, a Gnutella proxy and index server that reduces load on the network. Cash ran out August 2001.
Ohaha - (Windows; IE5) - Describing itself as "the best of Freenet and Gnutella", Ohaha indeed mixes technology of both networks. Like KaZaA, it assigns more tasks to peers with more bandwidth, and it automatically caches files like Freenet does. No longer available as of June 17, 2001.
Snoopstar - (Windows) - Searches OpenNap, Napster, Imesh & Gnutella. Discontinued after being acquired by Bertelsmann.
24Link - Kind of a super-small version of groove.net. Allows you to invite other users by e-mail for file sharing & collaboration. Requires e-mail registration. Shut down in March 2001.
BeOS - Be Inc. got bought out by Palm after financial problems. After that, the OS was left alone although there are minor 3rd party improvements.

[edit] other dead (confirmed) stuff Gnutella.de - Gnutella for Germans. Shut down by Ferrero for infringing on the Nutella chocolate spread name.
Peerprofits - P2P business news, with a list of P2P companies. -- from the website: Since I'm no longer involved in the P2P-distributed computing space (and I've not had time to maintain it) the PeerProfits web site has been brought to a close. Good luck to everyone in the space. I'm available for consulting. Details below. chris -- Nov 2002.
Hook Protect - (Windows) - A program for detecting keyloggers, interceptors, spies, trojans and so on. Monitors programs loaded into memory, directories, files etc. -- From the homepage: We don't support this software anymore. Visit www.anti-keyloggers.com for new products.

You can find more information from his web site.
Scramdisk - (Windows) - An easy-to-use, free disk encryption tool. -- from the homepage: "DriveCrypt" will replace ScramDisk and E4M, and is fully backwards compatible with legacy Sramdisk and E4M partitions, WAV containers, normal containers and partitions.

You can download a demo version of "DriveCrypt", or get more information about the product, browsing to http://www.drivecrypt.com or writing to info@drivecrypt.com

Doesn't allow to cancel uploads or to disable sharing (both intentionally).
