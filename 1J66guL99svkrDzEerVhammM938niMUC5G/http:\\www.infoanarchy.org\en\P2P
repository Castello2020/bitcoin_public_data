Acronym: P2P
Peer-to-peer is a concept whereby one individual directly communicates with another, as opposed to each client referring to a common hub or server. For example, using walkie-talkies is peer-to-peer, while chatting on the phone network as a central hub and is a client-server model.

[edit] Examples [edit] Phone System One way to illustrate P2P is through the phone system. Phones can be viewed as an system of calls switching between endpoints, similar to the Internet and its packets. Land-line phones behave like the traditional client-server model: they go from location-to-location and users can be fairly confidant where they are phoning but not necesssarily who is going to answer. Meanwhile wireless mobile and cellphones, are like P2P from the user point-of-view; you know who you're phoning, but not where that person is.
