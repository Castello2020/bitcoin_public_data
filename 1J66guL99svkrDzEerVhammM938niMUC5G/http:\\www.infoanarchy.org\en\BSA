Acronym: Business Software Alliance
An international organization that warns companies to make certain they have fully paid for their software or face legal repercussions. The BSA is the "foremost organization dedicated to promoting a safe and legal digital world." However, this service to the software industry often assumes guilt "until you can prove yourself innocent" (see below). This organization is thought to mostly be controlled/promoted by Microsoft.
This approach has been a growth strategy for much of the tech industry by finding
Ethically, individuals and companies should pay for their software regardless of the BSA to promote good karma and keep good software engineers employed. Or, where possible, actively contribute to free software projects such as the GNU project or Mozilla

This annoyed me on several levels, but ultimately, it comes back to the BSA.
This needs to stop. While some might argue against my motives with "The BSA is the best thing ever to happen to Linux", they fail to
