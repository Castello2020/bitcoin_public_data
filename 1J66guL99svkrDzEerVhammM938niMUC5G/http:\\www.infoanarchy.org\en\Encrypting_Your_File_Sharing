Encrypting Your File Sharing
From iA wiki

Software or methods for more-secure/anonymous file sharing. If exchanging files with known parties over an ordinary file sharing network, see Encrypting Your Files.
Note: No action other than abstaining from any sort of file sharing is a true defence. Programs that promote anonymity may not be 100% effective and programs with encryption are often not carefully audited and may be insecure. In avoiding audits by the RIAA, anonymity is more important than encryption.
[edit] P2P-enabled software ENTROPY - Similar in design to Freenet (at least from the user's perspective), but written in C instead of Java.
