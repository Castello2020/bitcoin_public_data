Looking throught the list of countries, i didn't find Turkey, nor Spain, nor the Netherlands, nor Germany. While all of these countries (ab)use censorship on the internet, either by default using such filter (Turkey), by law (any capitalist country where copyright exists and Russia probly via other ways), or a less obvious more silent way by censoring individuals, groups, events, or spreading f*cking lies; censoring the truth. Or in minor things, for example censoring Mein Kampf using copyright (Netherlands, Germany).
Stating only the obvious doesn't say anything about howe the censorship takes place. Censorship is everywhere.
How do Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan censor? Perhaps such info can be added using a URL. It at least adds some proof to backup the statements instead of listing countries.
Oh, and can somebody explain me the psychologic behind censorship? Why exactly do people censor? On which feelings and/or thoughts is it based? I was thinking mainly about fear and self-interest but i think there's more behind it, somehow. -- dpi
To the last element, I have a suggestion. The obvious reason to censor something is to exert control. Information is power so limiting what is known limits what can be done. Parents seek to control the way children grow up so that they remain innocent - it is hoped - not seek out sex. Governments seek to control the way its citizenry thinks by controlling its information sources and destroying dissent and - it is hoped - preventing rebellion. Many fundamentalist religious groups wish to control what they see as immorality allowed to run rampant and therefore - it is hoped - prevent bad things from happening. Censorship previous to the Internet was possible but is quickly becoming much more difficult. See Security Through Obscurity. Webfork
Interesting analyse Webfork. I recognize, besides "control" and "hope" also earlier said "fear" and "self-interest" and also "distrust/uncertainity". Do you believe it will become impossible to censor on the internet? dpi
Yes and no. Here are some examples of why I say that:
1. China - has done a good job of censoring *most* if the Internet but technologies like peer-to-peer often duck censorship measures and are changing so fast that its hard to simply shut everyone out of the service. In fact, some technologies are created PURELY to circumvent blocking technologies.
2. Web Filters - I have "NetNanny" at my work place on some of the computers and I'm constantly amused at which Web sites it blocks and those it allows. It
