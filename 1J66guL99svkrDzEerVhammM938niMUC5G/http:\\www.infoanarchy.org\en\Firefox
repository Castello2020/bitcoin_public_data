Web Browser available for a long list of operating systems (Windows, OS X, *Nix, and more), Firefox is free, standards-compliant, and open-source (GPL).
Currently the second most popular and arguably better web browser, Firefox is taken from the Mozilla Suite application, developed for speed and security. Unique to Firefox software, new releases do not often have more new features but instead improved infrastructure. New and unique features are instead generally left to a broad and strong plugins and extension community.
Firefox has become a model for many other open source projects with a focus on extensibility, simplicity, and portability (cross-platform). Its popularity has surprised Microsoft, the open source community, and given way to the possibilities of Web 2.0.
Version 1.0 had 6 million downloads on the 24 November 2004 (from it's non-developer homepage Spread Firefox). As of mid 2006, the software is fast approaching over 50 million downloads.
