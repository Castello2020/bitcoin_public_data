File Extension: MOV, AVI
Quicktime is Apple's proprietary video container and API that supports things like capture from DV devices, streaming, and playback. Codecs like 3ivx and Sorenson Video 3 use MOV while older versions use AVI. Note that the various Quicktime versions (4, 5, 6) are different distributions of compression formats.
