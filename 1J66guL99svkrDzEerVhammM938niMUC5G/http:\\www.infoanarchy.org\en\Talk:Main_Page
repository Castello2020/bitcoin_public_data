[edit] Image thumbnailing I would be happy if this feature was enabled. I think images, esp thumbnails can be useful. I would like to see more screenshots from the linux desktop and other software in particular. --ABliss 11:35, 23 Dec 2004 (GMT)
Everyone,
I'm about to put the front page on "protect" but I have no problem not having this feature available. If anyone wants me to turn it off, just say so.
