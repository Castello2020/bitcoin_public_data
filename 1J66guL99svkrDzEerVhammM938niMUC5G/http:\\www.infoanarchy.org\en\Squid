Home Page: http://www.squid-cache.org
Adapted from the homepage:
A caching engine usually installed on a remote server. Caching is a way to store requested Internet objects (i.e., data available via the HTTP, FTP, and gopher protocols) on a system closer to the requesting site. Web browsers can then use the local Squid cache as a proxy HTTP server, reducing access time as well as bandwidth consumption. This is often useful for ISPs to increase speed to their customers, also known as Web Server Acceleration, and LANs that share an Internet connection. Because it is also a proxy, it provides some anonymity and security.
