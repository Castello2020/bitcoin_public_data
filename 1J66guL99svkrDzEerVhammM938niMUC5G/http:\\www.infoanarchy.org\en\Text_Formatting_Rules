[edit]General
To edit a MediaWiki page, click on the "Edit this page" (or just "edit") link at one of its edges. This will bring you to a page with a text box containing the wikitext: the editable source code from which the server produces the webpage. For the special codes, see below.
After adding to or changing the wikitext it is useful to press "Preview", which produces the corresponding webpage in your browser but does not make it publicly available yet (not until you press "Save"). Errors in formatting, links, tables, etc., are often much easier to discover from the rendered page than from the raw wikitext.
If you are not satisfied you can make more changes and preview the page as many times as necessary. Then write a short edit summary in the small text field below the edit-box and when finished press "Save". Depending on your system, pressing the "Enter" key while the edit box is not active (i.e., there is no typing cursor in it) may have the same effect as pressing "Save".
You may find it more convenient to copy and paste the text first into your favorite text editor, edit and spell check it there, and then paste it back into your web browser to preview. This way, you can also keep a local backup copy of the pages you have edited. It also allows you to make changes offline, but before you submit your changes, please make sure nobody else has edited the page since you saved your local copy (by checking the page history), otherwise you may accidently revert someone else's edits. If someone has edited it since you copied the page, you'll have to merge their edits into your new version (you can find their specific edits by using the "diff" feature of the page history). These issues are handled automatically by the Mediawiki software if you edit the page online, retrieving and submitting the wikicode in the same text box.
See also MediaWiki architecture.
[edit] Dummy edit If the wikitext is not changed no edit will be recorded and the edit summary is discarded.
A dummy edit is a change in wikitext that has no effect on the rendered page, such as changing the number of newlines at some position from 0 to 1 or from 2 to 3 or conversely (changing from 1 to 2 makes a difference, see below). This allows an edit summary, and is useful for correcting a previous edit summary, or an accidental marking of a previous edit as "minor" (see below). [edit] Minor edits When editing a page, a logged-in user has the option of flagging the edit as a "minor edit". When to use this is somewhat a matter of personal preference. The rule of thumb is that an edit of a page that is spelling corrections, formatting, and minor rearranging of text should be flagged as a "minor edit". A major edit is basically something that makes the entry worth relooking at for somebody who wants to watch the article rather closely, so any "real" change, even if it is a single word. This feature is important, because users can choose to hide minor edits in their view of the Recent Changes page, to keep the volume of edits down to a manageable level.
The reason for not allowing a user who is not logged in to mark an edit as minor is that vandalism could then be marked as a minor edit, in which case it would stay unnoticed longer. This limitation is another reason to log in.
[edit] The wiki markup In the left column of the table below, you can see what effects are possible. In the right column, you can see how those effects were achieved. In other words, to make text look like it looks in the left column, type it in the format you see in the right column.
You may want to keep this page open in a separate browser window for reference. If you want to try out things without danger of doing any harm, you can do so in the Sandbox.
[edit] Sections, paragraphs, lists and lines What it looks like
What you type
Start your sections with header lines:
New section Subsection
Sub-subsection


== New section ==

=== Subsection ===

==== Sub-subsection ====
Newline:
A single
newline
has no
effect on the
layout.
But an empty line
starts a new paragraph.
(<p> disables this paragraphing until </p> or the end of the section)
(in Cologne Blue two newlines and a div tag give just one newline; in the order newline, div tag, newline, the result is two newlines)


A single
newline
has no
effect on the
layout.

But an empty line
starts a new paragraph.
You can break lines
without starting a new paragraph.
Sufficient as wikitext code is <br>, the XHTML code <br /> is not needed, the system produces this code. You can break lines&lt;br&gt;
without starting a new paragraph.
Lists are easy to do:
start every line with a star
more stars means deeper levels
A newline
in a list marks the end of the list.
Of course
you can
start again.
* Lists are easy to do:
** start every line with a star
*** more stars means deeper levels
*A newline
*in a list  
marks the end of the list.
*Of course
*you can

Numbered lists are also good
very organized
easy to follow
A newline
in a list marks the end of the list.
New numbering starts
with 1.
# Numbered lists are also good
## very organized

Definition list list of definitions
item the item's definition

A colon indents a line or paragraph.
A manual newline starts a new paragraph.
This is primarily for displayed material, but is also used for discussion on Talk pages.
: A colon indents a line or paragraph.
A manual newline starts a new paragraph.
IF a line of plain text starts with a space THEN
  it will be formatted exactly
    as typed;
  in a fixed-width font;
  lines won't wrap;
ENDIF
this is useful for:
  * pasting preformatted text;
  * algorithm descriptions;
  * program source code
  * ASCII art;
  * chemical structures;
WARNING If you make it wide,
you force the whole page to be wide and
hence less readable. Never start ordinary lines with spaces.

A horizontal dividing line: above

Mainly useful for separating threads on Talk pages.
A horizontal dividing line: above
----
and below. Summarizing the effect of a single newline: no effect in general, but it ends a list item or indented part; thus changing some text into a list item, or indenting it, is more cumbersome if it contains newlines, they have to be removed; see also w:Wikipedia:Don't use line breaks.
[edit] Links, URLs What it looks like
What you type
Sue is reading the video policy.
First letter of target is automatically capitalized.
Internally spaces are automatically represented as underscores (typing an underscore has the same effect as typing a space, but is not recommended).
Thus the link above is to http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_policy, which is the page with the name "Video policy".
Sue is reading the [[video policy]].
Link to a section on a page, e.g.
List_of_cities_by_country#Morocco; when section editing does not work the link is treated as link to the page, i.e. to the top; this applies for:
links to non-existent sections
links in redirects
interwiki links
[[List_of_cities_by_country#Morocco]].
Link target and link label are different: answers.
(This is called a piped link).
Same target, different name:
[[User:Larry Sanger|answers]]
Endings are blended into the link: official positions, genes
Endings are blended
into the link: [[official position]]s, [[gene]]s
Automatically hide stuff in parentheses: kingdom.
Automatically hide namespace: Village pump.
The server fills in the part after the | when you save the page. Next time you open the edit box you will see the expanded piped link. A preview interprets the abbreviated form correctly, but does not expand it yet in the edit box. Press Save and again Edit, and you will see the expanded version. The same applies for the following feature.
Automatically hide stuff in parentheses:
[[kingdom (biology)|]]. Automatically hide namespace:
[[Wikipedia:Village pump|]].
When adding a comment to a Talk page,
you should sign it. You can do this by
adding three tildes for your user name:
Karl Wick
or four for user name plus date/time:
Karl Wick 08:10 Oct 5, 2002 (UTC)
When adding a comment to a Talk page,
you should sign it. You can do this by
adding three tildes for your user name:
: ~~~
or four for user name plus date/time:
: ~~~~
The weather in London is a page that doesn't exist yet.
You can create it by clicking on the link.
To create a new page:
Create a link to it on some other page.
Save that page.
Click on the link you just made. The new page will open for editing.
Have a look at how to start a page guide and the naming conventions page for your project.
[[The weather in London]] is a page

Use links for dates, so everyone can set their own display order. Use Special:Preferences to change your own date display setting.
[[July 20]], [[1969]] , [[20 July]] [[1969]]
and [[1969]]-[[07-20]]
will all appear as 20 July 1969 if you set your date display preference to 1 January 2001.
[edit] Images What it looks like
What you type
A picture: Image:Wiki.png
For many projects, only images that have been uploaded to the same project can be used. To upload images, use the upload page. You can find the uploaded image on the image list

A picture: [[Image:Wiki.png]]
or, with alternate text (strongly encouraged) [[Image:Wiki.png|Wikipedia 
- The Free Encyclopedia]] 
Web browsers render alternate text when not displaying an image -- for example, when the image isn't loaded, or in a text-only browser, or when spoken aloud. See Alternate text for images for help on choosing alternate text. See Extended image syntax for more options.
Clicking on an uploaded image displays a description page, which you can also link directly to: Image:Wiki.png

[[:Image:Wiki.png]]
To include links to images shown as links instead of drawn on the page, use a "media" link.

[edit] Character formatting What it looks like
What you type
Emphasize, strongly, very strongly.
These are double and triple apostrophes, not double quotes.
''Emphasize'', '''strongly''',
'''''very strongly'''''.
You can also write italic and bold
if the desired effect is a specific font style
rather than emphasis, as in mathematical formulae:
F = ma
However, the difference between these two methods is not very important for graphical browsers, and many people choose to ignore it.
You can also write &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt;
and &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; if the desired effect is a 
specific font style rather than emphasis, as 
in mathematical formulas:
:&lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt; = &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;
A typewriter font for technical terms.
A typewriter font for 
&lt;tt&gt;technical terms&lt;/tt&gt;.
You can use small text for captions.
You can use &lt;small&gt;small text&lt;/small&gt; 
for captions.
You can strike out deleted material
and underline new material.
You can &lt;strike&gt;strike out deleted material&lt;/strike&gt;
and &lt;u&gt;underline new material&lt;/u&gt;.

Use <pre> to suppress interpretation of wiki markup and keep newlines and multiple spaces, and get typewriter font, but interpret character references:
arrow      &rarr;

''italics''
[[link]]
&lt;pre&gt;arrow      &amp;rarr;

''italics''
[[link]]&lt;/pre&gt;
Use leading space on each line to keep newlines and multiple spaces, and get typewriter font:
arrow      &rarr;
italics
link
</pre>
 arrow      &amp;rarr;

 ''italics''
 [[link]]
Use typewriter font:
arrow →
italics
link
&lt;tt&gt;arrow      &amp;rarr;&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;''italics''&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;[[link]]&lt;/tt&gt;
Show character references:

Commenting page source:

Used to leave comments in a page for future editors.
&lt;!-- comment here --&gt;
[edit] HTML Tables HTML tables can be quite useful as well. For details on how to use them and discussion about when they are appropriate, see MediaWiki User's Guide: Using tables.
[edit]Templates
Some text on a page may correspond in the edit box to just a reference to another page, in the form {{name}}, referring to the page "Template:name" (or if the name starts with a namespace prefix, it refers to the page with that name). This is called a template. For changing that text, edit that other page. Sometimes a separate edit link is provided for this purpose. A convenient way to put such a link in a template in Wikipedia is with en:Template:ed.
[edit]Page protection
In a few cases the link labeled "Edit this page" is replaced by the text "Protected page" (or equivalents in the language of the project). In that case the page can not be edited.
[edit]Position-independent wikitext
Wikitext for which the result does not depend on the position in the wikitext page:
interlanguage links (see also above) - the mutual order is preserved, but otherwise the positions within the page are immaterial category specification - ditto
__NOTOC__, __FORCETOC__, see Help:Section
[edit]Separating edits
When moving or copying a piece of text within a page or from another page, and also making other edits, it is useful to separate these edits. This way the diff function can be usefully applied for checking these other edits.
