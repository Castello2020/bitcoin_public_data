Veganism
From iA wiki
See also: Good Thing | Vegetarianism | Politics
The philosophy and related actions of not eating animals or animal products or by-products. This includes eat meat (fish / pig / cow / whatever), eggs, milk, butter, or any other dairy. Vegans also generally avoid products that are made using animals in other ways, as with leather clothing or shoes, certain types of sugar, gelatin-containing film, or cosmetics tested on animals. Some go so far as to avoid bee-produced honey as the bees are often burned alive after they make the honey as it is more efficient to start a new colony than waiting for their honey-making cycle to begin again.
Veganism is considered strict Vegetarianism.

[edit] Philosophy People usually become vegan due to moral concerns. Most vegans believe that a vegan diet is healthier than the typical omnivorous human diet, but are more often motivated by compassion for animals. Factory Farming in both meat and dairy industries is a leading reason for vegans to avoid such product. Vegans also stress that exploiting animals in modern society is not necessary for survival.
Vegans also generally develop other political philosophies, perhaps Anarchism,
