Empathy Collective
From iA wiki
The Empathy Collective, in its current form, is an informal decentralized network of autonomous anarchist individuals that strives to cooperate in a way that is freely sharing, mutually supportive, autonomy-respecting, constantly free-form & changing, and in constant process.
