Vegetarianism
From iA wiki
See also: Philosophy | Veganism
The philosophy and related actions of not eating animals or what is commonly called meat. Vegetarianism is a rather loose title, however, as many call themselves vegetarians but eat fish, chicken, etc. A more strict and clear version of Vegetarianism is Veganism which involves NO animal-based products including gelatin found in some medicine capsules. To find out if a prescription drug had gelatin check the Prescription Desk Reference, Prescription Drug Information:
Vegetarianism can prolong life and greatly reduce the risk of cancer (colon, lung, pancreatic, stomach, prostrate and bladder), heart disease and other chronic diseases, primarily because vegetarians eat more fruit, vegetables and legumes. The exact mechanisms for these health benefits are still not known, however observations have been deduced from long-term statistics collection and reporting by Synnove
