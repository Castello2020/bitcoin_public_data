				<p>If you randomly start tracing down the family tree of mankind, you&#8217;ll probably reach a dead-end.  But if you&#8217;re lucky you might avoid dead-ends forever and trace out an <i>infinite chain of descendants</i>.  The likelihood of this depends on how prone humans are to spawn offspring: if everyone always has children, then you&#8217;ll get an infinite chain guaranteed, but of course this isn&#8217;t how things are.  If mankind goes extinct then it&#8217;s impossible to get an infinite chain because after a certain generation everybody&#8217;s dead.  But what about the converse: is it possible there could be an alternate universe where mankind doesn&#8217;t go extinct, but contains no infinite chains?  The answer is no, and the proof uses a profound combinatorial result called Konig&#8217;s Lemma.</p>
<h3>Trees</h3>
<p>Mathematical trees are a bit more simplified than family trees.  A tree is a set of <i>nodes</i>.  One of the nodes is the <i>root</i>.  Every node except for the root has exactly one <i>parent</i>.  If node A is the parent of node B then node B is a <i>child</i> of node A.  The <i>descendants</i> of A are the children of A, together with their own children, and their grandchildren, and so on.  Loops are not allowed: a node is not allowed to be its own descendant.  And every node must be a descendant of the root (except for the root itself).</p>
<p>The difference between a mathematical tree and a family tree is, in the mathematical tree, people (nodes) only have one parent.  Essentially, the mathematical tree is a family tree for a species which reproduces asexually.  The reason for this is it&#8217;s a lot easier to prove things about asexual trees.  We&#8217;ll see below that the theorems we get for mathematical trees can often be tweaked for family trees, so nothing is really lost.</p>
<p>The <i>generations</i> of a tree are defined exactly how you&#8217;d think.  The first generation is the set consisting solely of the root.  The second generation is the set of children of the root; the third generation is the set of children of nodes in the second generation&#8230;  and in general, the (k+1)th generation is the set of children of nodes in the kth generation.  In the literature, a more common synonym for generation is <i>level</i>, and sometimes the counting starts at 0, so that the root is said to be at level 0 and its children at level 1.  &#8220;A rose by any other name&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<h2>Konig&#8217;s Lemma</h2>
<p>Let T be a tree.  If T is infinite but every generation is finite, then T contains an infinite descending chain of children.</p>
<p><b>Proof</b>.  We&#8217;ll construct an infinite chain n<sub>1</sub>n<sub>2</sub>n<sub>3</sub>&#8230; inductively in such a way that every n<sub>k+1</sub> is a child of n<sub>k</sub>.</p>
<p>First, let n<sub>1</sub> be the root of the tree.  Note that n<sub>1</sub> has infinitely many descendants, because the whole tree is infinite by assumption, and everything (except the root itself) is a descendant of the root.</p>
<p>Now, inductively, suppose we&#8217;ve defined n<sub>1</sub>n<sub>2</sub>&#8230;n<sub>k</sub>, each one a child of the previous, and such that n<sub>k</sub> has infinitely many descendants.  I&#8217;ll show how we can define n<sub>k+1</sub>, a child of n<sub>k</sub>, itself with infinitely many descendants.</p>
<p>Let c<sub>1</sub>,c<sub>2</sub>,&#8230;,c<sub>n</sub> be the children of n<sub>k</sub> (n<sub>k</sub> must have at least one child since it has infinitely many descendants).  I&#8217;m using the fact here that n<sub>k</sub> only has finitely many children, and that&#8217;s true by the assumption that every generation of T is finite (if n<sub>k</sub> had infinitely many children, that would make a whole infinite generation).</p>
<p>I claim that at least one of the c<sub>i</sub>&#8216;s has, itself, infinitely many descendants.  The proof is by contradiction:  assume c<sub>1</sub>,c<sub>2</sub>,&#8230;,c<sub>n</sub> each have only finitely many descendants.  Add finitely many finite numbers, and the result is finite: thus n<sub>k</sub> has only finitely many descendants-of-children.  Together with the finitely many children themselves, n<sub>k</sub> has only finitely many descendants.  But we assumed we&#8217;d chosen n<sub>k</sub> to have infinitely many descendants, so this is a contradiction, and my claim must be true.</p>
<p>So, take one of the c<sub>i</sub> with infinitely many descendants, and pick it as n<sub>k+1</sub>.</p>
<p>Inductively, this defines a whole infinite sequence n<sub>1</sub>n<sub>2</sub>&#8230; which goes on forever with each node the parent of the next.  In other words, an infinite descending chain of children. QED.</p>
<h2>Application to Family Trees</h2>
<p>In real life, people have two parents, not one.  We can convert mankind&#8217;s family tree into a mathematical tree by systematically erasing one parent from every mother-father pair.  For example, we could erase all females, and have each person count only as a descendant of their father: sort of like a medieval European throne-room.  Or we could ignore males, counting only mothers as parents.  We aren&#8217;t really erasing these people in real life, only erasing their names from the family tree, to turn it into a mathematical one.</p>
<p>Assume mankind never goes extinct: there is always an nth generation, for every n&gt;0 (see note 1).  Assume nobody has infinitely many children.</p>
<p>I claim there is an endless chain of people, each one a parent of the next: an infinite chain of progeny.</p>
<p>Proof:  Turn the family tree into a mathematical tree&#8211; say, by erasing females.  Now &#8220;parent&#8221; becomes synonymous with &#8220;father&#8221; (this might alter what generations people belong to, but the assumption that no father has infinitely many children, ensures the generations are still finite).  The &#8220;root&#8221; (which previously was the matriarch-patriarch pair) is now just the patriarch and the matriarch is banished.  The tree is infinite: otherwise, only finitely many generations would be witnessed.  By Konig&#8217;s Lemma, the tree has an infinite descending chain of children.  And this infinite chain of kids translates back into the original, non-mathematical family tree, completing the proof.</p>
<p>In fact, we proved something stronger than we needed:  not only is there an infinitely descending chain of children, but we can find such a chain which is <i>all male</i>.</p>
<p>Identical reasoning would also yield an infinite chain of children of <i>all female</i> gender:  instead of ignoring females, ignore males.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a challenge-question for the reader.  Is it true, that in every alternate universe where mankind never goes extinct, that you can always find an infinite chain of children which alternates male-female-male-female forever?</p>
<h2>Application to Games</h2>
<p>Suppose a game has infinitely many possible configurations&#8211; for example, a game of Chess on an infinite board.  But assume at any particular point in the game, there are only finitely many moves available&#8211; for example, infinite-board Chess with only finitely many pieces.  Then it is possible to play the game forever without ever hitting the same configuration twice.</p>
<p>(In the infinite chess game, this is obvious:  both players can simply move their rooks sideways forever and ever in the same direction.  But the application works for <i>all</i> games which meet the assumptions)</p>
<p>Proof:  Create a tree as follows.  Nodes correspond to configurations of the game.  The root is the initial configuration.  Now, inductively, for each node N we&#8217;ve already defined, N being a game configuration, and for each possible game configuration M, add M as a child of N if and only if two criteria are met:</p>
<ol>
<li>M hasn&#8217;t already been added to the tree yet</li>
<li>It&#8217;s possible to go from configuration N to configuration M in one move</li>
</ol>
<p>The fact that we assumed there are only finitely many legal moves at any given time, ensures that no node has infinitely many children; it follows that every generation is finite.  The tree itself is infinite: every one of the possible configurations can be reached by following a finite number of moves from the initial configuration&#8211; this is the definition of &#8220;possible&#8221;&#8211; and thus will be added as a child to the corresponding configuration right before it&#8211; assuming it hasn&#8217;t been added even earlier by some other series of moves.</p>
<p>By Konig&#8217;s Lemma, there is an infinite branch through this tree.  You can &#8220;play&#8221; this branch, because each configuration follows from the previous one by a legal move in the game (criteria 2).  You&#8217;ll never hit the same configuration twice, because criteria 1 ensures no configuration appears twice in the tree, hence in the infinite branch.  So the theorem is proved.</p>
<h2>The Nonconstructive Nature of Konig&#8217;s Lemma</h2>
<p>In the proof of Konig&#8217;s Lemma, we create an infinite branch inductively, using <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> at every step except the first.  A proof by contradiction, proving that some choice works, gives us no clue about <i>which</i> choice works.  In a sense, if we&#8217;re confused once by once proof by contradiction, then Konig confuses us infinitely often, and the infinite branch is <i>infinitely nonconstructive</i> (but this is handwavey and not actually a formal statement).</p>
<p>In some alternate universe, the root of mankind is named Adam and his sons are named Cain and Abel.  Konig assures us that at least <i>one</i> of Cain or Abel will have infinitely many descendants (or mankind will go extinct).  We have no idea <i>which one</i>.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b></p>
<p>1. In a non-mathematical family tree, &#8220;generation&#8221; isn&#8217;t very well-defined, because it&#8217;s possible for a person&#8217;s two parents to come from two different generations.  For the sake of making everything well-defined, you can say that a person whose mother and father are generation x and y, is generation max(x,y)+1.  Assume no John Connor time-travel paradoxes <img src='http://www.xamuel.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>2. The form I gave here is a special case of the full Konig&#8217;s Lemma, which is a statement about more general graphs which don&#8217;t have to be trees.</p>
