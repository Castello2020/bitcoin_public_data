gzippo
gzippo pronounced g-zippo is a gzip middleware for Connect / expressjs using node-compress for better performace.
gzippo currently only supports only gzipping static content files however a release is in progress to introduce streaming support.
Installation
$ npm install gzippo
Usage
In your express/connect server setup, use as follows:
var gzippo = require('gzippo');

//Replace the static provider with gzippo's
//app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
app.use(gzippo.staticGzip(__dirname + '/public'));
Options:
contentTypeMatch - A regular expression tested against the Content-Type header to determine whether the response should be gzipped or not. The default value is /text|javascript|json/.
maxAge - cache-control max-age directive, defaulting to 1 day
clientMaxAge - browser cache-control max-age directive, defaulting to 1 week
Currently the gzipped version is created and stored in memory. This is not final and was done to get a working version
up and about. A version which will gzip text/html after res.render() / res.end() is in progress.
node-compress gzip library is used for gzipping.
