        "title": "Korean Street Food - 포장마차",
        "description": "When it comes to street food in Asia, Korea reigns supreme as the true heavyweight offering up a diverse spread of delectable street snacks that range from sweet to salty and from savory to spicy.  Whether you\'re in the mood for a small bite - or a huge feast - you\'ll certainly find what you\'re looking for at an affordable price as most Korean street food items are priced between 1000 to 4000 Korean Won.  \n\nWhen many foreigners think of Korean cuisine the first thought that may come to mind is having Korean barbecue at a Korean restaurant; however, Korean food is so much more than that and I truly believe it is showcased in its finest form on the streets of Seoul - or any Korean city\/town for that matter.\n\nWhether your outing is for breakfast, lunch, dinner, a snack or even a hangover cure, eating on the street is as real as it gets in South Korea.\n\nPlease be sure to let me know how your experience eating Korean street food compares to other types of Asian street food and\/or street food from around the world.\n\nThe following is a guide to some of our favorite Korean street food bites that you\'ll want to try when you visit Korea for the first time:\n\nI\'ve now traveled to over forty countries and I\'ve yet to experience street food that can compete with Korea.  Known locally as Pojangmacha, you can tantalize your taste buds with spicy, savory, salty and sweet street snacks.  Two of my personal favorites include Tteokbokki (떡볶이) and Hotteok (호떡). \n\nThe following is a guide to some of our favorite Korean street -- warning -- I hope you\'re not hunrgy while watching this.\n\nAnd we are going to show you the different kinds of food you can buy in this alley.\n\nSo that looks pretty appetizing.  What do you have there? It sure does.  Well we found some food on a stick here.  Different kind of battered food objects.  So if you want to take a look.  We\'ve got what appears to be a rice cake, kind of a lobster roll and as we go down a bit lower sort of like a hotdog\/sausage thingamajig.  And this is our first little snack food of the day.  It looks tasty. Let\'s try it. Okay, I\'m going to have the rice one. Very classy!  Mmmmmm. Nice.\nAlright, now you are up.  What are you going to have?  I\'m going to take a bite of the hotdog.  Scarf it.  Mmmmm.  It\'s nice and spicy.  Is it?  This is really good.  Yeah.  You\'ll have to try this one.\n호떡?  얼마 죠?  1000 원입니다.\n\nOkay, so we have got a delicious treat here called Hotteok.  And it\'s a fried kind of sweet treat.  Inside it\'s filled with cinnamon, honey and sugary kind of goodness. You bit into it and it\'s really warm. Perfect for the fall or winter.  So I will take the first bite here.\nOh yeah.  Oh yeah.  That\'s good.  Mmmmmmm....haha\n\nSo we\'ve found ourselves a nice little back-alley to enjoy it.  We\'re going to feast on the hotteok.  It\'s delicious.  Show us how it is done. It\'s hot. It\'s hot!  Oh nice!  The gooey-ness.\nIt\'s made of honey.  Malt.  M A L T.  Actually honey is liquid right?  We boil this for one week.  We make it solid because I have to show you a performance. It\'s hard.  This is corn flour.  Make a hole. Like this.  Like this.  Stretch.  Stretch. Little by little.\n\nI have a clump of candy in my cheek.  Nice.  We just bought some sticky rice taffy and it is all natural.  It is very sweet.  It is kind of like a chewy candy.\n\nThis would appear to be ice cream in some kind of cane.\n\nLook at what we\'ve got here.  Nice.  Big enough?  Go take a bite of that.  Take a look at this.  I think it is big enough to share.  Well, good.\n\nIs that the biggest ice cream you\'ve ever had?  Yeah, that is really good.\n\nIf you\'re looking to try Korean street food Insadong (인사동) is one of your best bets in the entire country let alone Seoul.\n\nSpeaking Korean.\n\nWhen traveling to Korea don\'t be afraid to sample as many Korean street food snacks as you possibly can -- your taste buds will surely be rewarded.\n\nThis is part of our Travel in Korea series.

Whether you're in the mood for a small bite - or a huge feast - you'll certainly find what you're looking for at an affordable price as most Korean street food items are priced between 1000 to 4000 Korean Won.  \n\nWhen many foreigners think of Korean cuisine the first thought that may come to mind is having Korean barbecue at a Korean restaurant; however, Korean food is so much more than that and I truly believe it is showcased in its finest form on the streets of Seoul - or any Korean city/town for that matter.\n\nWhether your outing is for breakfast, lunch, dinner, a snack or even a hangover cure, eating on the street is as real as it gets in South Korea.\n\nPlease be sure to let me know how your experience eating Korean street food compares to other types of Asian street food and/or street food from around the world.\n\nThe following is a guide to some of our favorite Korean street food bites that you'll want to try when you visit Korea for the first time:\n\nI've now traveled to over forty countries and I've yet to experience street food that can compete with Korea.  Known locally as Pojangmacha, you can tantalize your taste buds with spicy, savory, salty and sweet street snacks.  Two of my personal favorites include Tteokbokki (떡볶이) and Hotteok (호떡). \n\nThe following is a guide to some of our favorite Korean street -- warning -- I hope you're not hunrgy while watching this.\n\nAnd we are going to show you the different kinds of food you can buy in this alley.\n\nSo that looks pretty appetizing.  What do you have there? It sure does.  Well we found some food on a stick here.  Different kind of battered food objects.  So if you want to take a look.  We've got what appears to be a rice cake, kind of a lobster roll and as we go down a bit lower sort of like a hotdog/sausage thingamajig.  And this is our first little snack food of the day.  It looks tasty. Let's try it. Okay, I'm going to have the rice one. Very classy!  Mmmmmm. Nice.\nAlright, now you are up.  What are you going to have?  I'm going to take a bite of the hotdog.  Scarf it.  Mmmmm.  It's nice and spicy.  Is it?  This is really good.  Yeah.  You'll have to try this one.\n호떡?  얼마 죠?  1000 원입니다.\n\nOkay, so we have got a delicious treat here called Hotteok.  And it's a fried kind of sweet treat.  Inside it's filled with cinnamon, honey and sugary kind of goodness. You bit into it and it's really warm. Perfect for the fall or winter.  So I will take the first bite here.\nOh yeah.  Oh yeah.  That's good.  Mmmmmmm....haha\n\nSo we've found ourselves a nice little back-alley to enjoy it.  We're going to feast on the hotteok.  It's delicious.  Show us how it is done. It's hot. It's hot!  Oh nice!  The gooey-ness.\nIt's made of honey.  Malt.  M A L T.  Actually honey is liquid right?  We boil this for one week.  We make it solid because I have to show you a performance. It's hard.  This is corn flour.  Make a hole. Like this.  Like this.  Stretch.  Stretch. Little by little.\n\nI have a clump of candy in my cheek.  Nice.  We just bought some sticky rice taffy and it is all natural.  It is very sweet.  It is kind of like a chewy candy.\n\nThis would appear to be ice cream in some kind of cane.\n\nLook at what we've got here.  Nice.  Big enough?  Go take a bite of that.  Take a look at this.  I think it is big enough to share.  Well, good.\n\nIs that the biggest ice cream you've ever had?  Yeah, that is really good.\n\nIf you're looking to try Korean street food Insadong (인사동) is one of your best bets in the entire country let alone Seoul.\n\nSpeaking Korean.\n\nWhen traveling to Korea don't be afraid to sample as many Korean street food snacks as you possibly can -- your taste buds will surely be rewarded.\n\nThis is part of our Travel in Korea series.  We're making a series of videos showcasing Korean culture...","actions":[{"name":"Watch on Frequency","link":"http://www.frequency.com/video/korean-street-food/159805993/-/5-15615"}],"properties":{},"source":"http://www.youtube.com/v/J2dr5AylU-w&autoplay=1&hl=en&fs=1"}

        "description": "Shawn Cornally teaches and learns in eastern Iowa where he is primarily concerned with conducting action research in different models of the secondary schooling experience with specific concern towards producing generative and joyful students. He is currently conducting several experiments in this area including: running a school without walls, developing a software suite dedicated to assessment-for-learning, and managing a local media company\'s efforts to catalyze educational transformation. Shawn has also written for GOOD magazine and Edutopia.org, while blogging his success and failures at ThinkThankThunk.\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

        "description": "One our one year travel anniversary together, we decided to celebrate by having a meal at one of our favorite Indian Malaysian restaurants (Selvam) in Malacca, Malaysia by indulging in a Thali set consisting of rice, curries, dal, papad and pickles.\n\nThis 22 Ringgit ($7 USD) feast is one of the reasons we love traveling in Malaysia.  Although accommodations tend to be a bit more expensive than other SE Asian countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, the price, diversity and quality of food more than makes up for it. \n\nThe combination of Malay, Chinese, Indian and fusion options are enough to satisfy my every craving.  There have been days when I\'ve literally had Dim Sum (Chinese) for breakfast, Thali (Indian) for lunch and Nasi Goreng (Malaysian) for dinner.\n\nI may not have my own private bathroom\/shower (many budget accommodations in Malaysia offer shared facilities); however, I know for certain my stomach will be satisfied and that - to be perfectly honest - is more important than anything else ;)\n\nBeing back in UNESCO Heritage city Malacca, Malaysia on our one year travel anniversary was the perfect chance for us to eat Thali, an Indian meal made up of various dishes typically including rice, dal, vegetables, roti, papad, chutney and pickle.\n\nIt is lunchtime here in Melaka and today we\'re eating at the Selvam Banana Leaf restaurant, which is an Indian restaurant.  We\'ve been here several times during the week.  It is one of our favorite places so far.  It is really popular with locals, so we\'re going to show you what a Thali set meal looks like.\n\nWhen I was backpacking in India three and a half years ago I subsisted off of Thali, so I\'m thrilled to be having the opportunity to eat it again here in Malacca, Malaysia.\n\nThali is an Indian meal that consists of various kinds of dishes.  It can be served on a platter or - in this case- we\'re having it on a banana leaf if you take a look at it down here.  It comes with different vegetables, curries and rice.\n\nTypically you would eat this using your hand; however, someone has to hold the camera, so I\'m going to be using cutlery and Sam will demonstrate how it is done the proper way.\n\nAlright boy, dig in.  Get them fingers dirty.  You mix it around here.  There we go.  That\'s awesome stuff.\n\nSam and I ordered two different Thali sets.  He is having the vegetarian one and I am having the chicken but the only difference is that I get a little plate with a chicken curry on the side.  Everything else we got was the same.  We have the same dhal, the same rice and the same chips.  Take a bite of that chicken to see how it tastes.  I already have a chunk here.  It is very tender and you can tell it has been cooked slowly for a long time.  It is really good.  Is it spicy?  Of course, a bit of Indian spice in there.\n\nOne thing I absolutely love about Thali is the concept of the bottomless refills.  You eat until you\'re fully satisfied.  That means if you go through your rice - and you finished your rice and you want more - you call them over and they load you up.  It is perfect for a hungry boy.\n\nOur Thali lunch came to 22 Ringgit which is roughly $7 USD and that included three drinks, two different Thali sets (including a chicken and a vegetarian) and a roti pisang banana flat bread for dessert.\n\nhttp:\/\/nomadicsamuel.com\/video-blog\/thali-lunch-set-malaysia ‎\n\nSebagai kembali UNESCO Warisan bandar Melaka, Malaysia pada ulang tahun perjalanan satu tahun kita telah peluang yang sempurna untuk kita makan Thali, makan India terdiri daripada pelbagai hidangan biasanya termasuk beras, dal, sayur-sayuran, roti, papad, chutney dan jeruk. \n\nIa adalah waktu makan tengahari di sini di Melaka dan hari ini kita makan di restoran Selvam pelepah pisang, yang merupakan sebuah restoran India.

With your involvement, The Sunday Assembly will make the world a better place\nWe won\'t won\'t tell you how to live, but will try to help you do it as well as you can\nAnd remember point 1... The Sunday Assembly is a celebration of the one life we know we have\nWhat should you expect from a Sunday Assembly event?\n\nJust by being with us you should be energised, vitalised, restored, repaired, refreshed and recharged. No matter what the subject of the Assembly, it will solace worries, provoke kindness and inject a touch of transcendence into the everyday.\n\nBut life can be tough... It is. Sometimes bad things happen to good people, we have moments of weakness or life just isn\'t fair. We want The Sunday Assembly to be a house of love and compassion, where, no matter what your situation, you are welcomed, accepted and loved.\n\nMost of all, have fun, be nice and join in.\n\n[[ Sunday Assembly is not an Atheist Church of Satanic Illuminati Devil worship, it\'s open to everyone however it is Godless~ ]] \n\nPushkaCom YouTube Video - http:\/\/YouTube.com\/PushkaCom\nThe Loar Mandolin LM-520-VS F style with pick-up added \nCanon 7D DSLR Camera with 24-105 IS L Lens\nZOOM H4N microphone Gun Metal Grey Red Head wind shield\nAdobe Premier Pro, Photoshop, After Effects",

It will move to a more permanent location soon.\n\n\"We are in discussion with a big mall in the centre of Stockholm. We aim to cooperate with them for the first ATM deployment,\" said Frank Schuil, CEO and co-founder of Safello. He added:\n\nWhen the company originally described their ATM, Stockholm mall Gallarian was cited as a target. Safello will be operating the ATM, which will be owned by 19-year-old bitcoin entrepreneur Ludvig Oberg, an angel investor in the company. Oberg and Safello will share revenue from the machine.\n\nSchuil says the financial authority in Sweden sees bitcoin as a \"high-risk event\", requesting additional KYC (Know Your Customer) \n\nManufactured by Lamassu, the bitcoin ATM cost $5,000 to build (this includes the Google Nexus tablet used for its display). \n\nSafello is moving quickly to market bitcoin. The company was founded in July, and its online trading site only went live back in August. It began promoting its plans for an ATM in mid-November.\n\nSo far, ATMs have seen great success: bringing bitcoin into the public arena in a way that wasn\'t possible before. Canada\'s first ATM, developed by US-based firm Robocoin, took over $1m in its first month of operation in a Vancouver coffee shop.  europe world\'s first Bitcoin ATM.\n\nOn its 29th day of operation at the Waves Coffee House in Vancouver B.C., Robocoin\'s Bitcoin ATM exceeded $1,000,000 CAD in volume from 1,576 transactions.\n\nOperated by Las Vegas-based Robocoin and Vancouver-based Bitcoiniacs, the ATM scans your palm and allows you to exchange cash for Bitcoin, or do the reverse. Customers can make up to $3,000 worth of Bitcoin exchanges per day.

Bitcoins exist only online, can be transferred right away and are not controlled by a central authority like the Federal Reserve.\n\nHere in Seattle, a Seattle grilled cheese foodtruck is now accepting Bitcoin.

It will move to a more permanent location soon.\n\n\"We are in discussion with a big mall in the centre of Stockholm. We aim to cooperate with them for the first ATM deployment,\" said Frank Schuil, CEO and co-founder of Safello. He added:\n\nWhen the company originally described their ATM, Stockholm mall Gallarian was cited as a target. Safello will be operating the ATM, which will be owned by 19-year-old bitcoin entrepreneur Ludvig Oberg, an angel investor in the company. Oberg and Safello will share revenue from the machine.\n\nSchuil says the financial authority in Sweden sees bitcoin as a \"high-risk event\", requesting additional KYC (Know Your Customer) \n\nManufactured by Lamassu, the bitcoin ATM cost $5,000 to build (this includes the Google Nexus tablet used for its display). \n\nSafello is moving quickly to market bitcoin. The company was founded in July, and its online trading site only went live back in August. It began promoting its plans for an ATM in mid-November.\n\nSo far, ATMs have seen great success: bringing bitcoin into the public arena in a way that wasn't possible before. Canada's first ATM, developed by US-based firm Robocoin, took over $1m in its first month of operation in a Vancouver coffee shop.  europe world's first Bitcoin ATM.\n\nOn its 29th day of operation at the Waves Coffee House in Vancouver B.C., Robocoin's Bitcoin ATM exceeded $1,000,000 CAD in volume from 1,576 transactions.\n\nOperated by Las Vegas-based Robocoin and Vancouver-based Bitcoiniacs, the ATM scans your palm and allows you to exchange cash for Bitcoin, or do the reverse. Customers can make up to $3,000 worth of Bitcoin exchanges per day.

        "description": "Porn star extraordinaire, James Deen, joins Media Mayhem for an hour long talk about his adult career, mainstream success, and sex tape with Farrah Abraham. Showing the strength of his wit, charisma and humor, James Deen gives it to us straight about the marketing of sex to the masses and how he always knew what he wanted to be when he grew up.\nWe also talk about Measure B, and the law requiring porn shot in LA to feature condoms and ban kissing. Hold on tight, it\'s a fun ride.\n\nGUEST BIO:\nJames Deen knew at an early age he was destined to have sex with girls on camera, so as soon as he turned 18, the Pasadena, California native set out to make the dream a reality. Without any contacts and unsure of how to approach studios, Deen began attending parties in Hollywood hoping to meet anyone affiliated with the industry. His perseverance paid off, and Deen eventually made the connections he needed to start his illustrious adult film career.\nThough peers warned Deen his skinny body type and boyish looks went against the porn norm, it actually helped him carve out a niche within the industry. Over 3,000 scenes later and Deen is now considered the top male porn star. He is the youngest ever to earn Male Performer of the Year honors at the AVN, XBIZ, and XRCO awards shows. Whether filming hardcore BDSM or straight gonzo and feature adult films, Deen is always the most captivating male on screen, and his honest passion for all kinds of sex, both on and off camera, is displayed in the array of movies to his credit.\nDeen\'s accomplishments extend beyond the adult industry, as mainstream reporters chronicle his popularity among the most unlikely of porn fans -- young women. Popular female-oriented website Jezebel.com often reports on Deen\'s large female fan-base, calling him the \"permanent crush of all straight ladydom.\" Deen was noted as one of the top 100 Jews in Heeb magazine in 2009 and has also been featured on CNBC\'s special \"Porn: Business of Pleasure,\" ABC\'s \"Nightline,\" Good Magazine, The Goodmen Project, GQ Magazine, Rolling Stone, E! Entertainment, TMZ, and more. In 2012, Hollywood screenwriter Bret Easton Ellis and director Paul Schrader cast Deen opposite Lindsay Lohan in the feature film \"The Canyons.\"\nWith demand for James Deen at an all-time high, the enterprising star launched JamesDeenStore.com in December 2012. The online store is a one-stop-shop for all things Deen. In addition to featuring his movies and adult novelty line from Doc Johnson, the store stocks an eclectic array of items Deen designed and\/or loves and relates to.

Showing the strength of his wit, charisma and humor, James Deen gives it to us straight about the marketing of sex to the masses and how he always knew what he wanted to be when he grew up.\nWe also talk about Measure B, and the law requiring porn shot in LA to feature condoms and ban kissing. Hold on tight, it's a fun ride.\n\nGUEST BIO:\nJames Deen knew at an early age he was destined to have sex with girls on camera, so as soon as he turned 18, the Pasadena, California native set out to make the dream a reality. Without any contacts and unsure of how to approach studios, Deen began attending parties in Hollywood hoping to meet anyone affiliated with the industry. His perseverance paid off, and Deen eventually made the connections he needed to start his illustrious adult film career.\nThough peers warned Deen his skinny body type and boyish looks went against the porn norm, it actually helped him carve out a niche within the industry. Over 3,000 scenes later and Deen is now considered the top male porn star. He is the youngest ever to earn Male Performer of the Year honors at the AVN, XBIZ, and XRCO awards shows. Whether filming hardcore BDSM or straight gonzo and feature adult films, Deen is always the most captivating male on screen, and his honest passion for all kinds of sex, both on and off camera, is displayed in the array of movies to his credit.\nDeen's accomplishments extend beyond the adult industry, as mainstream reporters chronicle his popularity among the most unlikely of porn fans -- young women. Popular female-oriented website Jezebel.com often reports on Deen's large female fan-base, calling him the \"permanent crush of all straight ladydom.\" Deen was noted as one of the top 100 Jews in Heeb magazine in 2009 and has also been featured on CNBC's special \"Porn: Business of Pleasure,\" ABC's \"Nightline,\" Good Magazine, The Goodmen Project, GQ Magazine, Rolling Stone, E! Entertainment, TMZ, and more. In 2012, Hollywood screenwriter Bret Easton Ellis and director Paul Schrader cast Deen opposite Lindsay Lohan in the feature film \"The Canyons.\"\nWith demand for James Deen at an all-time high, the enterprising star launched JamesDeenStore.com in December 2012. The online store is a one-stop-shop for all things Deen. In addition to featuring his movies and adult novelty line from Doc Johnson, the store stocks an eclectic array of items Deen designed and/or loves and relates to. Whether its apparel he wears, books he reads, or the sex toys of some his favorite female porn stars, every item on the site carries the James Deen stamp of approval.\n\nADD'L LINKS:\nhttp://jamesdeen.com/  (nsfw!)\nhttps://twitter.com/JamesDeen\nhttp://www.jamesdeenblog.com/\nMedia Mayhem full episodes:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1mFYCoOPxg&list=PLC937B599FD2B8241\nMedia Mayhem shorts playlist:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xog5YMLFQmY&list=PL261CA9306E39D2DB&index=1\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thelip.tv\n\nEPISODE BREAKDOWN:\n00:01 Coming up on Media Mayhem.\n01:18 Welcoming James Deen to Media Mayhem.\n02:12 \"How did you get started in adult films?\"\n07:10 Not your typical male porn star.\n09:30 Raising his profile and setting himself apart.\n14:00 Shooting scenes with customers through the website.\n16:16 Is porn reflecting or directing sex in society?\n21:04 Why don't you work with men?\n22:30 The job description for a male porn star.\n24:54 The Farrah Abraham film and crossed marketing signals.\n35:35 Any interest in reality tv?\n36:01 HPV and the industry.\n39:39 Breaking into the mainstream media and working on The Canyons with Paul Schraeder, Bret Easton Ellis, and Lindsay Lohan.\n48:34 The measure B controversy over condoms in porn.\n50:51 Everyone's dirty little secret.","actions":[{"name":"Watch on Frequency","link":"http://www.frequency.com/video/sex-porn-last-word-on-farrah-abraham/100128410/-/5-15615"}],"properties":{},"source":"http://www.youtube.com/v/89EZuznHYN4&autoplay=1&hl=en&fs=1"}
