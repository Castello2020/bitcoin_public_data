	&lt;a href="http://dailydot.com/tags/bitcoin"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;just took a big step toward the mainstream, but whether that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing for the popular digital currency is becoming an increasingly contentious debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Influential financial regulators in New York just&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/bitcoin-new-york-regulations/"&gt;unveiled a formal proposal&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for what they&amp;rsquo;re calling a BitLicense, which is essentially a set of regulations virtual currency companies will have to adhere to if they want to do any kind of business in the state.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the stated goals of the regulations is to protect consumers, but many within the Bitcoin community are up in arms about the proposal. It&amp;rsquo;s not that they want to leave the door open for scammers. Rather, at the core idea of Bitcoin for them, is the belief that technology can regulate a currency in a way that&amp;rsquo;s far more pure and protective to users than any government agency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This contrast between early Bitcoin adopters and regulators is especially apparent in the cybersecurity section of the BitLicense proposal, which is among the most-lengthy of the proposal&amp;rsquo;s 21 sections. It includes three pages of what, to a non-Bitcoin expert at least, may seem like rigorous security protocols to which businesses must adhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Benjamin Lawsky, the superintendent of financial services at the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS), introduced the proposed regulations Thursday in a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2aycxs/hi_this_is_ben_lawsky_at_nydfs_here_are_the/"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to the Bitcoin forum on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/reddit/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. Lawsky wrote that the recent&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/mtgox-liquidation/"&gt;massive collapse&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/mtgox/"&gt;Mt. Gox&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;made &amp;ldquo;very clear&amp;rdquo; the need for cyber security requirements for Bitcoin companies. Mt. Gox, the former largest Bitcoin and a sort of symbol of Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s rise, crumbled earlier this year under the weight of security breaches, both&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/mtgox-shut-down-bitcoin-hack/"&gt;virtual&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/mt-gox-mark-karpeles-bitcoin-security-interview/"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To hopefully prevent such problems in New York Bitcoin exchanges and other services, Lawsky&amp;rsquo;s proposal would require virtual currency companies to undergo quarterly vulnerability assessments, as well as a thorough annual audit that includes penetration testing and a source code review by a third party. In addition, companies would be required to appoint a chief information security officer to oversee all these processes and prepare a yearly report &amp;ldquo;identifying relevant cyber risks.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On Reddit, Lawsky described these as &amp;ldquo;common sense rules of the road&amp;rdquo; that are &amp;ldquo;vital to the long-term future of the virtual currency industry, as well as the safety and soundness of customer assets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bitcoin security researcher Kristov Atlas wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite so confident about the proposed cybersecurity regulations, which he described as &amp;ldquo;sufficiently vague that they serve no practical purpose.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Requiring BitLicensed exchanges to employ basic security practices is like the mid-west requiring wheat farmers to purchase equipment for grain harvesting,&amp;rdquo; Kristov told the Daily Dot in an email. &amp;ldquo;I doubt very much that Mt. Gox would have been unable to comply with the letter of this law despite their obviously inadequate security practices.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kristov even suggested regulators deserve some of the blame for Mt. Gox. His argument is that if U.S. regulators allowed a manageable path for would-be Bitcoin exchanges, consumers would have had far more alternatives to Gox, which had its share of security problems even before the mega-hack that let hundreds of millions of dollars worth of customers&amp;rsquo; funds disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Displaying some of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/bitcoin-battle-future-libertarian-lost/"&gt;libertarian spirit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that is prevalent among early Bitcoin advocates, Kristov said that consumers &amp;ldquo;should not look to government regulators&amp;rdquo; for protection from would-be hackers or for financial protection in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;In this cutting edge area of technology, regulators will always be months behind innovators when it comes to securing customer funds,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Bitcoin is showing us an opportunity to grow out of a legacy financial system burdened with debt, abysmal risk analysis, and regulatory baggage, and all NY DFS has to offer is chaining Bitcoin to yesteryear&amp;#39;s way of doing finances.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kristov is not the only one who is unimpressed with Lawsky&amp;rsquo;s proposed cybersecurity regulations. Dan Kaminsky, a noted security researcher who said he doesn&amp;rsquo;t own any Bitcoin specifically so he can objectively assess potential security risks, read through the New York DFS proposal at our request. His feeling was that the cybersecurity requirements are somewhat hard to evaluate because the way they&amp;rsquo;re written is vague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Yearly [penetration] tests and external code audits of any internal code&amp;mdash;not bad,&amp;rdquo; he said in an email to the Daily Dot. &amp;ldquo;Everything else is &amp;lsquo;you figure it out and we&amp;#39;ll tell you if we don&amp;#39;t like it.&amp;rsquo; That may actually be how this legal realm operates.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The cybersecurity aspect of the proposal is far from the biggest point of contention. That would most certainly be privacy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A main reason early Bitcoin advocates got behind the currency was because it allows people to make long distance transactions without necessarily revealing their identities, though the degree of this anonymity has often been called into question.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Regardless, as a byproduct of its quasi-anonymous nature, Bitcoin became the go-to currency for people to use in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/bitcoin-crash-is-over/"&gt;illicit transactions&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;over the Internet. In attempt to snuff out Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s money-laundering capabilities, Lawsky&amp;rsquo;s proposed regulations require both operators and customers of Bitcoin businesses to provide significant identifying information, including names and addresses. That&amp;rsquo;s a big no-no in the Bitcoin world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Eric Voorhees, a thought-leader in the Bitcoin community, wrote in a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://moneyandstate.com/reflections-right-privacy-response-nydfs-bitcoin-proposal/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that Lawsky and company are trying to place Bitcoin users under &amp;ldquo;surveillance and control.&amp;rdquo; Also citing privacy concerns, Andreas Antonopoulos, another prominent Bitcoin security expert, expressed strong opposition to the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Privacy *is* consumer protection. If your &amp;ldquo;consumer protection&amp;rdquo; laws destroy privacy, you&amp;rsquo;re doing it wrong&lt;/p&gt;
	&amp;mdash; AndreasMAntonopoulos (@aantonop) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aantonop/statuses/489938414133706752"&gt;July 18, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite Kristov&amp;rsquo;s and others&amp;rsquo; misgivings, not everyone in the Bitcoin world is categorically opposed to regulators stepping in. Jerry Brito, a Bitcoin a research fellow at George Mason University&amp;rsquo;s Mercatus Center, wrote a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://techliberation.com/2014/07/17/new-yorks-financial-regulator-releases-a-draft-of-bitlicense-for-bitcoin-businesses-here-are-my-initial-thoughts/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;expressing some concerns, but he concluded that the proposed regulations &amp;ldquo;are on the right track.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps most notably, Bitcoin Investment Trust founder Barry Silbert, an extremely prominent Bitcoin entrepreneur with a stake in more than 30 virtual currency companies, expressed optimism about the New York DFS proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Kudos to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BenLawsky"&gt;@BenLawsky&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the DFS team on their thoughtful approach to bitcoin regulation. Proud to be a NYC company&lt;/p&gt;
	&amp;mdash; Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/barrysilbert/statuses/489786843853234176"&gt;July 17, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While entrepreneurs such as Silbert may benefit from attempting to find common ground with regulators, the feeling toward Lawsky&amp;rsquo;s proposal was largely negative among those who&amp;rsquo;ve been evangelizing Bitcoin for the past several years. And while one might expect Bitcoin advocates and regulators to clash on issues of privacy&amp;mdash;Kaminsky described it as a &amp;quot;civil war&amp;quot; over whether Bitcoin should remain semi-anonymous to use or become increasingly subject to government regulation&amp;mdash;the fact that these groups can&amp;rsquo;t even get on the same page about cybersecurity protections is a sign of deep division.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One thing that seems increasingly clear is that if Bitcoin does break through and achieve widespread mainstream adoption, it probably won&amp;rsquo;t be the same cryptocurrency&amp;rsquo;s anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"&gt;imagined&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lawsky&amp;#39;s office did not reply to our request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

</description><author>francisberkman@gmail.com (Fran  Berkman)</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2014 18:43:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.dailydot.com/business/bitcoin-bitlicense-regulation-civil-war/</guid><category>Business</category></item><item><title>New York unveils first-ever regulations on Bitcoin</title><link>http://www.dailydot.com/politics/bitcoin-new-york-regulations/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='//cdn0.dailydot.com/cache/8b/b6/8bb6bcec22115e42db38ac5a3d02c1aa.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services Ben Lawsky revealed a draft proposal on Thursday of regulations governing virtual currencies like &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/bitcoin"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;, making New York the first state in the country to grapple directly and openly with the issue. If passed, they would be the first regulations on virtual currencies anywhere in North America to carry the full weight of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The rules say that anyone conducting &amp;quot;virtual currency business activity&amp;quot; needs to have a BitLicense. That sort of activity includes things like buying and selling virtual currency as a customer business, storing virtual currency on behalf of others, or issuing a virtual currency. Merchants and customers who use virtual currencies exclusively for the transactions of goods and services, however, are exempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you want to start a virtual currency exchange or operate an online wallet service in the state of New York, you&amp;#39;re going to need a BitLicense, but if you just want to buy or sell a pizza with virtual money, it&amp;#39;s still possible to do so without first getting government approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Applying for a BitLicense involves disclosing personal and financial information for top company officials, undergoing a background check, paying a fee, and providing details about the structure and business goals of the company. If the regulators see any shady behavior, licenses can be either suspended or revoked entirely following a hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The proposal also introduces capital requirements, which are rules that nearly all financial institutions are required to follow requiring them to have a certain amount of cash (or other assets) on hand to ensure that a market downturn or bad business decision doesn&amp;#39;t suddenly sink the whole company and its customers&amp;rsquo; investments with it. The minimum amount of capital each virtual currency financial firm will be required to carry will be determined by regulators on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, all firms applying for BitLicenses will be required to comply with a set of policies&amp;mdash; including the preservation of all financial records for at least a decade, the submission of quarterly financial statements, the verification of customers&amp;rsquo; real-world identities, and the logging all user transactions&amp;mdash;which are designed to combat fraud and money laundering, as well as rules designed to ensure against data breaches and protect customers&amp;#39; privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Interesting, the rules appear to technically prohibit virtual currency firms from taking the revenue they earn from virtual currencies and then investing that money back into virtual currencies. Earnings can only be sunk into &amp;quot;high-quality, investment-grade permissible investments &amp;hellip; denominated in United States dollars.&amp;quot; This is a category that includes investment vehicles like money market funds, state or municipal bonds, and government securities. Notably absent from this list: virtual currencies like Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the most appealing aspects of virtual currencies like Bitcoin for many early adopters was that they could be traded in relatively anonymity. However, as regulators around the globe have worked to incorporate virtual currencies into the traditional financial system, there&amp;rsquo;s been a push for companies operating in the virtual currency space to collect the same type of information about their clients as is required for those operating with government-backed money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even in New York, under these regulations that people will still be able to transfer bitcoins back and forth without revealing their real names,. But if they want to utilize the services of an online wallet service, a degree of anonymity will have to sacrificed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The regulations cover ‟any type of digital unit that is used as a medium of exchange or a form of digitally stored value or that is incorporated into payment system technology,&amp;rdquo; but exclude digital units used solely for online gaming. In other words, the rules cover &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/dogecoin"&gt;Dogecoin&lt;/a&gt; but not &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/world-of-warcraft"&gt;&lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gold pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	‟In developing this regulatory framework, we have sought to strike an appropriate balance that helps protect consumers and root out illegal activity &amp;ndash; without stifling beneficial innovation,&amp;rdquo; Lawsky said in a Thursday morning &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2aycxs/hi_this_is_ben_lawsky_at_nydfs_here_are_the/"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/reddit"&gt;Reddit&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; r/bitcoin forum. ‟These regulations include provisions to help safeguard customer assets, protect against cyber hacking, and prevent the abuse of virtual currencies for illegal activity, such as money laundering.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lawsky has become a fixture on Reddit, hosting a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ygcil/as_requested_im_ben_lawsky_superintendent_of_the"&gt;well-regarded AMA&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on the social news site in February of this year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	‟We recognize that not everyone in the virtual currency community will be pleased about the prospect of a new regulatory framework,&amp;rdquo; he added. ‟Ultimately, though, we believe that setting up common sense rules of the road is vital to the long-term future of the virtual currency industry, as well as the safety and soundness of customer assets. (We think the situation at Mt. Gox, for example, made that very clear.) Moreover, given that states have specific regulatory responsibilities in this area, we also have a legal obligation to move forward on this framework.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Marco Santori, chair of the Regulatory Affairs Committee at the Bitcoin Foundation, told the Daily Dot that he appreciated the sincere effort Lawsky&amp;rsquo;s office is making to accommodate virtual currencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	‟First and foremost, New York is giving us an opportunity as an industry that the federal government never really gave us,&amp;rdquo; he explained. ‟They want to engage in a dialog, that&amp;rsquo;s not something that FinCen or the IRS [federal agencies that have also issued guidelines on virtual currencies] never did&amp;mdash;they just put out their opinions without first getting feedback. New York, on the other hand, seems very serious about about becoming a hub for virtual currencies.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, Santori did have some reservations about the actual substance of the regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He argued that these rules impose heavier regulations on businesses that work in the world of virtual currencies than are placed on firms dealing in traditional ones. Santori said the new rules would, for example, sweep in the producers of software allowing people to manage their own bitcoins, while not holding other people&amp;rsquo;s money&amp;mdash;which is typically considered the line separating regular businesses from the type of money transmitters subjected to harsher governmental scrutiny. ‟It would be like holding &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; responsible for the content of a manifesto I wrote in Microsoft Word.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The draft regulations will be formally published in the New York State Register on July 23, after which there will be a 45-day window when the public can comment. Regulators will then review the comments, make any changes they deem necessary, and then finalize them. Santori said that the Bitcoin Foundation will be actively engaging in that commenting period and beleives New York officials will be receptive to indsutry concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	New York isn&amp;rsquo;t the only state that&amp;rsquo;s working to incorporate virtual currencies into its formalized regulatory structure. Late last month, California Governor Jerry Brown &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/29/5854838/california-bill-legalizes-alternative-currencies-like-bitcoin-and-dogecoin"&gt;signed a bill&lt;/a&gt; legalizing the use of virtual currencies in the Golden State by striking down an older bill prohibiting the use of any currency in the state other than the U.S. dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; The story has been updated to include comments from the Bitcoin Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

	Before there were comical cryptocurrencies like &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/coinye/"&gt;Coinye&lt;/a&gt; (inspired by the rapper &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/kanye-west/"&gt;Kanye West&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/dogecoin/"&gt;Dogecoin&lt;/a&gt; (based off the popular Internet meme), and &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/bitcoin-porn-wankcoin/"&gt;Wankcoin&lt;/a&gt; (used online to buy porn), there was &lt;a href="http://buttcoin.org/"&gt;Buttcoin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	The fictional cryptocurrency started in 2011 as a blog to make fun of and satirize the &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/bitcoin/"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	Thanks to Buttcoin.org&amp;rsquo;s editorial freedom, founder borderpatrol and editor killhamster regularly published headlines like &amp;quot;The $22,484.00 Butterfly Labs Mini Rig bitcoin miner is a huge, broken, unstable piece of shit&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://buttcoin.org/this-is-the-most-brilliantly-useless-bitcoin-mining-rig-ever-created"&gt;This is quite possibly the most brilliantly useless bitcoin mining rig ever created&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; to a small but growing audience eager for a raw look at how complicated and preposterous Bitcoin can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	Last winter, all that changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	That&amp;rsquo;s when one of the popular targets of Buttcoin&amp;rsquo;s criticisms, Butterly Labs, purchased the site, shut out its founder, and rewrote stories to show the Bitcoin mining rig company in a positive light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	All of this was detailed in a post Friday from borderpatrol and verified by killhamster in an interview with the Daily Dot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	In December, borderpatrol was approached by a man named Jeff, who said he was a reader and owner of bitcoins. Jeff was eager to buy Buttcoin.org, a pitch borderpatrol was all too familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I have been asked to comment on articles in &lt;em&gt;PC World &lt;/em&gt;and speak at John Hopkins University about Bitcoins, and the site was somewhat popular, but no one ever put in any serious offers,&amp;rdquo; borderpatrol wrote on &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/2adssm/buttcoin_foundation_rocked_as_founder_exposed_to/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;ldquo;The site got steady traffic but everyone who knows about bitcoins, knows about computers. And everyone who knows about computers runs AdBlock. So the site made no money but was a fun little hobby of mine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	At the time, borderpatrol was tired of running the site and busy with school and work. He asked Jeff a lot more questions and discovered that he wanted to keep the site as &amp;quot;The Onion of Bitcoin,&amp;quot; with borderpatrol at the editorial helm for another six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	The two men signed a contract and borderpatrol transferred the domain over to Jeff&amp;rsquo;s daughter, who he claimed was in journalism and eager to learn about the online publishing world. Borderpatrol and killhamster wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say how much Jeff paid for Buttcoin but stated it was a five-figured amount and enough for a &amp;ldquo;really nice Christmas.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	For borderpatrol, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good New Year&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The day after the transfer occurred my admin account was locked out,&amp;rdquo; borderpatrol added. &amp;ldquo;[W]e noticed that our most popular article on the entire site, &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131109133622/http://buttcoin.org/butterfly-labs-mini-rig-is-a-huge-broken-unstable-piece-of-shit"&gt;The $22,484.00 Butterfly Labs Mini Rig bitcoin miner is a huge, broken, unstable piece of shit&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rsquo; had been edited and now read &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href="http://buttcoin.org/butterfly-labs-mini-rig-is-a-sexy-bitcoin-mining-machine"&gt;The Butterfly Labs Mini Rig is a sexy Bitcoin mining machine&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	Another two Butterfly Labs-related stories on Buttcoin were also edited. One of the stories was about Butterfly Labs, about it &lt;a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=247310.0"&gt;faking CE certification&lt;/a&gt; for its mining rigs and another discussing a &lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;article where a reporter tried out a rig and was unimpressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	Each of these three stories were some of the most popular on Buttcoin and would turn up high in Google when &amp;ldquo;Butterfly Labs&amp;rdquo; was searched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It was obvious to me that the purpose of purchasing the site was to simply remove the negative articles that were destroying their search traffic and making them look bad,&amp;rdquo; borderpatrol said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	Butterfly Labs has been dogged by controversy since it launched in 2011. First came a series of lawsuits related to &lt;a href="https://coinreport.net/class-action-filed-butterfly-labs/"&gt;mining rigs not being&lt;/a&gt; delivered to customers on time. The failure to deliver rigs on time is a big deal because the computing power needed to mine bitcoins grows increasingly difficult as each day passes. In June, all of this drama earned Butterfly Labs the title of &amp;ldquo;Bitcoin&amp;#39;s Most Controversial Startup&amp;rdquo; on &lt;a href="http://www.vocativ.com/tech/bitcoin/butterfly-labs-bitcoins-innovative-controversial-startup/"&gt;Vocativ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	Jeff (or whoever mans the Buttcoin contact email) did not immediately respond to our request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	Borderpatrol is still locked out of the site, while killhamster continues to publish on Buttcoin regularly. Jeff&amp;rsquo;s daughter never materialized, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Nobody has touched any of my articles and I pretty much have free reign over the site and Twitter, though I&amp;#39;ve lost my administrator privileges in the site&amp;#39;s backend,&amp;rdquo; killhamster said. &amp;ldquo;Anyway, we&amp;#39;ve had quite a laugh over this. Lots of &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/communities/reddit/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; Bitcoiners are trying to frame this as us getting scammed, but we made a pile of money off of what was otherwise an unprofitable joke website. How exactly did we get scammed?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

And if there’s one group that’s almost always willing to accept other people’s money as frictionlessly as possible it’s politicians. While a number of politicians from around the world have embraced Bitcoin, none have done it as wholeheartedly as &lt;a data-cke-saved-href="http://sundinmathias.blogspot.se/2014/07/the-worlds-first-political-bitcoin.html" href="http://sundinmathias.blogspot.se/2014/07/the-worlds-first-political-bitcoin.html"&gt;Mathias Sundin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sundin is running as a "liberal centre-right party" Folkpartiet party candidate for a seat in Parliament representing the southern Swedish county of Östergötland. But if you want to toss him a few kronor, you’re out of luck: Sundin is only accepting Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‟The world is getting connected in an unprecedented way,” Sundin wrote in an email to the Daily Dot. “Bitcoin is a symbol of this development, and could also play a huge part in changing how the world works. To promote the spreading of Bitcoin and increase the awareness of how the world is getting connected and the new political challenges this brings I have decided to only accept Bitcoin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 36-year-old deputy mayor of Norrkoping, who has previously served in parliament, insists that one of his major goals with the move is to show politicians and regulators, both in Sweden and around the world, that Bitcoin isn’t something to be feared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‟At first, I only saw the negative headlines about Bitcoin and thought it was some sort of unserious speculation bubble,” he explained. ‟Then I read up on it and understood that it has the potential to change the world. And when I realized I could order pizza and pay in Bitcoin, then I was all for it!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opinions on digital currency by Swedish authorities have been mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Sweden’s central bank &lt;a data-cke-saved-href="http://www.riksbank.se/Documents/Rapporter/Riksbanksstudie/2013/rap_riksbanksstudie_The_Swedish_retailpayment_market_130605_eng.pdf" href="http://www.riksbank.se/Documents/Rapporter/Riksbanksstudie/2013/rap_riksbanksstudie_The_Swedish_retailpayment_market_130605_eng.pdf"&gt;issued a warning&lt;/a&gt; about the risks associated with virtual currencies and stated that they are ‟not to be regarded as alternatives to national currencies." Yet, a few months later, the same body &lt;a data-cke-saved-href="http://www.riksbank.se/Documents/Rapporter/Ekonomiska_kommentarer/2014/rap_ek_kom_nr02_140617_eng.pdf" href="http://www.riksbank.se/Documents/Rapporter/Ekonomiska_kommentarer/2014/rap_ek_kom_nr02_140617_eng.pdf"&gt;issued a report&lt;/a&gt; acknowledging the effect of virtual currencies was "essentially positive" for the Swedish economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While virtual currencies are relatively easy to transfer from one party to another, they also allow those parties to transact without necessarily revealing their identities. When it comes to politics, this can be tricky—effectively anonymous political donations aren’t exactly the hallmark of a healthy, transparent political system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sundin isn’t requiring that his Bitcoin donors reveal their identities, which is legal under Swedish campaign finance law as long as each donor gives less than 4.7 bitcoins, or approximately 20,000 Swedish Krona (~$3,000 U.S.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sundin said that, as far as he is aware, he is the first political candidate in Sweden to even accept Bitcoin donations, let alone accept them exclusively. In the United States, a pair of Texas politicians—Rep. &lt;a data-cke-saved-href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/bitcoin-bill-money-congress-steve-stockman/" href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/bitcoin-bill-money-congress-steve-stockman/"&gt;Steve Stockman&lt;/a&gt; and state Attorney General Greg Abbott—made waves when they &lt;a data-cke-saved-href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/steve-stockman-texas-bitcoin/" href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/steve-stockman-texas-bitcoin/"&gt;started accepting Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;. (No major political candidate, even Sundin himself, has accepted &lt;a data-cke-saved-href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/dogecoin" href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/dogecoin"&gt;Dogecoin&lt;/a&gt; donations.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sundin believes that the majority of the Bitcoin donations he has received so far have come from outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‟I hope that Bitcoin community around the world will take this chance to show how strong it is,” he noted. ‟If I get well funded, other candidates in other countries will do the same, which could be very important in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Illustration by Jason Reed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>asankin@dailydot.com (Aaron Sankin)</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2014 13:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.dailydot.com/politics/swedish-politician-bitcoin-donation/</guid><category>Politics</category></item><item><title>Bitcoin may be the next weapon in ISIS extremists' arsenal</title><link>http://www.dailydot.com/politics/isis-iraq-bitcoin-terrorism/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='//cdn0.dailydot.com/cache/b7/15/b7151062ed07dd977dcbfeb0c828cfcc.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	A blogger is teaching jihadi groups, and specifically members of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/isis/"&gt;ISIS&lt;/a&gt;), how to organize and finance terrorism through &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/bitcoin/"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://news.sky.com/story/1296508/global-jihad-could-be-funded-with-bitcoin"&gt;Sky News&lt;/a&gt; reports. A recent blog post highlights how well the cryptocurrency can serve the needs of ISIS militants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ISIS, which now calls itself the Islamic Caliphate, has captured a large swath of territory in northern Syria and Iraq in recent months, as it attempts to establish a strict Islamist state in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The article, which can be &lt;a href="https://alkhilafaharidat.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/btcedit-21.pdf"&gt;read as a PDF here&lt;/a&gt;, was reportedly sent to Sky News from sources within ISIS/Islamic Caliphate. It comes from a &amp;ldquo;new online magazine&amp;rdquo; and showcases tools like &lt;a href="https://darkwallet.unsystem.net/"&gt;Dark Wallet&lt;/a&gt; that have been marketed as &amp;ldquo;money laundering tools&amp;rdquo; by developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/silk-road/"&gt;Silk Road&lt;/a&gt; is also mentioned as &amp;ldquo;an online black market that could have potentially be used for anything from purchasing weapons to donating to &amp;nbsp;mujahideen, though most kufar [a derogatory term for non-Muslims] used it to intoxicate themselves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This allows our brothers stuck outside of the ardh Dawlatul-Islam to avoid government taxes along with secretly fund the mujahideen with no legal danger upon them,&amp;rdquo; reads Amreeki Witness&amp;rsquo;s article. &amp;quot;This system has the potential to revive the lost sunnah [the ideal Muslim way of life, based on the teachings of Muhammed] of donating to the mujahideen, it is simple, easy, and we ask Allah to hasten it&amp;rsquo;s [&lt;em&gt;sic&lt;/em&gt;] usage for us.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Psuedononymous Bitcoin usage by criminals and terrorists has long been a source of criticism for the digital currency. Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s defenders, however, say that articles like these spread needless &amp;ldquo;fear, uncertainty, and doubt&amp;rdquo; and &lt;a href="http://libertyblitzkrieg.com/2014/07/07/attempt-to-tie-bitcoin-to-isis-is-proof-the-establishment-is-scared-to-death/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;question&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; its authenticity&amp;mdash;which, it has to be noted, has not been verified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Although the NSA&amp;rsquo;s dragnet was so broad as to invite a torrent of derision, several journalists tracking online jihadi activity nodded in agreement. Noted journalist &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/intelwire"&gt;&lt;u&gt;J.M.

	The man they call &amp;ldquo;Bitcoin Jesus&amp;rdquo; is about to bestow a cryptocurrency blessing on the man the feds are calling &amp;ldquo;Dread Pirate Roberts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/bitcoin/"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;entrepreneur Roger Ver is poised to make what&amp;rsquo;s shaping up to be at least a six-figure contribution to the legal defense fund of Ross Ulbricht, 30, who stands&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-digital-landlord-bitcoin/"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of running the online drug empire&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/silk-road/"&gt;Silk Road&lt;/a&gt;. Here&amp;rsquo;s the tweet that started it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		I&amp;rsquo;ll give $10 to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Free_Ross"&gt;@Free_Ross&lt;/a&gt; for each RT. If guilty, he&amp;rsquo;s a hero. If innocent, he needs help. &lt;a href="http://t.co/XwhqrN06UT"&gt;http://t.co/XwhqrN06UT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://t.co/Oau4dkFvdV"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Oau4dkFvdV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&amp;mdash; Roger Ver (@rogerkver) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rogerkver/statuses/485478065959493632"&gt;July 5, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Posted on Saturday, the tweet surpassed 16,000 retweets on Sunday, putting Ver on the hook for more than $160,000. Clearly achieving the type of viral effect for which he was aiming, we reached out to Ver to ask why he&amp;rsquo;s willing to give so much money to Ulbricht&amp;rsquo;s cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ver, a 35-year-old Bitcoin entrepreneur who gained his sanctified nickname from his willingness to invest in Bitcoin startups, said he decided to make the contribution as a sort of investment in his Libertarian ideals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I think that each individual owns their own body and has the absolute right to put whatever they want into it,&amp;rdquo; Ver told the Daily Dot in an email. &amp;ldquo;The police, judges, and jail guards, who lock people in cages for ingesting substances without the permission of strangers, are the ones committing evil and need to stop.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;big&gt;Clashing with the law, Libertarian style&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ulbricht has been in federal custody since Oct. 1, when the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/crime/silk-road-dread-pirate-roberts-arrested-shut-down/"&gt;FBI arrested him&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in a San Francisco public library on the same day the agency seized Silk Road&amp;rsquo;s Web domain. The spirit of technologically-facilitated libertarianism that Ver extols seems to be something he and Ulbricht have in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Just as slavery has been abolished most everywhere, I believe violence, coercion and all forms of force by one person over another can come to an end,&amp;rdquo; Ulbricht wrote on his LinkedIn&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rossulbricht"&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;ldquo;To that end, I am creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Libertarian thought was also an extremely&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/silk-road-dread-pirate-roberts-libertarian-mises-institute/"&gt;important facet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the Silk Road community, which hung its collective hat on the idea that their way of drug selling and buying involved far less violence than more traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;If Ross Ulbricht is [Dread Pirate Roberts] and helped facilitate the these voluntary interactions,&amp;rdquo; Ver said, &amp;ldquo;he is a hero for helping provide the technology that allowed peaceful people to ignore the violent threats from strangers calling themselves politicians and law enforcement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, investigators have also floated allegations that Ulbricht was involved in several murder-for-hire plots. Those alleged plots are not thought to have resulted in any deaths, and the federal prosecutors currently working on the case did not bring any formal charges against Ulbricht in regards to the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ver himself is no stranger to the long arm of federal law. He was&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/press-releases/2002/verPlea.htm"&gt;sentenced&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to 10 months in prison in 2002 for selling explosives on eBay. As Ver recently explained it to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-15/-bitcoin-jesus-calls-rich-to-tax-free-tropical-paradise.html"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, the product was a &amp;ldquo;firecracker to scare birds away from cornfields.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I can tell you from first-hand experience much more than half of the people at the facility I was imprisoned and tortured at were there for victimless crimes,&amp;rdquo; Ver wrote in his email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Disenchanted by the U.S. government, Ver renounced his citizenship and moved to &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/tokyo/"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; in 2006 after his probation period ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;big&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Ulbricht needs money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ulbricht&amp;rsquo;s trial is not scheduled to begin until November, but his lawyer Joshua Dratel has been&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/crime/ross-ulbricht-lawyer-silk-road-bitcoin-irs/"&gt;jockeying&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;with federal prosecutors for the past several months. In short, there has never been an illicit website quite as successful as Silk Road, and there has never been a case quite like Ulbricht&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This is a complicated, precedent-setting case and will take a mountain of work,&amp;rdquo; Lyn Ulbricht, Ross Ulbricht&amp;rsquo;s mother, told the Daily Dot in an email. &amp;ldquo;Our lawyers are dedicating an enormous amount of labor and time, for little compensation so far.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lyn Ulbricht has become the driving force behind the effort to raise money for her son&amp;rsquo;s defense. The campaign was&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/ross-ulbricht-legal-defense-mother/"&gt;slow to pick up steam&lt;/a&gt;, but Ulbricht has been successful of late by appealing to Internet freedom activists and libertarians at gatherings such as last month&amp;rsquo;s Porcupine Freedom Festival or &amp;ldquo;Porcfest.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fb-root"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Basically, Ulbricht&amp;rsquo;s argument is that since her son&amp;rsquo;s case is legal &amp;ldquo;uncharted territory,&amp;rdquo; everyone who uses the Internet has something at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This is about much more than one man or one website,&amp;rdquo; Ulbricht said. &amp;ldquo;This case will set precedent for 21st century law as it regards the Internet, digital currency, and more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The strategy seems to be paying off. Ulbricht said an anonymous donor at Porcfest contributed about $17,000 to her son&amp;rsquo;s defense fund, which was the largest contribution she has received to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ver has not yet made his mega-donation. To this point, it&amp;rsquo;s all promises, and apparently not something he pre-planned with the Ulbricht defense fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I learned of the campaign on Twitter the same way as everyone else,&amp;rdquo; Lyn Ulbricht said. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;big&gt;Silk Road&amp;rsquo;s Bitcoin legacy&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On Silk Road, Bitcoin was the only way to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The site is said to have facilitated 1.2 million transactions in its two-and-a-half year run totaling 9.5 million bitcoins, which investigators say equaled $1.2 billion. At today&amp;rsquo;s conversion rate, it would be closer to $6 billion, but the value of Bitcoin was significantly less while Silk Road was in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Last month, the U.S. government&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/us-marshall-silk-road-bitcoin-auction/"&gt;auctioned off&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;nearly 30,000 bitcoins it allegedly seized during its digital raid of Silk Road. The government is still sitting on about 144,000 bitcoins worth more than $90 million that the FBI&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/crime/fbi-bitcoin-seized-28-million-silk-road-ulbricht/"&gt;said it obtained&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;from a hard drive belonging to Ross Ulbricht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, one of the Bitcoin community&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/us-marshall-silk-road-bitcoin-auction/"&gt;favorite sons&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and most fervent evangelists, 24-year-old entrepreneur Charlie Shrem, is also in legal hot water over alleged ties to Silk Road. Shrem is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/charlie-shrem-bitcoin-indictment/"&gt;facing 30 years&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in prison for supposedly helping to launder Silk Road bitcoins through his company BitInstant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite these alleged criminal connections, the value of Bitcoin has increased nearly sixfold to about $630 in the nine months since Silk Road fell. This growth has sparked a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/newegg-1800flowers-bitcoin/"&gt;wave of positive attention&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for the digital money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Bitcoin is here to stay,&amp;rdquo; Ver said. &amp;ldquo;Charlie&amp;rsquo;s case is just another example of people wearing costumes behaving in immoral ways that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be tolerated if done by people not wearing costumes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ver said he has been in contact with Lyn Ulbricht about transferring his contribution to the Free Ross campaign, and he expects it to happen within the next week. As you might have guessed, Ver says he won&amp;rsquo;t be wiring cash or cutting a check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine making the contribution in anything other than Bitcoin.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Update: &lt;/strong&gt;Soon after this story was published on Monday, Ver again tweeted about his contribution to Ulbricht&amp;rsquo;s defense campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Amazing support for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Free_Ross"&gt;@Free_Ross&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/DyCFsnDMpv"&gt;https://t.co/DyCFsnDMpv&lt;/a&gt; More retweets welcome, but the donation limit has been reached. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Silkroad?src=hash"&gt;#Silkroad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash"&gt;#Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&amp;mdash; Roger Ver (@rogerkver) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rogerkver/statuses/486087296098127872"&gt;July 7, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We reached out to Ver for more information. He said that he hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet decided what the exact amount of donation will be, but he expects his contribution will be near to the estimate given at the beginning of this article, which was $160,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It appears Ver also looking for ways to use his contribution to rally other donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I need some other information first, but I plan to leverage it into a whole lot more as well,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ver says he hopes to reveal further plans sometime next week.&lt;/p&gt;

	Pop music and money have always been closely intertwined, especially since the former, done right, can lead to the latter in massive quantities. From &amp;ldquo;Money&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;All About the Benjamins,&amp;rdquo; there&amp;#39;s a long tradition of making music that&amp;#39;s about, well, money, Benjamins, dollar dollar bills, Euros, Yen, ducats&amp;mdash;all kinds of currency. With the exception of weird fantasy epics and allegorical protest songs about capitalism, however, music about money tends to usually be about real forms of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There&amp;#39;s some new money in town, though, and it&amp;#39;s the hottest thing since Beanie Babies. For those of you who have been living under a rock, it&amp;#39;s called Bitcoin, and it has a lot of ardent fans who are convinced it&amp;#39;s the answer to many of our global economic woes. Some of these fans are so ardent, they&amp;#39;ve recorded music about Bitcoin, the same way, say, T.I. and Young Thug recently made a song &amp;quot;About the Money.&amp;quot; Is this music any good? I wanted to know, so I tracked down as much Bitcoin music as I could and listened to it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To understand the merits of various songs about Bitcoin, though, it&amp;#39;s probably important to understand a little bit about how Bitcoin works and why it inspires both so much devotion and so much mockery. Bitcoin is a digital cryptocurrency, which, at the time of this writing, &lt;a href="http://www.coindesk.com/"&gt;is trading&lt;/a&gt; for around $650 per Bitcoin, or BTC. There are a finite amount of Bitcoins out there, and new ones are generated through a process of &amp;ldquo;mining&amp;rdquo;: Essentially, computers compete to solve an extremely complicated mathematical puzzle and unlock the next &amp;ldquo;block,&amp;rdquo; which contains a record of recent transactions, a bunch of bitcoins, and a puzzle that launches the next block. Because of the way it&amp;#39;s designed, Bitcoin is anonymous (and therefore impossible to track), immune to duplicate transactions, and completely outside of any government regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Due to these qualities, it&amp;#39;s popular among people trading illicit goods (its main use for years was on the black market exchange Silk Road) and among people who don&amp;#39;t trust the government, particularly those who are convinced of an impending global economic collapse triggered by hyperinflantion due to the use of fiat currency (a.k.a. regular money that isn&amp;#39;t tied to an actual object, like gold). Due to &lt;em&gt;these &lt;/em&gt;qualities, Bitcoin also has a reputation of being an obsession of Libertarian message board nerds who have a complete misunderstanding of both economics and overall human society. It tends to get mocked due to the extreme volatility of Bitcoin&amp;#39;s real world value. Are these critiques warranted? You listen to these songs and tell me. To improve comprehension, here&amp;#39;s a short glossary of key terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satoshi Nakamoto&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp;The pseudonym of the anonymous figure who pioneered Bitcoin and coded the original algorithm, who is regarded by some (based on these songs at least), as a bit of a minor deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Block chain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: The chain of officially discovered blocks and, thus, the official record of all transactions. Occasionally, the block chain might split into different paths, causing a fork, which eventually must get resolved back into one official block chain to avoid duplicate transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

Gox</title><link>http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/800-bitcoin-recovered-mt-gox/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='//cdn0.dailydot.com/cache/03/c0/03c0d6191ea8de8044b0fdb38cd1a732.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	A &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/bitcoin/"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; user, who inexplicably threw $500,000 worth of the digital currency into the abyss last month, has managed to recover his funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	The story starts in early June, when &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/communities/reddit/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;user TheDJFC&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/273vi2/if_you_just_received_800_bitcoin_out_of_the_blue/"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;about how he &amp;ldquo;messed up big time.&amp;rdquo; Explaining the blunder as a copy-and-paste error, he mistakenly sent 800 bitcoins&amp;mdash;worth about $500,000&amp;mdash;to the &lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/address/113MmkyjjH6zS9VMvbwrhBNoMe6upzdvNC"&gt;wrong digital wallet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	The Bitcoin community on Reddit verified TheDJFC&amp;rsquo;s story and helped him determine that the address where he sent the Bitcoin belonged to &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/mt-gox/"&gt;Mt. Gox&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s not clear whether or not the Mt. Gox address was one that TheDJFC once controlled, but it was quite clear that the bitcoins were stuck there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	Though it was once the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world and something of a symbol of Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s rise, Mt. Gox &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/mtgox-shut-down-bitcoin-hack/"&gt;crashed in spectacular fashion&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in February, losing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its customers&amp;rsquo; bitcoins in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	On Bitcoin discussion boards, those who lost money in the crash are said to have been &amp;ldquo;goxxed,&amp;rdquo; a play on another popular term for something bad happening: &amp;ldquo;doxxed,&amp;rdquo; which means to reveal an anonymous online person&amp;rsquo;s identity by finding and posting personal details on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	TheDJFC didn&amp;rsquo;t actually &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; goxxed; he goxxed himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	But alas, we all make mistakes, and no one deserves to lose half a million due to a copy-and-paste error. It was with this spirit that the Bitcoin community on Reddit advised TheDJFC to hire a lawyer to reach out to the bankruptcy trustee that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/mt-gox-liquidate/"&gt;now in charge&lt;/a&gt; of Mt. Gox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	After taking those steps, TheDJFC was able to recover the bitcoins, according to a &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/29tdt3/remember_the_800_btc_fuckup_guy/cioc8f9?context=10000"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;he posted on a Reddit&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/29tdt3/remember_the_800_btc_fuckup_guy/"&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; started Friday, titled &amp;ldquo;Remember the 800 BTC fuckup guy?&amp;rdquo; TheDJFC has not responded to our request for more details on the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	The person who started Friday&amp;rsquo;s thread, Reddit user 1ruru, did so after noticing that the 800 bitcoins had moved from the Mt. Gox address earlier this week. At first it was unclear whether or not the bitcoins had been recovered, but TheDJFC&amp;rsquo;s eventual comments on the thread provided clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	To his credit, TheDJFC seemed to keep his composure throughout the ordeal and even managed to laugh at himself when it was all over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;From now on, I dub thee.. &amp;lsquo;The Ungoxxed man,&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; 1ruru &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/29tdt3/remember_the_800_btc_fuckup_guy/cioc0av"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to TheDJFC in Friday&amp;rsquo;s thread. His reply: &amp;ldquo;I will wear that badge with pride.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-d712fc06-f8bf-afb7-300c-86bf0914c428"&gt;Speaking at a banking conference in St. Petersburg on Wednesday, Georgy Luntovsky, first deputy chairman for the Bank of Russia, said the country will take a wait-and-see approach to regulating Bitcoin, Reuters &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/07/02/russia-cenbank-bitcoin-idINL6N0PD3K420140702"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. For now, Russians should feel free to explore the increasingly popular digital currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-d712fc06-f8bf-afb7-300c-86bf0914c428"&gt;&amp;ldquo;One shouldn&amp;#39;t reject these instruments,&amp;rdquo; Luntovsky said, &amp;ldquo;perhaps they really have a future.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-d712fc06-f8bf-afb7-300c-86bf0914c428"&gt;Earlier this year, the Russian bank released a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_158121/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; saying that using Bitcoin or any virtual currency would be &amp;ldquo;considered as a potential involvement&amp;rdquo; in &amp;ldquo;crime and financing of terrorism.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-d712fc06-f8bf-afb7-300c-86bf0914c428"&gt;Luntovsky reiterated that authorities still consider Bitcoin a highly dubious currency because of its connections to the &amp;ldquo;criminal world&amp;rdquo; in Russia. But for now, the government isn&amp;rsquo;t going to try to control Bitcoin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-d712fc06-f8bf-afb7-300c-86bf0914c428"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Perhaps after a certain time we will make a decision about some legislative regulation of this issue,&amp;rdquo; Luntovsky said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-d712fc06-f8bf-afb7-300c-86bf0914c428"&gt;In the U.S., Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/bitcoin-federa-reserve-yellen-regulate/"&gt;has said&lt;/a&gt; that banking authorities should not &amp;ldquo;supervise or regulate Bitcoin in any way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-d712fc06-f8bf-afb7-300c-86bf0914c428"&gt;Russia isn&amp;rsquo;t the only place to recently soften its stance on Bitcoin. On Saturday, California Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/bitcoin-lawful-money-california/"&gt;made Bitcoin &amp;ldquo;lawful money&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; in the state. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-0884697e-f794-c94b-3943-6c9d49c27490"&gt;The person who bought a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://dailydot.com/tags/bitcoin"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; fortune at a U.S. Marshal&amp;#39;s auction last week is Tim Draper, a venture capitalist who&amp;#39;s invested big in a burgeoning Bitcoin exchange called Vaurum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-0884697e-f794-c94b-3943-6c9d49c27490"&gt;The massive stash of nearly 30,000 bitcoins, which at today&amp;#39;s price of 648.83 is worth almost $20 million, was &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/silk-road-30000-bitcoin-us-marshals-auction/"&gt;seized&lt;/a&gt; in October as part of a sting on the online black market the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://dailydot.com/tags/silk-road"&gt;Silk Road&lt;/a&gt;. As with any big bust, the feds auctioned off the seized goods, though it was unprecedented for them to sell millions in a surging digital currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-0884697e-f794-c94b-3943-6c9d49c27490"&gt;The actual auction price is undisclosed, and Vaurum didn&amp;#39;t immediately respond to the Daily Dot request for commment. Several bitcoiners who &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/us-marshall-silk-road-bitcoin-auction/"&gt;placed&lt;/a&gt; failed bids previously said they&amp;#39;d offered between $400-500 per bitcoin for portions of the stash, implying that Draper&amp;#39;s final sale price for all the coins was possibly in the realm of $15 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-0884697e-f794-c94b-3943-6c9d49c27490"&gt;Draper announced the purchase in conjunction with Vaurum, which counts both him and his son Adam as early investors. CEO Avish Bhama said in a statement &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@vaurum/88f04a1d8598"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; to Medium that the company, which aims to provide Bitcoin services to major financial institutions like banks, hedge funds, and foreign exchanges, would use the huge pool of bitcoins to give the company a base to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

	Last night, &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/paypal/"&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt; froze $275,000 in donated funds belonging to &lt;a href="https://protonmail.ch/"&gt;ProtonMail&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/technology/protonmail-email-encryption-nsa-pgp-privacy/"&gt;easy email encryption&lt;/a&gt; service designed to make privacy mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A PayPal representative questioned the legality of encryption and wondered if the ProtonMail had government approval, a line of thought that has touched off a barrage of criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The freeze has since been lifted&amp;mdash;PayPal blamed the incident on a &amp;quot;technical problem&amp;quot;&amp;mdash;but ProtonMail is not accepting donations via PayPal until they are assured that nothing like this will happen again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Instead, supporters have donated over $3,100 in bitcoins in recent hours, pairing their money with messages like, &amp;ldquo;Keep up the awesome work and F*** Paypal.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1Q1nhq1NbxPYAbw1BppwKbCqg58ZqMb9A8?filter=2"&gt;ProtonMail&amp;rsquo;s Bitcoin address&lt;/a&gt; has seen over $13,000 in donations (over 21 bitcoins) in the last two weeks, a number that is only going to go up as news of this controversy spreads.&lt;/p&gt;

	Following in the digital footsteps of &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/overstock-bitcoin-sales-day-1/"&gt;Overstock.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/expedia-bitcoin-hotels/"&gt;Expedia&lt;/a&gt;, electronics retailer Newegg announced on Tuesday that customers can now pay using the popular cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Adopting Bitcoin as a payment method is another way we&amp;rsquo;re responding to our customers&amp;rsquo; diverse needs,&amp;rdquo; Newegg Chief Marketing Officer Soren Mills said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additionally, the Bitcoin wallet company Coinbase &lt;a href="http://blog.coinbase.com/post/90452241367/1-800-flowers-com-partners-with-coinbase-to-accept"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it has partnered with 1-800-FLOWERS to allow its online customers to pay with Bitcoin, beginning this fall. The partnership will extend to several other gift sites owned by 1-800-FLOWERS such as ThePopcornFactory.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On its website, Newegg &lt;a href="http://promotions.newegg.com/nepro/14-3540/index.html"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Bitcoin to customers as &amp;quot;a new option that gives people more power and control over their finances.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://cdn0.dailydot.com/uploaded/images/original/2014/7/1/Newegg_2014-07-01_at_10.32.16_AM.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Newegg Bitcoin" src="http://cdn0.dailydot.com/uploaded/images/original/2014/7/1/Newegg_2014-07-01_at_10.32.16_AM.png" style="width: 640px; height: 184px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Very soon the number of &lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/charts/total-bitcoins"&gt;bitcoins in existence&lt;/a&gt; will surpass 13 million, which means there&amp;rsquo;s nearly $9 billion worth of the cryptocurrency out there, burning a hole in users&amp;rsquo; digital wallets. Each time a new retailer begins accepting Bitcoin, there&amp;rsquo;s a small celebration on the forums where Bitcoin users gather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="Reddit Bitcoin" src="http://cdn0.dailydot.com/uploaded/images/original/2014/7/1/Reddit_2014-07-01_at_11.03.03_AM.png" style="width: 640px; height: 381px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It should come as no surprise that more vendors are looking to capitalize on the current wave of Bitcoin enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some other things you can currently do with Bitcoin: &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/bitcoin-road-trip-bush-bleish-family-charlie-shrem/"&gt;fund&lt;/a&gt; a family road trip, &lt;a href="http://vacation/"&gt;vacation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;at a nudist resort in Canada, &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/tuition-bitcon-kings-college/"&gt;pay tuition&lt;/a&gt; at a historical college, and &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/bitcoin-football-st-petersburg-bowl-ncaa/"&gt;buy&lt;/a&gt; tickets to an NCAA football bowl game called the &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/bitpay-bitcoin-bowl-ncaa-interview/"&gt;Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	The &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/bitcoin/"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; community is chomping at the bit to learn the results of an auction that the U.S. government is conducting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Through the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), the U.S. government just auctioned off nearly 30,000 bitcoins that it confiscated when the FBI &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/crime/silk-road-dread-pirate-roberts-arrested-shut-down/"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; the online drug empire &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/silk-road/"&gt;Silk Road&lt;/a&gt; last October. The auction took place during a 12-hour period ending at 6pm ET Friday. The Bitcoin trove was split up and sold in nine blocks of 3,000 bitcoins and one block of 2,656.5 bitcoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But what everyone wants to know is the value of the winning bids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some 45 prescreened registrants placed a total of 63 bids on the blocks, U.S. Marshals spokeswoman Lynzey Donahue told the Daily Dot in an email. Donahue declined to provide an answer as to whether the USMS would eventually disclose the winning bids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the Marshals do not disclose the information, another possibility is that the winners could reveal their bids. As of Monday evening, we&amp;rsquo;ve only heard from those who did not win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Announcement: The SecondMarket / Bitcoin Investment Trust bidding syndicate for the US Marshals bitcoin auction was outbid on all blocks&lt;/p&gt;
	&amp;mdash; Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/barrysilbert/statuses/483692873855299584"&gt;June 30, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Silbert was speaking on behalf of a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/barrysilbert/status/482951689381904384"&gt;syndicate of 42 bidders&lt;/a&gt; that bid under the banner of SecondMarket and Bitcoin Trust, companies Silbert owns. The syndicate was a way to participate for those who couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford the $200,000 deposit required by the USMS to bid in the auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Asked to discuss specifics about the bids placed by the syndicate, a spokesperson for SecondMarket told the Daily Dot that the company is &amp;ldquo;not disclosing that at this time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the SecondMarket syndicate, two Reddit users who appeared to be named Josh and Alex posted pictures said to be the emails they received, notifying them that they hadn&amp;rsquo;t won the auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://cdn0.dailydot.com/uploaded/images/original/2014/6/30/Alex.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn0.dailydot.com/uploaded/images/original/2014/6/30/Alex.png" style="width: 640px; height: 99px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://cdn0.dailydot.com/uploaded/images/original/2014/6/30/Josh.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn0.dailydot.com/uploaded/images/original/2014/6/30/Josh.png" style="width: 640px; height: 82px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the four blocks he bid on, Josh &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/29i457/i_lost_too_my_bid_was_45113_ama/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that he bid $451.13 per bitcoin. Alex &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/29hxs7/i_lost/cil3gtl"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; his bid was between $400 and $500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both of those bids are well under the Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s current market, which climbed about $40 to $640 Monday. The bids were also low compared to the $580-$600 price of Bitcoin Friday, the day participants placed their bids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://cdn0.dailydot.com/uploaded/images/original/2014/6/30/Bitcoin_06-30_at_5.54.49_PM.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn0.dailydot.com/uploaded/images/original/2014/6/30/Bitcoin_06-30_at_5.54.49_PM.png" style="width: 640px; height: 331px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;z&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s hard to know for sure how the results of the auction will affect the value of Bitcoin. The auction was unprecedented in that normally Bitcoin is normally sold in a manner that&amp;rsquo;s more similar to how a stock would be traded. In addition, it&amp;rsquo;s unprecedented for the U.S. government to sell Bitcoin to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The USMS initially &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/silk-road-30000-bitcoin-us-marshals-auction/"&gt;revealed its intention&lt;/a&gt; to sell the bitcoins earlier this month. To even take part in the auction, registrants had to put up a $200,000 deposit. Though the government didn&amp;rsquo;t publicly disclose the identities of the bidders, 15 of them &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/us-marshals-leak-silk-road-bitcoins-list/"&gt;leaked through an email&lt;/a&gt; mishap for which the USMS later apologized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even after lightening its load by 30,000 bitcoins, the U.S. government still possesses more than 144,000 bitcoins that it said it &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/crime/fbi-bitcoin-seized-28-million-silk-road-ulbricht/"&gt;obtained from a hard drive&lt;/a&gt; belonging to &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/ross-ulbricht/"&gt;Ross Ulbricht&lt;/a&gt;, who is accused of running Silk Road for nearly three years under the alias &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/dread-pirate-roberts/"&gt;Dread Pirate Roberts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ulbricht has pleaded &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/crime/ross-ulbricht-lawyer-silk-road-bitcoin-irs/"&gt;not guilty&lt;/a&gt; to narcotics and computer hacking conspiracy charges, money laundering, and being the kingpin of a continuing criminal enterprise. His trial is scheduled to begin in November, and it is likely the government will not move to sell the Bitcoin before it concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. Marshals Service announced Tuesday that one bidder won the entire stock of Bitcoin and that the transfer of bitcoins to that winner is complete. The USMS was previously holding the seized bitcoins in this wallet (&lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1Ez69SnzzmePmZX3WpEzMKTrcBF2gpNQ55" target="_blank"&gt;https:&lt;wbr /&gt;/&lt;wbr /&gt;/blockchain.info&lt;wbr /&gt;/address&lt;wbr /&gt;/1Ez69SnzzmePmZX3WpEzMKTrcBF2gpNQ55&lt;/a&gt;), which is now nearly empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is still no word on the value of the winning bid.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-aa037f7d-ed0c-8fbb-f92e-225f0ea479a4"&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s now legal to buy stuff with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://dailydot.com/tags/bitcoin"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/california/"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s right&amp;mdash;it wasn&amp;rsquo;t legal before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-aa037f7d-ed0c-8fbb-f92e-225f0ea479a4"&gt;Previously, individuals and groups in California were barred from &amp;ldquo;issuing or putting in circulation, as money, anything but the lawful money of the United States.&amp;rdquo; This past weekend, Gov. &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/jerry-brown/"&gt;Jerry Brown&lt;/a&gt; put his signature on a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billVotesClient.xhtml"&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt;, striking that provision from the state&amp;rsquo;s laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-aa037f7d-ed0c-8fbb-f92e-225f0ea479a4"&gt;The bill, simply titled &amp;ldquo;Lawful money,&amp;rdquo; was one of 15 that Brown &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=18590"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that he had signed on Saturday. He did not comment specifically on any of the bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-aa037f7d-ed0c-8fbb-f92e-225f0ea479a4"&gt;Assemblyman Roger Dickinson authored the bill and introduced it to the legislature back in January. It passed through the state assembly by a 75-0 vote that same month. The state senate took up the bill earlier this month and passed it by a vote of 28-3.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-aa037f7d-ed0c-8fbb-f92e-225f0ea479a4"&gt;&amp;ldquo;In an era of evolving payment methods, from &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/amazon/"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; Coins to &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/starbucks/"&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt; Stars, it is impractical to ignore the growing use of cash alternatives,&amp;rdquo; Dickinson said in a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://asmdc.org/members/a07/news-room/press-releases/legislation-addressing-alternative-currencies-such-as-bitcoin-headed-to-governor-s-desk"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; last week, after the state senate passed his bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-aa037f7d-ed0c-8fbb-f92e-225f0ea479a4"&gt;Dickinson referenced Bitcoin in his statement as a &amp;ldquo;a growing digital currency&amp;rdquo; that &amp;ldquo;has gained recent media attention as businesses have expanded to accept bitcoins for payment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-aa037f7d-ed0c-8fbb-f92e-225f0ea479a4"&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not likely anyone has ever been penalized for using Bitcoin under the now repealed provision, but the fact that it was technically illegal to use cryptocurrencies&amp;mdash;even in tech-savvy California&amp;mdash;is a reminder that current law is very much still in the catch-up phase when it comes to digital currencies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Gox CEO says thieves physically stole your bitcoins</title><link>http://www.dailydot.com/business/mt-gox-mark-karpeles-bitcoin-security-interview/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='//cdn0.dailydot.com/cache/08/15/0815fdcc4dfb14b184b674ed89d0e487.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It wasn&amp;rsquo;t just cyberattacks that brought down&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/mt-gox/"&gt;Mt. Gox&lt;/a&gt;, the one-time largest &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/bitcoin/"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; exchange in the world. Apparently, the company&amp;rsquo;s security problems extended to the physical world with some old fashioned break-ins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That&amp;rsquo;s according to the Mt. Gox CEO, Mark Karpel&amp;egrave;s, who recently gave his first interview since the late February press conference during which he disclosed that his company had lost hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its customers&amp;rsquo;&amp;nbsp;bitcoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;If anyone wants to start a Bitcoin exchange, I would say, &amp;lsquo;Be sure to have 24-hour security guards,&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; Karpel&amp;egrave;s told the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/mt-gox-head-believes-no-more-bitcoin-will-be-found-1403850830"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Karpel&amp;egrave;s said he couldn&amp;rsquo;t provide specifics, but that there were &amp;ldquo;some cases where a stranger sneaked in and took things away&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;at least one former employee stealing the company&amp;rsquo;s data.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the time of the exchange&amp;rsquo;s collapse, it was widely&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/mtgox-shut-down-bitcoin-hack/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that an issue with the Bitcoin protocol, dubbed the &amp;ldquo;transaction malleability,&amp;rdquo; was what allowed hackers to steal 850,000 bitcoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	About 200,000 of the stolen bitcoins have since been recovered, but&amp;nbsp;Karpel&amp;egrave;s said he does not believe any more of the lost bitcoins will be retrieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;m deeply sorry. I&amp;#39;m frustrated with myself,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;The weakest point of my company was management.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Karpel&amp;egrave;s said he &amp;ldquo;couldn&amp;rsquo;t lay out an adequate corporate structure&amp;rdquo; because he was regrettably &amp;ldquo;too busy with meetings with banks, lawyers and business partners.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As for the future of Mt. Gox, Karpel&amp;egrave;s is hoping an outside investor will buy the company and attempt to rehabilitate it. Those decisions are now out of his hands, however, as a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee has assumed control of the Japan-based company. The trustee is likely to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/mt-gox-liquidate/"&gt;liquidate the company&amp;rsquo;s remaining assets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Much to the dismay of many Mt. Gox investors, Karpel&amp;egrave;s remains a free man, pending investigation. Despite conducting the interview in his apartment on the 33rd and top floor of what WSJ described as an &amp;ldquo;upscale&amp;rdquo; neighborhood, the 29-year-old Frenchman insists his standard of living has regressed back to the less-than-$2 instant noodle ways of before his Bitcoin successes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I swear I haven&amp;rsquo;t been doing anything too luxurious,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Some people say I still own bitcoins or have a yacht, but that&amp;rsquo;s not true.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Karpel&amp;egrave;s said he&amp;rsquo;s mostly working on his other Web services company, Tibanne, which is named after his orange and white cat. Tibanne, the cat, made an appearance on Karpel&amp;egrave;s&amp;rsquo;s recently-revived&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/communities/twitter/"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;feed this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Like almost all of&amp;nbsp;Karpel&amp;egrave;s&amp;rsquo; tweets these days, the cat photo was met with sarcasm and vitriol from other Twitter users, some of whom claim to be victims of the Mt. Gox collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-740f95fd-da01-cec4-9d38-116f4e8fe55e"&gt;Sandra Alhilo, a 37-year-old mother of two, only had a vague knowledge of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://dailydot.com/tags/bitcoin"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; when the extortion letter came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;I remembered the... Spice Road?&amp;quot; she told the Daily Dot. &amp;quot;The drug thing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-740f95fd-da01-cec4-9d38-116f4e8fe55e"&gt;It&amp;#39;s actually the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://dailydot.com/tags/silk-road"&gt;Silk Road&lt;/a&gt; she was thinking of, the &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/communities/deep-web/"&gt;Deep Web&lt;/a&gt; marketplace where you can buy all sorts of illegal goods, and where the online-only Bitcoin is the currency of choice. But the point remains: The second time Bitcoin came to her attention, it was in the form of a letter that arrived June 16 to Pizza Pirates in Pomona, Calif., where Alhilo is the general manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;I started laughing,&amp;quot; Aliho said. &amp;quot;It looked like junk mail on the outside.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The tone of the letter, however, is dead serious. &amp;quot;Your business,&amp;quot; it begins, &amp;quot;has been targeted for Extortion [sic].&amp;quot; It goes on to name the list of things the anonymous criminal will do if the business doesn&amp;#39;t pay up: negative online reviews, calling in bomb threats, calling the cops and saying the company&amp;#39;s running a meth lab or training terrorists. To avoid this, it says, simply send over a single Bitcoin (worth around $600 these days). The letter&amp;#39;s recipient is directed to Coinbase, a popular cryptocurrency exchange, to purchase the digital money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-740f95fd-da01-cec4-9d38-116f4e8fe55e"&gt;A friend of Aliho quickly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/28ch4f/my_friends_business_received_an_extortion_letter/"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; the letter to Reddit, then got cold feet and deleted the thread. But copies spread on Twitter and were reposted back on Reddit. Then other copies of the same letter started cropping up. Then other businesses across the U.S., so far all independent pizza places, started reporting receiving the same letter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-740f95fd-da01-cec4-9d38-116f4e8fe55e"&gt;Because of the nature of Bitcoin, there&amp;#39;s no way to tell who owns the wallet that the company set up to ask for money. The wallet itself is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1MJ39pv1347AWVdN5kfYC6Cr9yYn1rrUAc"&gt;visible&lt;/a&gt; for anyone to see, however. It&amp;#39;s only received two tiny transactions, presumably to test it out. So far, no one has paid it 1 BTC as an extortion ransom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-740f95fd-da01-cec4-9d38-116f4e8fe55e"&gt;Pizza Pirates is the earliest known recipient of the letter, but it&amp;#39;s not the only one. Grand Rapids Pizza and Delivery, based in Michigan, got it too. It came with a different wallet address, which &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1kgvtbfdwxzyxqpbhyuszyh4eobfx4b6d6"&gt;seems&lt;/a&gt; to be invalid, but is otherwise identical. &amp;quot;They&amp;rsquo;re [trying to take our] lunch money, and we&amp;rsquo;re not going to let them,&amp;quot; owner Mike Raymond &lt;a href="http://woodtv.com/2014/06/24/bitcoin-new-payoff-for-extortionists/"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; local news outlet Wood TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another pizza joint, New Hampshire&amp;#39;s 900 Degrees Neapolitan Pizzeria, got the same thing. &amp;quot;This is a new one on me, you guys,&amp;quot; 900 Degrees&amp;#39;s official Facebook page wrote on its wall. &amp;quot;What the heck is a BitCoin??&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Alhilo said that she contacted the postal inspection service for an investigation. &amp;quot;We have no intention of paying this,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;Husband and wife John Bush and Catherine Bleish are not ashamed to admit that they have unconventional values. In fact, that&amp;rsquo;s the exact reason the young couple decided to take a month-long road trip with their two young children and pay for the entire thing with&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/bitcoin/"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s more activism than it is a vacation,&amp;rdquo; Bush tells the Daily Dot. &amp;ldquo;We try to use our daily lives as a way to inspire people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;The trip has already taken the family from their home in San Marcos, Texas, to a Bitcoin conference in Washington, D.C., where they screened a new episode of their online Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;reality show, &lt;a href="http://sovereignliving.tv/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sovereign Living&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Along the way, Bush has been uploading Bitcoin-themed podcasts to his company&amp;rsquo;s website and Bleish has been &lt;a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/13694/uncoinventional-tour/"&gt;blogging the trip&lt;/a&gt; for Bitcoin Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;We caught up with the family Monday, the eighth day of their voyage, as they shared a breakfast with Bitcoin entrepreneur and evangelist &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/charlie-shrem/"&gt;Charlie Shrem&lt;/a&gt; at the Holiday Inn Express in Brooklyn, N.Y.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;Despite facing up to 30 years in prison for&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/charlie-shrem-bitcoin-indictment/"&gt;money laundering charges&lt;/a&gt;, the 24-year-old Shrem is using the time before his trial, scheduled to start in September, as an opportunity to continue his Bitcoin entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;Shrem&amp;#39;s current&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://newsbtc.com/2014/06/15/holiday-inn-location-in-new-york-to-accept-bitcoin-payments-pilot/"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;involves convincing hotels to accept Bitcoin as payment, and his first client was Brooklyn Holiday Inn Express, where we sat. As it turns out, the hotel&amp;rsquo;s first Bitcoin customers was none other than Bush and Bleish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not surprising that Bush and Bleish crossed paths with Shrem at a time when both parties&amp;mdash;one on a Bitcoin road trip and the other bringing Bitcoin to hotels&amp;mdash;could benefit from being involved in each others&amp;rsquo; projects. Despite its anonymity-loving reputation, the Bitcoin community has grown close over the past few years in a concerted effort to extol the cryptocurrency&amp;rsquo;s virtues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;With his 18-month-old son William tearing up a gluten-free muffin on his lap, Bush describes how it&amp;rsquo;s possible to pay for an entire road trip with Bitcoin, a digital currency that remains at the fringes of mainstream acceptance. It&amp;#39;s not really the complicated: They have a mobile app that shows them nearby vendors that accept Bitcoin, which is their number one option.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;Of course, those are still few and far between, so the family has resorted to several workarounds, such as using Bitcoin to purchase gift cards and using what they call &amp;ldquo;proxies,&amp;rdquo; which is when one of their friends pays for something and they pay the person back with Bitcoin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;Bush uses terms like &amp;ldquo;revolutionary market anarchy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;coercive hierarchical structures&amp;rdquo; to describe the libertarian values he hoped to spread with the family trip, pausing at times to nuzzle his golden-haired, chubby-cheeked son.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s this new open-sourced, peer-to-peer, decentralized way of doing all different things,&amp;rdquo; Bush says. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s really the future. We&amp;rsquo;re in this weird transition period where, unfortunately, the people that are pioneers are getting locked up and have to wear ankle bracelets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s well-known in the Bitcoin community that after spending several months confined to his parents&amp;rsquo; house in Brooklyn following his arrest, Shrem, now free to roam New York City, has been forced to wear a GPS-monitoring ankle bracelet as part of his bail agreement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;Shrem, who is certainly&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/03/05/indicted-bitcoin-mogul-charlie-shrem-defiant-in-first-public-appearance-since-arrest/"&gt;not known&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to be apologetic, casually shrugs off any discussion about his impending prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is what it is,&amp;rdquo; Shrem says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;After about 40 minutes go by, Bleish enters with a plate of food in one hand and the couple&amp;rsquo;s daughter Aliana under the other arm. Aliana is nearly 3 years old, and when asked if she likes Bitcoin, the young girl shakes her head emphatically while grinning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;Why not? Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because mommy and daddy spend so much time talking about it. Or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because daddy used to call her &amp;ldquo;Professor Bitcoin,&amp;rdquo; her parents suggest in turn. Aliana, seemingly unconcerned with the details, goes to work on a gluten-free muffin of her own.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Other than the exhaustion part, it&amp;rsquo;s been pretty good,&amp;rdquo; Bleish responds with a smile, when asked how she&amp;rsquo;s been enjoying the road trip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;Bleish spent the weeks leading up to the trip working out all the logistics. To get an idea of her task, imagine how much planning would go into a normal month-long road trip that involves two young children, then add the Bitcoin element.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;Thus far, the only flaw in the plan was what can perhaps be described as a bit of midwestern naivete. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never driven in the New York metro area, you might not know that it&amp;rsquo;s basically impossible to enter and leave New York City from the West without paying a toll.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;When the family&amp;rsquo;s minivan pulled up to the Holland Tunnel after midnight on Monday morning, they were disappointingly forced to use what Bleish calls &amp;ldquo;Federal Reserve notes,&amp;rdquo; also known as U.S. dollars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s just this crazy thing that popped into my head,&amp;rdquo; Bleish says, when asked why she went to such great pains to plan a Bitcoin road trip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;Well before Bleish joined the breakfast, her husband used the same word, &amp;ldquo;crazy,&amp;rdquo; to describe their trip, but it was obvious neither meant it to be taken literally. Rather, they seem to mean that, by mainstream America&amp;rsquo;s perspective, their trip could be viewed as crazy. On her Bitcoin Magazine blog,&amp;nbsp;Bleish has dubbed it the &amp;ldquo;un&lt;em&gt;coin&lt;/em&gt;ventional&amp;rdquo; road trip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;For people like Bush, Bleish, and Shrem, Bitcoin or something similar is undoubtedly the currency of the future. Independent of one another, Shrem tells me that one bitcoin will be worth a million dollars within a few years, and Bush says the currency&amp;rsquo;s value will eventually surpass $100,000.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;That might not be so easy, however, as in the last year alone, Bitcoin has showed incredible volatility, increasing in value from around $100 to more than $1,100, before diving back down to under $400.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;Not to mention the former largest and most prominent Bitcoin exchange on the planet,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/mt-gox/"&gt;Mt. Gox&lt;/a&gt;, spectacularly crumbled, losing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of customers&amp;rsquo; funds in the process. Oh yeah, and the U.S. government is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/silk-road-30000-bitcoin-us-marshals-auction/"&gt;sitting on about $100 million&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;worth of Bitcoin that it said it seized from cybercriminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;When I ask the road trippers if they plan to visit the newly opened &amp;ldquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/bitcoin-boulevard/"&gt;Bitcoin Boulevard&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, they say that it was not in their plan, but they immediately decide they will take a detour to go there on the way home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;Bitcoin itself has displayed similar flexibility and opportunism in past months, seeking partnerships and inroads into the mainstream. The &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/cryptocurrency/"&gt;cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; has attracted prominent companies such as &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/expedia-bitcoin-hotels/"&gt;Expedia&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/overstock-bitcoin-sales-day-1/"&gt;Overstock.com&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/dish-network-bitcoin/"&gt;Dish Network&lt;/a&gt; to start accepting it as payment. Bitcoin has even&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/bitpay-bitcoin-bowl-ncaa-interview/"&gt;attached its name&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to one of NCAA football&amp;rsquo;s 39 bowl games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-e4064c40-cad4-8b44-911a-f2f263542666"&gt;Whether Bitcoin ultimately takes the high road to widespread adoption or the low road to failure is anyone&amp;rsquo;s guess. But, like Bush-Bleish family&amp;#39;s &amp;ldquo;uncoinventional&amp;rdquo; vacation, it&amp;rsquo;s sure to be one hell of a trip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;

	In person, Max Keiser is everything you want him to be: sharp, articulate, and narcissistic. He slips into hysteria like other people slip into a bathrobe. Just mention JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, and he&amp;rsquo;s gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Fuck you, Jamie! Fuck you!&amp;rdquo; he screamed to an empty studio audience on set at&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Keiser Report&lt;/em&gt;, at the mere utterance of his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since the banking meltdown of 2008 and subsequent bailouts, the financial shock-jock has been punching way above his weight. Launched on Russian state-funded channel RT in 2009 and filmed at a studio that overlooks city hall in London, the thrice-weekly&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Keiser Report&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;nets more viewers globally than Bill O&amp;rsquo;Reilly on Fox News and Jeremy Paxman on the BBC. Keiser is beloved among followers because he&amp;rsquo;s the only person on any mainstream outlet who savages bankers and their government supplicants with as much ferocity as the tabloids and other cable news hosts. In fact, he goes at them harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Originally from New York, Keiser started out in standup comedy before taking a job as a stockbroker, which gave him the insider knowledge for his &amp;ldquo;act.&amp;rdquo; And although he toes the line between news and personal entertainment, the anchor for what he claims is the most popular financial show in the world does seem genuinely incensed a lot of the time. To wit, not long after I asked if he had considered following his fellow RT host Liz Wahl in resigning live on air to protest the Russian government&amp;rsquo;s actions in Ukraine, Kaiser took to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-mce-="" href="http://www.dailydot.com/communities/twitter/" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and began abusing the anchors from Western TV channels for not resigning over the war in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I had to ask Keiser&amp;mdash;one of &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/bitcoin/"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s biggest hype men&amp;mdash;what was going on in the world of alternative money. And does the former broker really have faith in MaxCoin, the new cryptocurrency bearing his name?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Have you been affected by the Bitcoin hacks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Fortunately I haven&amp;rsquo;t. I was very wary about Mt. Gox because it&amp;rsquo;s been known for a couple of years now the technology there is pretty bad. So I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any in Mt. Gox, more in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-mce-="" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.bitcoin.it%2Fwiki%2FCold_storage&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNH2VnJQ0QlC3hqH7Buc5iXSFY1JvQ" target="_blank"&gt;cold storage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;When did you buy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	I started buying between $3 and $4. Three and a half years ago is when I first got into it, because my background goes back to virtual currencies. I have some patents on virtual currencies going back to the mid-1990s. So this is really building on that idea. It&amp;rsquo;s a cryptocurrency, but it uses a lot of the virtual currency ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Do you think there&amp;rsquo;s an ethical problem with talking up Bitcoin when you have such a vested interest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s fully disclosed, so it&amp;rsquo;s no different from Warren Buffett going on TV and saying he has a huge interest in such and such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;On&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a data-mce-="" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.npr.org%2Fblogs%2Fmoney%2F2014%2F02%2F05%2F272113082%2Fepisode-515-a-bet-over-bitcoin&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFzzFtVLsyrfu4zmJ-MLqhtT_GQnw" target="_blank"&gt;Planet Money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;recently, Ben Horowitz and Felix Salmon had a bet over whether Bitcoin would be a widely used currency in five years&amp;rsquo; time. What do you think?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	I follow Rick Falkvinge, who founded the Swedish Pirate party and was one of the very early adopters of Bitcoin. He made a very compelling case that Bitcoin should capture between 1 and 10 percent of the global Forex [foreign exchange] market, so that would imply a price of between $100,000 to $1 million a bitcoin. I think that will be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;You really believe it will hit a million dollars per bitcoin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Absolutely. Because I do believe it will capture between one and 10 percent of global Forex. The global Forex market is in big trouble right now. It&amp;rsquo;s plagued with manipulation scandals; it&amp;rsquo;s completely inefficient. It&amp;rsquo;s ready to be &amp;ldquo;&lt;a data-mce-="" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.etoro.com%2Feducation%2Fgrowing-trend-disintermediation.aspx&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHnNjdIc36iiyUNU3LFfCXgklCBuQ" target="_blank"&gt;Disintermediated&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; Bitcoin as an asset class is brilliant, as a means of payment, fantastic. So it will definitely challenge the current Forex business. All the companies currently in that business, like Western Union, there&amp;rsquo;s one here in London called World First; when I was on Newsnight with one of the people from that company, it was quite obvious they weren&amp;rsquo;t prepared for the competitive threat of Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;So when do you think it will reach that level?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Well in 2014 there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more virtual currency money coming into it. So the market capitalisation of Bitcoin, which is $6-8 billion right now, will probably get into $50-100 billion range in 2014, and from there it should take off substantially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Is it a good idea for employees to take their wages in Bitcoin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	I think anybody who is interested in keeping their money safe from the criminal banking system would want gold, silver, and Bitcoin. On an individual basis, it differs from person to person. But this is what I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying for several years now. Originally I recommended people with gold portfolios to hedge their position with maybe 5 percent position of Bitcoin. Then, over the last year and a half, that 5 percent hedge has eclipsed&amp;mdash;it has driven those portfolios to 300 to 400 percent gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Gold is outperforming Bitcoin now, though.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Last year it out-performed gold. This year gold is doing better than Bitcoin. There is an interesting relationship between gold and Bitcoin. I think owning gold, silver, and Bitcoin, you have a great portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The real test is whether Bitcoin can be a reliable currency for people who have bills to pay. Even if they don&amp;rsquo;t like the banking system, at least if their wages go into a bank, they are going to be able to pay their bills with that currency. They don&amp;rsquo;t really have to worry too much about it being worthless in six months&amp;rsquo; time, or someone hacking into their bank account and making off with their unsecured savings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Well the U.K. is a slightly different story to, say, Cyprus, Venezuela or Argentina, where funds are being confiscated and hyper-inflation is destroying the value of the money. So in those places, Bitcoin is a lifesaver. The U.K. is one of the last places that would be affected because it&amp;rsquo;s the global centre of these banking problems. That&amp;rsquo;s why we do our show in London. We consider ourselves to be financial war reporters, and London is the front line of the worst banking scandals in the world right now. That&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;re here, to cover HSBC, Barclays, Lloyd&amp;rsquo;s, RBS. They&amp;rsquo;re the worst elements in this criminal banking disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;But isn&amp;rsquo;t Bitcoin also susceptible to the criminal impulses of cartels?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	No, because you can&amp;rsquo;t print Bitcoin the same way you can print pounds. So every time one of these major banks screws up, the Bank of England just prints more money. When HSBC pays&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-mce-="" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbusiness%2F2012%2Fdec%2F11%2Fhsbc-bank-us-money-laundering&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFvsE6sdh000rjBXR2s6aBH1JmjqA" target="_blank"&gt;multimillion dollar fines&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for laundering drug money, they just print more money. There&amp;rsquo;s no accountability to all this money being printed, which isn&amp;rsquo;t the case with Bitcoin. That&amp;rsquo;s why&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-mce-="" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2F2014%2F03%2F07%2Fbitcoin-mtgox-believers-idUSL1N0LX17E20140307&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNERjOJwaIocC4HDR0ecS2MqEzihvw" target="_blank"&gt;Mt. Gox going belly up&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a good example of Bitcoin being more true to a capitalist spirit of business, because nobody bailed out Mt. Gox. If it was JP Morgan or HSBC, the government would have bailed them out and you would have been paying as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Tell me about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-mce-="" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmaxcoin.co.uk%2F&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNH5n-hTX_WlSK8AVKlbP5H7Eh7SdA" target="_blank"&gt;MaxCoin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Two developers from Bristol contacted me because I said on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Keiser Report&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;that if there was a MaxCoin, it would do very well. And if it didn&amp;rsquo;t do well, I would host the show naked. So they contacted me and said, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve got a MaxCoin, we want to launch.&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;OK, do it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;How does it feel to have your head on a proverbial bank note?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Well this is not the first time. I created the Hollywood Dollar with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-mce-="" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hsx.com%2Fabout%2F&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFaEy_ZzpAueetWZuOYVwQFsO5crg" target="_blank"&gt;Hollywood Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, which is the first convertible virtual currency in the world, backed by several patents. We have the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-mce-="" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.keiserethicalsilver.com%2F&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEscpXE1Y9Y-izpb86BS-t5n_mSiw" target="_blank"&gt;Keiser Ethical Silver Coin&lt;/a&gt;, which has my name on it, which is for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-mce-="" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FGIABO.US&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNH-J3grNfVxL9kVREGFtv1N0R-eZQ" target="_blank"&gt;Global Insurrection Against Banker Occupation&lt;/a&gt;, which is a followup to a coin that was done in Canada a year before, which is called the Silver Keiser, which does have my actual face on the coin. This latest one just has my name on the coin&amp;mdash;it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have my face on the coin. So MaxCoin is, I think, the fourth coin that&amp;rsquo;s been branded Max Keiser in the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your involvement with MaxCoin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of involvement at all. I support them. Nigel Smart is the lead cryptographer in Bristol. He&amp;rsquo;s somebody I discovered through MaxCoin, and we&amp;rsquo;re going to do some projects together going forward. But it&amp;rsquo;s pretty much&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-mce-="" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FLukeCrypto&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHEnfMs5Sv__dozHOznCAfdZ8xCbg" target="_blank"&gt;Luke Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;, who is the lead developer. It&amp;rsquo;s his project, basically. The coin has a lot of great technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Some of the people on your website&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-mce-="" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.maxkeiser.com%2F2014%2F02%2Fhow-to-start-mining-maxcoins-cpu-mining-max-coins%2F&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGmivBjNF7yE4IeFs60woWI-H7Tfw" target="_blank"&gt;disagree&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
	That&amp;rsquo;s what makes a market, you know, buyers and sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Do you think there&amp;rsquo;s a danger you&amp;rsquo;re becoming one of the financial hucksters you rally against?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	No, because I&amp;rsquo;ve said all along that my mission, if you will, is to put the tools of free markets into the hands of people, so they can empower themselves. And at the same time disenfranchise the bad folks, the bad banks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-mce-="" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.karmabanque.com%2F&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEKWucRgZJLLphl3qeuFcasALIWPA" target="_blank"&gt;KarmaBanque&lt;/a&gt;, which was using the tools of capitalism against capitalism, got huge press a few years ago. Hollywood Stock Exchange was the same thing, transferring the power of Hollywood elites to the population. So that&amp;rsquo;s been a recurring theme, transferring power and wealth from the concentration to the many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Is MaxCoin going to be a serious contender, or another novelty?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to say, as market forces are in operation here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t there an argument that capitalism relies on relatively stable currencies, because if you have a thousand kinds of money in the marketplace, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to establish a common value to the goods we&amp;rsquo;re trading?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s all about competition. MaxCoin is competing for the crypto buck, if you will. So is Bitcoin, so is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-mce-="" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailydot.com%2Ftags%2Fdogecoin%2F&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFKWdIWGRTYd7oYEpWRswdh64fCvg" target="_blank"&gt;Dogecoin&lt;/a&gt;. Alt-coins are proving to be formidable because there&amp;rsquo;s a solid community behind it, there&amp;rsquo;s a use for it, and it&amp;rsquo;s got a great market capitalisation. I think that&amp;rsquo;s going to be a winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-mce-="" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.wsj.com%2Fmoneybeat%2F2014%2F03%2F05%2Fauroracoin-already-second-biggest-virtual-currency-and-its-not-even-out-yet%2F&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNG9zuLuCJrb0_1FzFx0vgEUhheolg" target="_blank"&gt;Auroracoin&lt;/a&gt;, which came out of the banking crisis of Iceland, that has huge support, that looks very good. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-mce-="" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.wsj.com%2Fmoneybeat%2F2014%2F03%2F07%2Flakota-nation-strives-for-independence-with-digital-currency-mazacoin%2F&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNE5laeHSu6Nw1DeNpWbzH_te-wqwA" target="_blank"&gt;Mazacoin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;from the Lakota Nation is brilliant, because they have their own sovereignty within the U.S., so they&amp;rsquo;ve created their own sovereign coin. And here&amp;rsquo;s a group of people that have been downtrodden, beat up, horrified, tortured, annihilated, and genocided by the U.S. government for 300 years, so they clearly have a need for a coin. Then market forces take over. Scotland wants to do a coin; they should do a coin because they&amp;rsquo;re trying to achieve independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s one MaxCoin trading at right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	0.00042 bitcoin, around $0.27&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;In that case, I may get some.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s cheap! I think the risk is near a 100 percent. The risk-reward is attractive, but it&amp;rsquo;s still high. The risk-reward for Bitcoin is very compelling at $670 per Bitcoin. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a very attractive coin with huge distribution, application, etc. If you asked me which currencies to put money in, I would say Bitcoin number one, and go from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;I want to buy some MaxCoin, but it looks difficult.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Go to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-mce-="" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fmcxnow.com%2Fexchange%2FMAX&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEsP3nrDuBg6aN-5MHG3iV_chtCAw" target="_blank"&gt;MCXNow&lt;/a&gt;, which is an exchange, with Bitcoin, you can convert it into MaxCoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a bitcoin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Well you should get some. Get some Bitcoin!&lt;/p&gt;

Wargo said that BitPay drew inspiration from this guy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" data-cke-saved-src="http://cdn0.dailydot.com/uploaded/images/original/2014/6/18/0c913be7bea10b7d1609ec9ad604319c.jpg" src="http://cdn0.dailydot.com/uploaded/images/original/2014/6/18/0c913be7bea10b7d1609ec9ad604319c.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 320px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Bitcoin user appeared on ESPN’s College Gameday before a matchup between the Auburn Tigers and the Alabama Crimson Tide last December. The Bitcoin community apparently &lt;a data-cke-saved-href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/espn-signholder-bitcoin-qr-code/" href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/espn-signholder-bitcoin-qr-code/"&gt;enjoyed his sign&lt;/a&gt;—they sent him more than $20,000 worth of bitcoins, at a time when the digital currency’s &lt;a data-cke-saved-href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/bitcoin-litecoin-black-friday-boom/" href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/bitcoin-litecoin-black-friday-boom/"&gt;price was soaring&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wargo said this happened at the same time BitPay was brainstorming ways to bring to the public “massive education on Bitcoin” to help people get “prepared for the massive [Bitcoin] adoption that’s going to take place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Wargo and the rest of the BitPay team, college football seemed like a perfect match:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;”College sports fit right in with our demographics. A lot of the kids are working on crypto, looking at crypto. There’s a very big crypto community on college campuses. Football in general fits our demographic—80 to 85 percent male, ages 17 to 54. It just lined up and it was a really good fit for us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just about six months later, the company has arranged a situation where it will affix Bitcoin’s name to one of college football’s 39 bowl games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reason it’s the Bitcoin Bowl and not the BitPay Bowl is because we want to be able to make this a complete Bitcoin ecosystem and really get the whole entire community involved in every aspect of the game,” Wargo said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way BitPay sees it going down is that people will be able to pay for everything, from tickets to hot dogs and sodas, with Bitcoin. Representatives from across the Bitcoin community will attend the game to evangelize the cryptocurrency to what will largely be a new audience, from setting up &lt;a data-cke-saved-href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/bitcoin-wallet/" href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/bitcoin-wallet/"&gt;wallets&lt;/a&gt; to showing people how to make Bitcoin payments. The move is part of a l&lt;a data-cke-saved-href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/bitcoin-battle-future-libertarian-lost/" href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/bitcoin-battle-future-libertarian-lost/"&gt;arger shift&lt;/a&gt; within the Bitcoin community, one that’s less about the currency’s original libertarian ideals and more about providing a cheaper alternative to traditional credit systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want to get across how easy and secure using Bitcoin is,” Wargo said. “Just like you go through a Starbucks drive-thru right now, and you hand over your phone to do a payment, that you use your phone to do a [Bitcoin] payment, and it’s that simple.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making payments may be relatively simple, but not everything about Bitcoin is quite so copacetic. From its &lt;a data-cke-saved-href="http://www.dailydot.com/technology/history-misidentifying-satoshi-nakamoto/" href="http://www.dailydot.com/technology/history-misidentifying-satoshi-nakamoto/"&gt;anonymous creator&lt;/a&gt;, Satoshi Nakamoto, to its &lt;a data-cke-saved-href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/silk-road-30000-bitcoin-us-marshals-auction/" href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/silk-road-30000-bitcoin-us-marshals-auction/"&gt;connection to cybercrime&lt;/a&gt;, Bitcoin has developed a sometimes &lt;a data-cke-saved-href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/what-is-bitcoin-faq-beginners-guide/" href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/what-is-bitcoin-faq-beginners-guide/"&gt;dubious reputation&lt;/a&gt; that it has struggled to shake.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than avoiding it, Wargo said she foresees a situation where BitPay will embrace the sort of digital folklore surrounding Bitcoin when trying to introduce it to NCAA football fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We definitely don’t want to discount how cryptocurrency and Bitcoin came to be,” Wargo said. “Where that fits, I’m not exactly sure at this moment. I do foresee it fitting in somewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s arguably the most significant, this isn’t the first time a cryptocurrency has found a willing advertising partner in the sports world. Earlier this year, users of &lt;a data-cke-saved-href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/dogecoin/" href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/dogecoin/"&gt;Dogecoin&lt;/a&gt;, a light-hearted alternative to Bitcoin, pooled their resources to &lt;a data-cke-saved-href="http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/doge4nascar-fundraising-goal/" href="http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/doge4nascar-fundraising-goal/"&gt;sponsor NASCAR driver&lt;/a&gt; Josh Wise and get Dogecoin’s canine logo onto Wise’s no. 98 car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here she is!

But if it is a success, BitPay has the option to extend the contract with the St. Petersburg Bowl for an additional three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2013 version of the game, when it was still called the Beef 'O' Brady's Bowl, the East Carolina University Pirates topped the Ohio University Bobcats by a score of 37-20. This year the team that wins the game will take home a $500,000 prize, and yes, it can choose to take the payment in Bitcoin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photos by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fdecomite/" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fdecomite/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;fdecomite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;/Flickr and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-cke-saved-href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Football_Icon.svg" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Football_Icon.svg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Connormah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;/Wikimedia Commons (CC BY 2.0 and GNU Lesser General Public License) | Remix by Fran Berkman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>francisberkman@gmail.com (Fran  Berkman)</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2014 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.dailydot.com/business/bitpay-bitcoin-bowl-ncaa-interview/</guid><category>Business</category></item><item><title>U.S. Marshals leak list of people who want to buy seized Silk Road bitcoins</title><link>http://www.dailydot.com/politics/us-marshals-leak-silk-road-bitcoins-list/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='//cdn0.dailydot.com/cache/be/e4/bee45add318818604839d3d7996693f7.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	U.S. Marshals want to &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/silk-road-30000-bitcoin-us-marshals-auction/"&gt;sell off 30,000 bitcoins&lt;/a&gt; worth over $18 million that were confiscated in the late 2013 &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/silk-road/"&gt;Silk Road&lt;/a&gt; bust.

	The marshals have since apologized for the mistake in a follow up email, saying the list includes &amp;ldquo;some of the individuals who have asked a question or questions about the pending bitcoin auction.&amp;rdquo; The list, it seems clear, is only a partial representation of the interest in buying the coins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to buy some of the Silk Road coins, you have until June 23rd to contact U.S. Marshals to do so. The auction will take place on June 27 and the results announced on June 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	U.S. Marshals have not yet verified the emails at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

	On Dec. 26, 2014, two college-level football teams from the NCAA will square off in the &amp;ldquo;Bitcoin Bowl.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://dailydot.com/tags/bitcoin"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; enthusiasts can thank BitPay, a payment processing company for the popular cyptocurrency, which paid to attach the word &amp;ldquo;Bitcoin&amp;rdquo; to one of college football&amp;rsquo;s 39 bowl games. The game&amp;rsquo;s official title is the &amp;ldquo;Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		BitPay is proud to sponsor the Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl on December 26th! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bitcoin&amp;amp;src=hash"&gt;#bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinBowl"&gt;@bitcoinbowl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://t.co/tkrXqyp6NY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/tkrXqyp6NY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&amp;mdash; BitPay (@BitPay) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BitPay/statuses/479261607369785344"&gt;June 18, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	The naming arrangement is part of a four-year deal that BitPay struck with ESPN Events, the &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/bitpay-to-sponsor-st-petersburg-bowl-in-first-major-bitcoin-sports-deal-1403098202"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	The Internet reacted to the Bitcoin Bowl news with a predictable burst of excitement. The term &amp;ldquo;Bitcoin Bowl&amp;rdquo; became a globally trending topic on &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/communities/twitter/"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and within an hour of the news, the &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/wikipedia/"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; page for the St. Petersburg Bowl was amended to reflect that Bitcoin has replaced Beef O&amp;#39;Brady&amp;#39;s as the sponsor for the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time a cryptocurrency has sponsored a major sporting event. Users of a Bitcoin alternative called &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/dogecoin/"&gt;Dogecoin&lt;/a&gt;, which styles itself after a &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/doge/"&gt;popular Internet meme&lt;/a&gt; featuring a Shiba Inu with a quizzical look on its face, &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/doge4nascar-fundraising-goal/"&gt;pooled together enough money&lt;/a&gt; to sponsor NASCAR driver Josh Wise earlier this year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	The payout is $500,000 to the university that wins the Bitcoin Bowl. This raises an obvious question: Can the winning team opt for payment in Bitcoin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Yes, the team can and it&amp;#39;s up to the team/University,&amp;rdquo; BitPay&amp;rsquo;s Jan Jahosky told the Daily Dot in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;

</description><author>francisberkman@gmail.com (Fran  Berkman)</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2014 17:11:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/bitcoin-football-st-petersburg-bowl-ncaa/</guid><category>Sports</category><category>Lifestyle</category></item><item><title>Bitcoin may not be anonymous after all</title><link>http://www.dailydot.com/business/bitcoin-identify-users-anonymity/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='//cdn0.dailydot.com/cache/7a/b1/7ab1f4462fc7c9947c40641b559bc100.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	One of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/bitcoin/"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s first big selling points was that the virtual currency made it possible to transact online without revealing one&amp;rsquo;s real-world identity. For high-tech drug dealers, people looking to avoid strict capital controls in economically oppressive countries, and the chronically paranoid, this newfound ability was positively liberating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Technically, Bitcoin is pseudonymous rather than anonymous. Every transaction on the currency&amp;rsquo;s network is linked to a giant public ledger containing a record of everything that&amp;rsquo;s happened to every&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/bitcoin-wallet/"&gt;Bitcoin wallet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;since the currency&amp;rsquo;s creation. Even so, linkages between those Bitcoin wallet addresses and someone&amp;rsquo;s offline identity isn&amp;rsquo;t required, and Bitcoin has flourished under that veil of secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.7418v2.pdf"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;released earlier this month by a trio of researchers at the University of Luxembourg lays out an ingenious strategy, called an eavesdropping attack, that allows someone to link nearly two-thirds of users on the Bitcoin network to their specific IP addresses. In many cases, those IP addresses could easily be matched to up users&amp;rsquo; real-world identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The study&amp;rsquo;s authors have also uncovered a loophole in the Bitcoin protocol&amp;rsquo;s method for preventing denial-of-service attacks that allows someone to not only prevent users from employing the anonymizing service&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/tor"&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to keep their identities hidden but also single-handedly blocks all Tor use across the entire Bitcoin network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The most troubling part is that, according to the study&amp;rsquo;s authors, this de-anonymization may already be happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Co-author Ivan Pustogarov&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.coindesk.com/eavesdropping-attack-can-unmask-60-bitcoin-clients/"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;indispensable cryptocurrency news site CoinDesk that he was spurred to publish his paper online before it had undergone peer review because he had some limited evidence that this sort of attack was already underway.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m running several Bitcoin servers and from time to time I get many connections from the same IP address,&amp;rdquo; Pustogarov said. ‟I have suspicions that someone is trying to mount this kind of attack.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To understand how this all works, it&amp;rsquo;s important to first visualize Bitcoin as a decentralized network of about 100,000 clients computers located across the globe and all running software that links them to each other. When someone conducts a transaction on the Bitcoin network, their data first enters the network through direct connections with a set of eight other computers. Those computers are the user&amp;rsquo;s entry nodes into the network. Those nodes are consistent as long as the Bitcoin client software remains running or the user&amp;rsquo;s computer is switched off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The University of Luxembourg researchers discovered that if they were able to keep track of the entry points through which a given computer connected to the network, they&amp;rsquo;d be able discern that computer&amp;rsquo;s IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The researchers tried out the attack over the Bitcoin test network, a separate network from the one over which the vast majority of transactions flow. Since the value of all the coins on the test network are negligible, it&amp;rsquo;s often used by developers working on new applications without fear that a malfunctioning program would do serious damage. To protect the privacy of Bitcoin users the world over, the study&amp;rsquo;s authors conducted their de-anonymization trials on the test network instead of on the full, widely used network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The team was able to determine the IP address of 11 percent of the transactions going across the test network. If they employed a slight modification on this strategy that involved sending far more feelers out through the network, that number jumped to 60 percent; however, employing this modified method would make it far easier for others on the network to see what they were doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Scaling up the scheme to make it applicable to the full network wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be particularly difficult. The more computers someone has sniffing the network for users&amp;rsquo; IP addresses, the more difficult it is for one of the parties being sniffed at to realize what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dmitry Khovratovich, one of the study&amp;rsquo;s authors, explained in an email to the Daily Dot that it would take an attacker using about 50 different IP address for their attack to be ‟indistinguishable from ordinary users,&amp;rdquo; which he estimated would cost about &amp;euro;1,500 per month&amp;mdash;just over $2,000 U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	‟A more active adversary might conduct a cheaper attack, but it is more likely that he will be detected and banned,&amp;rdquo; Khovratovich added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are ways for even novice computer users to easily disguise their IP addresses through applications like virtual private networks (VPNs), Tor, or Network Address Translation (NAT) systems that allow multiple computers to connect to the Internet using a single, shared IP address. However, none of these methods will allow a Bitcoin user avoid detection through an eavesdropping attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Bitcoin network doesn&amp;rsquo;t support VPN functionality and, unlike prior attempts to de-anonymize the Bitcoin network, this strategy isn&amp;rsquo;t phased by NATs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When it comes to Tor, the researchers discovered a jaw-dropping method for preventing users from using the service to disguise their identities&amp;mdash;tricking the entire Bitcoin network to automatically reject all traffic coming from Tor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First developed by the U.S. Navy in the early 2000s, Tor works by randomly routing all traffic through a global network of computers. Tor makes it impossible to determine the origin of any individual piece of data that passes through it. Yet, because there are only just over 1,000 established exit nodes through which data can leave the Tor network, the researchers discovered that it&amp;rsquo;s possible to stop the Bitcoin network from accepting Tor traffic altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Built into the Bitcoin protocol is a mechanism designed to guard the network against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, where Bitcoin clients become so overloaded with phony requests for information they aren&amp;rsquo;t able to respond to legitimate ones. If a client on the Bitcoin network receives too many transaction requests that don&amp;rsquo;t appear legitimate, that client will automatically stop accepting requests from that IP address for a period of 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The researchers realized that all they had to do was connect to Tor and start flooding the Bitcoin network with as many illegitimate requests as possible&amp;mdash;a process that only required about a single gigabyte of data to be sent to Bitcoin through Tor. Once that happened, everyone connecting through Tor would effectively be banned because the Bitcoin network would identify all of the Tor exit nodes as being the source of a DoS attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With Tor removed as an option, the only way someone could connect to the Bitcoin network would be through a method vulnerable to an eavesdropping attack. Khovratovich noted that there&amp;rsquo;s no evidence anyone has ever successfully used this technique to block Tor users from using Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=632124.0"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on the influential BitcoinTalk forum, Bitcoin core developer Mike Hearn postulated, and then immediately dismissed, one possible way to plug the hole identified in the study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&amp;ldquo;This could be solved by encrypting the entire P2P network (but then, it would be trivial for an adversary to connect to you and get the traffic unencrypted again), and by sending lots of cover traffic so it&amp;#39;s harder to tell when a tx is being relayed. But that&amp;#39;s very expensive, probably too expensive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	‟Privacy against privileged network observers is one thing. DoS is something else,&amp;rdquo; Hearn added. ‟As far as I know, nobody has ever built a P2P network that is really DoS resistant. It&amp;#39;s not even clear it&amp;#39;s possible with current technology. This may make Bitcoin technically un-viable in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even so, the realization that Bitcoin may not be as anonymous&amp;mdash;or pseudonymous for that matter&amp;mdash;as initially advertised likely isn&amp;rsquo;t a fatal blow to the growth of the virtual currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bitcoin largely entered the mainstream consciousness through its association with shadowy online drug markets like the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/silk-road"&gt;Silk Road&lt;/a&gt;, which valued the currency&amp;rsquo;s ability to allows its users to transact with each other without one party having to know anything about the other. But, over the past year or so, there&amp;rsquo;s been a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/business/bitcoin-battle-future-libertarian-lost/"&gt;growing appreciation for Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s other attributes&lt;/a&gt;, primarily its almost nonexistent overhead costs for securely sending and receiving money online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As upstart financial institutions increasingly work towards integrating Bitcoin into the global financial system, there&amp;rsquo;s been a move in the direction of requiring customers who patronize those institutions to use their real-world identities. Many Bitcoin wallet services, exchanges, and physical ATMs require real-name verification up front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In an ecosystem where Bitcoin is seen as an alternative to Visa or Paypal rather than a digital suitcase full of unmarked, non-sequential hundred dollar bills, the realization that a dedicated hacker could discover a Bitcoin user&amp;rsquo;s IP address may not be the end of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

	If you&amp;rsquo;re planning on paying for your university education in bitcoins, the cost of tuition could run up as much as 54.77 bitcoins, or $30,310 at the first brick and mortar American college to accept the currency: &lt;a href="https://www.tkc.edu"&gt;The King&amp;rsquo;s College &lt;/a&gt;in New York City&amp;rsquo;s financial district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Compared to many private educational institutions in the U.S., that&amp;rsquo;s not such a bad price to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The private Christian liberal arts school announced that it would use merchant processor Coin.co to process any tuitions received via the digial currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The King&amp;rsquo;s College, founded in 1938, follows Cyprus&amp;rsquo;s University of Nicosia and the U.K.&amp;rsquo;s University of Cumbria as major universities accepting cryptocurrency in lieu of government-backed cash, although if a student chose to pay with Bitcoin, the exchange is made instantly and the school itself never actually touches bitcoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We have a strong emphasis on the founding documents of the U.S., the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, which are very individual based,&amp;rdquo; Dr. Gregory Thornbury, president of the school, &lt;a href="http://www.coindesk.com/kings-college-new-york-now-accepting-bitcoin-tuition-payments/"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Coindesk. &amp;ldquo;Bitcoin represents that, it&amp;rsquo;s the empowerment of individuals.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Draper University, a Silicon Valley-based online school that also calls itself the &amp;ldquo;University of Heroes,&amp;rdquo; began accepting bitcoins in 2013. So far, it&amp;rsquo;s most famous for having students &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/20/draper-university-sex-toys/"&gt;sell sex toys&lt;/a&gt; for class, so American Bitcoin enthusiasts are looking at the historic King&amp;rsquo;s College adoption of the currency as a more significant milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The King&amp;rsquo;s College seeks to transform society by preparing students for careers in which they help to shape and eventually to lead strategic public and private institutions,&amp;rdquo; Thornbury continued. &amp;ldquo;Allowing Bitcoin to be used to pay for a King&amp;rsquo;s education decreases our costs while simultaneously allowing our students to be a part of this exciting new technology.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

	If there&amp;rsquo;s one structural flaw that could cause&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/bitcoin/"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to collapse from within, it&amp;rsquo;s the network&amp;rsquo;s vulnerability to what&amp;rsquo;s called a &amp;ldquo;51 percent attack.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	Threat of a 51 percent attack was, up until very recently, a theoretical problem that would only come about if one entity came to control more than half of the computing power being used to mine Bitcoin. In theory, with the majority of the network&amp;rsquo;s computing power, an entity could double-spend Bitcoin and engage in what&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;selfish mining,&amp;rdquo; a process that would allow it to mine a disproportionately large share of new Bitcoin blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	The threat of a 51 percent attack became very real for many Bitcoin owners this week, when the world&amp;rsquo;s largest Bitcoin mining pool, GHash.IO, flirted with, and may have even surpassed, 51 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	Bitcoin communities on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/communities/reddit/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and the BitcoinTalk forum reacted to this news with much apprehension. Peter Todd, a prominent figure in the Bitcoin world, wrote a long&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/281ftd/why_i_just_sold_50_of_my_bitcoins_ghashio/"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on Reddit titled &amp;ldquo;Why I just sold 50 percent of my bitcoins: GHash.IO,&amp;rdquo; which was upvoted to near the top of the Bitcoin subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;GHash.IO shows that the economic incentives behind Bitcoin are probably very flawed, it might take a disaster to get the consensus to fix it,&amp;rdquo; Todd wrote, &amp;ldquo;and if that happens, I want to make sure I can pay my rent and buy food while we&amp;#39;re fixing it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that no one is saying GHash.IO plans to carry out a 51 percent attack, but the group&amp;rsquo;s ability to do so is troubling to many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	While the Bitcoin community has long feared the 51 percent threat, those of us who aren&amp;rsquo;t seasoned Bitcoin users may not have heard about it until now. In the simplest terms possible, here&amp;rsquo;s how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;big&gt;Wait... mining?&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	Currently, there are nearly 13 million&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/charts/total-bitcoins?timespan=all&amp;amp;showDataPoints=false&amp;amp;daysAverageString=1&amp;amp;show_header=true&amp;amp;scale=0&amp;amp;address="&gt;bitcoins&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in existence, and about 25 new ones are added every 10 minutes through a process called mining. Of course, Bitcoin mining doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve a pickaxe and hardhat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	To mine Bitcoin, one just needs to run the Bitcoin software on a computer. As it&amp;rsquo;s typically explained, the computer will join all the other computers running the software in trying to solve a complex mathematical problem. Whichever computer solves the problem is rewarded with a &amp;ldquo;block,&amp;rdquo; currently worth 25 bitcoins. When enough of the other computers confirm that the solution is legitimate, the block is added to the Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s public ledger, the blockchain, and the computers begin working on the next problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	At this point, no ordinary computer is powerful enough to mine Bitcoin. It takes fantastic computing power to compete, the likes of which you can only get by a machine specifically designed for this type of task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	Even with a custom Bitcoin-mining machine, there is still much competition. Many miners have joined forces to form mining pools in hopes of being able to uncover blocks more regularly, then split the reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;big&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;The 51 percent threat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	The first and most apparent problem with a mining pool that has more than 51 percent of the computing power of the entire network (hashing power, as it&amp;rsquo;s also called) is the potential for double-spending. The people trying to mine Bitcoin are the same ones tasked with auditing the network by confirming Bitcoin transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	If you want to buy Bitcoin from me, first we settle on a price, then you ask the network to confirm that I haven&amp;rsquo;t already spent the Bitcoin I say I&amp;rsquo;m selling to you. When the network signs off on the confirmation, the transaction goes through and those who confirmed it receive a small transaction fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	So, basically, an entity that controls most of the mining power also controls most of the auditing power. If it chooses to act maliciously, that entity could potentially spend the same Bitcoin twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;big&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selfish mining&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	In addition to allowing double-spending, a 51 percent entity could engage in what Bitcoin researchers call &amp;ldquo;selfish mining.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	A person&amp;#39;s or group&amp;rsquo;s ability to mine Bitcoin should be about proportional to the amount of computing power the person or group is contributing to the network. Once an entity controls 51 percent of the computing power, it&amp;rsquo;s possible for the entity to mine much more than 51 percent of new blocks of Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	It works something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	All Bitcoin miners are trying to solve a sort of mathematical problem based on the most recently discovered block on the blockchain, which is called the lead block. Even though there are multiple solutions to each problem, the blockchain must remain as one long continuous entity. It can not be &amp;ldquo;forked.&amp;rdquo; Thus, the first discovered solution to each block is the one that the entire network decides to accept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	If two miners, let&amp;rsquo;s say you and I, discover separate solutions to the lead block&amp;rsquo;s problem and we both try to publish them to the blockchain at near the same time, the network ultimately determines which of us had the first solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s likely some miners will begin hashing on the block you discovered while others will hash on mine. Maybe 75 percent of the miners saw your solution first and began hashing on the block you discovered, but only 25 percent saw mine. In all likelihood those 75 percent will determine a solution to your block before the 25 percent determine a solution to mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	Either way, when an acceptable solution is published for either of the blocks, that part of the chain becomes the longest and all miners resume hashing on the longest continuous chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	A selfish miner looking to execute a 51 percent attack starts by solving that problem but not publishing the solution. While the rest of the network is still searching for that initial solution, the selfish miner begins working on the next problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	If the selfish miner solves the second problem before the rest of the miners solve the first, the network is in deep trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	The selfish miner continues to secretly get as far ahead as possible. When the other miners eventually publish a solution to the initial problem, the selfish miners immediately publish their hidden solution causing a fork. Then, as the network goes to determine which solution came first, the selfish miners publish their second solution making their chain the longest and thus the most legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	Not only that, but the selfish miners have a head start in hashing off the second published block. They might have already found the solution. They might be 20 blocks ahead and no one would know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	If this happens, honest Bitcoin miners have no chance to discover new blocks, and all the rewards go to the selfish miner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	Cornell researchers Emin G&amp;uuml;n Sirer and Ittay Eyal have even argued that a selfish mining attack is possible with less than 50 percent of the network&amp;rsquo;s computing resources in a 2013&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0243"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;titled &amp;ldquo;Majority is not Enough: Bitcoin Mining is Vulnerable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	At the time, it seemed implausible to many that a pool would ever grow to 51 percent. The Bitcoin community has historically been relatively good at self-policing, and a 51 percent pool would be bad for business because it would rattle everyone&amp;rsquo;s confidence in Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		When we discovered selfish mining, we cautioned &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bitcoin&amp;amp;src=hash"&gt;#bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; that pools could grow to 51%. Bitcoiners claimed &amp;quot;no one would do that.&amp;quot; Mwhaha.&lt;/p&gt;
	&amp;mdash; Emin G&amp;uuml;n Sirer (@el33th4xor) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/statuses/477412399352643584"&gt;June 13, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;big&gt;Is this the end of Bitcoin?&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	This wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a true Bitcoin story without talking about how Bitcoin could be doomed. In reality, Bitcoin has proved time and again that it is resilient, and it has overcome many obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	Earlier this year, GHash.IO released a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://ghash.io/ghashio_press_release.pdf"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, saying it was &amp;ldquo;preventing accumulation of 51 percent of all hashing power.&amp;rdquo; That was when the pool controlled just over 40 percent of the hashing power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;GHash.IO does not have any intentions to execute a 51 percent attack, as it will do serious damage to the Bitcoin community, of which we are part of,&amp;rdquo; the statement reads. &amp;ldquo;If something happened to Bitcoin as a whole, it could risk our investments in physical hardware, damage those who love Bitcoin and we see no benefit from having 51 percent stake in mining.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	GHash.IO has not replied to our inquiry as to its apparent change of heart.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/news/bitcoin-mining-pool-ghash-io-is-unapologetic-risk-theoretical-51-attack/2014/06/12"&gt;CryptoCoinsNews&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;got in touch with Jeffrey Smith, the chief information officer of Cex.io, which is a cloud-based Bitcoin mining company that&amp;rsquo;s associated with GHash.IO. Smith said the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
		We understand that the Bitcoin community strongly reacts to GHash.IO&amp;rsquo;s percentage of the total hash rate. However, we would never do anything to harm the Bitcoin economy; we believe in it. We have invested all our effort, time and money into the development of the Bitcoin economy. We agree that mining should be decentralised, but you cannot blame GHash.IO for being the number one mining pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	Not exactly a confidence-inspiring response, but the situation is not quite dire for the moment, as GHash.IO has dipped back down below 50 percent control of the network, according to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/pools?timespan=24hrs"&gt;this nifty tool&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that most view as somewhat accurate. Other&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://blockorigin.pfoe.be/chart.php"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;have GHash.IO at closer to 40 percent of the mining power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	It is possible, however, that some members left the pool to avoid shaking up the Bitcoin community&amp;rsquo;s confidence at a time when the value of the cryptocurrency has been trending upward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://cdn0.dailydot.com/uploaded/images/original/2014/6/12/Bitcoin_price.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bitcoin price chart June 13, 2014." src="http://cdn0.dailydot.com/uploaded/images/original/2014/6/12/Bitcoin_price.png" style="width: 640px; height: 271px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	One way or another, this appears to be an important crossroads for Bitcoin, and an issue so often-discussed that it seemed inevitable that it would one day come to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In fact, the 51 percent attack is even something Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s anonymous creator, &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/satoshi-nakamoto/"&gt;Satoshi Nakamoto&lt;/a&gt;, foresaw and wrote about in Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s now-famous&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"&gt;founding document&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Since there&amp;rsquo;s no more appropriate way to close a discussion on Bitcoin than with Nakamoto&amp;rsquo;s own words, here they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
		If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

	The U.S. government is about to plunge into the &lt;a href="http://dailydot.com/tags/bitcoin/"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; business in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	Through the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), the government plans to auction off nearly 30,000&amp;nbsp;bitcoins&amp;nbsp;that it says once resided on the servers of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://dailydot.com/tags/silk-road/"&gt;Silk Road&lt;/a&gt;, a vast online marketplace for drugs and other contraband&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/crime/silk-road-dread-pirate-roberts-arrested-shut-down/"&gt;shuttered by the FBI&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on Oct. 1 last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn0.dailydot.com/uploaded/images/original/2014/6/12/marshals.png" style="width: 629px; height: 263px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	The auction will take place during a 12-hour period on June 27, according to the USMS&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.usmarshals.gov/assets/2014/bitcoins/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Interested parties must register to bid on the trove of Bitcoin, a process that includes putting up a refundable $200,000 deposit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	At the time the government seized the digital currency, it was worth about $3.6 million; it&amp;rsquo;s now valued at more than $17.5 million by current exchange rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	The government appears to have picked a particularly fortuitous time for the auction as the price of Bitcoin has increased by more than $150 in recent weeks. But with more than two weeks to go, it&amp;rsquo;s anyone&amp;rsquo;s guess at where the historically volatile cryptocurrency&amp;rsquo;s value will settle by the day of the auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	ZeroBlock, a Bitcoin sentinel of sorts, first realized something was happening with the Silk Road bitcoins, when it noticed they had been transferred out of the &amp;ldquo;Silk Road Seized Coins&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1F1tAaz5x1HUXrCNLbtMDqcw6o5GNn4xqX"&gt;wallet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;the government was known to be using for storage and placed in a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1Ez69SnzzmePmZX3WpEzMKTrcBF2gpNQ55"&gt;new Bitcoin wallet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	The government is also sitting on a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1i7cZdoE9NcHSdAL5eGjmTJbBVqeQDwgw"&gt;separate stash&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of more than 144,000 bitcoins ($84 million) that it said came from a hard drive belonging to &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/tags/ross-ulbricht/"&gt;Ross William Ulbricht&lt;/a&gt;, who is charged with owning and operating Silk Road for more than two and a half years under the alias &amp;ldquo;Dread Pirate Roberts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;
	Ulbricht has pleaded not guilty to all charges, and his trial begins in November. His lawyer, Joshua Dratel, told&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/06/12/silk-road-bitcoin-on-the-move-as-government-prepares-to-auction-off-18-million-worth/"&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that Ulbricht&amp;rsquo;s Bitcoin will stay put until the result of the criminal case against him is determined.&lt;/p&gt;
