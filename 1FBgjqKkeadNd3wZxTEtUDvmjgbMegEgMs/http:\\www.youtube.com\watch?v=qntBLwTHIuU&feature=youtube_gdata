Sponsor: http://LRN.FM - Ron Paul: Euro collapse imminent.This clip's part of a playlist series. Watch the series in sequence...by clicking here: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=...Some of the video in this clip is probably available for you to use commercially. Basically that would mean any part of the clip that has the URL "RidleyReport.com" burned into it at the bottom or was obviously shot by me. That is released into the public domain by me. Or it was public domain to begin with. If it says "YouTube.com/WinWinParty" at the bottom, that means the same thing.Like what you see? You can donate to the Ridley Report, via Bitcoin.
