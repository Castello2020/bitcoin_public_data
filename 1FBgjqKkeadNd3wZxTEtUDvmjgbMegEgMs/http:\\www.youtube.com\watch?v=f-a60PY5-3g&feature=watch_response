Sponsor: http://LRN.FM - CNN stares me down! Senior photojournalist with apparent ties to the president...shows me his Glare of Doom after I film his reporter, Dana Bash. His name is Peter Morris, and our encounter occurred at Ron Paul's NH primary celebration on Jan. 10. Morris's pro-government blog: http://whitehouse.blogs.cnn.com/tag/c...This clip's part of a playlist series. Watch the series in sequence...by clicking here: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=...Related vids: Ridley asks Dana Bash for interview (previous vid in this series): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHFGjy...Moe's incident vids show elements of media crowd had become violent: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7LJ2Z... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSXmsy...Paul bails on Bash interview over question content: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDlY5U...Polite, unhappy crowd swarms Dana Bash: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geQnTX...Ridley's concerns over Bash's other treatment part 1: http://ridleyreport.podomatic.com/pla...Ridley's concerns over Bash's other treatment part 2 (vid) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4o9fb...Some of the video in this clip is probably available for you to use commercially. Basically any part of the clip that has the URL "RidleyReport.com" burned into it at the bottom or was obviously shot by me. That is released into the public domain by me. Or it was public domain to begin with. If it says "YouTube.com/WinWinParty" at the bottom, that means the same thing.Like what you see? You can donate to the Ridley Report via Bitcoin. Here's my BC address:1FBgjqKkeadNd3wZxTEtUDvmjgbMegEgMsThe wallet is kept almost empty for security reasons. Fill it up a bit if you like!
