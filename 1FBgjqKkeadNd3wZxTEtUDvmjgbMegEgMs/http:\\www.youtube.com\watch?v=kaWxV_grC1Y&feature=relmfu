Sponsor: http://LRN.FM - Authoritarian crows over free stater's harsh sentence. Music by Jandy...the "hottie with a synthesizer:" http://YouTube.com/JezebelDecibelSome of the video in this clip is probably available 4 you to use commercially. Basically any part of the clip that has the URL "RidleyReport.com" burned into it at the bottom or was obviously shot by me. That is released into the public domain...by me. Or it was public domain to begin with. If it says "YouTube.com/WinWinParty" at the bottom, that means the same thing.Like what ya see? You can donate to the Ridley Report most easily using Bitcoin.
