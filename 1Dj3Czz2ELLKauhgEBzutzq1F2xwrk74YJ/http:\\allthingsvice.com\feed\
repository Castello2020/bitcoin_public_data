				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>‘This could be it. This could be the killer application for bitcoin’ </em></strong>– Free Talk Live host, March 2011</p>
<div id="attachment_596" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://allthingsvice.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/screen-shot-2014-06-16-at-1-33-07-pm.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-596" src="http://allthingsvice.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/screen-shot-2014-06-16-at-1-33-07-pm.png?w=300&#038;h=240" alt="Old School Silk Road... it came a long way" width="300" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Old School Silk Road&#8230; it came a long way</p></div>
<p>Whilst researching the early days of Silk Road for my book, I came across a wonderful little piece of history: a radio show by <a href="www.freetalklive.com" target="_blank"><em>Free Talk Live</em></a> which ran a <a href="http://ec.libsyn.com/p/9/f/9/9f9ca558cc4631f7/FTL2011-03-16.mp3?d13a76d516d9dec20c3d276ce028ed5089ab1ce3dae902ea1d06c88532d9cd589383&amp;c_id=3126600" target="_blank">comprehensive piece</a> on Silk Road on 17 March 2011 – around six weeks after Silk Road had launched and a good two-and-a-half months before Adrian Chen’s <a href="http://gawker.com/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imag-30818160" target="_blank">Gawker article</a>. At the time, Silk Road had 151 registered users, 38 listings and 28 transactions to date. By the time it was shuttered in October 2013, it had just shy of a million registered users.</p>
<p><span id="more-595"></span></p>
<p>At around 48 minutes into the program, the hosts discuss Bitcoin, which they said, is worth “almost a buck”. One of the hosts says he started mining, but then figured it would take two years to generate 50 bitcoins – “not worth it”.</p>
<p>Then it moves on to Silk Road at about 58 minutes in. ‘I’ve come across something I think is really interesting… it can really make things interesting as far as Bitcoin is concerned, as far as the black market is concerned. And I’m talking about drugs,’ says one of the hosts. ‘One of the hallmarks of black markets is, unfortunately, crappy quality and crappy service. . . Service is unreliable at best and prices typically exorbitant. And there’s a lot of danger…What happens when the internet gets into black markets?’</p>
<p>A good twenty minutes of the program is dedicated to discussing Silk Road and they seemed to have a pretty solid handle on it. They bring up the potential for harm minimisation and crime reduction, and seem impressed by the potential for plausible deniability. But most of all, they look at how online black markets can reduce drug-related violence. ‘All kinds of violence surrounds the black market. One of the goals of us when we talk on <em>Free Talk Live</em> is to minimize the harm that is done’, they say.</p>
<p>Being a talkback show, they invited listeners to call in.</p>
<p>‘This sounds like a website set up by the CIA.’ said first caller, Larry. ‘They’re preying on us already through the internet and through Google’. But we sort of lost where Larry was going went into a rambling discussion about his daughter’s internet dating experiences.</p>
<p>‘Of course,’ the hosts said, ‘nobody knows who’s running the Silk Road’</p>
<p>Well they knew, sort of. Long before the moniker &#8220;Dread Pirate Roberts&#8221; was ever attached to the online black markets, a forum member called “silkroad” had been ethusiastically spruiking his new site on the Bitcoin forums.</p>
<p>‘Thanks for this awesome idea, silkroad,’ FTA host Ian wrote on the forum. ‘I am so impressed, I promoted it on my national radio program tonight. Hope you don&#8217;t mind the publicity’.</p>
<p>‘How cool!’ silkroad responded. ‘How big is your audience?’</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>VICE is onto the documentary, yours truly is bringing a book out. But who would&#8217;ve guessed that the most notorious online black market in the world could be coming to a theatre near you?</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="http://allthingsvice.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/screen-shot-2014-05-26-at-5-25-33-pm.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-592" src="http://allthingsvice.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/screen-shot-2014-05-26-at-5-25-33-pm.png?w=614" alt="Screen Shot 2014-05-26 at 5.25.33 pm"   /></a></p>
<p>Emerging playwright Alex Oates plans to bring his one-man play to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival this year. Like many young writers, he’s hoping to raise the funds for it – at least GBP11,000 – via crowdfunding. But his approach is a little different.</p>
<p><span id="more-591"></span></p>
<p>‘I want to have the first play funded by bitcoin’ says 26-year-old Alex. ‘How cool would that be?’</p>
<p>He won’t be the first person to ask the bitcoin community to help kickstart a project, but he may garner more interest than most – because <a href="http://www.silkroadtheplay.com">Alex’s play is called </a><em><a href="http://www.silkroadtheplay.com">Silk Road</a>.</em> It’s a fictional tale based on the most notorious online black market in the world, which was instrumental in bitcoin’s early rise in value.</p>
<p>The promo for the play claims that it ‘both controversially instructs budding online drug dealers and cautions us against the dangers of the dark web’.</p>
<p>‘The play is quite instructional in that it talks about exactly how you go about buying drugs on Silk Road,’ admits Alex. ‘It tells you how to download Tor and how to get bitcoins, things like that. That’s one theme. But its also about drug safety and the reality about what its like when you buy things like street cocaine which is often cut. And as well as the drugs and Silk Road, its about being popular and growing up and young love and things like that’.</p>
<p>It’s a comedy ‘sort of’ about a young Newcastle man, Bruce, from a council estate who lives with his gran. Gran’s eBay business booms overnight when he starts selling wraps of cocaine in the tea cozies she sells. Bruce finds the popularity and acceptance he never had among the community of Silk Road. But things go south when Ross Ulbricht (allegedly the Dread Pirate Roberts, owner of the site) is arrested, Silk Road is shuttered and Bruce owes a lot of money to some very real local drug dealers. Actor James Baxter plays all of the parts.</p>
<p>So why a play about Silk Road?</p>
<p>‘I found out about Silk Road about a year and a half ago when somebody told me about it because they’d used it,’ he told me, ‘and it just completely blew my mind that it was possible to buy drugs on the internet’. A drug reform advocate – he’s a fan of David Nutt &#8211; Alex was curious what the online platform could mean for the drug debate. ‘I just don’t think people took it seriously enough in the press and the way its been handled. I think that Silk Road has a massive potential to change the way that we look at drug policy’.</p>
<p>Alex began lurking the site, asking questions and interacting with the members and realised there was a story there he could use in his art. At first, he didn’t tell the other members about his plans for a play as he was afraid of a hostile reaction. ‘I just sat on the forums asking questions about general things. Mostly about postage – that’s quite a part of the play, how you actually receive drugs in the post, how they get past customs and things like that’.</p>
<p>Recently Alex came out to the Silk Road forums as author of a play. He was surprised and pleased that some of the first suggestions to him were to put links to harm reduction websites and services on his home page. ‘You know these are really discerning users. They really do care about people, and I think that’s really important to point out because the media really demonises them,&#8217; he says. &#8216;They really demonise anybody who speaks up and makes a case for drugs. Because it’s an easy political point I guess’.</p>
<p>Alex says he doesn’t want to be seen as promoting buying and selling drugs online, but has aimed to be as balanced and accurate as possible in his portrayal of Silk Road, whilst still providing audiences with an entertaining and informative hour.</p>
<p>‘I think Silk Road is brilliant in the way that it gives you the opportunity to exercise your own personal freedom and liberty,’ he said. ‘I think it’s dangerous in that it’s quite hard to realise what you’re doing from your bedroom at the click of a button from the perspective of exactly how illegal it is’.</p>
<p>Since coming out on the Silk Road forums, the play already has a bitcoin sponsor. ‘We got two bitcoins this morning which I was incredibly excited about. That’s from one person. I don’t know who it was from, but I’m thinking it was from a Silk Road user.’</p>
<p>Directed by Dominic Shaw, the play is also supported and funded by <a href="http://www.kevinspaceyfoundation.com">The Kevin Spacey Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>The Edinburgh Fringe Festival runs from 1-25 August 2014.</p>
<p>Bitcoin donations for the play can be made to 1Dj3Czz2ELLKauhgEBzutzq1F2xwrk74YJ</p>

<div id="attachment_585" style="width: 381px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://allthingsvice.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/screen-shot-2014-03-21-at-2-50-04-pm.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-585" alt="Sometimes Yo Ho Ho became Hee Hee Hee" src="http://allthingsvice.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/screen-shot-2014-03-21-at-2-50-04-pm.png?w=614"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sometimes Yo Ho Ho became Hee Hee Hee</p></div>
<p>Last month I attended a Q&amp;A session with the cofounder of The Pirate Bay (and User No.7), Tobias Andersson. He was one hell of a speaker and entertained the Melbourne Hack’n’Tell group for well over an hour, his speech peppered with jokes and wry observations.</p>
<p>Although Tobias answered questions on all manner of serious subjects thrown at him about copyright, the future of The Pirate Bay and government surveillance, he was most animated when talking about the fun times and practical jokes they played over the years.</p>
<p><span id="more-584"></span></p>
<p>In 2002 a bunch of bored hackers and anarchists got together on an IRC channel and decided “We should do something fun!” Their idea of fun was a little out there compared to others, being hackers and anarchists and bored and all.</p>
<p>The first fun thing they did was set up a website (Tobias couldn’t remember what it was called but said it roughly translated into “The Currency Thingy”) to disrupt the election in 2002 because they thought a single currency for all of Europe was really stupid.  They decided there was a market in selling votes.  ‘We made a lot of fake profiles of people selling their votes,’ he said. ‘Like a middle aged businessman who said <em>Yeah, you can have my vote for 10 bucks</em>.’ Their joke received a lot of media attention which they enjoyed very much. It spurred them on. ‘By doing that we found out it was kind of fun to play with the media and kind of fun to disrupt stuff’, he said.</p>
<p>At the time a lobby group called the Anti-Pirate Bureau was active representing the Swedish film and computer game industry against pirates. ‘We thought hey, if there’s an Anti-Pirate Bureau, we should be like the Pirate Bureau. We’ll be, like, pro-piracy and stuff’. Thus The Pirate Bay was born.</p>
<p>But they never took themselves too seriously. ‘We played a lot of jokes on people over the years which has been real fun,’ said Tobias.  Because The Pirate Bay was never meant to be for profit, they didn’t much care if they alienated their user base and lost support so long as they got a laugh.</p>
<p>‘One day we thought “we should play a trick on the users, yeah!” so we made this sign: “Cease and Desist. We are FBI.  Your ID will be tracked” And we got a lot of hate for that, but it was a lot of fun. If our point had been making money out of this that would probably have been a stupid decision, to scare our customers away’.</p>
<p>This started a string of practical jokes, sometimes purposely to garner as much media attention for their cause as they could and sometimes just for the lulz.  Like the time they announced they were buying eBay:</p>
<blockquote><p>BREAKING NEWS In a bid on Auction site eBay, for the site of eBay.com itself, Pirate Bay (TPB) has come out as the official winner. We saw that eBay was up for sale on their own site and since we have a long going law suit against them for abuse of our trademark name \&#8221;pirat(ebay)\&#8221;, we wanted to be pragmatic and just use our immense profits to buy them. This will hopefully make us spend less time with the lawsuit. TPB will use the tools from eBay to make a better rating system for torrents. Then TPB will divide eBay up into smaller companies and sell to the highest bidders. We see no use for an auction site since most stuff is available for free. eBay.com will in the future be redirected to thepiratebay.org, and hopefully this will put TPB into the top 5 internet sites today. Please return to this blog for further updates later.</p></blockquote>
<p>April Fools Day always saw The Pirate Bay announce it was moving its servers; one year to North Korea, another to the Egyptian desert and another to the United States (<em>We hereby announce that we have moved our servers from the evil North Korea to the greatest fuckin nation in the entire world. The United States of America, fuck yeah!</em>), where they would become The Freedom Bay.  Every time, many users – and often the media – were sucked in.</p>
<p>Even though the 2013 announcement that TPB’s servers were moving to North Korea (<i>We can reveal that we have been invited by the leader of the Republic of Korea, to fight our battles from their network</i> the website said gravely) was a hoax, several years earlier The Pirate Bay really did almost find themselves being hosted from Korean soil.</p>
<p>‘True story, yeah,’ said Tobias. ‘So in Stockholm Sweden, there’s a North Korean embassy. We got to know one guy who knew another guy, who knew another guy, who actually worked at the embassy and we were like, hey, we should place the servers in North Korea. That would be so cool. So we got in contact with him and said we want to place this in the embassy, is that okay? And he said “yeah, sure”’.  They set the wheels in motion, until suddenly the emails stopped.  ‘Sadly the guy moved back to North Korea. We don’t know the reason. But we were so close to being on North Korean soil and that would’ve been so funny’.</p>
<p>With all these countries hostile to hosting The Pirate Bay, why not get their <i>own</i> country? They gave it a go once.</p>
<p>‘We found this ad somewhere of this guy just outside of England who owned this oil platform,’ said Tobias.  “The guy” was Roy Bates, who seized a floating pontoon from a group of pirate radio broadcasters in 1967 and subsequently declared it a sovereign state, called Sealand.  He anointed himself Prince of Sealand.</p>
<p>‘We thought, hey, <i>we</i> should have our own country, that would be cool. We can say we have our servers there and nobody would be able to attack us and we can have cannons and stuff,’ said Tobias. ‘So we started this crowdfunding, saying “Hey we wanna buy a nation!”’.</p>
<p>Pirate Bay followers were enthusiastic (<i>I’m gonna move there! That would be so cool! Fuck Yeah!</i>) and they soon raised $80,000 for their project.</p>
<p>They contacted the Royal Family of Sealand and discovered they were amenable to selling, but wanted more like $65 million.  When they heard the counter-offer of significantly less than that, ‘They stopped replying to our emails,’ Tobias sighed. ‘So we actually bought a little bit of rainforest for the money instead. In the jungle somewhere. I have, like a diploma or something back home’.</p>
<p>So the search for a friendly place to host their pirate website continued.  Then the organizers hit upon a brainwave.  ‘We released a statement that said we were gonna place the servers up in the clouds – like the <b>actual</b> clouds,’ Tobias said. ‘We were gonna buy a bunch of weather balloons and send them off into space&#8217;. This dream also, sadly, fizzled out.  &#8216;I personally actually bought a lot of weather balloons, but never got around to getting the specs of how we were gonna transmit the signals back to earth and all that’.</p>
<p>Tobias says he is a full time student and father now, no longer involved in The Pirate Bay. But he had a whole load of fun while he was. And about the jokes: ‘<i>Half of the world got it, and half of the world didn’t get it…’</i> he grinned.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/allthingsvice.wordpress.com/584/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/allthingsvice.wordpress.com/584/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=allthingsvice.com&#038;blog=36658613&#038;post=584&#038;subd=allthingsvice&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A surreal story has been playing out in the last 24 hours or so, ever since <i>Newsweek</i> promised the biggest story of the crypto-year. The unmasking of Satoshi Nakamoto. And the Real Satoshi may have just come out of the woodwork to respond.</p>
<p>50 minutes ago, this post appeared on the <a href="http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/profile/SatoshiNakamoto">P2P Foundation forum</a>, the same place Nakamoto unleashed his White Paper on Bitcoin in 2009:</p>
<p><a href="http://allthingsvice.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/screen-shot-2014-03-07-at-1-05-45-pm.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-580" alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-07 at 1.05.45 pm" src="http://allthingsvice.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/screen-shot-2014-03-07-at-1-05-45-pm.png?w=614"   /></a></p>
<p>Most likely a joke on the part of the administrators of the forum. But what prompted the post? A series of events that have reached high farce.</p>
<p><span id="more-579"></span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">In the <a href="http://mag.newsweek.com/2014/03/14/bitcoin-satoshi-nakamoto.html"><em>Newsweek </em>story</a>, Journalist Leah McGrath claimed that Satoshi Nakamoto was… Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, a 64-year-old Japanese-American living a humble life in suburban Las Angeles. In a feature that bordered on harassment of the man – he called the police to support him as he spoke to McGrath – photos of a nondescript, aging man and his modest house belied the myth. </span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Newsweek decided to post pictures of a man and his easily-identifiable house, along with an estimate of his net worth, for the world to see. </span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">His fortune – the so-called “genesis block” of the first Bitcoins mined and still untouched – by this time would be worth over $400 million.</span></p>
<p>‘Tacitly acknowledging his role in the Bitcoin project, he looks down, staring at the pavement and categorically refuses to answer questions.’ wrote McGrath.</p>
<p>&#8216;I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it,&#8217; Nakamoto allegedly told the reporter. &#8216;It&#8217;s been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.&#8217; As there was no context to the sole quote of the man, it is hard to say whether he was talking about Bitcoin.</p>
<p>With no more words coming from Nakamoto himself, the rest of the story focussed on a two-month investigation and conversations with family and friends. Nakamoto, they said, had worked on classified projects for the government. And he liked model trains. Flimsy though the evidence was, the story set off a media frenzy, with newspapers around the world picking up the story.  Soon reporters and journalists were camped outside the house, jostling for position and taking pictures through the screen door.</p>
<p>In a bizarre and somewhat surreal scene, Nakamoto emerged from his house, looking for a lift for sushi. ‘No, no questions right now. I want a free lunch. I&#8217;m not involved in Bitcoin. Wait a minute. I want free lunch first. I&#8217;m going to go with this guy,’ he said, indicating a reporter from Associated Press. Ignoring Nakamoto’s own Corolla, the two took off in the journalist’s car, with all the less-favoured following in a slow-speed chase, which was duly photographed and tweeted as it happened.</p>
<p>Investigative journalists used the lunch break to track down early online musings of the man enjoying his sushi. Andy Greenberg of <em>Forbes </em>turned up<a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/OSCALEMODELERS/conversations/topics/2743"> this piece</a> of writing. Not so similar to the White Paper.</p>
<p>At the lunch, the sickly man <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/6/5479660/newly-exposed-founder-of-bitcoin-now-denies-founding-bitcoin">emphatically denied</a> having any involvement in Bitcoin. He said English was not his first language and that the reporter had misunderstood him.</p>
<p>Tweeter @CryptoCobain, suggested setting up a Bitcoin Lunch Fund so that Not-Satoshi can have free sushi for a year. The fund might also help pay the harassed man&#8217;s medical bills.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The </span><em style="line-height:1.5em;">Newsweek </em><span style="line-height:1.5em;">story came hot on the heels of a brilliantly-researched and thoroughly more convincing story in the UK&#8217;s </span><em style="line-height:1.5em;">The Sunday Times</em><span style="line-height:1.5em;">, &#8220;</span><a style="line-height:1.5em;" href="http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/Magazine/article1379779.ece">Desperately Seeking Satoshi</a><span style="line-height:1.5em;">&#8221; by Andrew Smith. Unfortunately you&#8217;ll need a subscription or a friend who&#8217;s willing to scan the hard copy to you to read it.</span></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/allthingsvice.wordpress.com/579/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/allthingsvice.wordpress.com/579/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=allthingsvice.com&#038;blog=36658613&#038;post=579&#038;subd=allthingsvice&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>I took may Mac to the Genius Bar recently and the genius decided I need to do a full clean reinstall. I had done a Time Machine backup before going, so I didn’t think much of it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I foolishly neglected to export my private key to a USB before doing the reinstall. I thought I would get my key back by restoring from the backup. Newsflash: that doesn’t work.</p>
<p>So I can’t decrypt anything encrypted to my old key. Apologies for any inconvenience this causes.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/allthingsvice.wordpress.com/572/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/allthingsvice.wordpress.com/572/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=allthingsvice.com&#038;blog=36658613&#038;post=572&#038;subd=allthingsvice&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>SSBD had no role to play in the Silk Road marketplace where drugs were bought and sold.  He was a moderator of the Silk Road discussion forum, which had its own URL and was hosted on a different server to the marketplace. So why is the US so determined to extradite someone who may or may not be him?</strong></em></p>
<p>Peter Philip Nash has been sitting in a Brisbane jail cell since 20 December 2013.</p>
<p>He is facing extradition to the United States to face allegations of narcotics conspiracy (maximum sentence of life in prison and a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years); conspiracy to commit computer hacking (maximum 5 years) and money laundering conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.</p>
<p><a href="http://allthingsvice.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/scales-of-injustice.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-560" src="http://allthingsvice.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/scales-of-injustice.jpg?w=614" alt="scales-of-injustice"   /></a></p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://cryptome.org/2013/12/silk-road-indictments.pdf" target="_blank">US Indictment</a>, Nash was known online as “samesamebutdifferent”, better known to Silk Road members as SSBD. SSBD was a well-loved moderator of the now defunct Silk Road discussion forums (<a href="http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php" target="_blank">new forums</a>, colloquially known as SR2, have replaced the old). His job was to answer questions, explain the rules, move posts to their proper forum (with over a million posts, many were bound to wind up in the wrong place) and generally attend to banal administrative tasks.</p>
<p>In any event, Nash may or may not be SSBD.  But even if he is. What exactly was SSBD&#8217;s crime?</p>
<p><span id="more-559"></span></p>
<p>All I have to go on is the indictment. I don’t know what other information the authorities have, but if all they have is what is in the indictment, it would be a travesty if Australia was to agree to deport him.</p>
<p>SSBD had no role to play in the Silk Road marketplace where drugs were bought and sold.  He was a moderator of the Silk Road <i>discussion forum</i>, which had its own URL and was hosted on a different server to the marketplace. His job was confined to that site.</p>
<p>Two others who were arrested concurrently – Andrew Jones (aka Inigo) and Gary Davis (Libertas) – <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/01/09/silk-road-bail/" target="_blank">were immediately released on bail</a> under the laws of the USA and Ireland respectively. According to the Indictment, Inigo and Libertas <i>did</i> have roles on the marketplace as well as the forums. The indictment differentiates the two where it says:</p>
<p><i>“Inigo”… worked as a site administrator on Silk Road</i></p>
<p><i>“Libertas” ”… worked as a site administrator on Silk Road</i></p>
<p><i>“Samesamebutdifferent”… worked as the primary moderator on the Silk Road <b>discussion forums</b></i><b> </b>(my emphasis)</p>
<p>Nash was not granted bail because under the Australian <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/" target="_blank"><i>Extradition Act 1988</i></a>, ‘A magistrate or eligible Federal Circuit Court Judge shall not remand a person on bail under this section unless there are special circumstances justifying such remand’. It seems Nash could not fulfil the “special circumstances” requirement.</p>
<p>Next Wednesday, Nash is due back in court for a magistrate to determine whether he is “eligible for surrender” to the US. If so, Nash will be remanded in custody until the next phase of the proceedings – surrender or review (or he can consent to extradition).</p>
<p>Under s.19 of the Act, he will be eligible for surrender to US authorities if the magistrate is satisfied:</p>
<p>(a)  the supporting documents in relation to the offence have been produced to the magistrate or Judge;</p>
<p>(b)   any additional requirements imposed by the US-Australia Extradition Treaty are satisfied</p>
<p>(c)  the conduct would have constituted an extradition offence if it had occurred in Australia, and</p>
<p>(d)  there are no substantial grounds for believing that there is an <b>extradition objection</b> in relation to the offence</p>
<p>Now, a disclaimer. Although I was a lawyer in my deep dark past, I have <i>zero</i> experience with either crime or extradition law. So I don’t know any more than anyone else. These are simply my uninformed opinions after looking at the Act and extradition treaty, and knowing from two years of investigating Silk Road what SSBD’s role consisted of.</p>
<p><b>19(b) &#8211; any additional requirements imposed by the US-Australia Extradition Treaty are satisfied</b></p>
<p>Article VI of the Treaty says: ‘<i>Extradition shall be granted only if the evidence is found sufficient, according to the laws in the territory where the person whose extradition is requested is found, either to justify his trial or committal for trial if the offence with which he is charged or its equivalent had been committed in that territory</i>’</p>
<p>Like I said, I don’t know what evidence they have, so I can only go on the Indictment. It seems to me “evidence” is pretty lacking in that document.</p>
<p>First, I have no idea what evidence the US authorities have that Nash is SSBD. They may have found some correspondence on the Silk Road servers between he and the site’s owner, Dread Pirate Roberts. Or perhaps Ross Ulbricht, the man accused of being Dread Pirate Roberts, provided his details in an attempt at a plea bargain. Ulbricht, it should be noted, has denied being DPR, and has denied all charges, so this seems unlikely. The indictment claims SSBD was paid around $50,000 per year. This presumably was paid in Bitcoin. It is possible, though again unlikely, that the Bitcoin trail was followed to Nash’s bank account.</p>
<p>Most likely, the “evidence” is an email from an anonymous email account or a message through an anonymous private claiming that SSBD’s real name is Peter Nash. Not too compelling.</p>
<p>This requirement for evidence is also relevant to the next two stipulations.</p>
<p><b>19(c) – the conduct would have constituted an extradition offence if it had occurred in Australia</b></p>
<p>The wording says “conduct” not “crimes of which the person is accused”. The only <span style="text-decoration:underline;">conduct</span> I could find attributed to SSBD in the indictment was:</p>
<p>(1)   in relation to the narcotics charge: <i>sent a message to Dread Pirate Roberts, owner of Silk Road, summarising the actions he had taken during the previous week in his capacity as the primary forum moderator on the Silk Road discussion forums.</i></p>
<p>-        I doubt that sending a message from one anonymous online account to another anonymous online account constitutes an extradition offence</p>
<p>-        The narcotics charge is the only charge to have any “<b>overt acts</b>” (which sounds similar to “conduct” to me) listed underneath the charges attributable to SSBD</p>
<p>(2)   in relation to the hacking charge: <i>intentionally accessed computers without authorisation for commercial advantage and private financial gain, and in furtherance of criminal and tortious acts</i></p>
<p>-        no “overt acts” were listed under this charge; the above was a general accusation aimed at all three defendants; this does not sound like it could be considered “conduct of the person constituting the offence,” which is what the Act requires</p>
<p>-        I would be interested to see what evidence they have that SSBD accessed computers without authorisation. There would certainly be no need to do so in order to carry out his functions of moderating a discussion forum. He would have carried out his duties on his own computer, logging in to the Silk Road administration panel (at least the small part he had access to), completely authorised to do so.</p>
<p>(3)   in relation to the money laundering charge: <i>conduct and attempt to conduct such financial transactions which in fact involved the proceeds of specified unlawful activity, to wit, narcotics trafficking and computer hacking</i></p>
<p>-        no “overt acts” were listed under this charge; the above was a general accusation aimed at all three defendants; this does not sound like it could be considered “conduct of the person constituting the offence,” which is what the Act requires</p>
<p>-        again, I would be interested to see what evidence they have that SSBD conducted or attempted to conduct illegal financial transactions – especially as conducting any transactions whatsoever was explicitly banned on the Silk Road <i>forums</i>, the only site SSBD had access to in any sort of administrative capacity. Not surprisingly, Dread Pirate Roberts wanted to keep all financial transactions on the marketplace, where he received a commission for each one</p>
<p><b>19(d)  there are no substantial grounds for believing that there is an extradition objection in relation to the offence</b></p>
<p>“Extradition objections” (s.7) include:</p>
<p><i>“(b)  the surrender of the person, in so far as it <span style="text-decoration:underline;">purports</span> to be sought for the extradition offence, is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">actually</span> sought for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing the person on account of his or her race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, nationality or <b>political opinions</b> …; or </i></p>
<p><i>(c)  on surrender to the extradition country in respect of the extradition offence, the person may be prejudiced at his or her trial, or punished, detained or restricted in his or her personal liberty, by reason of his or her race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, nationality or <b>political opinions</b>;” </i></p>
<p>(my emphasis)</p>
<p>This probably isn’t much of a legal argument, but in the real world, this whole extradition attempt smacks of politics. It’s all show so that politicians can trumpet a win on their long-doomed War on Drugs. Spending this sort of taxpayers’ money to extradite a man who may or may not have been paid a paltry $50K a year to perform mundane administration tasks on what was purely a website for discussions? There is no suggestion that Nash sold drugs himself. Hell, there’s not even a suggestion that he <i>bought</i> drugs. Just these trumped-up charges so conservatives can parade him in front of the media, claiming they’ve brought down some sort of evil drug cartel.</p>
<p>According to the Attorney-General’s Department Annual Reports, most extradition requests are to return ex-pats, not Australian citizens. They tend to be for fugitives that have escaped with hundreds of millions of fraudulently-obtained funds, or child sex predators of the most heinous kind.</p>
<p>The United States requests extradition of <i>two to four</i> people from Australia a year. Should Peter Nash really be one of them?</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/allthingsvice.wordpress.com/559/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/allthingsvice.wordpress.com/559/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=allthingsvice.com&#038;blog=36658613&#038;post=559&#038;subd=allthingsvice&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="http://allthingsvice.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/screen-shot-2014-02-12-at-11-12-24-pm.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-569" alt="Screen Shot 2014-02-12 at 11.12.24 pm" src="http://allthingsvice.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/screen-shot-2014-02-12-at-11-12-24-pm.png?w=614"   /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-551"></span></p>
<p>All,</p>
<p>As the last remaining moderator of the forum I feel it is my obligation to warn all of you that the DPR account might be compromised.</p>
<p>When the news broke about the arrests of Inigo and Libertas there was about a 12 hour period that we did not see DPR.</p>
<p>He eventually logged in and posted the following message to us:</p>
<p>Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts on December 20, 2013, 11:02:10 am</p>
<p><em>   &#8211; - &#8211; &#8212;&#8211;BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE&#8212;&#8211;</em><br />
<em>    Hash: SHA512</em></p>
<p><em>    Right now it is still chaotic at best so I am not sure yet how to best respond long term. As a short term bit of caution both Libertas and Inigo are to be treated as hostile and all communications you receive from them must be forwarded to me immediately.</em></p>
<p><em>    The weighting of Inigo being busted is that in my opinion many things do not yet add up but I believe the reports may be correct. Until the time I know any different or more evidence comes to light remember to think back and if there is anything that may further compromise anyone he may have had access to let me know.</em></p>
<p><em>    Libertas&#8217;s case is not supported by much other than rumors. As such it is unlikely this applies to him and it may be a case of bad luck he hasn&#8217;t logged on for some hours but continue to also treat him as hostile.</em></p>
<p><em>    Right now I myself have no reason to be offline for any period greater than 24 hours, especially now I am aware of the events above. If such time elapses (24 hours) where I do not appear online consider both myself everything associated with me compromised, even PGP signed messages should be treated with extreme caution. I will be wiping all my communications with all of you and so that may be used as a proof if you wish to verify me in the event something happens by using information only I would know.</em></p>
<p><em>    This is going to be a testing time for us all and I do not know where it will take us, but everyone please be safe and godspeed.</em><br />
<em>   </em>[DPR sig redacted by allthingsvice]</p>
<p>I would normally not ever divulge anything from our hidden forums but seeing as I feel this was our final order given by our leader we felt obligated to alert the community with something more than just our words.</p>
<p>As you can see that message was clear that if he was not online for 24 hours he should be considered compromised and it has been over 36 hours now since he last logged on.</p>
<p>We tried asking Defcon about this but he never responded to us other than a similar message like he posted in the discussion forum that DPR was okay, but we as staff, have no way to verify that.</p>
<p>Let me be clear this is not to sabotage DPR, or Silk Road &#8211; on the contrary it is to remain loyal the final signed order we received from our Captain.  Seeing as he directly told us in this message to even ignore any future signed messages if that 24 hour period elapses we felt there was no other course than to follow orders and consider his account compromised.</p>
<p>I suggest removing any and all bitcoins you have in the market and to consider the website under the control of LE.  Considering all that has happened lately, we (myself and ChemCat) felt this was our only course of action and we didn&#8217;t come to this decision lightly.</p>
<p>I think for now our journey on Silk Road has ended &#8211; but there will be others and we did so many marvelous things.</p>
<p>Please spread this message everywhere and share with as many people as possible. I don&#8217;t know how long it will remain up.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As my book deadline closes in really really fast, there are a few people I was having email correspondence with who used Tormail addresses and I&#8217;ve now lost contact. I really would like to hear from them again. And a few others to boot&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_547" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://allthingsvice.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/images.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-547" alt="Help me get this Silk Road book finished!" src="http://allthingsvice.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/images.jpeg?w=614"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Help me get this Silk Road book finished!</p></div>
<p>The rub is, I don&#8217;t want to name the three I most want to hear back from, because I promised I wouldn&#8217;t out them by username. So&#8230; if you think there&#8217;s any chance <strong>you might be one of the people I&#8217;m talking about</strong>, please get in contact soon! Think money laundering, security, moderating&#8230;</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s a long shot, but if Atlantis&#8217;s <strong>Loera</strong> and/or <strong>Vlad</strong>, or <strong>EnterTheMatrix</strong> or <strong>Tony76</strong> (assuming you haven&#8217;t <em>really</em> been contract-killed) would care to get in touch with me I&#8217;d love to hear from you too. <span class='wp-smiley emoji emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>
<p>Anyone else who has anything unique to share &#8211; especially <strong>ex-SR mods/admins</strong> or<strong> No.1 vendors</strong> or anyone who got arrested etc &#8211; who would care to get in touch, please do.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had an overwhelming number of SR buyers and sellers tell me their stories or offer to help and have tried to respond to them all, but if I missed you, please accept my most sincere apologies.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Silk Road may be gone and Silk Road v.2 yet to prove itself, but the site has become culturally significant enough to attract the attention of some serious academic researchers. And unlike the plethora of tabloid news pieces, their starting position is not always that the online black market is a den of evil inhabited by junkies and thieves with no redeeming features whatsoever.</p>
<p><a href="http://allthingsvice.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/screen-shot-2013-11-16-at-1-34-40-pm.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-543" alt="Screen Shot 2013-11-16 at 1.34.40 pm" src="http://allthingsvice.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/screen-shot-2013-11-16-at-1-34-40-pm.png?w=614"   /></a></p>
<p>The National Drug and Research Institute is a Curtin University-backed research body committed to minimising the harm associated with drug use. The NDRI is <a href="http://ndri.curtin.edu.au/research/silkroad/">calling for Silk Road users to participate in research and interviews</a> about their experiences using the site.</p>
<p><span id="more-541"></span></p>
<p>Despite assurances of anonymity and the researchers’ ethical obligations to maintain privacy of participants, it can be difficult to find people willing to discuss their drug use. Many Silk Road users are (sometimes justifiably) paranoid about discussing their illegal activities.  The NDRI has taken the extraordinary step of providing a means for willing participants to be interviewed over encrypted chat. There is no need to provide any identifying information.</p>
<p>The institute has no hidden agenda; harm minimisation is its only goal and sites like Silk Road raise unique questions for researchers.  “There’s an assumption that people will use more drugs or come to more harm if drugs are more available,” says Research Fellow Dr Monica Barratt.  “We think it’s more complex than this, and think the situation that Silk Road users can find themselves in, where many drugs are more available, provides an interesting experiment. What happens to people’s drug use in this situation?”</p>
<p>If you are reading this and you are a current or previous user of one of the online black markets, I urge you to assist the NDRI. It will certainly be more beneficial than trying to justify yourself to a tabloid journalist. These are the good guys.</p>
<p>Another interesting study resulting in the paper “<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955395913001722" target="_blank">Responsible Vendors, Intelligent Consumers: Silk Road, the online revolution in drug trading</a>,” was carried out by School of Health Sciences, Waterford Institute of Technology in conjunction with the Irish Needle Exchange Forum.</p>
