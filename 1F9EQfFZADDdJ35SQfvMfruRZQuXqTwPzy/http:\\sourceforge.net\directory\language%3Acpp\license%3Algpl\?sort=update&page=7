SystemC Network Simulation Library
SystemC Network Simulation Library (SCNSL) is an extension of SystemC to allow modelling packet-based networks such as wireless networks, ethernet, fieldbus, etc. As done by basic SystemC for signals on the bus, SCNSL provides primitives to model packet trasmission, reception, contention on the channel and wireless path loss. The use of SCNSL allows the easy and complete modelling of distributed applications of networked embedded systems such as wireless sensor networks, routers, and distributed plant controllers.
Please, read wiki page for more information.
To get the most updated version of the library, please check out from Bazaar repository by using bzr client as follows:
