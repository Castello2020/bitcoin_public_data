TemplateLite
Template Lite is a very fast, small HTML template engine written in PHP. The engine supports most of the Smarty2 template engine functions and filters. This template engine is no longer a Smarty Replacement. But is still similar to Smarty.
The new TemplateLite3 is currently in the works and has a new parser and compiler structure along with a new syntax. The new TemplateLite is not backwards compatible for the templates but, the usage from php should work. Version 2 will still receive bug fixes until v3 is production stable and out performs v2.
