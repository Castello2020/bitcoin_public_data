<h2>Ringlord Technologies</h2>

<p class="cap">Ringlord Technologies was founded in 1987 by Udo
Schuermann as a vehicle for research, development, and publication of
distributed software technologies for business and entertainment
purposes. Although we've not made much of a business of the whole
thing, we have never failed to be entertained by it all.</p>

<p>The company's name was derived from a software concept enabling the
centralized configuration and management of workstations on an IBM
Tokenring LAN: the ring-shaped topology combined with the resulting
lordship (e.g. rule, control) over the whole network gave birth to
Ringlord Software. Our focus has shifted, and our named adjusted to
more accurately reflect our focus on research and development of
(software) technologies. Hence, Ringlord Technologies.</p>

<p>No relationship whatsoever exists, nor should one be inferred, with
any of J.R.R. Tolkien's fine works of fantasy literature, or any
related materials of any kind. No similarity and no such relationship
is or was ever intended. Period.</p>

<h3>What Can You Find Here?</h3>

<p class="cap">Mostly Java software and some interesting publications,
but also stuff for GNU/Linux and Amiga computers, as well as somewhat
more general materials. Have a look in the <a
href="products.html">Products</a> section of our site (check out the
navigation menu on the left side).</p>

<p>And you might notice that our pages load quickly, don't run
scripts, don't bog down your browser, and don't shove cookies into
your cache, either. Our site is as lean and mean as we can reasonably
make it. There are no advertisements here, either. We like it that
way.</p>
