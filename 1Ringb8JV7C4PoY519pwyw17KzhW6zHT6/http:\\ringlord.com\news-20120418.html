<h2>Oracle: Death to Object Oriented Programming!</h2><img src="img/java.png" width="64" height="64" alt="[java]" align="right"><p><i><a href="news.html#20120418">Back to Ringlord Technologies News</a></i></p><p><i>April 18, 2012</i></p><p class="cap">The currently running lawsuit brought by Oracle against
Google over Google's use of the Java APIs has made me scratch my head.
It may well be that I just don't get it, but from the first two days
of the trial, it seems that Google couldn't have violated the license,
because Java is licensed under the GPL (and Google didn't withhold the
source code for their VM, libraries, or software). What Google did was
use the same method signatures (method names, parameter types &amp;
order, and return types). So Oracle, having lost almost every other
argument in pre-trial, now seems intent to argue that the Java APIs
are copyrighted, and Google's use of the same method signatures and
class names constitutes copyright violation.</p>

<p>LOL WUT?</p>

<p>If it were possible to copyright an API, modern programming itself
would be brought to its knees. Let me say this again: In their blind
rage at Google, <em>Oracle seems intent on destroying object oriented
programming.</em> If you don't believe me, then consider one of the
key concepts of object oriented programming, inheritance.</p>

<p>Take Oracle's own <a
href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/ListCellRenderer.html"
target="_blank">ListCellRenderer documentation</a>, for example, which
describes how an object looking to implement a custom view of items
in a JList, for example, must <em>implement ListCellRenderer's API by
using exactly the same method name, parameter types, parameter order,
and return value</em> as defined by the ListCellRenderer.</p>

<p>So, it would seem that any code that actually does this is in
violation of Oracle's Java license, but sneaky Oracle is actually
recommending that Java programmers do it that way. Why? Because all of
object oriented programming rests on implementing what another object
defines, and extending the functionality of others. Claim copyright on
an API, and one of the fundamentals of object oriented development is
shackled at the ankles.</p>

<p>I would think it rather difficult to specify legally under
precisely what circumstances the use of inheritance is not a
violation, and when it is. The ugly little iconoclast clamoring within
me almost wants Oracle to win this, just to see who is the first livid
and barely sane programmer to take out Larry Ellison over
this&hellip;</p>
