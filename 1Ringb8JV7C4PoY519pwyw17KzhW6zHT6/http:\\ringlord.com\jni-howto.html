<p class="cap">As we have ourselves struggled through some of the
finer details of using the Java Native Interface (JNI) recently, we
thought that sharing our new-found insights might help others
understand the details better.</p>

<p>The following instructions for accessing native code from Java
through the JNI interface apply to a Unix system with gcc. If you are
using Microsoft Windows, Apple Macintosh, or another non-Unix
operating systems then you can obviously not follow these instructions
too blindly&hellip;</p>

<p><font color="#880000"><b>Note: There is a trouble-shooting section
at the end of this article that addresses (and has always addressed)
the majority of the questions we receive from readers.</b></font></p>

<p>Please note that one of our readers, Adrian Agapie, has made us
aware of the possibility that the information below may not work with
JDK 1.1 (e.g. JDK 1.1.8); he got it to work with JDK 1.2, though, so
please be aware that different rules may apply to different (major?)
versions of the JDK. Without having investigated the matter myself, I
propose that there is likely some significant differences with JNI
between what is Java&nbsp;1 and Java&nbsp;2. <i>Caveat emptor</i>.</p>

<hr>

<h3>The Goal</h3>

<p class="cap">We will call a method in a native library and return a
java.lang.String to the calling Java application. This is useful when
we need to access some machine dependent information or perhaps call
on a faster native code routine to accomplish what would take too long
in Java's interpreted code model.</p>

<p>In this particular case we will make use of a native library to obtain a UUID
(Universally Unique Identification). This is a 128-bit quanity that depends on the network
card's unique 6-byte (48 bit) address, a representation of the current machine time
(hopefully accurate), as well as a counter to provide a resolution of up to 10000 unique
identification per timestamp. I think the clock is deemed accurate to nano seconds, but
I'm probably off there.</p>

<h4>What you will need</h4>

<p class="cap">The native code library that supplies us with this code
is:</p>

	<div align="center">/usr/lib/libuuid.so</div>

<p>And the include file that matches it is:</p>

	<div align="center">/usr/include/uuid/uuid.h</div>

<p>If you have these files on your system, then you can work through
the examples below verbatim and should have no trouble getting this to
work. If you do not have either of the above files you must first
choose something to accomplish, then apply some thought as to where
your project differs from the one we are presenting here.</p>

<h3>Creating the Java program to call native code</h3>

<p class="cap">The following program will compile with Sun's javac,
Blackdown's port of the JDK to Linux, and with IBM's fantastic Jikes
compiler. The comments in the code will explain what the code is
doing, including how to bind to a native code library and call native
methods in it:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#f0f0f0" align="center">

package com.ringlord.util;

public class UUID
{
  /**
   * The program entry point. Call it as:
   * <tt>java&nbsp;com.ringlord.util.UUID</tt> with an optional numeric
   * parameter 1 or higher for the total number of UUIDs to be generated.
   */
  public static void main( String args[] )
    {
      int count;
      try
        {
          if( (count = Integer.parseInt(args[0])) &lt; 1 )
            {
              count = 1;
            }
        }
      catch( Exception e )
        {
          count = 1;
        }
      for( int i=0; i&lt;count; i++ )
        {
	  // create a new UUID object (this same class)
	  // using the default constructor (see below)
          UUID test = new UUID();
          System.out.println( "{" + test + "}" );
        }
    }
  
  /**
   * Default constructor: calls the getUUID() method which is defined
   * (below) as a native method!
   */
  public UUID()
    {
      super();		// always a good idea to call the super constructor
      uuid = getUUID();	// call the native method
    }

  /**
   * A convenient way of ensuring that the String representation of this
   * object is the UUID itself. This makes for very easy ways of printing
   * the object's value (see the main(java.lang.String[]) method above)
   */
  public String toString()
    {
      return uuid;
    }

  /**
   * This is the defininition of our native method. NOTICE THAT IT HAS NO
   * BODY. The static block following it is executed as part of the class
   * construction.
   */
  private native String getUUID();
  static
    {
      // Load a library whose "core" name is 'java-rlt-uuid' Operating
      // system specific stuff will be added to make from this an actual

      System.loadLibrary("java-rlt-uuid");
    }

  // the constructor stores here the result of the native method call
  private String uuid;
}
</pre></td></tr>
</table>

<p>We compile this code with the following command (we use IBM's Jikes because it's an
order of magnitude better than anything else we've used; it's also Open Source, and
it's available for free):</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width="1%" bgcolor="#ffff00">Command&nbsp;line:</td><td bgcolor="#e0e0e0">jikes UUID.java</td></tr>
</table>

<h3 id="javah">Creating the .h (include) file</h3>

<p class="cap">The include file is easily generated with the
<tt>javah</tt> program that should be part of every self-respecting
Java development environment. This command will parse the
byte-compiled Java class file and generate an appropriate file that
tells us all we need to know to write the native code that the Java
class wants to call. <em>Be sure to use the fully qualified name of
the class, not just the relative name of the class file!</em> This is
how <tt>javah</tt> is called:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width="1%" bgcolor="#ffff00">Command&nbsp;line:</td><td bgcolor="#e0e0e0">javah&nbsp;-jni&nbsp;com.ringlord.util.UUID</td></tr>
</table>

<p>We have provided the output of this program below so that you get to see all the pieces
in operation. <b>Again, this is machine-generated code and should not be provided by
you!</b> You will notice that the filename reflects the name of the package and class name
(com.ringlord.util.UUID) from which the file was generated.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#f0f0f0" align="center">
<tr bgcolor="black"><td><tt><font color="white" size="+1"><b>com_ringlord_util_UUID.h</b></font></tt></td></tr>

</pre></td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Creating the native code (.c) file</h3>

<p class="cap">We are now ready to write the native code. We are under
no obligation to use the long and unwieldy name that the
<tt>javah</tt> program chose. We'll just use "UUID.c" for our
purposes, although we will have to include the .h file from above:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#f0f0f0" align="center">
<tr bgcolor="black"><td><tt><font color="white" size="+1"><b>UUID.c</b></font></tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;uuid/uuid.h&gt;
#include "com_ringlord_util_UUID.h"

jstring Java_com_ringlord_util_UUID_getUUID(JNIEnv *env, jobject this)
{
  jstring value;                /* the return value */
  uuid_t id;                    /* a UUID we're building */
  unsigned char buf[40];        /* working buffer (really only need 37) */
  int i,j;                      /* counters into 'id' &amp; 'buf' */

  /* generate a uuid as per 'libuuid.so' library call (Unix). */
  uuid_generate( id );

  /* format the (16) bytes we get back as follows:
   *    01020304-0102-0102-0102-010203040506
   * including the dashes in the middle.
   */
  for( i=0,j=0; i&lt;sizeof(uuid_t); i++ )
    {
      sprintf( buf+j, "%02x", id[i] );
      j += 2;
      if( (i==3) || (i==5) || (i==7) || (i==9) )
        {
          *(buf+j) = '-';
          ++j;
        }
    }

  /* N.B.
   * as we always end with a normal digit that is added with an sprintf()
   * call, it is not necessary to ensure that the string is 0 terminated:
   * sprintf() has already accomplished this for us.
   */

  /* now create from this nicely formatted result a Java-native UTF-8(?)
   * string (java.lang.String) and return that as the fruit of our labors.
   */
  value = (*env)-&gt;NewStringUTF(env,buf);
  return value;
}
</pre></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The "uuid/uuid.h" file defines the <tt>uuid_t</tt> type (which
happens to be 16 unsigned characters, or 128 bits of data for the
UUID) as well as function prototypes that the compiler should use to
ensure that we're not messing up on parameters or return types.</p>

<p>If you don't have this file then you probably don't have the shared
code library either. This particular example won't work for you in
that case, but you are still likely to learn a lot from continuing to
read.</p>

<h3>Compiling the native code</h3>

<p class="cap">We will first examine each of the two steps in the
compilation separately, and afterwards present you with a handy
Makefile that you can use to build and rebuild the example.</p>

<p>The first step is to compile the <tt>UUID.c</tt> file. The
following centered line(s) are actually all one command line:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width="1%" bgcolor="#ffff00">Command&nbsp;line:</td><td bgcolor="#e0e0e0">gcc -I/java/jdk/include -I/java/jdk/include/genunix -c UUID.c -o UUID.o</td></tr>
</table>

<p>You will notice that we are specifying the
<tt>/java/jdk/include</tt> directory. We have installed the JDK class
files in the <tt>/java/jdk/</tt> directory. Your own choice probably
is different. The point is that there is an include directory with
some platform independent and platform dependent files. For the
platform dependent files we choose the "genunix" subdirectory.</p>

<p>The <tt>-c UUID.c</tt> command compiles (but does not link) our
native code. The output goes to the UUID.o file (as per <tt>-o
UUID.o</tt> option).</p>

<p>The only step left to accomplish is to generate a loadable file.
Again, the following centered line(s) are actually all one command
line:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width="1%" bgcolor="#ffff00">Command&nbsp;line:</td><td bgcolor="#e0e0e0">ld -shared -f /usr/lib/libuuid.so UUID.o -o libjava-rlt-uuid.so</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The <tt>-shared</tt> option is required here. In versions of this
document prior to 5-Dec-2002 this option was described as <tt>-G</tt>
which is (no longer) correct.</p>

<p>To ensure that the native code library can properly link to what
may otherwise appear to be a quite elusive shared library, we need to
give the linker a reference to the actual file that contains
unresolved external symbols, such as the call to the
<tt>generate_uuid()</tt> method in the <tt>UUID.c</tt> program we
wrote. This is what the <tt>-f /usr/lib/libuuid.so</tt> parameter
does.</p>

<p>And again, output goes to a specific file
<tt>libjava-rlt-uuid.so</tt> the name of which we discussed in the
<tt>UUID.java</tt> source code. This name is, naturally, platform
dependent.</p>

<p>There is a method in java.lang.System that you can use to find out
what actual filename the native code shared object file is expected to
have:</p>

	<div align="center"><tt>static String mapLibraryName(&nbsp;String&nbsp;libname&nbsp;)</tt></div>

<p>At the very end of this article is a little Java program that you
can use to explore the native names (in case you're too lazy to write
your own ;-)</p>

<h3>Ready? GO!!</h3>

<p class="cap">You should now have the following files; the only ones
you actually need to run the program are the ones
<b><u>indicated</u></b>:</p>

<pre>
	UUID.c
	<b><u>UUID.class</u></b>
	UUID.java
	UUID.o
	com_ringlord_util.UUID.h
	<b><u>libjava-rlt-uuid.so</u></b>
</pre>

<p>You run the program in the following manner:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width="1%" bgcolor="#ffff00">Command&nbsp;line:</td><td bgcolor="#e0e0e0">java com.ringlord.util.UUID 5</td></tr>
</table>

<p>&hellip;and you should see 5 universally unique identifiers appear,
similar to the following:</p>

<pre>
	{1e38f892-94a6-11d2-8143-00e018901983}
	{1e394fe0-94a6-11d2-8143-00e018901983}
	{1e396f98-94a6-11d2-8143-00e018901983}
	{1e398eba-94a6-11d2-8143-00e018901983}
	{1e39af26-94a6-11d2-8143-00e018901983}
</pre>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<p class="cap">There are bound to be some glitches that occur. Before
you use the Makefile below, make sure that each step alone works
properly. Use the following checklist to see if you can't find the
problem:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Can't compile the Java program</b><br>
    <ul>
    <li>Is your Java compiler properly installed and in the path?
    <li>Is your CLASSPATH set? Alternately, try <tt>-classpath&nbsp;${CLASSPATH}</tt>
        as arguments to the compiler.
    <li>The <tt>UUID.java</tt> program above is defined as part of the
        <tt>com.ringlord.util</tt> package. Did you create it in a
	directory <tt>com/ringlord/util/</tt>?
    </ul>
    <p>
<li><b>Can't generate the .h file</b><br>
    <ul>
    <li>Is the <tt>javah</tt> program (or equivalent) available?
    <li>Is your CLASSPATH set? (see (1) above)
    </ul>
    <p>
<li><b>Can't compile the .c file</b><br>
    <ul>
    <li>Are you using <tt>gcc 2.7.2</tt> or later? We compiled fine
	with version 2.7.2.3
    <li>Are you specifying directories where some of the following
	files are located? <tt>jni_md.h</tt>, <tt>byteorder_md.h</tt>,
	etc. If not, make sure you locate the appropriate directory
	where the JDK's include files are located. These are required
	to provide the proper translation to native architecture
	conventions.
    <li>Do you actually have the "uuid/uuid.h" file in your path?
	This file is located (on our system) in <tt>/usr/lib/uuid/uuid.h</tt>
    <li>Are you compiling <b>but not linking</b> the program, i.e. are
	you using the <tt>-c</tt> switch on <tt>gcc</tt>?
    </ul>
    <p>
<li><b>Can't link the shared library</b><br>
    <ul>
    <li>Make sure you have <tt>ld</tt> available; it's the native linker
	for your system.
    <li>Make sure you give it the <tt>-shared</tt> argument, otherwise it
	will not generate the correct type of file.
    <li>Make sure you give it the <tt>-f /usr/lib/libuuid.so</tt>
	argument. You must ensure that the <tt>libuuid.so</tt> file
	exists on your system. Substitute the correct path where this
	file lives. The <tt>-f</tt> option tells the linker that at
	run-time it is to resolve symbols using that file (in addition
	to more generic I/O libraries and the like.)
    <li>Make sure you give it the <tt>UUID.o</tt> name, too, which is
	the result of the previous step's compilation.
    </ul>
    <p>
<li><b>Can't run the <tt>com.ringlord.util.UUID</tt> program</b><br>
    <ul>
    <li>"<b>&hellip;cannot open shared object file&hellip;</b>"<br>
	The <tt>libjava-rlt-uuid.so</tt> file is not available. Look
	at the name of the file and compare it to the core name that
	the <tt>UUID.java</tt> program is hoping to find.
        <br><br>
    <li>"<b>&hellip;UnsatisfiedLinkError&hellip;</b>"<br>
	There are two possibilities of which I know:
        <ol>
        <li>Your shared object (e.g. <tt>libjava-rlt-uuid.so</tt> file)
	cannot be located by Java. There are several solutions to this:

	<ol type='a'>

	<li>The first is to ensure that you use the fully qualified
	class name, not just the relative name of the class file. We've
	now <a href="#javah">emphasized this above</a> as well.<br><br>

	<li>The second (and the only other I can recommend at this point)
	is to add the directory where the .so file is stored to the
	<tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> environment variable before running
	the JVM; Java will pick up a few additional directories for
	its own use. That combination will be reflected in the JVM's
	<tt>java.library.path</tt> property. You can check the value
	of System.getProperties().get("java.library.path");<br><br>

	<li>The third applies if you are using Sun Solaris. Apparently
	adding <tt>-g&nbsp;-DSOLARIS2</tt> to the compiler options will
	also help.<br><br>

	<li>The fourth is to directly modify the JVM's
	<tt>java.library.path</tt> property (when starting the JVM,
	not when it's already running!)  using the
	<tt>-Djava.library.path=&hellip;</tt> argument to the JVM.  You'd
	first have to find out what other libraries your JVM would
	need. This is about the very, very last solution I'd look at
	because it's completely non-portable and will vary depending
	on where the JVM is installed. Why do I even mention such a
	shoddy idea?  Because I can, that's why; and to take this
	opportunity to steer you to the <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>
	solution instead, just in case you thought of this one
	yourself :)
	</ol><br>

        <li>Something is wrong with the shared library you created: it's
	not the one that the Java program was hoping to find, or the
	methods it is looking for are not actually in the library.
	Check the .h file and make sure you use the same signature
	for the method as what Java will expect to be calling!
        </ol>
    </ul>
</ol>

<h3>Map Java Library Names to Native Filesystem Names</h3>

<p class="cap">This code might be useful to you if you are curious
what the physical name of the library file should be that Java expects
to be loading when you use a <tt>System.loadLibrary</tt> call:</p>
