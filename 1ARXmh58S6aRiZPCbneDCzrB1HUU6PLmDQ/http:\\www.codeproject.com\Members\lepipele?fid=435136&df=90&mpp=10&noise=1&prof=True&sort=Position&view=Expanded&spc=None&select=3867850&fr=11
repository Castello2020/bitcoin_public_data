Re: Azure Blackjack! Drew Stainton21-Dec-09 11:41 I quit when I was back to even. That's why I like blackjack. You can play for quite awhile without losing too much money (I just got back from Vegas a week ago, but didn't get to play much - too many other things going on).
I didn't keep count, but it seems to shuffle fairly often - is it using a single deck?
Cheers,
Drew.
Re: Azure Blackjack! Predrag Tomasevic21-Dec-09 11:50 Yeah - 1 deck... I made it that way in order to see if I can put in practice things I've read from that Blackjack book. Allegedly, with proper card counting and ranging bets from 1-8 units you have advantage of 2.5% over the house.
As said previously - plan is to expose this as setting in UI (my Shoe class already supports it), so user can practice with any number of decks... but as you are saying - too many other things going on.
Anyway, Drew, thanks a lot for providing valuable feedback!
Re: Azure Blackjack! Drew Stainton21-Dec-09 12:07 Ya, you can count and have an advantage. It's a lot tougher in real-life, though, because of all the distractions and other players at the table. I've heard that most online blackjack games reshuffle after each hand, so counting doesn't work on them.
Fun to learn, though. I went through all that back in the late 80's before a trip to Vegas where I got to try everything I learned. I won some money that time, but probably more due to luck than my counting ability.
Cheers,
Drew.
Re: Azure Blackjack! Predrag Tomasevic21-Dec-09 12:18 Haha... it's deja vu.
About 20 days ago I went to casino to "try everything I learned". Brought $200 and went out of casino with another $200. Played perfect Basic Strategy but couldn't keep count... and ended with same thought: "I've had luck".
Talk about history repeating itself...
Re: Azure Blackjack! Drew Stainton21-Dec-09 12:22 Sure is fun though!
Cheers,
Drew.
Re: Azure Blackjack! im1dermike17-Dec-13 8:04 Either the list of timezone keys here is wrong or what Microsoft is using is wrong. I thought I'd just compare this list to the one found in Windows' change timezone drop down and within about 20 seconds I saw that the values for "Moscow, St. Petersburg, Volgograd" are different between the two lists. The one here has it GMT+3:00 and Microsoft Windows is using GMT+4:00.
