Episode Information:

Top Gear - Season 9, Episode 6 - 2007.03.04

In this episode:

* Jeremy, Richard, and James make limos out of cars available in the UK and put
them through a series of hilarious tests.

* Richard drives the Ford Mustang Shelby 500 and compares it to his 1960&Atilde;&fnof;&AElig;&rsquo;&Atilde;&sbquo;&Acirc;&cent;&Atilde;&fnof;&Acirc;&cent;&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;&Aring;&iexcl;&Atilde;&sbquo;&Acirc;&not;&Atilde;&fnof;&Acirc;&cent;&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;&Aring;&frac34;&Atilde;&sbquo;&Acirc;&cent;s Ford
Mustang.

* Star in a reasonably priced car: Actress Billie Piper.


Trivia for:

&quot;Top Gear&quot; (1978)-( 2007)

*  In 2001 due to falling ratings, the BBC chose to axe the show. Channel 5 then
decided to revive the show with the then current presenters (Quentin Willson,
Vicki Butler-Henderson and Tiff Needell). Because BBC owns the name rights, the
show had to be renamed 5th Gear. The show was only revived because Jeremy
Clarkson was considered to be the most popular presenter of them all and many
people had considered his absence to be the cause of the demise of the show

* During a &quot;Star in a Reasonably Priced Car&quot; segment with Lionel Richie, a wheel
broke off as his Suzuki Liana was approaching one of the fastest parts of the
course. Richie managed to keep the car under control and got another go at his
fastest lap (something which is not normally allowed). The sequence was aired in
the UK as part of the show (complete with an embarrassed Jeremy Clarkson), but
appears not to have been in the US where an edited version of the show is screened.

* The show has a number of Suzuki Liana&#039;s for use in the celebrity race segment,
entitled &quot;Star in a reasonably priced car&quot;. The Liana was chosen because it is
quite a decent spec of equipment for a car under 10,000 pounds. Originally they
were going to use a Hyundai, but Hyundai refused to help them out - prompting
the first episode of the show to be advertised as &quot;containing no Hyundais&quot;. The
Lianas have appeared in various disguises; sporting flames for Rock Singer
Justin Hawkins of The Darkness, and an Indian tissue box for &#039;Sanjeev Baskhar&#039; .
There are several Lianas in case one breaks during the show. To date, David Soul
is the only celebrity to have broken all of the available Lianas during filming.

* Currently (Sept 05) the fastest time around the Top Gear track is 1 min 18.9
seconds by a Maserati MC12. However there have been faster laps which are not
included on the board because they have not been performed by road cars. The
laps are: Aston Martin DBR9 (the racing version of the DB9 GT car) 1 min 8.6
secs, Renault Formula 1 racing car 59.0 seconds (in the wet) and a BAe Sea
Harrier Fighter jet which did the track in 31.2 seconds despite taking the final
two corners &quot;somewhere over Kent&quot;.

* The show is famous for its humorous features. These have included
          o TV Chef Jamie Oliver making a tossed salad in the back of his
Porsche-engined camper van whilst it was being raced around the test track by
The Stig.
          o Car Darts when James May and Richard Hammond were launching cars by
compressed air into a quarry and onto a target (which was made juicier by the
addition of a caravan in the bullseye).
          o Russian Roulette when Hammond and May worked for Taxibike and gave
comments on the cars they drove their clients home in.
          o The Toyota Hilux where they attempted to see what it would take to
break one of these trucks (it was parked in the sea for a full tidal cycle, set
on fire and finally put on top of a tower block that was subsequently
demolished) - despite their best efforts the thing still started and moved.
          o The use of a Boeing 747 at full thrust against a Citroen 2CV and
various abuses against caravans.


* The show has close links with the UK military who have, among other things;
tried to target a Range Rover Sport with a Challenger 2 tank; proved that a
Hughes Apache attack helicopter cannot get a missile lock on a Lotus Exige;
driving a Mercedes SLK and a Porsche Boxster through an Irish Guard
sniper-filled abandoned town to see how many times they could hit the driver;
set the fastest ever lap of the test track using a Royal Navy BAe Sea Harrier
FA.2 (0.31 sec); and launched Stig One to his &#039;death&#039; from the deck of HMS Ark
Royal during a drag race between a stripped &amp; nitrous-modified Jaguar XJS and a
Sea Harrier.

* The revamped 2002 series onwards is filmed at the former BAe Systems site at
Dunsfold aerodrome

* The famous last corner in the Top Gear (revamped version) track is called
&quot;Gambon corner&quot;. It is named after actor Michael Gambon who drove a Suzuki Liana
(as part of the &quot;Reasonably priced car&quot; challenge) and nearly flipped over at
the last corner. Since then, Jerermy Clarkson dubbed the last corner as &quot;Gambon
corner&quot;.

* Winners of Reasonably Priced car challenge: 2002: Jay Kay 2003: Jodie Kidd
(who beat Jay Kay&#039;s time) 2004: Simon Cowell (who beat Jodie Kidd&#039;s time) 2005:
Jimmy Carr (who beat Jimmy Carr&#039;s time) 2005: Ellen MacArther

* The test driver, The Stig, never speaks a word and his face has never been
seen (it being always hidden behind a tinted visor).

* For the first two seasons, The Stig was Perry McCarthy, a former Formula One
driver as well as a test driver for three F1 teams. A new Stig took over from
McCarthy after the original Stig&#039;s &quot;demise&quot; at the beginning of Season 3. On the
18 March 2006 the former Stig, Perry McCarthy, revealed that currently there is
no one single test driver, but multiple test drivers who masquerade as the Stig;
he said this when he appeared at a Palmer Sport activity day in Bedfordshire,
UK. Rumours have it that one of the new Stigs is Damon Hill and occasionally
Colin McRae. And in January 2006, the Daily Express claimed that the identity of
The Stig is former Formula 1 driver Julian Bailey.

Top_Gear.9x06.PROPER.WS_PDTV_XviD-FoV: NUKED: invalid.proper.both.rlses.705mb


I guess the proper should be (or is already) un-nuked: it&#039;s 698 MB (or 715,116
KB or 732,278,988 bytes) (unpacked) ;)

RiVER\\\&#039;s avi is 5.5mb oversize, or 15 the way RiVER counts
