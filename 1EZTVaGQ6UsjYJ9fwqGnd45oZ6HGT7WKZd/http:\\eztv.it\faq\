<br />
Q: Why don't you cap my favourite show?<br />
<br />
A: eztv caps no shows, it is a distribution group only. The shows are capped by other<br />
release groups over whom eztv has no control (or communication).<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Why don't you distribute my favourite show... I know it was capped!<br />
<br />
A: Sometimes there simply aren't enough seeds to go around to distribute all of<br />
the releases for the day. Priorities have to be made, and it's a shame<br />
your show was relegated. eztv will usually try to find a less busy time to<br />
seed the file over the next couple of days, so please be patient.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Why do some episodes from a series get distributed, but not all?<br />
<br />
A: Once again, eztv caps no shows, it is a distribution group only. The shows<br />
are capped by other release groups over whom eztv has no control (or<br />
communication). Sometimes the release groups capture some episodes and not<br />
others, there is nothing eztv can do about that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Can I request a show?<br />
<br />
A: As has been written above, eztv in many cases has little control over what<br />
is distributed. However, it doesn't hurt for people to express interest in<br />
shows. You are welcome to post on the forum how much you enjoy a show, and<br />
that you hope eztv will be able to distribute it in the future. But keep in<br />
mind that whining, whinging and complaining about a show not appearing will<br />
probably have the opposite effect! A special thread (sticky) has been created<br />
in the forum to cater for show requests, inquires, information etc... please<br />
use this thread, any stray posts that belong in this thread will be deleted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: What about older shows?<br />
<br />
A: The networks keep eztv pretty busy with new stuff - it will be rare to see<br />
older shows seeded, unless it is a superior version (for example taken from an<br />
HDTV release or in Widescreen).<br />

<br />
Q: Why do you have two copies of a show on the site?<br />
<br />
A: One of the shows is probably a REPACK, or a PROPER. These are released when<br />
the first release had a flaw. Usually you will find the reason for the flaw in<br />
the forum posts for those torrents.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: The file I downloaded is bad, why haven't you released a PROPER version?<br />
<br />
A: One of two reasons. Either the release groups have not released a PROPER<br />
version, or eztv has declined to release it. eztv endeavours to release propers<br />
when the original file has a significant problem, but if a proper is for a<br />
technicality or a very minor glitch (such as 5 seconds of commercials left in)<br />
then it may be decided the bandwidth is more valuable elsewhere.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: I don't like torrents, can't I just download straight from your site or<br />
channel?<br />
<br />
A: No. eztv is purely a torrent distribution group, and devotes all available<br />
bandwidth to that means of distribution.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Why is the torrent so slow?<br />
<br />
A: There are hundreds of possible answers here. A few of the most likely are:<br />
i) The torrent is old, and there are few seeders left, slowing things down.<br />
ii) The torrent is brand new, and there are ten or twenty people downloading<br />
for each seed. Bandwidth will be stretched until more people complete their<br />
downloads.<br />
iii) You are running too many torrents. Torrents reward you for sharing -<br />
if a peer receives a lot of data from you, it will 'reward' you by sending you<br />
more data. So the more you upload the faster you will download. Spreading<br />
your upload too thin can reduce your download speeds. This is especially true<br />
early in the life of a torrent.<br />
iv) You are using a firewall/router and the port your torrent client is listening on<br />
cannot be accessed. You need to setup firewall exemptions and/or port<br />
fowarding to resolve this issue and greatly increase your download speeds.<br />
v) You are using Win XP and have not applied the http://www.lvllord.de patch<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Who are VTV, and why do some of your torrents have their name as well?<br />
<br />
A: VTV is another TV torrent distribution group with which eztv sometimes<br />
cooperates to maximise bandwidth and prolong torrent life. This will usually<br />
happen on less popular shows which may not be able to support two separate<br />
torrents.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: I love eztv! What can I do to help?<br />
<br />
A: Thanks, eztv loves you too. The best way to help is to seed. If you have a<br />
5mbit upload or better, contact an op and ask about becoming a seed! If not,<br />
once you finish your download, just leave it in your client for as long as you<br />
can to help other people get the file, and keep the torrent alive. eztv is<br />
very proud of how long the downloaders keep the torrents alive for, and would<br />
like to thank all those who keep files seeded many months after the initial<br />
release.<br />

<br />
Q: I capped something myself - how do I get eztv to distribute it?<br />
<br />
A: eztv distributes only releases by well known groups - this is a decision made<br />
in order to minimise the doubling up of torrents and wasted bandwidth. Exceptions<br />
are rare, but if you have a good reason then you should request to talk to an Op<br />
in our IRC channel.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: I downloaded a file labelled as [eztv], but I had problems with it. Why?<br />
<br />
A: Most likely you downloaded a fake file from mininova. Unfortunately there<br />
are idiots out there who make fake torrents and put the eztv name on them. We<br />
strongly recommend only downloading eztv torrents which are linked from the<br />
site or IRC channel. All torrents uploaded to mininova will be added by the<br />
EZTV user.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: How about movies, games, warez, ebooks... will you release those? Where can<br />
I get them?<br />
<br />
A: eztv is strictly a distribution group for current television. eztv has no<br />
interest in getting involved with the other types of media, and you should<br />
look elsewhere for such releases. We also ask that you not look for guidance<br />
to these releases in the IRC channel or forum - the most likely you response<br />
you will receive is "Go and buy it".<br />
<br />
Occasionally eztv may seed a non-tv release if it is deemed of particular interest.<br />
But this is to be considered a rarity and purely at the discretion	of the admins.<br />
