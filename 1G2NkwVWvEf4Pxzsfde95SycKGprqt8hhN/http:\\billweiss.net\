  Hi there! This is the semi-professional website of Bill Weiss, a systems
  and operations type currently in Chicago, IL.  I know it's not much to
  look at: notice the above list doesn't say designer :)
</p>

<p>
  I'm always promising myself that I'll put something more in this space.
  This is a first step: now it's not an Apache directory index.
</p>

<p>
  In the meantime, you can find me in a bunch of places:
  <ul>
    <li>On <a href="http://serverfault.com/users/4117/bill-weiss">ServerFault as BillWeiss</a></li>
    <li>At <a href="http://www.backstopsolutions.com/">Backstop Solutions
    Group</a>, my day job.  "bill" at that domain will reach me, as
    will lots of admin-related addresses</li>
    <li>On <a href="https://github.com/BillWeiss">GitHub as BillWeiss</a></li>
    <li>Via email tons of places, but preferably "bv" at this domain</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Things I'm interested in, and will start writing about here at some
  point:
  <ul>
    <li>Systems and operations, especially the DevOps world</li>
    <li>Automation of the same</li>
    <li>Management of the same, and the people who do them</li>
    <li>Security of networks, systems, people... anything and everything</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  I've got a GPG key if you like that sort of thing.  The key ID is
  5D055836, with a fingerprint of 
  <pre>4B15 D741 D64D 55BF 52AA 2221 75A9 6570 5D05 5836</pre>
  The entire file is here: <a
  href="http://www.clanspum.net/~houdini/bweiss.asc">bweiss.asc</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I have an old key, ID 0AD234B0, which has been revoked.  Nothing
  nefarious happened, I just lost access to it.
</p>

<p>
  I, in fact, can take Bitcoin, though I don't know what I'm doing with
  it: 1G2NkwVWvEf4Pxzsfde95SycKGprqt8hhN.  Don't pay anything you owe me
  via this address, but if you want to throw a couple of bucks in, go
  ahead :)
