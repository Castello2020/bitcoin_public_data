There is, however, a vocal minority of neurosceptics who contest this orthodoxy. Among them are those who focus on claims neuroscience makes about the preciseness of correlations between indirectly observed neural activity and different mental functions, states or experiences.</p>
<p>This was well captured in a 2009 article in Perspectives on Psychological Science by Harold Pashler from the University of California, San Diego, and colleagues, that argued: “…these correlations are higher than should be expected given the (evidently limited) reliability of both fMRI and personality measures. The high correlations are all the more puzzling because method sections rarely contain much detail about how the correlations were obtained.”</p>
<p>Believers will counter that this is irrelevant: as our means of capturing and analysing neural activity become more powerful, so we will be able to make more precise correlations between the quantity, pattern and location of neural activity and aspects of <a title="Mapping Human Consciousness – Mysticism and Spirituality with Dr. David R. Hawkins" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2012/06/22/mapping-human-consciousness-mysticism-and-spirituality-with-dr-david-r-hawkins/" target="_blank">consciousness</a>.</p>
<p>This may well happen, but my argument is not about technical, probably temporary, limitations. It is about the deep philosophical confusion embedded in the assumption that if you can correlate neural activity with consciousness, then you have demonstrated they are one and the same thing, and that a physical science such as neurophysiology is able to show what consciousness truly is.</p>
<p>Many neurosceptics have argued that neural activity is nothing like experience, and that the least one might expect if A and B are the same is that they be indistinguishable from each other. Countering that objection by claiming that, say, activity in the occipital cortex and the sensation of light are two aspects of the same thing does not hold up because the existence of “aspects” depends on the prior existence of consciousness and cannot be used to explain the relationship between neural activity and <a title="Plugging Into Your Intuition Helps Expand Consciousness" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2012/10/06/plugging-into-your-intuition-helps-expand-consciousness/" target="_blank">consciousness</a>.</p>
<p>This disposes of the famous claim by John Searle, Slusser Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley: that neural activity and conscious experience stand in the same relationship as molecules of H2O to water, with its properties of wetness, coldness, shininess and so on. The analogy fails as the level at which water can be seen as molecules, on the one hand, and as wet, shiny, cold stuff on the other, are intended to correspond to different “levels” at which we are conscious of it. But the existence of levels of experience or of description presupposes consciousness. Water does not intrinsically have these levels.</p>
<p>We cannot therefore conclude that when we see what seem to be neural correlates of consciousness that we are seeing consciousness itself. While neural activity of a certain kind is a necessary condition for every manifestation of consciousness, from the lightest sensation to the most exquisitely constructed sense of self, it is neither a sufficient condition of it, nor, still less, is it identical with it. If it were identical, then we would be left with the insuperable problem of explaining how intracranial nerve impulses, which are material events, could “reach out” to extracranial objects in order to be “of” or “about” them. Straightforward physical causation explains how light from an object brings about events in the occipital cortex. No such explanation is available as to how those neural events are “about” the physical object. Biophysical science explains how the light gets in but not how the gaze looks out.</p>
<p>Many features of ordinary consciousness also resist neurological explanation. Take the unity of consciousness. I can relate things I experience at a given time (the pressure of the seat on my bottom, the sound of traffic, my thoughts) to one another as elements of a single moment. Researchers have attempted to explain this unity, invoking quantum coherence (the cytoskeletal micro-tubules of Stuart Hameroff at the University of Arizona, and Roger Penrose at the University of Oxford), electromagnetic fields (Johnjoe McFadden, University of Surrey), or rhythmic discharges in the brain (the late Francis Crick).</p>
<p>These fail because they assume that an objective unity or uniformity of nerve impulses would be subjectively available, which, of course, it won’t be. Even less would this explain the unification of entities that are, at the same time, experienced as distinct. My sensory field is a many-layered whole that also maintains its multiplicity. There is nothing in the convergence or coherence of neural pathways that gives us this “merging without mushing”, this ability to see things as both whole and separate.</p>
<p>And there is an insuperable problem with a sense of past and future. Take memory. It is typically seen as being “stored” as the effects of experience which leave enduring changes in, for example, the properties of synapses and consequently in circuitry in the nervous system. But when I “remember”, I explicitly reach out of the present to something that is explicitly past. A synapse, being a physical structure, does not have anything other than its present state. It does not, as you and I do, reach temporally upstream from the effects of experience to the experience that brought about the effects. In other words, the sense of the past cannot exist in a physical system. This is consistent with the fact that the physics of time does not allow for tenses: Einstein called the distinction between past, present and future a “stubbornly persistent illusion”.</p>
<p>There are also problems with notions of the self, with the initiation of action, and with free will. Some neurophilosophers deal with these by denying their existence, but an account of consciousness that cannot find a basis for voluntary activity or the sense of self should conclude not that these things are unreal but that neuroscience provides at the very least an incomplete explanation of consciousness.</p>
<p>I believe there is a fundamental, but not obvious, reason why that explanation will always remain incomplete – or unrealisable. This concerns the disjunction between the objects of science and the contents of consciousness. Science begins when we escape our subjective, first-person experiences into objective measurement, and reach towards a vantage point the philosopher Thomas Nagel called “the view from nowhere”. You think the table over there is large, I may think it is small. We measure it and find that it is 0.66 metres square. We now characterise the table in a way that is less beholden to personal experience.</p>
<p>Science begins when we escape our first-person subjective experience</p>
<p>Thus measurement takes us further from experience and the phenomena of subjective consciousness to a realm where things are described in abstract but quantitative terms. To do its work, physical science has to discard “secondary qualities”, such as colour, warmth or cold, taste – in short, the basic contents of consciousness. For the physicist then, light is not in itself bright or colourful, it is a mixture of vibrations in an electromagnetic field of different frequencies. The material world, far from being the noisy, colourful, smelly place we live in, is colourless, silent, full of odourless molecules, atoms, particles, whose nature and behaviour is best described mathematically. In short, physical science is about the marginalisation, or even the disappearance, of phenomenal appearance/qualia, the redness of red wine or the smell of a smelly dog.</p>
<p>Consciousness, on the other hand, is all about phenomenal appearances/qualia. As science moves from appearances/qualia and toward quantities that do not themselves have the kinds of manifestation that make up our experiences, an account of consciousness in terms of nerve impulses must be a contradiction in terms. There is nothing in physical science that can explain why a physical object such as a brain should ascribe appearances/qualia to material objects that do not intrinsically have them.</p>
<p>Material objects require consciousness in order to “appear”. Then their “appearings” will depend on the viewpoint of the conscious observer. This must not be taken to imply that there are no constraints on the appearance of objects once they are objects of consciousness.</p>
<p>Our failure to explain consciousness in terms of neural activity inside the brain inside the skull is not due to technical limitations which can be overcome. It is due to the self-contradictory nature of the task, of which the failure to explain “aboutness”, the unity and multiplicity of our awareness, the explicit presence of the past, the initiation of actions, the construction of self are just symptoms. We cannot explain “appearings” using an objective approach that has set aside appearings as unreal and which seeks a reality in mass/energy that neither appears in itself nor has the means to make other items appear. The brain, seen as a physical object, no more has a world of things appearing to it than does any other physical object.</p>

				<p>ARE YOU OPEN MINDED ???</p>
<p>Electro-magnetic imprint of DNA goes with you in the death transition ?? Multi-life history/experience/form holding patterns in Junk DNA ?   Unseen IMPERISHABLE “bodies” in human aura?     Brain is not the mind!     Mind based upon mental (or reasoning) body of aura!  Mind goes with you in death !!<br />
Above Concepts based on my “knowledge” research were confirmed in Australian Michel Desmarquet&#8217;s abduction to a highly advanced planetary culture (see Other Reinforcing Books below)<br />
Note: I lost both of my parents at their early age of 57.  This caused me to launch a part-time fifty year study of “what comes next after death?”  Topics I researched were such as the Mother Mary apparition messages, a variety of religion beliefs other than my former Catholic (though still Christian), atheists rationale, the paranormal, quantum physics, biology, genomics, messages from the afterlife, instrumental transcommunication (ITC) via phone, tapes and TV,  UFOs&#8217; objectives, and extraterrestrial messages, trying to find out answers, primarily thru books, science magazines, and numerous websites, obviously with a very open mind.  </p>
<p>I was particularly interested in answering this question:  How can it be that it is possible to contact afterdeath personalities as if they were still of full mental capability &#8212; via paranormal MEDIUMS, or even by special ITC electronic communications, as has been demonstrated repeatedly?  As a retired engineer/executive, I needed to understand exactly HOW “mechanically”or structurally this could be possible.  I FOUND THE ANSWER:  Electromagnetic/energetic version of DNA &#8212; and unseen IMPERISHABLE body aura containing the mind &#8212;- go with you in your death transition!! </p>
<p>Two books in particular provided key answers, and both were most believable due to being very comprehensive and &#8220;scientific&#8221; though not related to much of Christian/Judeo training.  Below I have compiled short summaries and excerpts for your possible interest. Also, a short list of books that reinforced these two.  I hope you will keep an open mind in reading them.  An old Chinese proverb states: &#8220;A mind is like a parachute. It only functions when it is OPEN.&#8221;</p>
<p>To summarize the first book, a lengthy dictation by a benevolent extraterrestrial group Guardian Alliance, it teaches SCIENTIFIC EVOLVEMENT: 1) Your electro-magnetic or energetic version of DNA goes with you in the death transition. 2) you will reincarnate repeatedly and the JUNK DNA holds your personal multi-life history and experience. 3) Your consciousness will next progress eventually through fifteen dimensions toward “nirvana”perfection, currently being in the third.  All other dimensions are unseen and have different vibrational frequencies and atomic configurations.  4) After incarnation as Buddha, Christ as a highly advanced entity came to us as a teacher from the twelfth or higher dimension.  5) God is the Universe Prime Creator/Force/Source, and not the god Yahweh of the Old Testament who was an Ancient Astronaut to Earth.  </p>
<p>As dictated by Ascended Masters, key messages in the second book were: 1) There are other unseen IMPERISHABLE “bodies” around the physical one in an aura (Note: As seen by Kirlian/GDV photography, see Wikipedia re: the paranormal aura).  Key bodies are the astral, the mental (or reasoning), the etheric, among several others. 2) THE BRAIN IS NOT THE MIND. The mental body is the basis/source of the mind. 3) All these “bodies” go with you in the death transition, especially including the mind.  4) In the next step, all these bodies and DNA will proceed with you into the astral plane or dimension. 5) do not fear death as it is merely a transition to another “form”.</p>
<p>See the more detailed excerpts below.  Also, a short list of other reinforcing books. To me, these were &#8220;startling&#8221; concepts, but comforting in their believability as they “fit” based on other related research.  </p>
<p>There does need to be more scientific research especially on 1) electromagnetic/energetic &amp; biophotonic properties of DNA, and 2) functions of the aura(or bio-energy field)!  Russian and German scientific researchers are “on track” to one day scientifically prove life continues after death.  Dr. Fritz-Albert Popp and son Jurgen at University of Marburg, Germany continue early work on electromagnetic aspects/versions of DNA and cell biophotonics as members of the Int’l Institute of Biophysics, and among others, Dr. Peter Geriaev  in Russia with a breakthrough in biophotonic electromagnetic DNA termed Wave Genetics or bioholography.  And, Dr. Konstantin Korotkov, Director at the St. Petersburg State Tech University, who concentrates on aura (or bio-energy field) research as Founder/President of the Int’l Union of Medical and Applied Bioelectrography,  has actually produced early Kirlian/GDV photographs which may be of the “soul” or aura leaving dying human bodies.  Unfortunately, American research on these two “niches” is relatively modest.  Materialist brain researchers continue to believe that the source of the mind must be someplace in the brain or physical body.  And, narrowly educated atheists do not believe in any perceived afterlife.</p>
<p>Book  #1. Source: “Voyagers” Volumes I &amp; II  &#8212; by Ashayana Deane(Anna Hayes)   For details see Chapters on Ascension Mechanics &amp; DNA.  Available from Amazon.com, Volume I and 2nd Edition Vol. II  583 pages.  Also includes information on Earth history and quantum physics.  Purchase strongly recommended.</p>
<p>“At the death of the physical body, you will discover that your consciousness lives on and your evolution continues.<br />
“Ascension is not some lofty spiritual concept designed by the minds of man, it is the literal, tangible scientific process of the evolution of consciousness and biology with the laws of energy mechanics that apply to a multidimensional reality system.  All souls will eventually evolve and ascend through a 15 dimensional scale to re-emerge as sentient identity within realms of pure consciousness beyond the dimensional systems.  Whether or not you view ascension and multidimensional evolution as a reality while you are alive on Earth, you will be directly faced with that reality once your consciousness has passed out of physical life and into the multidimensional framework.   How well you prepare for that discovery now will determine the ease with which you are able to take your next evolutionary step once you “wake up on the other side”<br />
“The term “Ascension” represents much more than some lofty spiritual concept invented by the finite human psyche in order to give purpose to its finite existence.  Many in the earthly scientific communities believe that life is limited to the physical expression and that consciousness is the result of the body’s biochemical/neuro-electrical functions.  Following these erroneous beliefs they draw an equally erroneous conclusion that consciousness ends at the death of the physical body. Consequently, human science will be confronted with a whole new order of multidimensional reality and a whole new science.  <br />
“The process of ascension is not some quasi-religious concept based upon the meandering of the human mind.  Ascension is instead a highly SCIENTIFIC process that represents the universal order through which consciousness experiences itself as being.  Ascension also involves the understanding of morphogenetic fields or the form holding energy constructions that allow matter to build into individuated forms.  Ascension therefore is a science with specific mechanics that allow for the evolution of consciousness from simple to more complex forms.  Every being in existence is involved in this evolutionary process and applies to each and every one of you.  The choices one makes in thought and deed will determine the quality of experience, or lack thereof, that will be personally encountered.<br />
 “DNA is built upon minute electro-tonal (i.e., multi octave) patterns of multidimensional frequency and the energetic imprint of the DNA goes with you in the death transition. The content of that pattern will determine how high your consciousness will be able to travel (progress) in the system once it is released from the body. Whatever frequencies are contained within that imprint will determine the specific dimensional placement after death.<br />
“This “system” blueprint has called your races forward toward an unseen destiny which is the return of immortality and the (eventual) reunion of the consciousness of man with its Prime Creative Source.  In terms of the soul’s perspective, the challenges and hardships faced along the way in Earth life are understood to be lessons in growth as human consciousness evolves to remember the truth of its eternal existence and embrace the beauty of its multidimensional identity. From the perspective of a human consciousness focused within a physical body on Earth, those challenges can seem, at times, overwhelming.  Without consciousness recognition of the purposes, processes and objectives of the evolutionary plan, the hardships can appear to be unbearable and without meaning.<br />
“All human souls are involved with the exact same process of evolving the genetic “package” and the consciousness to higher dimensional levels; some souls are just further along in this journey.  This is a process by which the life forms evolve through matter particles and anti-particles upward through the 15 dimensional scale, from dense matter solidity to pure, non-mattered-based conscious energy substance.<br />
“All dimensions exist in the same space, but seem to operate separately due to the particle pulsation rates of which they are composed.  The degree of angular rotation of particle spin shifts 90 degrees from one dimension to the next while remaining invisible to each other.  In the universe there are 15 primary dimensional bands.  Dimensional frequency bands group in sets of 3 and each set of three dimensions represents a Harmonic Universe.  Thus there are five Harmonic Universes within one (overall) dimensional Universe.  The degree of angular rotation of particle spin shifts 90 degrees from one dimension to the next within one Harmonic Universe.  In each Harmonic Universe containing three dimensions, there are two 90 degree shifts of the angular rotation of spin between particles.  Between one Harmonic Universe and the next there is a 45 degree reverse angular rotation of particle spin.  This 45 degree reverse angular rotation of particle spin creates a Magnetic Repulsion Zone, or void between Harmonic Universes, which keeps the reality fields contained there within separated from each other.   Through this structure of relative angular rotations of particle spin, the holographic illusions of multidimensional reality, matter, time, space, movement and individuation of form are perpetually created and sustained.  Entities existing below the 7th dimension possess physical biological forms.  Dimensions 7 through 9 possess the etheric matter form.<br />
“These multidimensional electromagnetic fields are collectively referred to as the bio-energetic system or the aura field of a manifest form.  The aura field has seven primary inner layers (i.e., bodies) which  correspond to dimensional frequency bands 1 through 7.  The aura field also has seven outer layers which represent the form-holding MORPHOGENETIC imprints for the seven inner layers of the aura field.  The morphogenetic imprint holds the instructions and design for form-building in a type of digital or electronic encoding.  The seven outer layers correspond to dimensional frequency bands 9 through 15.<br />
“The perceptions of your present races are focused within the middle range of the third dimension.  In order for humanity to evolve into higher dimensional fields, the frequency patterns of dimensions four, five and six must be brought into manifest expression with the energetic grid of Earth.  The frequencies or sound-tones must also become operational within the active DNA strands.  The energetic imprint of the DNA is carried with the personal morphogenetic field and consciousness after physical death of the body.  (Note: Morphogenetic fields are the form holding patterns through which matter forms.  Rupert Sheldrake postulated on their existence, but proposed no physical mechanism.)  Whatever frequencies are contained with that imprint will determine the dimensional placement of the consciousness after death.   The ultimate success of DNA* building lies in the hands of the embodied consciousness who personally directs the process by the way in which personal energy is used and applied.</p>
<p>            *Note 1:  Our current scientific community is thoroughly confused about the multiple strands of DNA, declaring only a few as having a known usage – and calling the remainder “junk DNA.”  Over 98% of DNA has an unknown function!  However, if it were junk, the sequence of the “syllables” i.e., the nucleotides in DNA, should be completely random.  In fact, they are not random at all, and current scientists now believe that this DNA contains some kind of code with function completely unknown or undetermined.<br />
“(At death), you will move your consciousness through a dark tunnel, with a bright light at its end, the same effect as in a Near-Death-Experience (Note: the subject of much book investigative reporting).<br />
“Multiple reincarnational** identities represent portions of a person’s soul awareness evolving.   To the soul-self identity, the immediate incarnates in its incarnational family are recognized as living sub-personality fragments of its own identity whose reality simultaneously takes place with the dimensional bands contained within the soul-self’s DNA.  The DNA represents electro-magnetically encoded digital imprints of the other living portions of your identity.         <br />
**Note 2: Reincarnation occurs only in the first Harmonic Universe.  “You reincarnate into multiple forms and situations because one lifetime is in no way sufficient time, nor does it offer sufficient exposures to enough diverse situations to give the fragment-spirit the understanding necessary.  The best way to learn about poverty, or being rich, or being helpless, or being powerful, or being female, or being male is by experiencing lifetimes in such circumstances.”  Book source: Andareon Theory communication.<br />
“Consciousness and matter are both composed of these units of electro-tonal energy and so both spiritual and scientific mastery are brought together through the applied knowledge of electro-tonal energy dynamics.   For the smallest units of energy in the cosmos you could find 800 billion billion units in an average 3 dimensional photon.  They represent the “divine substance” out of which the cosmos is composed.<br />
“There is an organizational intelligence and sentient creative force of vast proportion that is responsible for the design and creation of the cosmos, i.e., the Central Creative Force you call God***.   Members of the benevolent Guardian Alliance (Note: who communicated this book) are beings from higher reality fields, dimensions ten through fifteen, who have evolved beyond the manifestation of biology, physical and etheric matter substance into states of conscious pre-matter form who appear as forms of light when they enter your system**** or, occasionally take on the appearance of biological forms in order to interact with Earth life, for example: Jesus from the 12th dimension. <br />
***Note 3: The GOD of the Old Testament Yahweh was an Ancient Astronaut as demonstrated by the Jewish-American scholar Zecharia Sitchin who authored multiple books based on historical Middle Eastern archeological hieroglyphic interpretations.<br />

Book #2. “The Treasure of El Dorado” Chapter 7.  The Bodies of Man.		EXCERPTS from dictated communications by Ascended Masters. 			Joseph Whitfield  213 pages.   Available through Amazon.com.</p>
<p>“The value of the TREASURE is literally priceless since it could not be purchased with all the material wealth of all worlds.  The asset is the SECRET OF OVERCOMING DEATH.</p>
<p>“Few indeed are aware of the totality of their being. Existing within and around the physical bodies are IMPERISHABLE bodies.  These other bodies interpenetrate the physical body as well as extend beyond it. The various bodies which constitute the total potential of all developing human beings are: the physical matter body, the astral (antimatter) body, the etheric (Christ) body, the mental body and the emotional body.  It is these other bodies that constitute the phenomenon referred to as an aura (NOTE: Which has been proven to exist by special photographic techniques, see Wikipedia aura paranormal). The reason that the aura is not readily seen by most people is that its range of vibration renders it invisible to the physical eye. One’s CONSCIOUSNESS and other higher faculties reside in this “spiritual” (frequency existing) body and are INDESTRUCTIBLE.<br />
“WHEN PHYSICAL DEATH OCCURS, THESE OTHER BODIES LEAVE THE PHYSICAL BODY AS A UNIT AND BECOME THE OPERABLE VEHICLE THROUGH WHICH THE CONSCIOUSNESS CONTINUES TO FUNCTION IN OTHER DIMENSIONS!  While one is no longer physically incarnated, the astral body houses the other bodies after the transition called death.  Unlike the physical body, however, the astral body is inviolable, (i.e.,incorruptible).<br />
“Let us examine some of the functions which the various aspects of the astral body serve while one is physically incarnated.  The subconscious is the mechanism which performs those vital functions that produce automatic actions and reactions on the physical level. Examples of this would be breathing, beating of the heart, blinking of the eyelids, digesting, etc. It is the subconscious which permits the formation of habits and which must be reprogrammed in order to break habits and existing beliefs.  The subconscious however does not have the capacity for rational thought.  Everything that is recorded in the brain is also recorded in the subconscious.  The subconscious contains total memory information FROM ALL PREVIOUS LIVES AND EXPERIENCES (as recorded in the energetic DNA).<br />
“The brain is the memory bank while physically incarnated.  The subconscious mind is the memory bank for your total experiences. Whatever is recorded in the brain is recorded automatically in the subconscious as well.<br />
“Consider that quality of the astral body that is called soul.  Think of a cassette tape (i.e., the energetic DNA).  When the tape is blank, it can be said to contain no soul.  Now fill it with recordings.  What we have done is to impart attributes to a previously empty cassette.  We have thus CREATED SOUL.  When the life ends, the tape (i.e., the surviving energetic DNA) is filled with that essence called SOUL.  Within the total soul are many completed “tapes” containing the records of all incarnational experiences.  The completed “tapes” form the memory bank, or the akashic record of each individual being.  Whatever information is contained (from past lives), whether it be good or evil, true or false, right or wrong, correct or incorrect, can and does influence your well-being in your present life.  This is why many people go through lifetime after lifetime making the same mistakes over and over again.  In summary, the subconscious and the soul lack discernment. They cannot reason.<br />
“The conscious part of your mental body provides you with the powers of thinking.  Thinking is the capacity to discern, reason, rationalize, to exercise self-discipline, to deduce, to employ logic, to analyze, inquire, synthesize, judge, investigate, observe, etc.  THE BRAIN IS NOT THE MIND.  It is one of the instruments that the mind uses while you are manifested in the physical planes (dimensions) of expression.  The mental body has three distinct parts or levels: the conscious, the subconscious, and the superconscious.  A primary function of the mind or mental body is to produce awareness, an incredible tool in the development of potential.  As a component of the mental body, the subconscious has the ability and the capacity to record all sensual, mental, and emotional, and spiritual experiences and to “play back” this information, functioning like a tape recorder (i.e. the DNA).</p>
<p>“The etheric (or Christ) body has been described by enlightened writers.  Often referred to as the light body due to the effect produced in the atomic structure of this body by the speed of the electron movement within the atoms which equals or exceeds the speed of light.  Achieving the status of etheric (or Christhood) confers upon the recipient many powers not found in the lesser bodies. Jesus represents the best example in history.  Among the powers he was known to have demonstrated were: bilocation, levitation, materialization, healing, etc.  Jesus constantly reminded his followers that they could do all of these and even greater things.<br />
“When one achieves the full etheric (or Christ) vibration, then death will no longer have dominion over him.  It gives him the power to alter his vibrations at will, and thus he can freely travel through the physical, astral and etheric vibrations.<br />
“It is the emotional body that gives you a feeling nature, i.e., that produces the capacity for experiencing all levels of emotion such as joy and sorrow, love and hate, compassion and malevolence, ecstacy and depression, pleasure and pain, excitement and indifference. The emotional capacity is experienced on all levels of expression.<br />
“The superconscious is the functioning mind of the etheric or Christ self.  What is required is that man of earth become aware of the existence of the incredible power of the superconscious mind and desire its attainment. To give you some idea of the scope of the superconscious mind, think of a rating scale numbered from 1 to 10 as representing the range of man’s conscious mind in Earth.  Then classify the most outstanding geniuses of Earth history using 10 as the ultimate that is attainable.  You will find that such men as Einstein, Swedenborg, Whitman, etc., would be rated from perhaps 7 through 9.  By comparison, a pure state of superconsciousness would range into the hundreds or thousands.  It is quite easy to conclude from this, is it not, that the means exist to literally transform Earth into a paradise by educating mankind as to its potential.<br />
“These bodies constitute man’s potential as he continues to evolve within the “system.”  Each aspect of our total self is indispensable to the function and purpose of our total being.  </p>

***Abduction to the 9th Planet, republished under title “Thiaoouba Prophecy” by Michel Desmarquet, Arafura Publishing, Australia      He was abducted physically in 1987 for nine days by the spiritually most highly evolved and most technically developed planet in our galaxy.   He confirmed and detailed the existence of IMPERISHABLE aura, reincarnation, and astral/etheric<br />
afterlife on progressively more advance planets !!  Excerpts below.<br />
“Your Astral body, which inhabits every normal human being, transfers to its higher-self all the sensations that are experienced during a lifetime in a physical body. A normal  human Astral body contains approximately four billion, trillion electrons, exactly marrying your physical shape.<br />
“The more you cultivate your mind, the less you will be burdened by your physical body and the quicker you will proceed through your cycle of lives.  Regarding the problems of your planet, Michel, the solution depends on love, not money. People need to rise above hate, resentment, jealousy and envy, and put their neighbor before themselves.<br />
“There are nine categories of planets. You are on the planet Thiaooabu which is the top of the scale. Earth is a planet of the first category which could be likened to a kindergarten. We are one of three planets which are the most highly evolved. </p>
