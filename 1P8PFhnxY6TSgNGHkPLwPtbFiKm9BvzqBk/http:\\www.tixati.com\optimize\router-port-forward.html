<big style="font-weight: bold;"><big>Forwarding Ports in a Broadband Router</big></big><br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction</span><br>
<br>
Broadband routers are in wide use today.&nbsp; They enable multiple
computers to share a single internet connection, and also provide
enhanced security by not allowing arbitrary incoming TCP connections
from the internet to reach computers on the LAN (Local Area Network)
side of the router.<br>
<br>
A broadband router can be a stand alone device with one end plugged
into your Cable/DSL modem and the other end plugged into your computer
or a wireless antenna, or sometimes they are built directly into DSL
and Cable modems.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img style="width: 120px; height: 92px;" alt="" src="dlink-router.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img style="width: 120px; height: 106px;" alt="" src="netgear-router.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img style="width: 125px; height: 114px;" alt="" src="linksys-router.jpg"><br>
<br>
Broadband routers keep track of all outgoing connections from the LAN
side by maintaining an internal mapping table of which computer on the
LAN is responsible for a given outgoing connection to a particular
destination on the internet.&nbsp; This allows two-way communication
between computers on your LAN and computers on the internet, so long as
it was a computer on your LAN that initiated the connection in the
first place.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 480px; height: 207px;" alt="" src="rtr-outgoing.png"><br>
<br>
When an unsolicited connection comes in from the internet (perhaps from
another peer in a download swarm), your router does not know what
computer, if any, in the LAN should receive the connection, and will
block it.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 494px; height: 207px;" alt="" src="rtr-incoming.png"><br>
<br>
In order to receive incoming connections from the internet to your
computer on the LAN side of the router, you need to change a setting in
the router's configuration so that it forwards all incoming connections
for a particular port number to your computer in your LAN.&nbsp; There
are a few different ways to do this.<br>
<br>
Before you forward a port, you need to know what port numbers Tixati is
configured to use.&nbsp; Refer to step 2 and step 3 in the <a href="index.html#incconn">Optimizing Guide</a> for more information.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Simplest Way to Forward a Port:&nbsp; Universal Plug and Play (UPNP)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Universal Plug and Play is supported by many broadband routers.&nbsp;
It automates the process of mapping an incoming TCP port from the
internet to a particular computer on the LAN side of your router.<br>
<br>
To see if this will work for you, the UPNP option within Tixati needs
to be enabled.<br>
<br>
Click the 'Settings' button at
the top of the main window.&nbsp; The Settings window will appear.&nbsp; Click
"Network &gt; Incoming Ports" in the list along the left side.&nbsp;
You should see something like this:<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 491px; height: 426px;" alt="" src="networksettings_small.png"><br>
<br>
You will see that your incoming TCP and incoming UDP settings are in view.&nbsp; If UPNP is already activated, it will be
indicated as shown here:<br>
<img style="width: 348px; height: 106px;" alt="" src="upnp-on.png"><br>
<br>
If this is the case, UPNP is already active, and if you are receiving
incoming connections and DHT messages (see step 2 and 3 in the <a href="index.html#incconn">Optimizing guide</a>),
then you can skip the rest of the steps on this page.&nbsp; If UPNP was
already active and you are not receiving incoming connections or DHT
messages, your router probably does not support UPNP and you will have
to proceed to the <a href="#manual">next section</a> below.<br>
<br>
If UPNP is not active, it is simple to activate it.&nbsp; Click the change button:<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 348px; height: 106px;" alt="" src="upnp-activate.png"><br>
<br>
A pop-up window will appear, from which you can activate UPNP:<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 469px; height: 235px;" alt="" src="upnp-activate-popup.png"><br>
<br>
Repeat this to activate UPNP for the UDP port as well.<br>
<br>
Now that you've activated UPNP, repeat steps 2 and 3 in the <a href="index.html#incconn">Optimizing Guide</a>
to see if UPNP is working for you.&nbsp; Not all broadband routers
support UPNP, and some support it but are very unreliable when
forwarding incoming connections this way.<br>
<br>
If after activating UPNP and running some transfers and the DHT for a
few minutes you still are not receiving incoming connections and DHT
packets, you can resort to manually configuring your router to forward
incoming connections to your computer on the LAN side of the
router.&nbsp; That is covered in the next section.<br>
<br>
<a name="manual"></a><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Configuring Your Router to Forward a Port</span><br>
<br>
If UPNP is not working for you, this is the alternative.&nbsp; This
procedure may be difficult for users that are new to computing and the
internet.&nbsp; It is important to remember that receiving incoming
connections is not necessary for good performance from Tixati, and if
you are not confident when it comes to configuring your router, you may
not want to do this.<br>
<br>
First, you should make sure your computer has a static private IP
address in your LAN.&nbsp; The procedure for doing this on different
operating systems is beyond the scope of this guide, but we have
provided the following links which outline the procedure:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://portforward.com/networking/static-win7.htm" target="_blank">PortForward.com - Configuring a Static IP Address in Windows 7</a><br>
<br>
<a href="http://portforward.com/networking/static-vista.htm" target="_blank">PortForward.com - Configuring a Static IP Address in Windows Vista</a><br>
<a href="http://portforward.com/networking/static-xp.htm" target="_blank"><br>
PortForward.com - Configuring a Static IP Address in Windows XP</a><br>
<br>
When following the above procedures, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">make a note of the static IP that you've chosen</span>.<br>
<br>
The next step is forwarding the port in your router's
configuration.&nbsp; This is usually done by directing your web-browser
to your router's IP address, which is usually http://192.168.1.1 or
http://192.168.0.1 .&nbsp; You will be prompted for a user name and
password, which by default is usually "admin" for either the user name
or password, or sometimes both.&nbsp; Once you've logged in, you will
be presented with a web-based configuration interface that allows you
to make the needed changes.<br>
<br>
Because there are many different brands of broadband router and the
procedures for accessing and configuring them vary greatly, we can't
outline the specific procedures for each one.&nbsp; Here are some links
which should help you:<br>

<a href="http://www.portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/routerindex.htm" target="_blank">PortForward.com - List of Routers by Brand</a>&nbsp; (this link contains instructions for dozens of different routers)<br>
<br>
<br>
Once you've finished configuring port forwarding in your router, you should repeat steps 2 and 3 in the <a href="index.html#incconn">Optimizing Guide</a> to see if you can now receive incoming connections and DHT messages.<br>
