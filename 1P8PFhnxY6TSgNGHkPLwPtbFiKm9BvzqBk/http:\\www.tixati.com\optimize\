<big style="font-weight: bold;"><big>Optimizing Tixati</big></big><br>
<br>
<br>
Tixati works well with the default settings, but there are a few things
every user should do to make sure they are getting the fastest download
speeds possible.<br>
<br>
The following instructions are provided as a general guide for all
users.&nbsp; Because internet connection speeds and latency can vary
greatly, you should feel free to experiment with the settings to find
what works best for you.<br>
<br>
<br><a name="throttle"></a>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 1: Set Your Outgoing Bandwidth Throttle</span></big><br>
<br>
On some internet connections, especially DSL and Cable modems, too much
outgoing traffic can choke off all traffic and will effect your
download speed.&nbsp; Tixati features both incoming and outgoing
bandwidth throttles.&nbsp; It is generally not necessary to set the
incoming bandwidth throttle, but all users should set the outgoing
throttle to prevent too much outgoing traffic from slowing your
downloads.<br>
<br>
Most users will get the best results with the outgoing bandwidth
throttle set to about 70-80% of total capacity, which can vary greatly
depending on how fast your internet service is.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How To Figure Out Your Outgoing Bandwidth Capacity</span><br>
<br>
If you already know what your outgoing bandwidth capacity is, you can skip this step.<br>
<br>
There are a few ways to figure out how fast your internet connection is
in terms of outgoing bandwidth.&nbsp; One of the quickest and easiest
ways is to use an online speed test.<br>
<br>
There are many online speed tests, but some will only tell you your
incoming speed and will not test your outgoing speed.&nbsp; One that
gives you both incoming and outgoing is on <a href="http://speedtest.net" target="_blank">http://speedtest.net</a> , and there is also another decent one on <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/stest" target="_blank">http://www.dslreports.com/stest</a> .<br>
<br>
Once you've completed the test, you will see results that look something like this:<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 336px; height: 210px;" alt="" src="stn-speedtest.png"><br>
<br>
<img style="width: 508px; height: 136px;" alt="" src="dslr-speedtest.png"><br>
<br>
<br>
Make sure you are looking at Upload speed.&nbsp; These speed tests give
results in different units, such as Mb/s and Kb/s.<br>
<br>
Note the difference between upper-case "B" and lower-case "b" when you
are working with units.&nbsp; Upper-case means bytes, lower-case means
bits.&nbsp; There are 8 bits in a byte.<br>
<br>
You will need
to convert your results into kilobytes per second (KB/s) according to the following
table:<br>
<br>
<table style="text-align: left;" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Kb/s (kilobits per second)<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">divide by 8<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">example: 628 Kb/s divided by 8 = 78.5 KB/s<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Mb/s (megabits per second)<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">multiply by 125<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">example: 0.64 Mb/s x 125 = 80 KB/s<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">MB/s (megabytes per second)<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">multiply by 1,000<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
From the results in our examples, we know our internet connection has an 80 KB/s (kilobytes per second) outgoing capacity.<br>
<br>
It is usually best to set your outgoing throttle at about 70-80% of
capacity.&nbsp; Since our capacity is 80 KB/s, we will set our
throttle to 80 x 0.7, which equals 56 KB/s.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How To Set Your Outgoing Bandwidth Throttle</span><br>
<br>
To set the outgoing throttle in Tixati, first click the 'Bandwidth'
button at the top of the main window.&nbsp; This will switch to the
Bandwidth view where the throttle controls are:<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="outgoing-throttle.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 587px; height: 479px;" alt="" src="outgoing-throttle_small.png"></a></span><br>
(click this image for a sharper full-size picture)<br>
<br>
Once we have switched to the Bandwidth view, we activate the 'Maximum'
checkbox in the lower (outgoing) area, and type our desired limit of
56 into the box underneath and press ENTER, as shown by the green arrow.<br>
<br>
You may want to experiment with raising or lowering the throttle when
you are running many transfers to see what is the best setting.&nbsp;
If you set it too low, your downloading rate might suffer because you
are not uploading enough for other peers to reciprocate.&nbsp; If you
set it too high, it may choke your Cable/DSL modem and impact your
downloading rate.&nbsp; You can usually tell it is too high if the
bandwidth chart is jagged, like on the left side of the above picture.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="incconn"></a><br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 2: Make sure you can receive incoming connections</span></big><br>
<br>
In any peer-to-peer system it is important to be able to receive
incoming TCP connections from other peers.&nbsp; Without this ability,
a peer can only place outgoing connections and becomes isolated from
other peers that also can't receive incoming connections.<br>
<br>
In many swarms, it is typical for nearly half of the peers to not be
able to receive incoming connections.&nbsp; This means if you are one
of these peers, you are missing out on downloading from many other
peers with your same situation.&nbsp; If you could receive incoming
connections, these peers could connect to you and provide you with a
faster transfer.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How do I know whether I can receive incoming connections?</span><br>
<br>
It is easy to tell if you are unable to receive incoming
connections.&nbsp; First, get a few downloads going.&nbsp; Make sure
they are healthy swarms with plenty of other peers.<br>
<br>
After about five minutes, look at the bottom of the main window:<br>
<img style="width: 512px; height: 67px;" alt="" src="no-inc-conn.png"><br>
<br>
If you see "0 Incoming Connections Received" like in the picture, you
haven't received any incoming connections and you probably have a
firewall and/or broadband router that is preventing this.<br>
<br>
If you don't see "0 Incoming Connections Received", you have been
receiving incoming connections, and you can skip this entire section.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why can't I receive incoming connections?</span><br>
<br>
There can be many reasons for this, but generally it is because of a
network firewall built into your operating system, or because you are
using a broadband router.<br>
<br>First, determine what TCP port number Tixati is configured
to use for incoming connections.&nbsp; Click the 'Settings' button at
the top of the main window.&nbsp; The Settings window will
appear.&nbsp; Click "Network &gt; Incoming Ports" in the list along the
left side.&nbsp;
You should see something like this:<br>
<br>
<a href="tcpport.png"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 562px; height: 488px;" alt="" src="tcpport_small.png"></span></a><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">(click this image for a sharper full-size version)</span><br>
<br>
Notice the incoming TCP connection port #.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Make a note of this number.</span><br>
<br>
Please consult the following guides to make sure your firewall and/or
broadband router is configured to allow incoming connections on your
TCP port:<br>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 3:&nbsp; Make sure DHT can receive incoming UDP packets</span></big><br>
<br>
DHT is an alternative to traditional http torrent trackers, and can
help you find more peers, especially if a tracker is unreliable.<br>
<br>
DHT needs to receive incoming UDP packets from the internet to work
optimally.&nbsp; This may be prevented by a firewall in your operating
system, or by a broadband router you are using.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How do I know if I am receiving UDP packets for DHT?</span><br>
<br>
First, make sure DHT is running.&nbsp; At the top of the Tixati main
window, click the 'DHT' button to switch to the DHT view.&nbsp; If you
see the word 'Stopped' in red in the status area, click the 'Start'
button, as shown in the following picture:<br>
<br>
<a href="dht-stopped.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 583px; height: 526px;" alt="" src="dht-stopped_small.png"></a><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">(click this image for a sharper full-size version)</span><br>
<br>
<br>
If your DHT status looks like this:<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 511px; height: 82px;" alt="" src="dht002.png"><br>
<br>
it means you should start a few downloads before continuing.&nbsp; DHT
gets it's initial list of other DHT peers from active file transfers
within Tixati.&nbsp; Once you start a few downloads, the DHT will
gather some IPs to build up it's table.&nbsp; Once the DHT table is
built up, it will be saved between sessions for quicker startup without
the need to gather IPs from file transfers.<br>
<br>
After DHT has been running for a few minutes, check the status again.<br>
<br>
If your DHT status looks like this:<br>
<img style="width: 531px; height: 82px;" alt="" src="dht-running.png"><br>
<br>
it means you are receiving incoming DHT packets and you can skip the rest of this section.<br>
<br>
If after 5 minutes your DHT status still looks like this:<br>
<img style="width: 532px; height: 80px;" alt="" src="dht-portunc.png"><br>
<br>
it means you are unable to receive incoming DHT packets and you will
need to configure your firewall and/or broadband router to open an
incoming UDP port.<br>
<br>
First, determine what UDP port number Tixati is using for
DHT messages.&nbsp; Click the 'Settings' button at the top of the main
window.&nbsp; The Settings window will appear.&nbsp; Click "Network &gt; Incoming Ports" in the list along the left side.&nbsp;
You should see something like this:<br>
<br>
<a href="udpport.png"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 562px; height: 488px;" alt="" src="udpport_small.png"></span></a><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">(click this image for a sharper full-size version)</span><br>
<br>
Notice the UDP port # for DHT.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Make a note of this number.</span><br>
<br>
Please consult the following guides to make sure your firewall and/or
broadband router are configured to allow incoming UDP packets on your
Tixati UDP port:<br>
