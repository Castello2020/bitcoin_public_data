			<small class="meta">July 11th, 2014 </small>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts ruled Wednesday that police officers cannot search vehicles based solely upon the smell of unburnt marijuana, <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2014/07/09/smell-marijuana-alone-can-longer-justify-police-search/OIpI8Jfs7g0aFJG220P09H/story.html"><strong>Boston.com reports</strong></a>. The court had previously decided that warrantless searches of pedestrians or cars for the smell of burned marijuana were illegal in 2011. They believed that allowing unwarranted searches based on the smell of marijuana would be inconsistent with the 2008 law that decriminalized marijuana in Massachusetts. The ruling on Wednesday was based on the fact that the human nose cannot discern the presence of a criminal amount of marijuana as opposed to a non-criminal amount. Possession of less than an ounce is not a crime in Massachusetts and, as the police cannot reliably distinguish criminal amounts of marijuana by smell, searches would not be legal. The justices wrote, “We are not confident, at least on this record, that a human nose can discern reliably the presence of a criminal amount of marijuana, as distinct from an amount subject only to a civil fine.”</p>
<p>The court said this decision was consistent with the will of the people who want the police to focus on more serious crimes. The court rejected the argument from law enforcement that they can search vehicles based on the smell of marijuana because possession of marijuana is still a criminal offense under federal law. Justice Barbara Lenk said, “The fact that such conduct is technically subject to a Federal prohibition does not provide an independent justification for a warrantless search.”</p>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>The rollout of <a href="http://www.mpp.org/states/massachusetts" ><strong>Massachusetts’</strong></a> medical marijuana program has been proceeding more slowly than anticipated, but a major milestone was reached last week with the approval of 11 dispensary applications. <strong><a style="color: #4c7094;" href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/2014/06/27/former-congressman-and-boston-companies-lose-out-bids-for-marijuana-dispensaries/F5wjdfC3QgnBWq4yrvSl7J/story.html" >The Department of Public Health granted eleven provisional certificates on Friday</a></strong>, and it’s possible that some of the approved dispensaries will be ready to serve patients before the end of this year.</p>
<p>The department had previously given preliminary approval to 20 applicants, but, after further review of the applications, nine were rejected. Massachusetts’ law authorizes up to 35 dispensaries, so these rejected applicants and others will be allowed to reapply in 2015.</p>
<p>Additionally, it’s disappointing that the state has not yet made it possible for patients to apply for ID cards. However, with dispensaries planning to open in only a matter of months, it seems likely that the ID card issue will soon be resolved.</p>

			<small class="meta">June 11th, 2014 </small>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>On Tuesday, MPP and allied advocates launched a ballot referendum committee to make marijuana legal, taxed, and regulated for adults in Massachusetts. The committee is called the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol in Massachusetts and will allow MPP to begin raising money within Massachusetts. Massachusetts voters have shown a desire to reform their marijuana laws, first by decriminalizing simple possession in 2008, and then by approving a medical marijuana ballot initiative in 2012. In addition, <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/225340486/WBUR-Poll-Views-On-Casinos">a recent poll</a> taken by WBUR/MassINC Polling Group found that 49% of Massachusetts voters support making marijuana legal.</p>
<p>MPP’s Mason Tvert weighed in on the future of MPP’s involvement in Massachusetts <a href="http://www.commonwealthmagazine.org/News-and-Features/Online-exclusives/2014/Spring/063-Group-plans-bid-for-Mass-marijuana-legalization.aspx#.U5h4Kyj1tMZ">in Commonwealth Magazine</a>, stating, “We’re going to be spending the next year working to build a coalition. We really want to replicate the Colorado process, and not just the winning part. We spent six months drafting the best possible initiative, and the most effective system we felt was possible. That’s our goal in Massachusetts: to get a large group of stakeholders, and write the best possible law. If the legislature wants to participate in drafting the law, they’ll have the opportunity. And if not, and if we believe it’s something the voters want, we have no choice but to take it to the ballot.”</p>

				<p><span><a href="http://www.cannabisnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/a-k_cannabis-flowering-outdoor.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1264" title="a-k_cannabis-flowering-outdoor" src="http://www.cannabisnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/a-k_cannabis-flowering-outdoor-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>The young woman pulled her Subaru wagon into the parking lot of a Framingham hotel Wednesday night for a prearranged meeting with someone she knew only as Kool Guy, a man with short black hair and glasses who resembled actor Joaquin Phoenix.</span></p>
<p><span>She handed him $250 cash for an ounce of marijuana dubbed Blue Cheese. He threw in four free samples — chocolate and caramel candies laced with THC, the ingredient responsible for the drug’s high.</span></p>
<p><span>“The first time we met, I was nervous,” said the 31-year-old woman named Janeen, who found Kool Guy through a website that matches medical marijuana patients nationwide with “caregivers” in their area who supply cannabis that they have grown or bought from others. Now, making her fourth purchase to help with severe migraines, Janeen felt comfortable enough to bring along the 97-year-old woman she cares for.</span></p>
<p><span>Kool Guy is part of a booming cottage industry of self-described caregivers who have jumped in to meet the demand created by the state’s year-and-a-half-old medical marijuana law. While Massachusetts health officials have been preoccupied with vetting and licensing storefront dispensaries, these entrepreneurs are hawking products with names such as Jack the Ripper and Sour Diesel on the Internet. They operate in a legal gray area, with no regulation or oversight.</span></p>
<p><span>Bill Downing, a longtime activist for legalizing marijuana who is from Reading, said his company, Yankee Care Givers, delivers medicinal cannabis products grown by “old hippies” to about 940 patients throughout Massachusetts who order from the company’s website. His prices range from $320 an ounce for strains of marijuana called Green Crack, Sweet Tooth, and Blueberry Cannabis Flowers to $7 for another, edible variety, Green Karma Happy Taffy Lollies.</span></p>
<p><span>The caregivers and patients such as Janeen, who asked to be identified by only her first name, said that they’ are following the law and state health regulations. The rules allow patients with doctor-provided certificates to grow marijuana or have a caregiver cultivate it or obtain it for them &#8212; up to 10 ounces for a 60-day supply. Caregivers are limited to supplying just one patient at a time, but caregivers, patients, and even some police officials say the rules are unclear and open to interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span>The state Department of Public Health issued guidelines for law enforcement in March, but Reading Police Chief James Cormier said they leave many questions unanswered.</span></p>
<p><span>“We are in a big state of confusion right now,” he said. “What we need is a clear definition of what is a caregiver.”</span></p>
<p><span>The state health agency is aware of the flourishing trade, but has apparently done nothing to stop it. Karen van Unen, director of the department’s medical marijuana program, declined to be interviewed, and did not answer questions submitted through a spokesman about whether the proliferation of online caregivers serving multiple customers violates state regulations.</span></p>
<p><span>Van Unen released a statement, saying: “The Department actively cooperates with law enforcement when there are concerns about violations of these regulations, and is developing an online system which will provide law enforcement with real-time access to patient and caregiver registration, and will improve officials’ ability to monitor compliance.”</span></p>
<p><span>Since voters legalized medical marijuana in November 2012, the state has granted preliminary approval for 20 dispensaries, but has delayed licensing them amid revelations that some of the companies made misrepresentations on their applications that the state failed to uncover before selecting them.</span></p>
<p><span>Many patients have meanwhile received certificates from physicians allowing them to obtain marijuana for an array of conditions. But with dispensaries not expected to open until the fall at the earliest, they have turned to the Internet, where sites such as marijuana-caregiver.com provide a list of eager suppliers.</span></p>
<p><span>Patients and caregivers find each other through forums on the website and then arrange purchases through e-mail, private messaging, texting, and phone calls. The site includes patients’ ratings of caregivers, and frequent posts about upcoming deliveries around Massachusetts.</span></p>
<p><span>“We are caregivers and patients on Cape Cod looking to help other patients in need,” read one post.</span></p>
<p><span>Another person wrote, “Are there any caregivers that would be willing to grow for my wife? Not sure if this is even possible with these ridiculous MA laws.”</span></p>
<p><span>Caregivers registered on the site say patients must provide a copy of their doctor’s certificate and identification before they will sell them marijuana. Some refer to their prices as a “donation,” in an apparent effort to comply with state regulations that prohibit caregivers from making a profit on marijuana.</span></p>
<p><span>Many of the caregivers have their own doctors’ certificate that allows them to legally carry up to 10 ounces of marijuana in Massachusetts.</span></p>
<p><span>“I don’t think I’m breaking the law,” said Kool Guy, who spoke on the condition he not be named for fear of legal problems and because he wants to maintain his privacy.</span></p>
<p><span>“You have to fill the void with something and that’s what we’re doing right now. When the dispensaries open up, we are going to dwindle away.”</span></p>
<p><span>Kool Guy said he grows a small amount of marijuana and has to buy from other caregivers to meet the demand of about 20 patients. He said he delivers to department store parking lots and million-dollar houses in Boston’s most affluent suburbs, depending on what the patient prefers.</span></p>
<p><span>“I feel bad for these people,” said Kool Guy, who described his patients as mostly middle-aged and suffering from various ailments, including cancer, AIDS, Parkinson’s disease, chronic pain, and anxiety.</span></p>
<p><span>Another caregiver who posts on the website said he is part of a cooperative composed of a small group of military veterans who grow marijuana for their medical needs and deliver any surplus to other patients.</span></p>
<p><span>“We started out as patients and it wasn’t available, or what was available was steeply overpriced or black market,” he said, adding that he works a full-time construction job and only takes “donations” from other patients to offset the cost of cultivation.</span></p>
<p><span>“You are not doing it for profit, you are doing it to help people,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span>Tom Brandes of Phoenix, the administrator of marijuana-caregiver.com, said he launched the site a couple of years ago when medical cannabis became legal in Arizona, then expanded to other states.</span></p>
<p><span>Brandes said he doesn’t charge patients or caregivers to register and post messages. The site does not conduct background checks and it is up to patients and caregivers to vet each other and follow the law, he said.</span></p>
<p><span>“I’m not going to try to police it; I can’t,” said Brandes, adding that he can’t keep drug dealers from trying to infiltrate the site, but enlists moderators to monitor activity.</span></p>
<p><span>Downing, 55, the owner of Yankee Care Givers, said during a telephone interview that he is different from other caregivers on the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span>“I’m the only actual caregiver,” he said. “Those guys are drug dealers.”</span></p>
<p><span>Downing said the Department of Public Health is aware of his business because he sends it a form signed by each of his patients, designating him as their caregiver. He said it is unclear what the department does with the forms since the state has yet to create the planned registration system for patients and caregivers.</span></p>
<p><span>Downing said the one-patient limit per caregiver does not apply to him because state regulations say personal care attendants are exempt from that rule and his business is defined as a personal services company. (Several other caregivers said in interviews they should not be limited to one patient because people shop around and do not stick with one caregiver.)</span></p>
<p><span>Downing, the father of two teenaged boys, said his company is nonprofit and he was growing marijuana at his home until police warned him last month that they suspected he was going to be robbed and that he was endangering his family. He said police told him they believed his business was illegal, but did not arrest him.</span></p>
<p><span>Cormier, the Reading chief, said he thinks Downing is breaking the law and has repeatedly asked the Department of Public Health over the last two months for a written opinion on whether he is.</span></p>
<p><span>“I am frustrated with the DPH,” Cormier said. “I believe that there’s a potential loophole in terms of the so-called caregiver exception that is being exploited. The frustration comes because we need DPH to give us an opinion in writing and we have not received it.”</span></p>
<p><span>Cormier said his department received numerous complaints from neighbors about Downing’s brisk business and he remains under investigation.</span></p>
<p><span>Downing said he has relocated his business to an undisclosed site and is buying marijuana from “black market growers who have been in business for decades, servicing the market with high, organic quality marijuana . . . just old hippies.”</span></p>
<p><span>Not everybody finds caregivers online. Scott Murphy, a 31-year-old Iraq veteran and father of three young children, said he started using marijuana about two years ago to ease the pain of his degenerative arthritis. Murphy buys tincture, a marijuana-infused oil, from a caregiver he met at a gathering of marijuana advocates.</span></p>
<p><span>The caregiver process is far better than buying it off the street, he said, because it’s cheaper and his caregiver sells only products that have been lab-tested.</span></p>
<p><span>“My caregiver switched to a delivery service that can meet you wherever it’s convenient for you, whether it be your house or another location,” said Murphy, a Newton resident who is completing his undergraduate degree, applying to law school, and running a nonprofit that promotes veterans’ health issues.</span></p>
<p><span>Matthew Allen, executive director of the Massachusetts Patient Advocacy Alliance, said he gets calls daily from patients who are seeking a medical marijuana caregiver, but his organization is unable to help them because it does not have a system to ensure the services that are springing up are reliable and comply with state law.</span></p>
<p><span>The alliance is lobbying to change the state regulation restricting caregivers to one patient, and wants to adopt the rules in Rhode Island and Maine, which allow five patients per caregiver.</span></p>
<p><span>“We do want caregivers to offer this service, staying within the boundaries of the law,” Allen said. “But this regulation makes it impossible to do that even for those with the best intentions.”</span></p>

<p>The law allows for 35 dispensary licenses; however, only 20 have been granted so far. More competition will mean lower prices for patients, so, the sooner the last 15 licenses are granted, the better.</p>

				<p>A majority of likely Massachusetts voters support legalizing marijuana, according to a Suffolk University/Boston Herald <a href="http://www.suffolk.edu/documents/SUPRC/2_4_2014_marginals.pdf">poll</a> released today.</p>
<p>Fifty-three percent of respondents said that they &#8220;favor &#8230; the legalization of marijuana.&#8221; Thirty-seven percent of respondents opposed legalization. Ten percent were undecided.</p>
<p>In previous elections, Massachusetts voters have overwhelmingly approved statewide ballot measures <a href="http://blog.norml.org/2008/11/05/truth-prevails/">decriminalizing marijuana possession</a> offenses and legalizing the <a href="http://blog.norml.org/2013/01/02/massachusetts-medical-cannabis-law-takes-effect/">dispensing of the plant</a> for therapeutic purposes.</p>
<p>Local activists have already <a href="http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/11/new_massachusetts_ballot_commi.html">begun plans</a> for a possible 2016 ballot initiative drive on the question of full legalization. </p>
<p>The Suffolk poll possesses a margin or error of +/- 4 percent. </p>
<p>Over the past few months, <a href="http://blog.norml.org/2014/02/03/hawaii-66-percent-of-voters-back-legalizing-cannabis/">separate statewide polls</a> in Arizona, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Hampshire, Oregon, and Texas have all shown majority support for legalizing the adult consumption of cannabis. </p>
<p>Recent national polls by <a href="http://norml.org/news/2013/10/24/gallup-nationwide-support-for-legalizing-marijuana-at-record-levels">Gallup</a> (58 percent), <a href="http://norml.org/news/2014/01/09/most-americans-believe-marijuana-should-be-made-legal">CNN</a> (55 percent), <a href="http://norml.org/news/2014/01/30/two-new-nationwide-polls-find-that-majority-of-americans-believe-marijuana-should-be-legal">CBS</a> (51 percent), and <a href="http://norml.org/news/2014/01/30/two-new-nationwide-polls-find-that-majority-of-americans-believe-marijuana-should-be-legal">NBC</a> (55 percent) have also shown majority support for legalizing cannabis.</p>

				<p>Building on steadily increasing public support, a coalition of marijuana policy reformers are looking to 2016 to get an initiative on the <a href="http://www.mpp.org/states/massachusetts"><strong>Massachusetts</strong></a><a href="http://blog.mpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/MA-seal.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-7221 alignright" style="margin: 10px;" alt="MA seal" src="http://blog.mpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/MA-seal.jpg" width="130" height="130" /></a> ballot to make marijuana legal for adults and regulate it similarly to alcohol.</p>
<p>MPP was largely responsible for the successful 2008 campaign to remove the threat of arrest for possession of small amounts of marijuana in the state. Now, national and local advocates are <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/massachusetts/2014/01/13/advocates-marijuana-legalization-turn-attention-massachusetts/OeBlgcAC5MtWvNKYXoysAK/story.html"><strong>preparing to end marijuana prohibition in the Bay State</strong></a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Outside groups are already pledging support &#8211; strategic and financial &#8211; to push for legalization in Massachusetts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Marijuana Policy Project, a national nonprofit that says it spent about $2 million on the successful 2012 campaign for legalization in Colorado, also plans to spend money in this state.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;We intend to support an initiative in Massachusetts in 2016 that would regulate and tax marijuana like alcohol,&#8221; said spokesman Mason Tvert.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8230;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Bill Downing, treasurer of Bay State Repeal, a group created to get the legalization question on the ballot, said he expects other national groups to back the effort here.</p>

			<small class="meta">November 25th, 2013 </small>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>NORML filed an <a href="http://norml.org/legal/brief-bank">&#8220;amicus curiae&#8221; brief </a>with the state supreme appellate court on Friday, November 22, urging the court to enforce the limits on police searches set by 2008&#8242;s voter-initiative state decriminalization law, which eliminating police searches and arrests for possession of small amounts of marijuana. Attorneys <a href="http://lawyers.norml.org/massachusetts/michael-d-cutler">Michael Cutler</a> of Northampton and <a href="http://lawyers.norml.org/massachusetts/steve-s-epstein">Steven Epstein </a>of Georgetown authored the brief.<a href="http://assets.blog.norml.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/norml_remember_prohibition_.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-306" alt="norml_remember_prohibition_" src="http://assets.blog.norml.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/norml_remember_prohibition_.jpg" width="300" height="408" /></a></p>
<p>In this case a Boston judge initially ruled a 2011 police search &#8212; based entirely on the smell of unburnt marijuana &#8212; violated the “decriminalization” law which made possession of an ounce or less of marijuana a civil infraction subject only to a fine, thereby ending police authority to search or arrest the possessor. The state appealed.</p>
<p>Earlier in 2011 the state supreme court ruled, in a case in which NORML also filed an amicus brief, that police searches based only on the odor of burnt marijuana were now illegal. The court reasoned that smell alone did not establish probable cause to believe a criminal amount (more than an ounce) was present, so police had no power to search or arrest.</p>
<p>NORML asks the court to reject the Boston prosecutor&#8217;s claim that federal prohibition &#8212; which allows arrest and imprisonment for any amount of cannabis under federal law &#8212; trumps the state decriminalization law and allows police to ignore state law and use evidence from smell-based searches in state courts.</p>
<p>NORML argues that state prosecutors and police must obey state law and state appellate court rulings under the state constitution&#8217;s separation of powers doctrine, requiring the executive branch to obey the legislative branch&#8217;s laws and the judicial branch&#8217;s limits on police conduct under state law and the state’s constitution.</p>
<p>Finally, NORML argues that the state prosecutor’s position violates fundamental principles of Federalism, which limit federal “preemption” of state law only where state law &#8220;positively conflicts&#8221; with federal law. Since the August 2013 federal Justice Department Guidance memo to  federal prosecutors nationwide, recommending no interference with state laws legalizing marijuana in a responsible manner, no such conflict exists between federal and state authority.</p>
<p>Oral argument in the case of <i>Commonwealth v. Craan</i> is scheduled for early February, with a decision possible by June 2014.</p>

				<p><span><a href="http://www.cannabisnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/marijuana-dispensary1.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1017" title="marijuana-dispensary1" src="http://www.cannabisnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/marijuana-dispensary1-150x150.jpeg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Doctors at Massachusetts community health centers have been advised not to authorize any of their more than 638,000 patients to obtain marijuana for medical purposes because the centers fear they would lose their federal funding.</span></p>
<p><span>The Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers has advised its 36 federally funded facilities to hold off on issuing patient marijuana certifications under the state’s new medical marijuana law, because use remains illegal under federal law.</span></p>
<p><span>Health center physicians who believe marijuana might be beneficial for certain patients and authorize its use could be committing a “potential violation of federal law and could result in legal and financial exposure for community health centers,” according to a statement from the League.</span></p>
<p><span>This disconnect between state and federal marijuana law is cropping up in other areas as well; some rules restrict tenants who use medical marijuana from living in federally subsidized housing, or prevent Veterans Administration hospitals and clinics from authorizing medical marijuana.</span></p>
<p><span>Voters approved a ballot initiative in November, making Massachusetts one of 20 states, and the District of Columbia, that allow medical marijuana use. Community health centers in other states also have advised doctors against authorizing patients to use marijuana.</span></p>
<p><span>It is not just federal funding at stake if the centers certify patients for marijuana use, but also loss of malpractice insurance, covered by a federal program known as the Federal Tort Claims Act. </span></p>
<p><span>Also, should a community health center physician be convicted under federal law for certifying a patient, the physician could be shut out of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the insurance that covers many who use health centers.</span></p>
<p><span>The National Association of Community Health Centers is unaware of any center or center physician that have faced federal sanctions for prescribing medical marijuana, but the threat of prosecution or funding loss looms large.</span></p>
<p><span>“Community health centers have been providing access to care for decades, but there is no assurance that they would not come under federal investigation or that their physicians would not face trouble for certifying medical conditions under state medical marijuana programs, given it is an unsettled area of the law,” said Kathryn Watson, an attorney at Feldesman Tucker Leifer Fidell, a Washington-based law firm that advises the national group.</span></p>
<p><span>With health insurance unlikely to cover medical marijuana treatments, state regulators tried to ensure that lower-income people would be able to afford medical marijuana. State-licensed cannabis dispensaries must offer discounted or free marijuana to patients with documented financial hardship, but the community health centers’ stance could undermine that goal.</span></p>
<p><span>Among these patients is Gary, a 61-year-old disabled former church outreach worker who received a certification for medical marijuana use this year from his primary care physician at the Joseph M. Smith Community Health Center in Allston. A few puffs before meals helps pique his appetite, which, along with his weight, has shriveled because of hepatitis C, a disease that attacks the liver.</span></p>
<p><span>Gary asked that his last name not be used for fear of losing his publicly subsidized apartment, where medical marijuana use is prohibited.</span></p>
<p><span>In July, Gary received notice from the health center that his marijuana certification was being rescinded because the center was worried about losing federal funding, which accounts for about 10 percent of the facility’s funding.</span></p>
<p><span>“I am in a Catch-22 position,” Gary said. “I have a [doctor’s certification] that may or may not be valid.”</span></p>
<p><span>He has been buying marijuana on the street, bargaining prices between $200 and $300 for an ounce, and eagerly awaiting the opening of dispensaries,where he could get reduced-cost or free marijuana, as well as edible or vapor options, which would be gentler on his scarred lungs.</span></p>
<p><span>Paola Ferrer, grants and development director at the Allston health center, said the organization cannot risk its federal funding and care for 12,000 patients by writing certifications for a small number.</span></p>
<p><span>“We are really tied to the federal government and the funding stream, and until the legal issues are adequately resolved, we are not at liberty to do this,” Ferrer said.</span></p>
<p><span>Regulations issued by the Massachusetts health department in May require people who want to legally buy medical marijuana to receive a physician’s written certification that they have a “debilitating medical condition” that would benefit from marijuana use.</span></p>
<p><span>Like patients treated at community health centers, those who receive care at Veterans Affairs facilities face challenges obtaining certification. In a 2011 memo, the Department of Veterans Affairs reminded its physicians that it prohibits them from “completing forms seeking recommendations or opinions regarding a veteran’s participation in a state marijuana program.”</span></p>
<p><span>The memo, however, said department policy does not prohibit veterans who legally participate in a state marijuana program from also receiving other treatment at VA centers.</span></p>
<p><span>More confusing is a 2011 memo from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development to public housing authorities. It directs them to establish standards and leases that prohibit new tenants, and those with new subsidized housing vouchers, from using “state-legalized medical marijuana,” but gives authorities discretion to allow medical marijuana use by current residents and “to determine continued occupancy policies that are most appropriate for their local communities.”</span></p>
<p><span>An August memo from the US Department of Justice to federal prosecutors has also left many lawyers and health administrators unsettled.</span></p>
<p><span>The department attempted to clarify its policy by listing eight priorities, such as preventing marijuana sales to minors. The priorities do not specifically mention selling, growing, or authorizing patients to get marijuana for medical use.</span></p>
<p><span>The department is “committed to using its limited investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way,” the memo states.</span></p>
<p><span>It concludes by noting the department still has authority to enforce federal laws “including federal laws relating to marijuana, regardless of state law.”</span></p>

				<p><span><a href="http://www.cannabisnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MEDMAR.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-876" title="MEDMAR" src="http://www.cannabisnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MEDMAR-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>The legalization of medical marijuana is prompting cities and towns across the region to consider zoning restrictions to limit where dispensaries may open. With state regulations in effect as of Friday, and the dispensary application process scheduled by the state for this summer and fall, many communities are feeling time is short to regulate what some see as an unwelcome neighbor.</span></p>
<p><span>Milford passed zoning restrictions last week; Framingham and Natick are looking at working together on zoning that could allow dispensaries on Route 9 in the neighboring towns; and Newton, amid several inquiries from prospective dispensary operators, is reviewing its zoning bylaw to see whether it is adequate for dealing with the new state law.</span></p>
<p><span>“What we’re doing is actually taking some time to internally review the regulations, since they still just came out, and we have not made any specific plans to alter the usual zoning requirements for new businesses, but we are looking into it,” said Dori Zaleznik, Newton’s commissioner of health and human services. </span></p>
<p><span>Massachusetts voters approved the legalization of medical marijuana via statewide ballot in November. The measure calls for a maximum of 35 nonprofit dispensaries across the state, with at least one and not more than five in each of the state’s 14 counties.MAS</span></p>
<p><span>Communities cannot ban dispensaries but can impose zoning laws that restrict their location, according to a March 13 ruling from Attorney General Martha Coakley. </span></p>
<p><span>Many municipalities have already passed or are considering a moratorium — typically lasting from six months to a year — on permits for a dispensary to buy time for reviewing their zoning regulations.</span></p>
<p><span>Milford decided it did not need a moratorium and went straight to zoning changes, approved by Town Meeting on May 20.</span></p>
<p><span>The amendment, which must still pass muster with the attorney general’s office, allows dispensaries in two of the town’s three industrial districts as long as they are not within 200 feet of a residential zone, school, place of worship, park, playground, or youth center.</span></p>
<p><span>The limitation translates into about 1,000 acres along Fortune Boulevard and Maple and Beaver streets available as the site of a dispensary, according to Larry Dunkin, Milford’s town planner.</span></p>
<p><span>Natick has already passed a moratorium, and Framingham’s Town Meeting was considering one this week. </span></p>
<p><span>Both communities are looking at allowing dispensaries along some part of Route 9.</span></p>
<p><span>Robert Halpin, Framingham’s town manager, said the moratorium would give his community some time to get a better sense of the regulations and how they are being implemented.</span></p>
<p><span>“I think there’s a discussion to be had with Natick,” he said. “We can talk about Route 9 and other approaches.”</span></p>
<p><span>Natick Town Administrator Martha White said it makes sense to work with Framingham on a shared approach.</span></p>
<p><span>“Since we share Route 9, and that may well be the area that’s zoned for these facilities, we want to be sure to keep each other’s communities informed and to work it out together, so we’re not negatively impacting each other,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span>Although many municipalities in the area see a moratorium as a first step before evaluating their zoning options, Newton is not sure that one is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span>“So at this point, we don’t believe we’ll need a moratorium, but we don’t know as we go through the review what we’ll end up doing,” said Zaleznik.</span></p>
<p><span>When the city gets inquiries, she said, staff are telling prospective dispensary operators that they should get through the first phase of the state’s two-phase application process before they look for a location in Newton.</span></p>
<p><span>“And hopefully by then, we will have figured out our approach,” said Zaleznik.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the local moves to limit dispensaries, which by law are supposed to cultivate their own marijuana to fill prescriptions for the drug, prospective proprietors are not put off, said Bruce Bedrick, CEO of Kind Clinics and MEDBOX, based in West Hollywood, Calif. </span></p>
<p><span>“We’re used to that — it’s all part of the process,” said Bedrick, who serves as a consultant for the application process and also markets his technology to keep marijuana supplies secure. “People have to get comfortable with the use. Once people realize it’s just average everyday people trying to pick up medicine, I think in a few years we’ll all look back and laugh at this.”</span></p>
<p><span>Bedrick, whose local office is in Natick, would not say exactly how many clients he has or where they are looking to locate a dispensary, but he suggested interest is healthy, with “not many spots left” on his client roster that will max out at 35.</span></p>
<p><span>He praised the state Department of Public Health, and said generally the new regulations are solid.</p>
<p>“It’s actually great for our clients because we’re all about transparency and regulation and safety and security,” he said. “The only thing we feel is cumbersome is the verification of $500,000.” He was referring to the minimum amount that applicants must have in escrow as part of the new regulations. </span></p>
<p><span>Adam Fine, a lawyer with a Colorado-based firm, Vicente Sederberg LLC, that opened offices in Boston and Needham in connection with last fall’s legalization vote, also applauded the state for creating a strong regulatory environment that balances patient needs with public safety concerns.</span></p>
<p><span>“I think overall people are very pleased with the comprehensive nature of the regulations and the fact the Department of Public Health took a measured, thoughtful approach,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span>Like Bedrick, Fine could not say which towns and cities are being eyed for dispensaries, but he did say Middlesex, Norfolk, and Suffolk counties seem to be garnering the most interest.</span></p>
<p><span>“The anecdotal information I’m getting is the most populous areas make the most sense because there will be more patients to serve,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span>Locally, one of the biggest issues that dispensaries will face might have nothing to do with zoning or moratoriums, but rather finding space to lease, he said. Part of his firm’s role is to help educate landlords, Fine said.</span></p>
<p><span>“Finding a location that is going to be able to house these dispensaries can be a challenge,” he said. “There are landlords that . . . until it’s completely legal under federal law, they don’t want to be a part of it.”</p>
