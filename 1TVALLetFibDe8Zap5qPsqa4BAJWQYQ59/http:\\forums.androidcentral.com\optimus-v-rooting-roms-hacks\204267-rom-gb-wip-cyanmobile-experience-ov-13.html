Hey, the Wifi is not working, all I get is an error. And How do I change the lock screen? I can't find it. EDIT: Found lockscreens, nvm. Still Wifi issues.

This might take a bit longer than expected.. I have it compiling, I just forgot to commit some stuff before I lost everything, so I have some more work to do. Ill try to have a release out by tomorrow night though, no promises.
