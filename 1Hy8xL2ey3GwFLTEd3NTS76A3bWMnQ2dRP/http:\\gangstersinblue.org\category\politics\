<p>So I just stumbled across this passage today; it&#8217;s kind of like a perfect addendum to the <q>Xenophobia and Anarchophobia</q> / <q>U.S. vs. Them</q> section of <a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2009/11/08/no-borders-no-state/">my old No Borders / No State presentation</a>, reheated, perfectly seasoned and cooked up together with everything I have to say about worker-owned, informal-sector food vendors and disruptive social and economic agoras.</p>

					<p>Here is another translation from Venezuela, once again of a one-compa-sounds-off article, this time from <q lang="es">Viento sin Fronteras</q> (<q>Wind without Borders</q>) in a rural area of Mérida, a state in western Venezuela. The article was reprinted by the Venezuelan anarchist newspaper <a href="http://periodicoellibertario.blogspot.com/"><cite>EL LIBERT@RIO</cite></a>. Inline links and editorial notes in footnotes are added by me. As always, the <a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2014/02/21/caracas-15-f-impressions-from-the-street-el-libertario/">same caveats apply</a>: I’m a nervous translator trying to keep up with a lot of regional references that I don’t always know, and moving through a lot of material coming out more quickly than I can translate it; this is a working draft; if you notice any mistakes or mangling please feel free to point them out in the comments, and I’ll attach a note or a correction to the text here. Again, there are lots of different Anarchists in Venezuela, and this is one compa&#8217;s view; there are many with different views about the attitude that Anarchists should take towards the protest. (See, for example, <a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2014/02/22/a-comrade-sounds-off-happening-now-venezuela-victor-camacho-el-libertario/">this previous translation of a commentary by Victor Camacho</a>. Viento sin Fronteras is, let&#8217;s say, significantly more <q>hands-on.</q>)</p>

  <p><strong>Viento sin Fronteras</strong></p>
  
  <p>This is a little chronicle many are certainly familiar with. Yesterday I got up at 6 a.m. so I could get ready to go to work. I arrived at work around 7:30 am and I spent the whole day over there. At 7pm I went back to my house. When I got home I had to go down to the nearest bodega (I live in a rural area) to buy stuff for making dinner or lunch in the coming days. Well O.K., so a purchase that consists of some three potatoes, two cans of sardines, three tomatoes, an onion, laundry soap,<sup>[<a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2014/02/26/one-comrade-merida-got-the-desirin-el-libertario/#one-comrade-merida-got-the-desirin-el-libertario-n-1" class="footnoted" id="to-one-comrade-merida-got-the-desirin-el-libertario-n-1">1</a>]</sup> a box of cigarettes and a few cookies, comes out to 170 bolivars [≈ US $27]. Up to this point everything seems normal but it isn&#8217;t. My daily salary is 200 bolivars [≈ US $32]. </p>
  
  <p>Clearly, they are 200 bolivars and this leaves me only just 30 bolivars [≈ US $5] to save for paying the rest of my expenses, like the rent for example. Or the fare for public transport, if I weren&#8217;t walking to work I&#8217;d have to take 10 bolivars off these 30 that are supposed to be left over for me.</p>
  
  <p>Besides this, I remembered that the last time that I went without natural gas nearly a month passed before that commodity came back to my house.  And I my house, of course, a little house of 38 square meters [≈ 409 sq. ft.] where the water shuts off every day for an hour or two, with a rent that&#8217;s equivalent to nearly half the minimum wage I work for. It brings to mind that house from the housing project<sup>[<a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2014/02/26/one-comrade-merida-got-the-desirin-el-libertario/#one-comrade-merida-got-the-desirin-el-libertario-n-2" class="footnoted" id="to-one-comrade-merida-got-the-desirin-el-libertario-n-2">2</a>]</sup> that

  <p>Something comes into my mind, and my nerves get hotter. I spent 10 years of my life in college. I have an undergraduate degree, a master&#8217;s, and I left my doctoral thesis half done when I lost interest. And O.K., it&#8217;s not that I believe that I deserve a Ministry salary, but for some reason, and this reason for some other reason always ends up being my fault; it has been impossible for me to find a job that, without being exactly the thing for which I supposedly studied at least would permit me (and that&#8217;s what college is supposedly about) to give back to society or to whoever, a little bit of that intellectual or technical material that I supposedly acquired in those years. At times, they then give me some moments of clarity and I say: clearly, it&#8217;s that to get hooked up you have to know whose balls to yank.<sup>[<a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2014/02/26/one-comrade-merida-got-the-desirin-el-libertario/#one-comrade-merida-got-the-desirin-el-libertario-n-6" class="footnoted" id="to-one-comrade-merida-got-the-desirin-el-libertario-n-6">6</a>]</sup> Or I think and I swear<sup>[<a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2014/02/26/one-comrade-merida-got-the-desirin-el-libertario/#one-comrade-merida-got-the-desirin-el-libertario-n-7" class="footnoted" id="to-one-comrade-merida-got-the-desirin-el-libertario-n-7">7</a>]</sup> about how to set up that writing project with the ever sacrosanct words: Eternal Commander, Fellow Comrade, the Little Bird, Our Process, the Economic War, the Eternal Giant, the Legacy.<sup>[<a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2014/02/26/one-comrade-merida-got-the-desirin-el-libertario/#one-comrade-merida-got-the-desirin-el-libertario-n-8" class="footnoted" id="to-one-comrade-merida-got-the-desirin-el-libertario-n-8">8</a>]</sup> All this without a doubt adds to the degree of a feeling of frustration that&#8217;s growing.</p>
  
  <p>And with that, what comes into my head are the contracts for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guasare_coalfield">Guasare coal</a>, the <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chevrontexaco-selected-as-preferred-bidder-on-venezuelas-plataforma-deltana-block-2-76842472.html">Deltana Plate</a>, the three billion dollars that Chevron loaned us, the concessions to Chinese timber companies in the high <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroní_River">Caroní</a>, the death of the <a href="http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/9014">Sabinos</a>, the criminalization of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayuu_people">Wayuu</a>, the Red Fascist wall shooting dissident unionists, the armed forces of the government holding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacerolazo">old women with their pans</a> at gunpoint, ordering them to be quiet, the dead of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Uribana_prison_riot">Uribana</a>, the 400 dying every year in prison, the intellectual authors of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_El_Amparo">the massacre of El Amparo</a> placed in the government designing the anti-terrorism laws. And so on. And so I think that late or early, me, and many people who aren&#8217;t identified one bit with the spokespeople of the opposition parties, including folks who come from the Chavista movement, are getting out into the streets to protest. And I&#8217;ll be over there, if country life lets me, handing out pamphlets to anyone who has eyes to read them. Without falling into naivete, I know that there will be plenty of imbecile fanatics for Pérez Jiménez<sup>[<a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2014/02/26/one-comrade-merida-got-the-desirin-el-libertario/#one-comrade-merida-got-the-desirin-el-libertario-n-9" class="footnoted" id="to-one-comrade-merida-got-the-desirin-el-libertario-n-9">9</a>]</sup> or Leopoldo Lopez<sup>[<a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2014/02/26/one-comrade-merida-got-the-desirin-el-libertario/#one-comrade-merida-got-the-desirin-el-libertario-n-10" class="footnoted" id="to-one-comrade-merida-got-the-desirin-el-libertario-n-10">10</a>]</sup> there with their slogans and believe me that I&#8217;ll fight them right there.

					<p>Here is another translation from Venezuela. This was a controversial one. As I mentioned <a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2014/02/21/caracas-15-f-impressions-from-the-street-el-libertario/">previously</a>, many writers on the left looking in on the Venezuelan situation from outside of the country operate from a limited selection of <q>official</q> news sources, heavily influenced by either the ruling Socialist party or one of the right-wing opposition parties; many independent radicals in Venezuela are finding this extremely frustrating and have been trying to put out their own view of things. This here is a <a href="http://periodicoellibertario.blogspot.com/2014/02/desde-chile-se-lanza-documento-para.html">broadside assault by the Venezuelan anarchist Armando Vergueiro against a document from some Chilean Platformists</a> expressing uncritical support for the Boli-Socialist government. The comments thread had drawn 75 comments, last I checked, including angry retorts from FEL and also some stinging criticisms of FEL from other anarchists in Chile.) It was posted online by the anarchist newspaper <cite>EL LIBERT@RIO</cite>. Inline links and editorial notes in footnotes are added by me. As always, <a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2014/02/21/caracas-15-f-impressions-from-the-street-el-libertario/">the same caveats apply</a>: I&#8217;m a nervous translator trying to keep up with a lot of regional references that I don&#8217;t always know, and moving through a lot of material coming out more quickly than I can translate it; this is a working draft; if you notice any mistakes or mangling please feel free to point them out in the comments, and I’ll attach a note or a correction to the text here. </p>

  <h3><a href="http://periodicoellibertario.blogspot.com/2014/02/desde-chile-se-lanza-documento-para.html">From Chile, a pitch for the foundation of anarcho-Madurism</a></h3>
  
  <p><strong>Armando Vergueiro</strong></p>
  
  <div class="illustration">
  <a href="http://periodicoellibertario.blogspot.com/2014/02/desde-chile-se-lanza-documento-para.html"><img src="http://radgeek.com/gt/2014/02/anarcomaduristas.jpg" alt="" /></a>

  <p>In the web page maintained by the Chilean Platformists in the Federation of &#8220;Libertarian&#8221; Students (FEL), there has been published, in a stellar plan, an official declaration from this grouping, which without a doubt will pass into history as the cornerstone of a new and picturesque version (or better misrepresentation) of non-hierarchical thought<sup>[<a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2014/02/23/chile-anarcho-madurism-el-libertario/#chile-anarcho-madurism-el-libertario-n-1" class="footnoted" id="to-chile-anarcho-madurism-el-libertario-n-1">1</a>]</sup> It goes by the name <q>With the Venezuelan people and against the coup movement,</q> and it deserves that we should occupy ourselves, even if briefly, with the pearls that adorn it.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>Out of the ignorance that only nurtures itself and gives credibility to what it sees on TeleSur about Venezuela, in the first paragraph it talks about <q>a march of university students, from the most privileged sectors in Venezuelan society.</q> Nobody told these <q>comrades</q> that today the most privileged sectors in these streets are the Boli-bureaucracy, the politico-military elite in power, their transnational associates like Chevron and Gustavo Cisneros, the Chinese &#8220;comrades&#8221; and the parasites of the old Cuban bureaucracy?</p></li>
  <li><p>According to FEL, in Venezuela there is &#8220;A process of radical transformations that has bettered the life of the majority of the inhabitants of that country, above all for the ordinary people and workers.&#8221; Don&#8217;t expect another opinion from those who just read here the stuff they&#8217;re given in the waiting room at the Madurista government&#8217;s embassy in Santiago, so that it would be a waste of time to suggest they look for the multitude provable and verifiable sources that refute that propagandistic idea, not to mention consulting the dominant opinion among Venezuelans in the streets.</p></li>
  <li><p><q>Today the Venezuelan right is trying to disable the legitimate government of Maduro in order to create an environment suitable for carrying on their plans for a coup d&#8217;etat.</q> Apart from the touching sight of these &#8220;libertarians&#8221; preoccupied with the fortunes of a legitimate government, this is olympically detached from the fact that after 15 years, and especially after the coup attempt in 2002, the Armed Forces have been, one the one hand, submitted to a politico-ideological purge that has exterminated whatever dissidence from their heart. And on the other, being even more important, they have accentuated the militarization of the apparatus of the State, arriving at a degree where it is made incomprehensible that they should want a coup in order to displace themselves from a government that favores them with ample powers and possibilities for enrichment through corruption. If there were any such military coup or anything similar, it would be in order to guarantee their privileges and immunities even more.</p></li>
  <li><p>The &#8212; FEL-istas? FEL-ines? FEL-ons? &#8212; proclaim: <q>this attempt that today is made from the mobilization in the streets, the call to violence, the manipulation of information and the hoarding of goods to create the sensation that there&#8217;s a crisis that the government is incapable of resolving. Since they couldn&#8217;t win at the ballot-box, they are trying to pull down the government and put an end to the revolutionary project of the people, hoarding basic necessities, calling for violence and generating the environment to legitimize a coup d&#8217;etat.</q> Once again they evince an unfamiliarity with the present juncture in Venezuela, except for what the government asserts, which is only explicable only by fanatical ignorance, out of taxed cynicism or lost innocence. Furthermore, we hold back the opinion that, as anarchists, we believe is deserved by FEL&#8217;s dismay that there are doubts about the government&#8217;s capacity to resolve the crisis. You can take our silence the same way concerning the sanctimonious indigation, with the stalest electoral flavor, against those who <q>couldn&#8217;t win at the ballot box</q> &#8230;</p></li>
  <li><p>They complain with sadness because in Chile: <q>the future president elect and the greater part of the forces of the New Majority keep a complicit silence, or simply lament the acts of violence in an abstract way. They do not denounce those who try to hold back a political and social project of justice and equality for all, because they do not share it.</q> At least it should be said that this lament is a truism, for how could you expect anything else from Doña Bachelet<sup>[<a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2014/02/23/chile-anarcho-madurism-el-libertario/#chile-anarcho-madurism-el-libertario-n-2" class="footnoted" id="to-chile-anarcho-madurism-el-libertario-n-2">2</a>]</sup> and her gang?</p></li>
  <li><p>In the best spirit of the Stalinist Popular Front in the 1930s, they preach: <q>We believe to be necessary the greatest unity of the Chilean and Latin American left to sharply denounce and reject the coup movement&#8217;s attempts in Venezuela. Once more as libertarians we are opposed to this type of play from the right, allied with imperialism, to hold back the socialist project of the people of Venezuela.</q> No other diligent student of Martha Harnecker and other classics of continental Marxist-Leninism could have said it better!</p></li>
  <li><p>Continuing their tale worthy of obedient PaCos militants (or the communist party, same thing),<sup>[<a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2014/02/23/chile-anarcho-madurism-el-libertario/#chile-anarcho-madurism-el-libertario-n-3" class="footnoted" id="to-chile-anarcho-madurism-el-libertario-n-3">3</a>]</sup>  now one has to give: <q>All our support and solidarity to the working people of Venezuela, the principal actor in the construction of socialism in their country and in which we are fully confident.</q> This vote of absolute faith would be because whatever opposition to the sacrosanct government of Maduro, even what might come from anarchism and critical segments of the left, <q>seeks to end the process of change that they have carried forward there for more than 15 years.</q> No doubt, with <q>comrades</q> like those at FEL, anarchism doesn&#8217;t need any enemies!</p></li>
  <li><p>As a glorious finish, these <q>fellow travelers</q> conclude with a celebration that they will surely applaud in the Venezuelan embassy, so that we wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to put it forward as worthy of airfare for revolutionary tourism to the beaches of the Caribbean Sea: <q>Yet much is lacking, there exist contradictions and issues for debate like in any process, but the socialist project continues intact. To the deepening of the Bolivarian process, to the building of socialism.</q></p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Clearly the editors of the seeming gem will not be pleased with qualifying as anarcho-Maduristas. They prefer to call themselves <q>libertarians,</q> &#8212; or <q>libertarian communists</q> in their moments of radical emotion &#8212; when they are in Chile and the rest of Latin America; although curiosly they do identify themselves as anarchists when they come to promote themselves in North America or in Europe. All the same, it&#8217;s worth leaving them the nickname, because it fits them very well.</p>

					<p>More from Venezuelan anarchists on the current wave of protest and government repression.

  <h3><a href="http://periodicoellibertario.blogspot.com/2014/02/resumen-express-de-la-situacion.html#more">Quick Overview of the Situation in Venezuela for the Curious and Ill-informed</a>.</h3>
  
  <p><strong>Rafael Uzcategui</strong></p>
  
  <p>On February 4th, 2014, students from the Universidad Nacional Experimental del Táchira (Experimental University of Táchira), located in the inland state of the country, protested the sexual assault of a fellow female classmate, which took place in the context of the city’s increasing insecurity. <strong>The protest was repressed, and several students were detained. The next day, other universities around the country had their own protests requesting the release of these detainees, and these demonstrations were also repressed, with some of the activists incarcerated.</strong></p>
  
  <p>The wave of indignation had as context the economic crisis, the shortage of first necessity items and the crisis of basic public services, as well as the beginnings of the imposition of new economic austerity measures by President Nicolás Maduro. Two opposition politicians, Leopoldo López and María Corina Machado, tried to capitalize on the wave of discontent rallying for new protests under the slogan “The Way Out” and also tried to press for the resignation of president Maduro. Their message also reflected the rupture and divisions on the inside of opposing politicians and the desire to replace Henrique Capriles’ leadership, who publicly rejected the protests. The Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (Democratic Unity Table) coalition, didn’t support them either.</p>
  
  <p>When the government suppressed the protests, it made them grow bigger and wider all over the country. On February 12th, 2014, people from 18 cities protested for the release of all of the detainees and in rejection of the government. In some cities of the interior, particularly punished by scarcity and lack of proper public services, the protests were massive. In Caracas, three people were murdered during the protests. The government blames the protesters, <strong>but the biggest circulating newspaper in the country, Últimas Noticias, which receives the majority of its advertising budget from the government itself, revealed through photographs that the murderers were police officers.</strong> As a response to this, Nicolás Maduro stated on national television and radio broadcast that police enforcement had been “infiltrated by the right wing.”</p>
  
  <p>The repression of the protesters draws not only on police and military enforcement agencies; it also incorporates the participation of militia groups to violently dissolve the protests. A member of PROVEA, a human rights NGO, was kidnapped, beaten and threatened with death by one of them on the west side of Caracas. President Maduro has publicly encouraged these groups, which he calls colectivos (collectives).</p>
  
  <p><strong>The Venezuelan government <ins>currently</ins><sup>[<a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2014/02/22/quick-overview-venezuela-rafael-uzcategui-el-libertario/#quick-overview-venezuela-rafael-uzcategui-el-libertario-n-2" class="footnoted" id="to-quick-overview-venezuela-rafael-uzcategui-el-libertario-n-2">2</a>]</sup> controls all of the major TV stations, and has threatened with sanctions radio stations and newspapers that transmit information about protests.</strong> Because of this, the privileged space for the distribution of information have been the social media networks, especially Twitter. The use of personal technological devices has allowed record-keeping through videos and photographs of ample aggressions of the repressive forces. Human rights organizations report detainees all over the country (many of them already released). The number has surpassed 400, and they have suffered torture, including reports of sexual assault, cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment. As this is being written 5 people have been murdered in the context of the protests.</p>
  
  <p>In his speeches, Nicolás Maduro <ins>incites</ins><sup>[<a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2014/02/22/quick-overview-venezuela-rafael-uzcategui-el-libertario/#quick-overview-venezuela-rafael-uzcategui-el-libertario-n-3" class="footnoted" id="to-quick-overview-venezuela-rafael-uzcategui-el-libertario-n-3">3</a>]</sup> the protesters opposing him to assume even more radical and violent positions. Without any ongoing criminal investigation, he automatically stated that everyone killed has been murdered by the protesters themselves, who he disqualifies with every possible adjective.</p>
  
  <p>However, this belligerence seems not to be shared by all the chavista movement, because a lot of its base is currently withholding its active support, waiting to see what will come next. Maduro has only managed to rally public employees to the street protests he has called. In spite of the situation and due to the grave economic situation he faces, <strong>Nicolás Maduro continues to make economic adjustments, the most recent being a tax increase.</strong></p>
  
  <p>The state apparatus reiterates repeatedly that it is facing a “coup”, that what happened in Venezuela on April 2002 will repeat itself. <strong>This version has managed to neutralize the international left-wing, which hasn’t even expressed its concern about the abuses and deaths in the protests.</strong></p>
  
  <p>The protests are being carried out in many parts of the country and are lacking in center and direction, having being called through social media networks. Among the protesters themselves, there are many diverse opinions about the opposition political parties, so it’s possible to find many expressions of support and also rejection at the same time.</p>
  
  <p>In the case of Caracas the middle class and college students are the primary actors in the demonstrations. On the other hand, in other states, many popular sectors have joined the protests. In Caracas the majority of the demands are political, including calls for the freedom of the detainees and the resignation of President Maduro, while in other cities social demands are incorporated, with protests against inflation, scarcity and lack of proper public services. Even though some protests have turned violent, and some protesters have fired guns at police and militia groups, the majority of the protests, especially outside of Caracas, remain peaceful.</p>
  
  <p><strong><ins>The independent revolutionary left in Venezuela (anarchists, sections of Trotskyism and Marxist-Leninist-Guevarism) has no involvement in this situation, and we are simple spectators.</ins></strong><sup>[<a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2014/02/22/quick-overview-venezuela-rafael-uzcategui-el-libertario/#quick-overview-venezuela-rafael-uzcategui-el-libertario-n-4" class="footnoted" id="to-quick-overview-venezuela-rafael-uzcategui-el-libertario-n-4">4</a>]</sup> Some of us are actively denouncing state repression and helping the victims of human rights violations.</p>
  
  <p>Venezuela is a historically oil-driven country. It possesses low levels of political culture among its population, which explains why the opposition protesters have the same “content” problem as those supporting the government. But while the international left-wing continues to turn its back and support — without any criticism — the government’s version of “a coup”, it leaves thousands of protesters at the mercy of the most conservative discourse of the opposition parties, without any reference to anti-capitalists, revolutionaries and true social change that could influence them.</p>
  
  <p>In this sense, Leopoldo López, the detained conservative opposition leader, tries to make himself the center of a dynamic movement that, up to the time of this writing, had gone beyond the political parties of the opposition and the government of Nicolás Maduro.</p>
  
  <p>What will happen in the short term? I think nobody knows exactly, especially the protesters themselves. The events are developing minute by minute.</p>

				<small>Monday, September 23rd, 2013</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Shortly after arriving in South Africa I learned of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Line-When-Become-Criminals/dp/1431408123/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379604175&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=crossing+the+line+when+cops+become+criminals" ><em>Crossing the Line: When Cops Become Criminals </em></a>by Liza Grobler. I gave it a read and concluded that Grobler could present a thorough and timely overview of the situation here on the ground related to the South Africa Police Service (SAPS).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Line-When-Become-Criminals/dp/1431408123/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379604175&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=crossing+the+line+when+cops+become+criminals"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-38396" alt="Screen shot 2013-09-21 at 11.50.38 PM" src="http://www.copblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-shot-2013-09-21-at-11.50.38-PM.png" width="148" height="200" /></a>Through <a href="http://www.publiclaw.uct.ac.za/staff/evanderspuy/" >Elrena van der Spuy</a>, whom we met and interviewed (stay tuned for a related video), and Jacana Media (who previously <a href="http://www.copblock.org/38374/south-africa-police-service-needs-to-clean-house-says-liza-grobler/www.polity.org.za/article/crossing-the-line-when-cops-become-criminals-2013-08-13" >interviewed Grobler</a>), I was able to get in touch with Grobler, who agreed to sit-down and share some thoughts.</p>
<p>Grobler and I spoke for over three hours &#8211; this video is some of the over 30-minutes of footage I captured. As is clear, Grobler is well-familiar with the SAPS as an institution, and how issues of corruption and criminal cops have been ignored by higher-ups, thus compounding and entrenching them even further. Of course the <a href="http://www.enca.com/south-africa/drug-legalisation-debated-heats" >current war on some substances</a> isn&#8217;t helping things.</p>
<p>Grobler says that politics must be removed from policing, and that the SAPS needs to clean house before overhauling the hiring, training, promotion, grievance, and complaint functions. That&#8217;s a tall task. Will that happen?</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Nearly 20 years ago Nelson Mandela came to power in a great surge of hope, pledging to his people that the massive wealth of South Africa would be used to lift the poor black majority out of poverty and subordination. But the nation he fought so hard to create is slowly disintegrating. Violence is commonplace, unemployment is out of control and the ruling ANC government is accused of rampant corruption. And as Mandela&#8217;s dream fades, the seeds for further upheaval and political instability are being sown.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8230;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Meanwhile, Jacob Zuma&#8217;[s retirement complex boasts 31 buildings, a double helipad, underground bunkers and a gym. It has cost nearly $30 million in state funds. . . . 18 million South Africans survive on less than $2 a day. The government has been promising to re-house shack dwellers for over 14 years, but despite the fading registration numbers painted on their doors, there is no prospect of change in sight. Across the nation there is a growing feeling that the government has lost its vision and moral authority. The freedom generation is looking for a new revolution.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A secretive U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration unit is funneling information from intelligence intercepts, wiretaps, informants and a massive database of telephone records to authorities across the nation to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans.</p>
  
  <p>Although these cases rarely involve national security issues, documents reviewed by Reuters show that law enforcement agents have been directed to conceal how such investigations truly begin - not only from defense lawyers but also sometimes from prosecutors and judges.</p>
  
  <p>The undated documents show that federal agents are trained to &#8220;recreate&#8221; the investigative trail to effectively cover up where the information originated, a practice that some experts say violates a defendant&#8217;s Constitutional right to a fair trial.</p>

<p class="first">Well <em>of course</em> the NSA&#8217;s secret data-gathering, spying and warrantless wiretaps have been used to prosecute American drug cases. Every single fascist National Security monitoring program, <a href="http://nymag.com/news/9-11/10th-anniversary/patriot-act/">secret search and seizure method</a>, surveillance policy, <a href="http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle-old/349/creep.shtml">financial regulation</a>, <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/2007/06/07/5768/anti-terrorism-funds-enlisted-war-drugs">foreign-aid slush fund</a>, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/07/30/why_is_a_swat_team_assaulting_me_im_just_dancing_at_a_rave/">paramilitary police program</a> and executive power that has been created over the last 20 years in the name of <q>counter-terrorism</q> &#8212; including large sections of Clinton&#8217;s AEDPA and <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2003/09/15/patriotic-mission-creep">large sections of Bush Jr.&#8217;s PATRIOT Act</a> &#8212; has been utilized, over and over again, by federal prosecutors and the DEA in order to gather evidence and coerce testimony in drug cases. Every single National Security state program, regardless of its alleged purpose, has been used to strengthen the narcs&#8217; hand, and to <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2006/02/23/making-a-meth-of-the-patriot-a">double down</a> on the federal government&#8217;s insane and destructive prosecution of a <q>War on Drugs.</q> This one is just as outrageous; but it&#8217;s no different, and no more surprising.</p>

<p>Now, even if there <em>were</em> such a thing as a limited National Security state &#8212; even if there were some way to create a counter-terrorism-only police state, which would focus on a single threat without creating a general, all-powerful police state in the process &#8212; it would still mean shredding civil liberties, targeting people and activities which ought to be presumed innocent, and it would still be destructive and wrong.</p>

<p>But, in any case, there is no such thing. There is no way to focus a police state on only one group of people or one part of life; there are no partial or limited police states. There is only a police state &#8212; one which will come for you sooner, or later.</p>

The police lit him up because they barged onto his property at a quarter till three in the morning, came up behind him, drew down on him and shouted at him out of nowhere to get his hands up. When he didn&#8217;t react the right way, quickly enough, to bellowed commands of these belligerent, heavily armed strangers, they opened fire on him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Roy] Middleton, 60, of the 200 block of Shadow Lawn Lane in Warrington, was shot in the leg about 2:42 a.m. Saturday while trying to retrieve a cigarette from his mother’s car in the driveway of their home.</p>

<p>For shooting an unarmed man standing in his front lawn, who posed no threat to them, the unnamed police officers have been given a paid vacation from their government jobs.</p>

<p>Last Thursday, Florida Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan gave an interview with CNN in which he defended the shooting and the deputies responsible for it, and that it is within <q>standard protocols</q> to open fire because Middleton <q>did not comply</q> with their commands.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to Florida Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan in a CNN interview Thursday, the police officers who fired 15 shots at 60-year-old Roy Middleton in the driveway of his and his mother’s home acted entirely within their limits in response to a 911 call for a suspected car theft&#8230; . <strong>On Thursday, Morgan defended the officers’ actions as standard procedure because Middleton “did not comply.”</strong> Asked by CNN’s Chris Cuomo how police could justify 15 shots at a 60-year-old man, Morgan said the officers saw a metallic object in Middleton’s hand as he made a “lunging movement” toward them. Middleton explained this in his account: He turned around because he thought the entire thing was a practical joke played by a neighbor.</p>
  
  <p><strong>“Right now we are comfortable from a training perspective that our officers did follow standard protocols,” Morgan said.</strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Let&#8217;s suppose that all that is true, for the moment. (There is actually no reason at all to take the police at their word on this, but let&#8217;s assume for the sake of argument.) If this overkill shooting of an unarmed man was something that leaves the police <q>comfortable from a training perspective,</q> then what does that tell you about the training? If this overkill shooting of an unarmed man was strictly by the book, what does that tell you about the book?</p>

<p>> An 18-year-old skater died yesterday after Miami Beach Police officers caught him tagging a building and then Tasered him.<br />
><br />
> Details about the death are still murky, but what is clear is that Israel Hernandez died before dawn Tuesday morning after cops caught him spray painting near 71st Street and Collins Avenue in Miami Beach. Police have yet to comment on the killing, but an officer near the scene confirmed that cops had fatally Tasered someone. Hernandez&#8217;s friends on the Miami Beach skate scene are devastated.<br />
><br />
> &#8220;I just cant believe it,&#8221; says best friend Rafael Lynch, on the verge of tears. &#8220;I still have his hat and his board. They still smell like him. It&#8217;s crazy.&#8221;<br />
><br />
> **Update:** MBPD has released a statement and incident report confirming that Hernandez died after being Tasered. Police chased Hernandez after catching him tagging a building and used the electronic weapon [<span lang="la">sic</span> &#8212;RG] when he refused to stop.<br />

<p>From [GT 2011-01-28: Non-Lethal Force (Cont&#8217;d)](http://radgeek.com/gt/2011/01/28/non-lethal-force-contd/):</p>
<p>> As such, police in general, and police assault forces especially, are trained to enter every encounter with the goal of <q>taking control of the situation,</q> by means of setting up confrontations in situations (no-knock raids, late-night forced-entry raids, etc.) where their chosen targets are most likely to be disoriented and easily terrorized, and by responding with maximal force in the volatile, disorienting confrontations that they create. For the sake of this maximal-force approach, they are equipped with an arsenal of weapons ranging from tasers and clubs to handguns and assault rifles, up to, and including, military helicopters and [tanks](http://radgeek.com/gt/2008/09/19/no_seriously/). Worse, with all these weapons, they have institutionalized a culture of fact-free assertion and lies about highly dangerous weapons that they consider to be categorically <q>non-lethal</q> &#8212; and thus to be used as a first resort, in virtually any situation, as long as it might give the cops a <q>tactical advantage</q> over people who they intend to bring under their control (whether or not these people have ever committed any crime at all). These weapons continue to be used with no hesitation and no restraint, and continue to be called <q>non-lethal force,</q> [no matter how many people are killed by them](http://radgeek.com/gt/2008/01/14/nonlethal_force/). There are, for example, [<q>tasers,</q>](http://radgeek.com/tag/tasers) portable electric torture devices which were originally sold as a less-deadly alternative to using a hand-gun in potentially life-threatening confrontations, but which cops now freely use for as part of <q>pain compliance</q> techniques[ref]That is, torture.[/ref] in everyday confrontations with the public. This would be bad enough on its own, but part of the reason they are used so freely is because they take no real exertion for cops to use, and are consistently billed as <q>non-lethal</q> by police and media, even though there are hundreds of documented cases of people dying after being subjected to repeated taser shocks.</p>

<p class="first">Oh, hey, look, my hometown&#8217;s in the national news again. This time it&#8217;s for <a href="http://reason.com/reasontv/2013/07/24/how-quotas-pervert-police-priorities-fir">the <q>contact</q> quotas handed down from the police division&#8217;s chain of command</a>. The requirements for ticketing and arrest quotas required more <q>contacts</q><sup>[<a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2013/07/26/auburn-police-contacts/#auburn-police-contacts-n-1" class="footnoted" id="to-auburn-police-contacts-n-1">1</a>]</sup> every year than there are people in the city of Auburn. The story has hit the news because Justin Hanners, a former police officer in Auburn, says that he was fired by the police department in retaliation against his objections to the quota policy, and to the over-use of police force and arrests that it was producing. After making some contact with local CopBlockers in Auburn, <a href="http://reason.com/reasontv/2013/07/24/how-quotas-pervert-police-priorities-fir">Hanners got his story to Reason TV</a>.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.oanow.com/news/auburn/article_d3ee1f50-f54e-11e2-a709-001a4bcf6878.html">the story in the <cite>Opelika-Auburn News</cite></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><q>Back in 2010, when Chief Dawson came in, immediately afterward, they started telling us that we had to have two tickets a day and two warnings a day on average and if we didn’t have it, we wouldn’t get promoted, we would get bad evaluations and if we continued to not do it, we would get written up and ultimately fired,</q> Hanners said in a phone interview with the Opelika-Auburn News.</p>
  
  <p>Hanners said he initially wrote a complaint about what he thought of the alleged quotas, but was soon suspended for other reasons and put on bike duty.</p>
  
  <p><q>They went back seven months on my computer where I told a joke to another officer and suspended me for four days and made me forfeit two days of annual leave,</q> Hanners said, who added the other officer was not punished.</p>
  
  <p>Hanners said while on bike duty, which he claimed involved patrolling the interior of Auburn University, he was still force[d] to comply with the alleged quotas.</p>
  
  <p><q>By directives, I’m not even supposed to be writing tickets, but my supervisor told me in my bike duty that I had to have just as many tickets as officers in cars,</q> Hanners said.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Since the story came out in the press, spokes-flacks from the city government have issued <a href="http://www.oanow.com/news/auburn/article_b5d010fc-f574-11e2-827f-001a4bcf6878.html">rote denials</a> and <a href="http://www.oanow.com/news/auburn/article_a7202e2e-f561-11e2-889f-001a4bcf6878.html">slimy <q>Oh-we-can&#8217;t-comment-but&#8230;</q> insinuations about Hanners&#8217; personnel file</a> from the City Manager&#8217;s office. <a href="http://www.oanow.com/news/auburn/article_a7202e2e-f561-11e2-889f-001a4bcf6878.html">Assistant City Manager James Buston admits that the sergeant said everything that was on that tape</a> but that it wasn&#8217;t official policy. (But, you know, if it <em>were</em> official policy, it&#8217;d be O.K., because it&#8217;s <q>kind of challenging them to do what they are supposed to do&#8230;</q>). <a href="http://www.oanow.com/news/auburn/article_b5d010fc-f574-11e2-827f-001a4bcf6878.html">The Office of Charles Duggan, City Manager of Auburn, says <q>The message that there is a quota was wrongfully conveyed through supervisory channels to at least one patrol shift</q></a> &#8212; which of course is a long-assed way of saying that there was a quota while denying responsibility for setting it &#8212; but insists that there is an <q>unfounded accusation</q> being <q>leveled by Mr. Hanners.</q> Because, when ex-chief Dawson told the city government that this story was going to hit the press, the city government hired another government investigator to look over their records and tell them that all was O.K. <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2013/07/26/online-community-comes-to-whistle-blower">Tracy Oppenheimer at <cite>Reason</cite> responds to the denials here.</a> Public Safety Director Bill James, for example, put the following in writing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To make 100 contacts, which include among others, traffic stops, issuing warrants, field interviews and arrests, requires about two contacts per shift hour. Making two contacts per hour is not unreasonable and still seems to leave a lot of time to perform other duties that are detailed in your job description. Your supervisors as well as I have an expectation that each employee needs to be productive during their time on shift.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Buston also claims that <cite>Reason</cite> did not offer the city government an opportunity to respond before they put the video together. <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2013/07/26/online-community-comes-to-whistle-blower">Oppenheimer&#8217;s story shows that this is false, and that Capt. Tom Stofer of the Auburn Police Division specifically said that the Division refused to comment</a>. As for the insinuations about Hanners&#8217; personnel file, besides the note about the retaliatory shift to bike duty, here&#8217;s some more elaboration on what happened to him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;Well, the day my grievance was over, I get called into the Chief’s office, and was told that some evidence I presented was from an internal affairs investigation and the gag order had been placed and I wasn’t supposed to have it. So then the Chief, who is the suspect in my grievance, now starts an internal affairs investigation into me and my partner to see if we somehow compromised his own investigation into his own wrongdoing where he had found he had done nothing wrong. So in this investigation, they found that we had violated a gag order and that I had violated the city’s reporting policy by reporting these people.  And they ultimately fired me for it and suspended my partner who gave me a statement that said everything I was saying was true.&#8221;</p>
