Cutting a chicken in half for broiling is almost as routine as chopping an onion. But keep the halves together in that same flattened position, and it looks as if you've done something complicated to the little bird. 
<P>
Think of it as butterflying the chicken. The real term is to "spatchcock." Alan Davidson explains in The Oxford Companion to Food: "The theory is that the word is an abbreviation of 'dispatch the cock,' a phrase used to indicate a summary way of grilling a bird after splitting it open down the back and spreading the two halves out flat." Davidson speculates that spatchcocked birds originated in Ireland. He has noticed them in Irish cookbooks that date to the 18th century. 
<P>
Besides making an intriguing presentation and being simple to carve, a spatchcocked bird requires less time in the oven. That means that the breast meat won't be dry. It's also easy to make a pocket between the skin and breast meat to stuff the bird with a protective layer of vegetables and seasonings. 
<P>
In Simple French Food, the late Richard Olney wrote about stuffing a flattened chicken with grated zucchini mixed with ricotta and Parmesan cheeses. Olney prepared the recipe on his book-promotion tour in the early 1970s, and for a while it became popular among cooks. 
<P>
We still see spatchcocked chicken on menus around town, sometimes just asimple flattened bird with a mixture of herbs tucked underneath the skin. It always feels new.

<font color=000000 size=4>
According to the New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, a "spatchcock" is
simply "a chicken or especially a game-bird split open and grilled after a
simple and speedy method of preparation." In other words, lunch. The origin
of "spatchcock" seems to be under debate. The folks at Oxford think it's
Irish, and a combination of "dispatch" (as in "quick") and "cock," but the
Random House Webster's College Dictionary dismisses that theory and ties
the word to "spitchcock," a dish made with fried eels. Even if one likes
fried eels (which I do not), this isn't very useful because no one seems to
know where "spitchcock" came from, either.

'Indian mode and sea fashion' adds the Victorian colonel's wife from whose cookbook this particular recipe comes. The word spatchcock comes from the dish - a happy rooster one minute and a rather flat-looking grilled chicken the next - all done with great despatch. This simple recipe was a favourite with army officers sent to India by sea, which used to entail several weeks' long voyage. Coops of chickens were kept on board and were a great treat for the bored passengers when despatched and cooked in this way.'

<blockquote>
<font color=000000 size=4>
This reference is interesting because Nigella Lawson is a popular host of English cookery television programs. It has 
been said that the English will adamantly tell you that the only definition of "spatchcock" is a young chicken, no more than 6 weeks old.  Nigella uses the word both as an adjective and a verb in her recipe for Spatchcocked Birds:
<blockquote>
Nigella: "For that point in the evening when people need to hunker down to some serious eating, you do need to provide something a little more substantial than plates for picking from. This is what I roll out during a summer's evening barbecuing. You can stick with just chicken if you want, but I've suggested poussins and quail as well, just because I like anything that produces that welcoming sense of the groaning board - and plus, it gives me the opportunity to suggest more than one marinade. 

<P>
The marinades themselves are to be regarded as the loosest blueprint. Use the flavourings you like, remembering that you need oil of some sort to prevent the meat from drying out and an acid- vinegars, citrus fruits - to tenderise it. The spatchcocked birds don't need to be cooked on the barbecue; an oven preheated to 220 or 240, gas mark 7 or 8, will do just fine. And because the birds are spatchcocked - that's to say, cut on one side and opened out, like a book - they need much less cooking time than surgically uninterfered with poultry, which can be useful if you've got time in advance for the spatchcocking and marinading and not much time on the night for actual cooking. 
<P>
Any good butcher will spatchcock the birds for you, or you could ask the butchery section at the supermarket to do it, but it's easy enough for you to manage yourself at home. Just get a pair of poultry shears or tough scissors (I use a pair sold by someone on one of those door-to-door yellow duster trails made for cutting through tins and tough stuff) and lay the bird, breast side down, on a surface and cut through all along one side of the backbone. Then cut along the other side and - hey presto - the backbone can be removed and you then turn the bird other way up and press down as you open it out. You have in front of you a spatchcocked bird, ready for its marinade." 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Spatchcocked Lemon Poussins
<P>
1. To spatchcock the poussins: place them breast-side down on a chopping board. Cut down either side of the backbone with poutry shears or a sharp pair of kitchen scissors and lift it out.

2. Turn the poussins over, open them out and press down firmly along the breast bone until they lie flat.

"There's no point fiddling around too much with quail. They are too small for fussy preparations unless you happen to have a huge team of helpers in the kitchen. I once boned, stuffed, and rolled a brace of quail, but what a performance for something that disappeared in a couple of mouthfuls! The one and only bit of fiddling around that I consider worthwhile is spatchcocking or in other words, opening the quails out flat, bones and all, so that they can be broiled or barbecued quickly and evenly. It hardly takes any time and the results are very good. Here, the quails are flavored with herbes de Provence and served with a powerful anchovy and garlic sauce. 
<P>
"Spatchcock the quails. Rub the crushed garlic over them and sprinkle with the herbes de Provence, salt, and pepper. Squeeze the lemon juice over them and rub it in. Leave, covered, for a couple of hours. "

<B>spatchcock</b> (spach'kok) 
v or n (English, probably from dispatch and cock) To insert into a text too hurriedly or inappropriately; a fowl stuffed and cooked immediately after killing. This is probably my favourite word of all time. Though there's little use for it any more as a noun, the idea of hurriedly killing, stuffing and cooking a bird has enormous metaphorical value. As a verb, spatchcock is a term that should be picked up and used by every editor who has ever had to read a manuscript that has been prepared in such a manner.

Properly spitchcock, a verb referring to a way of preparing eels by cutting them into pieces, dressing them with breadcrumbs and chopped herbs and then grilling or frying them. Thus the OED. Hannah Glasse, 92, omits the herbs and takes the word to mean grilling pieces of eel, since she gives a similar but separate recipe for frying eel. (There was another word, spatchcock, apparently of Irish origin and meaning a way of grilling pieces of fowl.)(Glasse, 1747)

Lest anyone think that the usage of spatchcock as a verb, etc. is some newfangled politically correct notion, we offer this final entry.   In 1882, the Century Company, publishers of Century Magazine, undertook to produce "a work of...transcendant literary importance", "an authority which will hereafter be...the standard of English spelling and usage."  Thus was produced the 10-volume dictionary, cyclopedia and world atlas known as <i>The Century Dictionary</I>.  Here is a scan of the entry for "spatchcock":

"I like <i>pollo al mattone</i> (Italian chicken grilled under a brick) for four reasons.  It's quick and easy to make. It looks great.  It produces the most crackling crisp skin and tender juicy meat you can imagine.  And, above all, it allows you to use the word <i>spatchcock</i> which is reason enough for preparing it." -- <i>Steven Raichlen, Beer Can Chicken</i>
<P>
"The curious French name <i>poulet en crapaudine</i> (chicken in the style of a toad) refers not to its seasonings (although you could use them for frog's legs) but to the way the chicken is cut so that it opens up flat like a book.  To the French, this vaguely looks like a frog, and I agree.  However, I'm a bigger fan of the English word for this --<i>spatchcocking</i>. -- <i>Steven Raichlen, Beer Can Chicken</i>
<P>
"A chicken or game hen that has been spatchcocked has been partially boned and butterflied(spread open)." -- <i>Steven Raichlen, The Barbecue! Bible</i>

"This recipe calls for spatchcocking the chicken, a technique that allows you to grill a whole chicken using the direct method.  Removing the backbone and breastbone lets you open up the chicken to lay it flat like a book on the grill. -- <i>Steven Raichlen, BBQ USA</i>
<P>
"While the indirect grill and rotisserie methods are great for roasting a whole chicken, nothing can beat the flame-charred smokiness of chicken pieces grilled directly over a fire.  There is a way to do this and I learned it in one of the world's most unlikely barbecue destinations: Paris.  The technique is spatchcocking and it looks as theatrical as it sounds.  You cut out the backbone and open the bird flat, like a book.  This makes the whole chicken thin enough to grill directly over the fire." -- <I>Steven Raichlen, How To Grill</i>

Almost every explanation of <i>spatchcock</i> you see on the web indicates that it is the same as butterflying.  But is it?  According to Anne Willan, founder of the French cooking school <i>La Varenne</I>, there is a difference:
<blockquote>
  "To butterfly is to cut a single slit more or less through the middle of a usually boneless piece of meat, poultry, fish, even a vegetable, so it can be opened up in the manner of butterfly wings," she says. "It may be cooked flat or stuffed and reshaped. To spatchcock is much more specific, applied only to poultry as far as I know, and almost always to small birds -- quail, pigeon, small chickens."
