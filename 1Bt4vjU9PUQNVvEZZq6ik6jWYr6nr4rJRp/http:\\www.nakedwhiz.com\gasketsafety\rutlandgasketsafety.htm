<font size=5 color=yellow><b>What's This All About?</b></font>
<BR>
Many owners of ceramic charcoal cookers have replaced factory gaskets with various replacement gasket materials when the original gaskets fail.
However, there have been concerns raised about the safety of using Rutland Grapho-Glas gasket kits on ceramic charcoal cookers.  (There have also been concerns raised about ceramic gaskets, but this document only addresses the Rutland Grapho-Glas product.) <img src="rutlandkit.jpg" height=300 align=right style="color:black;" border=10>
Where did all the concern come from? 
Posters on ceramic charcoal cooker bulletin boards have posted that they were told, either by Rutland or by the manufacturer of their cooker, that the Rutland gasket is not safe for use around food.  Some claim to have been told that Rutland has stated that using their product around food can result in harm to unborn fetuses. As result, there have been numerous arguments, sometimes heated, on these bulletin boards about the safety of using Rutland gasket material on ceramic charcoal cookers.  We will do our best to provide you with the information we have been able to accumulate on the subject so you can make an informed decision as to whether or not you wish to use this product on your ceramic charcoal cooker.

<P><BR><P>
<font size=5 color=yellow><b>Disclaimer</b></font>
<BR>
What would any document about health and safety be without a disclaimer?  Well, here's ours.  We don't claim to know if it is safe for you to use a Rutland gasket product on your ceramic cooker.  Any opinions stated here are just that, opinions.  It is up to you to evaluate the information presented here and make your own decision as to whether or not you wish to use Rutland gasket material on your cooker.

<P><BR><P>
<font size=5 color=yellow><b>The Letter From Rutland</b></font><BR>
In order to try to better understand what might be the source of some of these claims, and to get an actual statement from the Rutland Fire Clay Company regarding the use of their product on a ceramic charcoal cooker, we contacted Rutland and asked for a letter stating their position.  We informed Rutland that the letter would be published on our website and we did receive permission to do so.  Here's the letter:

<P><BR><P>
<center>
<img src="RutlandLetter.gif">
</center>

<P><BR><P>
We'll summarize the main points of this letter, points that are important to understanding what was actually stated by Rutland:
<ol>
<li>Rutland says that they do not recommend using their product around food.  Notice that they do not say that using their product around food is dangerous.
<P>
<li>The reason Rutland does not recommend using their product around food is that they do not have any test data indicating that it is safe to do so.  Notice that they also do not have any test data indicating that it is unsafe to do so either.
<P>
<li>Rutland did not make any statements to the Big Green Egg company about causing damage to unborn fetuses.
</ol>
So, the bottom line regarding statements made by Rutland is that they have no data about the safety of using their gasket around food, and therefore cannot not say that it is either safe or unsafe.  So, if you are trying to decide to use the Rutland gasket on your cooker, you basically cannot look to Rutland for guidance.  They recommend against doing it, but this recommendation is, by their own admission, not based on any scientific or testing data. This recommendation is no doubt motivated by the desire to limit their liability should anyone ever be harmed by this product in an application not recommended by the manufacturer.  

<P>
Where does this leave us? Since Rutland's letter didn't contain any information regarding the safety of using their product around food, we can look to some other sources of information.  First of all, Rutland has published a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) and a Technical Data Sheet for their product.  Also, their product is made from fiberglass and graphite.  There are MSDSs published for these two materials that can be examined for information about the safety of using these materials.  So let's look:

<P><BR><P>
<font size=5 color=yellow><b>Rutland Data</b></font>
<BR>
The first thing you should notice is that the Rutland MSDS indicates a Hazardous Materials Identification System (HMIS) rating of 1 for health.  This indicates that any health risks listed are "slight." The health hazards listed are:
<blockquote>
Inhalation: Acute: mechanical irritation of the mouth, nose and throat. Chronic: none known.<BR>
Skin: Acute: minor irritation. Chronic: none known.<BR>
Eye Contact: Acute: direct contact will cause mechanical irritation. Chronic: none known.<BR>
Ingestion: unlikely to occur.
</blockquote>
So the only hazards listed on Rutland's own MSDS are simply mechanical irritation of any affected area.  No chronic hazards are known to them.  What about Rutland's Technical Data Sheet?  It merely says "Not recommended to come in contact with food."  Since food isn't going to come into contact with a gasket on a ceramic charcoal cooker, we can only conclude based upon Rutland's own data sheets that there are no significant health hazards associated with Grapho-Glas gaskets known to Rutland.

<P><BR><P>
<font size=5 color=yellow><b>Fiberglass MSDS</b></font>
<BR>
We found an MSDS for fiberglass published by Owens-Corning, certainly one of the biggest names in fiberglass.  Here's what they have to say about potential health effects of fiberglass:
<blockquote>
ACUTE (short term): Fiber glass continuous filament is a mechanical irritant.
Breathing dusts and fibers may cause short term irritation of the mouth, nose
and throat. Skin contact with dust and fibers may cause itching and short term
irritation. Eye contact with dust and fibers may cause short term mechanical
irritation. Ingestion may cause short term mechanical irritation of the stomach
and intestines. See Section 8 for exposure controls.
<P>
CHRONIC (long term): There is (sic) no known health effects connected with long
term use or contact with this product. See Section 11 of MSDS for more
toxicological data.
</blockquote>
Further, we find the following information regarding any carcinogenic effects of fiberglass:
<blockquote>
The International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC) in June, 1987, categorized fiber glass continuous filament as not
classifiable with respect to human carcinogenicity (Group 3). The evidence from
human as well as animal studies was evaluated by IARC as insufficient to
classify fiber glass continuous filament as a possible, probable, or confirmed
cancer causing material.
</blockquote>
So, we find no reason to think that fiberglass is a hazardous material to be using for a gasket on a ceramic charcoal cooker.  

<P><BR><P>
<font size=5 color=yellow><b>Graphite MSDS</b></font>
<BR>
We know, however, that the Rutland Grapho-Glas gasket material also contains graphite.  So we found some MSDSs for graphite.  
<blockquote>
<font color=yellow><B>Graphteck:</b></font> Indicates that "Prolonged and repeated overexposure may lead to benign pneumoconiosis."  Otherwise, it lists no health hazards.
<P>
<font color=yellow><B>Fisher Scientific:</b></font> Lists eye irritation or conjunctivitis, skin irritation, intestinal irritation if you ingest large quantities, respiratory irritation, and potential silicosis caused by prolonged inhalation/exposure.  It also states that it contains trace amounts of quartz which may also lead to cancer.
<P>
<font color=yellow><B>West System:</b></font> Lists respiratory tract irritation with short term inhalation, mild skin irritation to short term exposure and moderate irritation from eye contact.  It also lists symptoms of overexposure as respiratory irritation, shortness of breath or coughing, red, irritated skin and eye irritation.  Finally it states that prolonged or repeated inhalation of dust may cause pulmonary fibrosis or emphysema, and is a possible lung cancer hazard.  The health hazards are listed in this MSDS as having a Hazardous Materials Identification System (HMIS) rating of 1, indicating that any health risks listed are "slight." 
</blockquote>
So, here we do find references to several serious health conditions.  What should we make of that?  Well, the health hazards are listed as "slight" in the Hazardous Materials Identification System. Also, the serious conditions are listed as being associated with prolonged and constant exposure. 
<P>
What about the reference to cancer?  OSHA says that graphite is not a cancer risk.  The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC, an agency of the World Health Organization) lists crystalline silica (graphite contains a small amount of crystalline silica) as a Group 1 material, meaning that they consider it to be carcinogenic to humans.  However, if you read the relevant IARC Monograph on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans (Volume 68),  you will find the following conclusion:
<blockquote>
There is sufficient evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of inhaled crystalline
silica in the form of quartz or cristobalite from occupational sources.
</blockquote> So again, we are talking about prolonged exposure to high levels of the substance.  Many of the studies cited were of 20-30 year exposures in mine and stone cutting workers.  



<P><BR><P>
<font size=5 color=yellow><b>Inhalation versus Ingestion</b></font>
<BR>
Notice that all the serious health effects listed are the result of prolonged and repeated inhalation of material.  There is no mention of any chronic health risks from ingestion of the material.  And since the only serious health risks might result from inhalation, it should also be apparent that this material would be just as hazardous if the product were used in its intended application (wood stoves and fireplaces) as it would in a ceramic charcoal cooker.  Therefore, it seems hard to justify Rutland's caution against letting food come into contact with the gasket material.

<P><BR><P>
<font size=5 color=yellow><b>The "Danger To Unborn Fetuses" Claim</b></font>
<BR>
All we can say is that Rutland says they never made this claim.  None of the material safety data sheets for fiberglass, graphite or the Rutland product indicate there is any danger to unborn fetuses.  Frankly, we think it is totally false and perhaps originated from someone's misunderstanding of either Rutland's statements or other health risk data in the MSDSs.  The bottom line is that it doesn't really matter who said what to whom.  There is no data to indicate that either fiberglass or graphite will harm unborn fetuses, so any such statements are irrelevant to any decision about using Rutland gaskets on ceramic charcoal cookers.

<P><BR><P>
<font size=5 color=yellow><b>Conclusions</b></font>
<BR>
You should carefully read all of the information available before drawing your own conclusion about the safety of using this material on your ceramic charcoal cooker.  This is what we conclude:
<ol>
<li>Rutland has no data to indicate that this product is either safe or unsafe for use around food or more specifically, in a ceramic charcoal cooker.
<li>Rutland's only relevant statement is that the gasket should not come into contact with food.  However, food does not normally come into contact with the gasket in a ceramic charcoal cooker.
<li>There is no evidence available, either from Rutland or any Material Data Safety Sheets, to suggest that this product can harm unborn fetuses.
<li>The health risks associated with this product are slight, as rated by the Hazardous Materials Identification System.
<li>Any serious health risks are only associated with prolonged and repeated exposure to high levels of the product.  Usage in a ceramic charcoal cooker would not subject the user to prolonged or repeated exposure to high levels of the product. 
<li>Any serious health risks are only associated with inhalation, not ingestion.
<li>Any serious health risks would be equally likely to harm anyone using the product in its intended application in fireplaces and woodstoves.
</ol>
So, it is our personal opinion that there is no significant level of risk associated with using the Rutland Grapho-Glas product in a ceramic charcoal cooker.  But, as we have stated, you should evaluate the available information and draw your own conclusions.
