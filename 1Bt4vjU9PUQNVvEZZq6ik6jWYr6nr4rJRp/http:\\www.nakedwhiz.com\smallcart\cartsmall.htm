<P>
<font size=4>Welcome back to another adventure with Whiz Flashburn and his Way Cool Technicolor Barbecue Cart!  This time we are on a quest to build a cart for our small Big Green Egg for under $100.  A nest for your small Big Green Egg will cost about $70 to $80, so we wanted to keep our price goal in that sort of range.  How did we do?  Read on.  We'll have a final accounting at the end.</font>

<font size=4>This time, ol' Whiz Flashburn is going to start with one of your standard Intragalactic Individual Speed Scooters for the base of his newest cart.  You can find these highly useful devices at Sam's Clubs masquerading as a restaurant cart for about 43,000 Olduvian krizenars.  That's about 40 bucks to you Earthlings.  (Yes, all you have to do is activate the omnidrive thrust circuits hidden in the legs of this little number, and you'll be zipping from one end of the Milky Way to the other at about .3 times the speed of light!  Just don't stray beyond the galactic boundaries, though. As versatile and useful as this scooter is, it just doesn't have the horses to make it to another galaxy.)</font>

<font size=4>We thought about cutting a hole in the top shelf of the Intragalactic Speed Scooter, but we decided to use a wood top instead.  We did this primarily because these units are now being manufactured on the planet Joval and frankly, those Jovalians just don't make 'em like they used to.  We knew that if we cut the metal grid, it would rust if not protected and we suspect it would rust quickly and badly.  Yeah, we could paint the edges with some Rustoleum or something, but would the Rustoleum stick to the chrome plating?  We decided not to find out.  Besides, we thought an oak top would continue the theme of the original Way Cool Technicolor Barbecue Cart.  So we ran down to our local Home Depot and bought a piece of oak plywood, 2 feet by 4 feet.  Well, that's what they claimed.  It was actually 2 feet by 3 feet, 11 and 3/4 inches.  (Hey!  If you look closely, there's Mrs. Flashburn's space boots on the door step!) </font>

<font size=4>Here we demonstrate the need for about 2 inches of clearance between the handle on the intragalactic Speed Scooter and the wood top that we are making.  This is so you can get your knuckles in there and hold onto the handle when you are running away from Atorian slime monkeys!  Or when you want to move your cart from place to place.  And whoa!!

<font size=4>More dimensional discussion, now.  Here is the top cut to length.  We cut it to 35 inches.  Why 35 inches?  Well, as you can see from the previous photo of the handle and tape measure, the total length of this cart is going to be 3 inches plus whatever the size of the top is.  If we make the top 37 inches, then overall, the cart will be 40 inches.  Hey!  That's the same size as a Big Green Egg medium table, and the cover for that table will fit our cart!  That's using our noodle!  So, 3 inches for the handle, 35 inches for the plywood board, and 2 inches for the two pieces of solid oak that we will glue to the edges.  That's 40 inches!  Oh, and what about width?  Well, the plywood is 24 inches wide, so when we add 2 inches of solid oak edging, that makes 26 inches.  HEY!!  That's how wide the medium table is, too!  We must be living right!  </font>

<font size=4>So, now that we have cut our board to length, it's time to put the solid oak edging on the plywood to cover up those nasty edges!  So take those 1-1/2 inch wide strips of oak that you have left over from making the table for your large egg.....  YOU DID SAVE THOSE 1-1/2 INCH WIDE STRIPS OF OAK THAT YOU HAD LEFT OVER, DIDN'T YOU????  Oh, I can see this is going be a challenging project for you Earthlings.  That is why I returned to Earth.

<font size=4>Time to start gluing the strips to the plywood!  Check out this clamping technique!  We didn't bring a bar clamp with us that was long enough to clamp the length of the plywood, so we clamp a board across the plywood and then use that as a clamping point.  So, a little wood glue on the strip, some careful lining up, and then apply a clamp to hold it in place until you can get all the clamps on.</font>

<font size=4>Apply the clamps just tight enough to ensure a good bond.  You don't want to squeeze all the glue out of the joint.  Did you know that it's a capital offense in the Sturgisian System?  I didn't think so.  Oh, and if you do squeeze some glue out of the joint, be sure to take a damp cloth and wipe it off.  Scrub it off.  Just get it off.  If that glue dries on the wood surface, you won't get any stain or finish to penetrate there.  Another capital offense in the Sturgisian System!</font>

<font size=4>At this point, we need to explain a step that we didn't photograph.  You remember, that we cut the strips a bit longer that necessary to cover the width and length of the plywood?  Well, in order to glue the long pieces onto the plywood, we need to trim the ends off those short pieces going across the width.  We actually cut the short pieces just a wee bit longer than necessary. (And we do mean "wee", as in about 1/32 of an inch on each end.) That way it was close enough to run the whole thing through the table saw to cut half a blade with off of each side and create a perfectly flat surface for gluing the long strips.</font>

<font size=4>See how the attachment blocks fit over the ends of the legs on our Intergallactic Speed Scooter?  We suppose that someone with good measuring skills could measure and lay out the position of the attachment blocks, but we decided to use an empirical approach.

<font size=4>So, we put the other two blocks on their legs, added some glue, then very carefully, we put the top down on the cart.  We lined up the two blocks on the top with their legs and once we had them seated on their legs, we lowered the other end of the top onto the blocks and the wet glue.  Observe the clamping technique.  We don't have clamps deep enough to reach the blocks on the underside.  So, we placed two long boards that reached across the width of the top.

<font size=4>On the two blocks nearest the edge, we chose to put the two screws in the middle of the blocks rather than screw into the edge banding.  We have to make a confession here.  The edge banding is just a bit thicker than the plywood and we didn't want to take the time to cut it down, so the edge is not flush.  To get the blocks to sit flush, we actually cut a slight rabbet in the underside of the block.  Well, the rabbet was a bit too deep, so we feared if we screwed down into it, it would crack the block in two.  Got that?   </font>

<font size=4>Uh, oh, it looks like ol' Whiz got a little overzealous with his space blaster and broke through the other side of the plywood.  Not to worry!  With a toothpick or other small flat object, just put a little glue on the underside of the chip.  Cover it with a small sheet of wax paper, then use a block to clamp the chip down. </font>

<font size=4>How are we going to cut a large hole in the top when we are ready to drop the Egg into the cart?  Well, as Emeril would say, "I don't know where you buy your compass, but where I buy mine, they don't come in 21" sizes!"  Here's a handy technique for drawing large circles.   First, we find a thin scrap of wood that is slightly longer than the radius of the circle.  As you can see, in one end we have driven a nail.  Then drill a small hole at a distance from the nail which is equal to the radius of the circle you need to draw. </font>

<font size=4>Right, then.   Take the sheet of plywood with the 21-inch hole in it that we made when we built the table for our large egg, and....   What?  YOU DID SAVE THE SHEET OF PLYWOOD WITH THE 21-INCH HOLE IN IT THAT WE MADE LAST TIME, DIDN'T YOU????  When are you going to learn?  Waste not, want not!  One more time, we'll wait while you cut a 21-inch hole in a sheet of plywood....  Got it?  Ok, then slip it over the small Egg.  Open the lid so you can bring the plywood up until it hits the bottom of the hinge in the back.  Now measure the distance from the side of the Egg to the edge of the hole.  6 inches?  Ok, 21-6=15 inches.  So, we'll need a 16-inch hole to allow 1/2 inch all around.</font>

<font size=4>16-inch diameter means we want an 8-inch radius.  So mark a spot 8 inches from the pivot point on our strip.  Drill a small hole there and now we can draw a 16-inch circle.  Also, we decided that the hole should be three inches from the edge.  So we mark the pivot point 11 inches from the edge, centered between the front and back edges.  Nail the strip to the top and we are ready to draw.</font>

<font size=4>If you have a helper, then have them hold the circle as you cut so it doesn't fall and possibly create a rough edge or even pull some of the oak veneer off.  If you don't have a helper, you can clamp a stick like this so that the circle won't fall when you complete the circle.  Just after we took this photo, we moved the stick to the other side of the 5/8-inch hole.  Duh.... </font>

<font size=4>Look a that!  He's got TWO Hortellian neutron shields!  Apparently, these shields are only cut to rough sizes and the first one he stole, er, obtained was a bit too wide.  The second one fit like a glove.  Anyway, more discussion now about dimensions.  If your small Egg is sitting on its three ceramic feet, when you open the lid with the spring hinge, the lower edge of the hinge will be about 11 inches above the surface that the feet are sitting on.  So, depending on the thickness of whatever you use in place of a Hortellian neutron shield, and other miscellaneous factors, you will need to measure from the surface the Egg will rest on to the top surface of the wood top.  Adjust the top shelf accordingly so that the lower edge of the hinge will be at least 11 inches above the supporting surface.  That's what's great about these Intergallactic Speed Scooters.  The legs have 1 inch markings on them so that you don't have to measure each leg to get the shelf level.</font>
