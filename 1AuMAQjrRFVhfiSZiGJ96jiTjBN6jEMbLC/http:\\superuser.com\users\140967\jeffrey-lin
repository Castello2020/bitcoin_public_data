I always research the question before I answer it and revise my answers as needed. I will try to explain what I mean and will upvote answers that are better than mine or deserve it even if my answer is accepted. Lately I've been taking to reviewing Late Answers and First Posts on sites that I have enough reputation in to stop robo-reviewers. I eat close votes on Arqade for breakfast. Some of my interests include mathematics, science, Android, and gaming.
