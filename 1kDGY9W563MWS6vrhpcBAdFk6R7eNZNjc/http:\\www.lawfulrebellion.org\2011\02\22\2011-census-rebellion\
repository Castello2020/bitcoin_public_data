<p>The 2011 Census seems to have been pushed aside by the media for more pressing stories like the X Factor, Recession, the new political model: coalition politics, Korean, Iranian and Egyptian propaganda and the looming Royal wedding. Yet for some of us who believe we’re not subjects of the Crown nor like to be told what to do, the Census is a vivid example that in fact we’re merely <strong>Person</strong>alty (living movable assets), and not free human beings, to the people in high places and that it’s their God-given Right to tell us what to do. One of the Government’s own website’s boasts:</p>
<p>“Governments of every era have recognised the need to collect information on their most valuable asset &#8211; their people. Slaves, peasants and serfs, nobles, clergymen and monarchs have all taken part in censuses.”</p>
<p>The first Census was taken in 1086 for tax purposes and displaced many Britons through the dividing of land – this was another step in destroying Cymric and Cornish culture, by not granting them the same Rights as Englanders. And only just in this 2011 Census, the ‘Welsh’ (Cymric) people have been given ‘status’.</p>
<p>The Census has repeatedly been used for propaganda, new tax policies and financial control, along with serving as a head count for various wars. For instance, the Napoleonic wars and the two world wars used valuable Census data to plan how to use human beings, as cannon fodder for their domination.</p>
<p>Rebellion to the Census began with opposition to the demographer, Thomas Malthus, who published his essay on the &#8216;Principle of Population&#8217; in 1798. Malthus suggested that population growth would soon outstrip supplies of food and other resources, Britain would be hit by famine, disease and other disasters. Such lobbying pressures on Parliament caused the introduction of the Census Act in 1800 and the first official Census of England and Wales was on 10 March 1801. This strategy sounds eerily like the plan used to drum up support for the Western Forces to conquer countless defenceless cultures.</p>
<p>Britons have always held the Census with contempt, and quite rightly so, why should we as human beings be treated like cattle at market? The history of rebellion began with the Women’s Freedom League, who encouraged the boycott of the 1911 Census by not being at home during the night of the Census – this is something the Office for National Statistics (ONS) are trying to stop by introducing a part where the ‘home owner’ has to fill out who exactly is staying at their homes during the night of the Census!</p>
<p>There was also a 1m large Census rebellion during the year of 1991 over the Poll tax and also the fact that people knew that the Census was a way of the Government producing new tax policies.</p>
<p>And just in 2001, 390,127 Britons found other ways of rebelling through saying their religion is Jedi! An absolutely novel and impressive way of rebelling in typical British style! A tradition that is continuing to successfully mock the idiocy of the people who think they can dominate us and tell us how to eat, shit and breathe.</p>
<p>So this 2011 Census needs to be a fitting gesture to the Government, that we aren’t their cattle and we won’t be told what to do by silly pieces of paper in buildings that look like Churches by Judges who look like Catholic priests!</p>
<p>After all of this, do you think it’s ETHICALLY right to assist in channelling your private details and tax money to the largest war-machine and most corrupt corporation in the USA, LOCKHEED MARTIN, under legal enforcement of the Crown, WITHOUT our consultation? The data of which will be then used by 100s of Government agencies and private companies for the purposes of working out new ways of extracting more of your Sweat Equity; and to hatch new plans in how to create their fictional Utopian societal domination?</p>
<p>This Census is designed to get into our collective minds more than ever before, you can make a choice to help them or resist them in whatever way you can manage…</p>
<p>This is the <strong>2011 CENSUS REBELLION!</strong></p>
<p>We will be campaigning and attempt to support you all in standing up to these brutes who think that it’s their authoritative right to treat us as their assets, <strong>PERSONALTY</strong>. These particular people live off the fruits of our labour, whilst most of us have to survive in relative poverty, worrying about whether we’re going to have a job in a year’s time and how we’re going to be able to afford to feed and educate our families, coupled with the fact of our Sweat Equity being worth less and our freedom of movement being sanctioned more and more.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a great video on what somebody is doing with the Census:</p>

<p><strong> </strong><strong>_______________________________</strong></p>
<p><strong>You have no Rights and will be an ‘Enemy of the State’ if you don’t comply with the 2011 Census. Decide what to believe:</strong></p>
<p>It’s a fact that the Crown will own your personal data when you fill out the 2011 Census survey. Just as your name and number becomes a legal fiction at birth through your parents unwittingly signing your Crown copyrighted Birth Certificate, along with other more ancient religious methods of recording your birth date for slavery. Through the transition from childhood into teenage-hood, most of us are successfully programmed to keep our <strong>Person</strong> alive by using credit facilities, accepting a National Insurance number, paying PAYE, being on the Electoral Register and voting in Governments.</p>
<p>The notion of us being owned stretches across everything else you think you own … Every <strong>‘thing’ </strong>is merely granted to your <strong>Person</strong> making it easier for them to monitor their assets… <strong>Personalty</strong> &#8211; <strong>your property is theirs</strong>, don’t be fooled! They will come and take whatever they like, whenever they like through their Mafia Court proceedings and incomprehensible<strong> Legalese</strong>.</p>
<p>We will repeat, the Crown can do anything they like with your <strong>person</strong>al life, because they literally own it &#8211; this fact is stipulated through the <strong>enforced</strong> compliance of the Census Act. The Crown and its Government agencies have made it very clear that Enforcement Officers’ will be <strong>fining everyone £1000</strong> who doesn’t do what the Crown tells them. Furthermore, everyone who resists payment to the Crown and Government will eventually be able to ‘legally’ enter your <strong>Person’s</strong> dwelling and strip it of £1000 worth of assets until the debt is settled. Proof you own <strong>NOTHING</strong> and have no control whatsoever of your <strong>person</strong>al life. In ONS’s own words,</p>
<p>“The Census is compulsory and there are no ethical reasons or legal exemptions for not having to complete a Census questionnaire with the exception of the question on religion which is voluntary.”</p>
<p>It’s a given some of you have already thought about how to get out of this legally, and the Act that immediately springs to mind is the Human Rights Act 1998, which is compatible with the EU version. Well we researched this and the response from the ONS is:</p>
<p>“Article 8(2) of the ECHR makes provision for the public authority to interfere with a person’s rights to privacy and respect for family life if such interference is authorised by law and is for the one of the permitted aims of the Article. The requirement to comply with the Census is therefore entirely in accordance with the Human Rights Act in that the lawful authority is given by the Census Act 1920 and this is the necessary for the economic well-being of the country and for the purposes of the protection of health and the rights and freedoms of others.”</p>
<p>They added more evidence regarding compliance with District Judge Parkinson’s, ruling in 2002, who was in favour of the Census, giving no Right to invoke the Human Rights Act:</p>
<p>“[The Census] is necessary for the benefit of society at large – to plan strategy spending policies etc for central and local government; education; schools and other organisations.”</p>
<p>Let’s unravel this particular Judgement, so everyone understands their disgusting way of addressing Human Beings:</p>
<p>“Article 8(2) of the ECHR makes provision for the public authority to interfere with a person’s rights to privacy and respect for family life if such interference is authorised by law and is for the one of the permitted aims of the Article.”</p>
<p>What ‘they’ actually said:</p>
<ol>
<li>We have designed ‘society’ and democracy carefully, so we cream off the top via the Class System, Canon Law and labour. We have to protect our privileges at any cost, and this includes any Conditional Rights, Citizens think they have, if what we created is deemed to be at risk.</li>
<li>The Public has no privacy when ‘Public Authority’ lobbies a move that would contradict so blatantly break real Human Rights, if they actually existed. But we’ve designed the Human Rights Act in such a way that we give people their Rights with one hand and take them away with the other – this seems to trick people on the whole.</li>
<li>We are the lawmakers, as well as the authority – we know this a conflict of interest and we continually manipulate the Law to our benefit everyday to keep what we have created.</li>
</ol>
<p>“The requirement to comply with the Census is therefore entirely in accordance with the Human Rights Act in that the lawful authority is given by the Census Act 1920 and this is the necessary for the economic well-being of the country.”</p>
<p>What ‘they’ actually mean:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you don’t comply with the Census, you will affect the ‘economic well-being’ of the Country, so what are all those who don’t comply? You will simply become a benign Terrorist or an enemy of the State, which will then give them the Right to spy on you. It’s quite apt at this point to slot in where such tight regulations apply for people in Banks and the Government Mafia – if we will be arrested and taken to Court, surely the Bankers and Government will be in there first?</li>
<li>‘They’ designed the Human Rights Act and ‘they’ use it as a weapon for propaganda when ‘they’ see fit. What is the Human Rights Act, but merely a two-tier stitch up phone contract that you seemingly have to pay for even if you don’t get any service? Answers in the post please!</li>
</ol>
<p>“For the purposes of the protection of health and the rights and freedoms of others.”</p>
<p>What ‘they’ actually mean:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you don’t comply, you will affect the way the private sector align budgets to continually save money at the expense of Human life for the benefit of the few at the top of the hierarchy.</li>
<li>If you don’t comply, you will affect the rights and freedoms of the Elite at the top of the hierarchy, which means that they will use all enforcement using their private army, the Police, to scare you into submission.</li>
</ol>
<p>Interestingly in 2001, over 1.5m households failed to return their Census and only 38 were prosecuted. Why is this? Simply because it’s way too difficult to police the Census Act, as they’re strapped for cash and don’t have the resources to cope with a mass rebellion. They’ve tried to offset this, as they know that there is going to be at least pockets of rebellion, and there is profit to be made from the £1000 fines – hence why they’ve employed lots of Enforcement Officers who will have absolutely NO AUTHORITY whatsoever to make you do anything – REMEMBER anything you do with them will be contractual and your choice – Don’t dig your own grave by even talking to them! The legislation and pseudo-law they state is as powerful as them trying to make you pay your TV Licence. It will be up to your strength of heart over brain matter! Tough – no seriously, if you do it, you’re very tough and one of maybe 1m people who will stand up and be counted.</p>
<p><strong>Private Shareholders will ultimately manipulate 2011 Census data to develop new draconian Tax and legal policies</strong></p>
<p>The Census has become even more intrusive, and as Britain becomes more and more openly privatised, it begs the question whether any corporation should be able to use any information given by the people, if it’s only going to generate increased profits for their Shareholders and people at the top? For instance:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the Highways are sold off to the Rothchild’s empire, this would mean that they would be able to access Census data in order to develop price plans for another Road Tax (vehicle excise duty); and be able to fund the live tracking of all of us on the roads.</li>
<li>All the greedy water companies will be able to access new Census data so they can seek new ways to increase prices of already what is considered to be liquid gold to corporations, pocketing £billions a year.</li>
<li>Local Councils will be able to access new Census data about how many rooms are in your dwelling, along with who spends a lot of time in your private dwelling both family and friends, whether they’re staying over (found in the ‘Household Questions’). How else would the Councils use this information than to produce a new taxation system; and tighten the benefits belt further? Or this is a double-whammy, so they try and capture all the people who try to hide around other houses!</li>
<li>There are interesting and very intrusive questions in the survey relating to jobs, which are revealing for example:</li>
</ol>
<p>“If a job had been available last week, could you have started it within two weeks?”</p>
<p>After speaking with people on benefits, they say things are changing rapidly and that they’re being forced into manual labour under blackmail that their benefits will be cut. These specific questions will surely drive new policy for the benefits system, as a PR gimmick to satisfy the mass of ‘hard worker bees’ making sure the Government are being tough on the unemployed.</p>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<p>What is the real purpose of the 2011 Census?</p>
<p>How do we all benefit from the Government and the Crown knowing more about our private lives than ever before?</p>
<p><strong>The officially severely corrupt and taxpayer-sucking corporation, LOCKHEED MARTIN, spies on you and you and you and helps to kill them over there and there and there…</strong></p>
<p>An interesting detail is that Staff with various levels of access to the full Census data set or substantial parts of it will have to apply security markings to handle material classified as, ‘UNCLASSIFIED’, ‘CLASSIFIED’ and ‘SECRET’ (assumed 3<sup>rd</sup> category) under the UK Government’s classifications. This system will obviously be a way of keeping everything that should be made public away from the public ‘for our own protection’. So basically anything that’s going against official public policy will be labelled ‘SECRET’, i.e. give them the green light to send whatever they like to LOCKHEED MARTIN or any EU private company they wish; or turn a blind eye at the amount of espionage going on all the time by agencies across the world, let alone in their own office! Funnily enough this list of LOCKHEED’s and NSA’s includes UK’s own allies, using technologies like the sophisticated spying sky network, ECHELON, which is in our own back garden.</p>
<p>Just in 2001, agencies were caught eavesdropping on, ‘anyone who is politically active’ – absolutely nothing was done about the case once it reached the EU Parliament. There are numerous companies involved in ECHELON’s production, namely LOCKHEED MARTIN, who is at the top of their game in surveillance technology and provide services to these agencies.</p>
<p>LOCKHEED is an interesting company taking $1 in every $13 of US Citizens’ tax, as surveillance, guns, war and killing seem to always be at the top of peoples’ minds whenever the American flag is seen – this is not natural is it?</p>
<p>LOCKHEED are also all over the UK Police supplying them with the staff and resources to forcibly take peoples’ DNA, fingerprints and photographs – where does this data all end up?</p>
<p>Yet despite the facts, the Crown has appointed this American war machine intelligence technology corporation to manage the whole 2011 Census from start to finish. Oh and for those that don’t know, LOCKHEED MARTIN designed and built the clever little F117 Stealth Bomber that so precisely bombed Iraq in all those TV videos and so skilfully assist the West in bombing little brown people across the planet – Shock and Awe – the years that followed, it’s estimated that over 500,000 children died as a result of the attack and sustained embargoes.</p>
<p>Here is a nice little selection of LOCKHEED products that assist Governments in spying and killing people who disagree with their beliefs and policies:</p>

</ul>
<p>LOCKHEED MARTIN explains:</p>
<p>“Whether it’s providing satellite imagery to track threats or developing systems to analyze complex security data or deploying fingerprint ID technology for rapid first response, Lockheed Martin offers the depth of expertise and technological capabilities to help protect our homeland… Our information security capabilities span secure communications, computer network defense, intrusion detection and prevention, and the full array of information operations.”</p>
<p><strong>LOCKHEED MARTIN is ruthless and beyond the reach of any real global Government control</strong></p>
<p>One of LOCKHEED’s contracts is with a company called, CIFA, a Defense Department Agency, providing consultancy and staff for data mining and intelligence gathering and got surprisingly got caught ‘illegally obtaining information on American Citizens’ according to The National Security Archive:</p>
<p>“CIFA did not comply with the 90-day retention review policy specified by that directive and the CORNERSTONE database did not have the capability to identify TALON reports with U.S. person information, to identify reports requiring a 90-day retention review, or allow analysts to edit or delete the TALON reports.”</p>
<p>The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) started the Information Awareness Office in 2002, its function was to gather as much information on American citizens as possible and be used by secret agencies. Data Mining included internet activity, rental car records, social security numbers, credit card purchases, driver’s licences, airline tickets, medical records, educational history, utility bills, tax returns, etc.</p>
<p>DARPA was disbanded in 2004, but the data-mining was contracted out to agencies like the National Security Agency (NSA), the Defense Intelligence Agency and the FBI, who contract out to companies like good old LOCKHEED MARTIN.</p>
<p>The US Act that allows Government-appointed agencies to spy on whoever they see fit internationally is the Patriot Act:</p>
<p>“Section 215 of the Patriot Act allows the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to authorise broad warrants for nearly any type of record, including those held by banks, libraries, internet service providers, credit card companies, even doctors of ‘persons of interest’.”</p>
<p>After all this damning factual information about LOCKHEED MARTIN and their fluid jurisdiction, it seemed logical to ask the ONS (a little British Statistical Department), exactly how they’ll be managing to stop LOCKHEED MARTIN (the foremost Intelligence contractor and war-machine maker in the World) from obtaining the Census 2011 information whilst LOCKHEED will be managing the whole process from start to finish including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Questionnaire printing</li>
<li>Data capture and coding – the scanning of paper questionnaires and online data capture</li>
<li>Questionnaire tracking</li>
<li>Provisions of a telephone helpline</li>
</ul>
<p>ONS wrote back and said:</p>
<p>“ONS has put in place additional contractual and operational arrangements in the 2011 Census contract with Lockheed Martin UK to ensure that US authorities could not gain access to census data. Those arrangements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>All data processing will be carried out in UK – no data will leave or be held at any point outside the UK</li>
<li>All data is the property of the ONS and only UK/EU owned companies will have any access to personal census data</li>
<li>The only people who have access to the full census dataset in the operational data centre will be ONS staff</li>
<li>No Lockheed Martin staff (from either the US parent or UK company) will have access to any personal census data</li>
<li>ONS will control system access rights to all data systems</li>
<li>Everyone working with census data will sign declarations of confidentiality</li>
<li>Independent checks by an accredited UK security consultancy of both physical and electronic security are carried out for ONS.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Surely LOCKHEED MARTIN will be able to commission one of its agencies or contractors to accidently crack the code they developed and deliver the Census information to whoever pays the price? This isn’t conspiracy, it’s an assumption based on imperial evidence of LOCKHEED MARTIN’s previous record of spying and illegal data mining.</p>
<p>How loose can a Government get in keeping peoples’ information confidential, unless it’s all a public show (surely not!)… Especially when they will be subcontracting out to these companies as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cable &amp; Wireless</li>
<li>Logica</li>
<li>UK Data Capture</li>
<li>BSS</li>
<li>Steria</li>
<li>Polestar</li>
<li>Barron McCann</li>
<li>Web Technology Group</li>
<li>Oracle</li>
</ul>
<p>It baffles the mind to think that if the priority of the ONS were confidentiality, then surely they’d be trying to minimise the amount of corporations involved, especially ones that won’t have such rigorous methods of secrecy? Obviously, they trust every corporation involved, and had lots of nice lunches with all of them probably at the taxpayers’ expense.</p>
<p><strong>LOCKHEED MARTIN’s involvement in torture, bribes, illegal wars and arming war-torn countries, snippet by Jeffery St. Clair of CounterPunch:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“More than 80 percent of Lockheed&#8217;s revenues derive directly from federal government contracts. And most of the rest comes from foreign military sales to Israel, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Chile. Israel alone spends $1.8 billion a year on planes and missile systems purchased from Lockheed. Lockheed sells its weaponry, from F-16 fighters to surveillance software, to more than 40 nations. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking at world domination of the market,&#8221; gloated Bob Elrod, a senior executive in Lockheed&#8217;s fighter plane division…</p>
<p>With Lockheed, it&#8217;s sometimes difficult to discern whether it&#8217;s taking advantage of US foreign policy or shaping it. Take the Iraq war. Lockheed&#8217;s former vice-president, Bruce Jackson, headed an ad hoc group called the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq. This coven of corporate executives, think tank gurus and retired generals includes such war-mongering luminaries as Richard Perle, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Gen. Wayne Downing and former CIA director James Woolsey…</p>
<p>After meeting with White House functionaries, members of the Committee would fan out on cable news shows and talk radio to inflame the fever for war against Saddam…</p>
<p>In 2002, the Bush administration called on Jackson to help drum up support in Eastern Europe for the war on Iraq. When Poland and Hungary came on board, Jackson actually drafted their letter supporting an invasion of Iraq. His company was swiftly rewarded for his efforts. In 2003, Poland purchased 50 of Lockheed&#8217;s F-16 fighters for $3.5 billion. The sale was underwritten by a $3.8 billion loan from the Bush administration.</p>
<p>Lockheed also made out quite nicely from the Iraq war itself. Its F-117 Stealth fighters inaugurated the start of the war with the &#8220;Shock and Awe&#8221; bombing of Baghdad. Later, the Pentagon stepped up orders of Lockheed&#8217;s PAC 3 Patriot missile. The missile batteries, designed for use against SCUD missiles that Iraq no longer possessed, sell for $91 million per unit.</p>
<p>After the toppling of Saddam, Lockheed executives saw an opportunity to gobble up one of the big private contractors doing business in Iraq, Titan Corporation. The San Diego-based company was awarded a $10 million contract to provide translators for the Pentagon in Iraq. Two of those translators, Adel Nakhl and John Israel, were later accused of being involved in the torture of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison. Titan translators, who are paid upwards of $107,000 a year, were also implicated in a scandal at Guantanamo prison.”</p>
<p><strong>Contracts are simply pieces of paper and have no authority unless you sign them</strong></p>
<p>As we all know, contracts issued by the Crown and Government of the UK aren’t worth the paper they’re written on, especially Legislation that matches that of policies such as the TV Licence.</p>
<p>The evidence regarding how LOCKHEED MARTIN seem to be very accustomed to data mining and gathering intelligence of the Public at large is astounding. And even if LOCKHEED MARTIN gets caught, they know on the whole a blind eye will be turned – just part of that special relationship between the UK and USA. So if LOCKHEED MARTIN think they’re above the ‘law’, then it’s easy to see they aren’t worried about a thing. Yet we can potentially end up in Court with a £1000 fine! Is this Democracy in action, as we’re slightly confused over here at Lawful Rebellion. J</p>
<p>The average bloke must think all that’s been documented is a joke and will be naturally questioning why such a corporation as LOCKHEED MARTIN will have complete unofficial control of British personal data.</p>
<p>And just in case, for those who don’t know, this arrangement is predicted to be part of the deal the Americans brokered back in the 60s &#8211; complete disclosure of every British Citizens’ personal data, free reign to spy and extradite who they choose, in exchange for a public share in global nuclear dominance. As one of my dearest friends, John Harris, says,</p>
<p>‘Look at what they’re doing turn it around 180 degrees and you can see what’s happening in plain sight.’</p>
<p>The trick is very simple, stamp a ‘CLASSIFIED’ or ‘SECRET’ seal on anything the Slaves aren’t allowed to see, and if they do, we have the Right to throw them in prison if they tell anyone what they’ve found out – Hence why we never hear anything of relevance with anything in the mainstream media.</p>
<p><strong>Ethics means nothing to the Authorities, only to us, the people</strong></p>
<p>If there isn’t a straightforward legal way to not comply with the Census 2011, and then let’s try putting some spanners in the works, we can choose to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ethically refuse the Census due to the nature of the contractors the Government has chosen. LOCKHEED MARTIN is clearly a rogue corporation who has been caught, along with their agents, spying on the American and UK Public, lobbying for the illegal Iraq war and arming conflicts making the world a more dangerous place. We cannot as the people of this Island, trust this kind of corporation with our private information.</li>
<li>Ethically refuse the Census until the Iraq war was ‘legal’ and justified and that LOCKHEED’s involvement didn’t cause a bigger problem and indirectly killing 100s of 1000s of people. We don’t want to be involved in any way, shape or form with this hideous corporation.</li>
<li>Not comply with the 2011 Census until the ONS can prove that the Census data won’t be used directly or indirectly for the service of Shareholders in all the corporations involved in the running of Government services. A popular theme on the streets from people is that we’re paying more for less or our Sweat Equity is worth less – so how can the Census help us other than to squeeze more from our pockets?</li>
<li>Refuse to comply, if our private information is going to be used to form profit-making Strategies and Policies that we know will affect the wellbeing of our families and us. It should be optional and everyone who fills out the Census to at least get paid £5000 for their time and private data. If we’re living in practically a privately run Government, then why can we not have control of our own Assets?</li>
<li>We’re positive how they’re dealing with this is very similar to how the TV Licence prosecutions are carried out. In essence, don’t contract with them, talk to them, sign anything or fill anything out, and the only tools they have to get you prosecuted cannot be used or will cost more than the fine’s worth to pursue.</li>
<li>Do it the official way, complain and complain and complain, asking over and over again the questions you have about the Census and that you don’t agree with it. Captain Ranty is very good at this method, ask him for tips!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Are the Terrorists in our own back garden?</strong></p>
<p>LOCKHEED MARTIN has broken many laws in the States and some over here, what’s to say they won’t follow the ‘law’ this time around? Also look at the Crown and the Government and find all the ways you have found where they can be defined in The Terrorism Act and Counter-Terrorism Act – this is FUN! There is enough information in this article and the links at the end of it for anyone to assist in this legal concept.</p>
<p>Definitions:</p>
<p>Under the Terrorism Act 2000:</p>
<p>“1 Terrorism: interpretation.</p>
<p>(1) In this Act “terrorism” means the use or threat of action where—</p>
<p>(b) the use or threat is designed to influence the government [For an international governmental organisation] or to intimidate the public or a section of the public, and</p>
<p>(c) the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious [racial] or ideological cause.”</p>
<p>Under the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008:</p>
<p>“Meaning of “ancillary offence”</p>
<p>(1) In this Act “ancillary offence”, in relation to an offence, means any of the following—</p>
<p>(a) aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of the offence (or, in Scotland, being art and part in the commission of the offence);</p>
<p>(b) an offence under Part 2 of the Serious Crime Act 2007 (c. 27) (encouraging or assisting crime) in relation to the offence (or, in Scotland, inciting a person to commit the offence)”</p>
<p>After reading the definitions within these two Acts, and all the information pertained within this document, do you think we have a case?</p>
<h2><strong>Let’s stand up to these brutes! Their secret is out, we aren’t their slaves! </strong><strong>THIS IS THE 2011 CENSUS REBELLION!</strong></h2>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi all im new to this site.Someone i know was working for the census and is finishing on Friday.He said alot of the people in this Phase dont give a toss wether people fill in the census or not(he doesnt) but after tomorrow he said the next lot start and as a previous poster stated they have the rather Orwellian title of &#8220;Compliance Officer&#8221;(WTF!).He knew i wasnt filling out the census(hes sound,known him for years,asked me to send him info on Lockheed Martin) and told me hed been asked to go down my road the other day .He told me my number and a couple of others had been taken off his to chase up list.He showed me the text.This is strange because i havent filled it in.I think they might be saving me for phase 2 and the &#8220;Compliance Officers&#8221; but he said as far as he knew the the list was passed on and if your not on it your not on it.I hope hes right but we shall see.When they first knocked on my door (theyve been round 4 times,ive been out twice and theyve been ignored twice) i got the arse ache,dug out my unopened census from a mound of paperwork and put it in a post box.I didnt put NCRTS on it just posted it as is.A few days later it came back.So i posted it off again and it came back.I posted it again last Wednesday and as yet it hasnt come back.I know each time it is delivered it costs them money.As i said i personally think they are leaving me for phase 2 but have had no knocks on the door or cards since,has anyone returning the census NCRTS found this?<br />
This bloke interestingly enough also told me that about 15%,certainly above 10% down my road had yet to return a census as of a few days ago,which i think is pretty good.<br />
As of what im going to do if the &#8220;compliance stasi&#8221; come after me,i will continue ignoring their knocks.If they for example accost me leaving my house i will say nothing,literally nothing,except possibly &#8220;shut the gate on your way out&#8221; and walk off.What can they do?They dont have powers of arrest,so they can bluster all they like.This lot will always go in pairs with one keeping a constant written record of anything said,so why say anything,it can only be of use to them.<br />
I feel like really digging in on this one.I think if they do start trying to take people to court (more appropriately their place of business)we should maybe try and replicate as well as we can the Birkenhead court case of Roger Hayes.I went up there(im a member of the BCG) for that and although i didnt get into the court the atmoshere outside was great.Vocal,intense but noone was hurt,no windows were smashed or damage caused.I was buzzing off it for days.Ive heard alot of Stop The War Coalition is boycotting the census so ive contacted my local group coordinator to see how they are going to deal with it.If the maximum fine is a thousand pounds and it starts costing them tens of thousands or even more i think theyll probably sack it. With numbers i dont  see why we cant see this one off  and try and give ourselves a moral boost for tougher battles to come.If they push this i think we should try and give them a nightmare,lawfully,peacefully and effectively.</p>
<p>Regards<br />

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I once heard about a census guy who got his eye poked out by a sharp stick &#8211; teach him to look through my letterbox! <img src='http://www.lawfulrebellion.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Seriously, though, I didn&#8217;t see it make any difference to stay quiet when they knocked again. I had lights on, bath running, etc. They clearly knew I was in and they just kept knocking! But I just ignored. Anyway, what if I didn&#8217;t even stay there on 27th March, legally I don&#8217;t have to fill out? And if I didn&#8217;t stay anywhere else either. I stayed out all night, just walking &#8211; or is that illegal now too?! Is there a curfew? Why are we putting up with this?!</p>

Nicola &#8211; because a percentage of the country still think they&#8217;re at school and will get in trouble if they don&#8217;t fill out their homework<br />

			<div class="comment-content"><p>My forms went straight in the shredder. Not had a peep out of the census drones yet though. No one at the door (not while we were in anyway), no reminder cards or letters, nothing. The census collectors were finished on Friday past so I wonder if I&#8217;m in the clear or they are saving me for the level two enforcment officers? Anyone else not heard off them? Most posters on here seem to have had several visits, cards, etc.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p><i>…a percentage of the country still think they’re at school and will get in trouble if they don’t fill out their homework.</i></p>
<p>Richy – thanks for responding! Yes I agree, and it does rather feel like school too. But the reality is that the UK is actually a registered corporation and we are the employees, subject to disciplinary if we misbehave. – (As a country, under our treaty, lawfully they cannot punish us for breaking a statute law which contradicts constitutional laws – so to get around this they make the UK one big corporation, putting together corporate “rules” within that company (i.e. statute laws) and using these “inhouse” so that you believe you are subject to.) – The courts are where this disciplinary is carried out; but only if you consent to this! The thing is, we never signed any contract with this corporation – they’re only way to fool us into compliance is our own ignorance and/or our fear. Your birth certificate bonds you to the state as MR JOHN SMITH and if you answer ‘yes, I am MR JOHN SMITH” when asked in court, you just consented to be disciplined in that court. But if you refuse to consent by merely realising that you and your birth certificate are two separate entities, and being the human you can represent your PERSON (this is the PERSONality bonded to the state by your birth certificate, which was not done by you!) then they cannot use legaleese, and have to revert to what is actually lawful.  </p>
<p>Oo sorry, I got a little carried away there! For more on this (or better put) have a listen to John Harris videos on TPUC, or even youtube. And of course Roger Hayes’ latest conquest in court!</p>
<p>Still holding strong on the census! Good luck everyone! <img src='http://www.lawfulrebellion.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>What the bible says about the census </p>
<p>(Old testament 1 Chronicles 21:1-28&#8243;)<br />
1 Satan rose up against Israel and caused David to take a census of the people of Israel<br />
7 God was very displeased with the census, and he punished Israel for it.<br />
8 Then David said to God, “I have sinned greatly by taking this census. Please forgive my guilt for doing this foolish thing.”</p>
<p>As it stands Houses have been marked with census number &#8230; what will they mark next??? Will they try to mark our bodies, the temple of God???&#8230;.</p>
<p>What the future holds according to the Book of Revelation</p>
<p>New Testament Revelation 13:1-16</p>
<p>7And the beast was allowed to wage war against God’s holy people and to conquer them. And he was given authority to rule over every tribe and people and language and nation.<br />
8And all the people who belong to this world worshiped the beast. They are the ones whose names were not written in the Book of Life before the world was made—the Book that belongs to the Lamb who was slaughtered.b<br />
9Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand.<br />
10Anyone who is destined for prison will be taken to prison. Anyone destined to die by the sword will die by the sword. This means that God’s holy people must endure persecution patiently and remain faithful.<br />
16He required everyone—small and great, rich and poor, free and slave—to be given a mark on the right hand or on the forehead.<br />
17And no one could buy or sell anything without that mark, which was either the name of the beast or the number representing his name.<br />
18Wisdom is needed here. Let the one with understanding solve the meaning of the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man.c His number is 666.</p>
<p>Revelation 14<br />
9 Then a third angel followed them, shouting, “Anyone who worships the beast and his statue or who accepts his mark on the forehead or on the hand<br />
10 must drink the wine of God’s anger. It has been poured full strength into God’s cup of wrath. And they will be tormented with fire and burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and the Lamb.<br />
11 The smoke of their torment will rise forever and ever, and they will have no relief day or night, for they have worshiped the beast and his statue and have accepted the mark of his name.”<br />
12 This means that God’s holy people must endure persecution patiently, obeying his commands and maintaining their faith in Jesus.</p>
<p>Be wise and make the right choices!</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>The non-compliance team – drones – fuckers- They appear to be getting many labels.  </p>
<p>People seem to be forgetting that they are just other people doing a paid job to pay the bills! I know that many of those filling the positions have recently been made redundant from other areas and have taken these jobs to pay the mortgages etc.</p>
<p>This is the score regarding the non compliance teams.  They are given a number of addresses to visit.  They have no powers to make you do anything you do not wish to. </p>
<p>If they come to your door, you do not even have to answer the door.   If you do answer the door and talk to them, they will simply point out that no return has been received from that address and they will also point out the possible consequences, i.e. a summons and up to a £1000 fine</p>
<p>They will ask for you name.  You do not have to give them your name or any details if you do not want to.  </p>
<p>part of their job is to carry out a doorstep interview after caution which consists of a series of  scripted questions they ask from a form.  If you want to reply to the questions then they will note down what you have to say – if you do not want to do the interview then you simply decline to take part.</p>
<p>If you want them to leave then say so and they will.</p>
<p>The bottom line is if you do not agree/wish/want to complete the census then fine – that’s your choice and you face any possible consquences.  </p>
<p>But remember they are human beings just trying to earn a living and pay the bills.<br />
You would get upset if they were discourteous and abusive to you so why do the same to them – treat other human beings as you would wish to be treated yourself.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#8217;m not sure when the next phase begins but I&#8217;ve heard it will last until September. The old tumbleweed&#8217;s blowing across the street at the moment; I don&#8217;t know when things will commence. But I&#8217;m not backing down &#8211; I won&#8217;t live in communist China, or Zimbabwe, which is what this country is becoming to their plans. People I know who don&#8217;t believe that are living in a dream world &#8211; they think that what goes on in such other countries could never happen here! But it has happened in the past (which is best judge of future) and it does go on now elsewhere, and they will bring it here again unless we say NO. We need to take our country back.

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Mr Sensible – it is nice of you to see that these are just human beings being used by the system, and that they’re just doing a job. Of course we aren’t out there to condemn them for trying to earn a wage, pay their bills, etc. – or for being ignorant. Sure they need to earn a living too. But whilst the job is paid and legal, it is not honest work. And it is not lawful. These people are trying to “persuade” laymen into thinking they have to fill out the census or they’ll be unlawfully fined by the mafia (excuse me, government). Is that honest work?<br />
We are venting about the pressures applied by those who do Evil’s bidding… Have you not heard that if no one joined the army there would be no war? (Oh, but the soldiers wouldn’t be able to pay their mortgages? Tut tut).<br />
Mr Sensible, yes they are human beings. But you must be able to comprehend that to do and to defend such a job is an example of where morality is lacking, or conviction of it, at least.<br />
With these census enforcers you are also arguing that &#8220;legal&#8221; and &#8220;right&#8221; are synonymous. They aren’t always the same thing. Do you think that all the acts and statutes constitute what is morally correct? If yes &#8211; isn’t that rather naïve? (to put it lightly) Can you not stand up for what is right?</p>
<p>You pointed out that we have a right to say no? We should be happy with that? What you are saying is that if the law says any prole can come to another proles door, on behalf of our dictators (excuse me, Government), doing their dirty work, having been trained for it, though in ignorance, lying and threatening (it is threatening when they BANG BANG BANG on your door non-stop for something you admit they cannot enforce – on your property, with no invitation, and you feel a prisoner in your own home) – this is ok with you BECAUSE THEY NEED TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGE?<br />
Forget other crimes of Lockheed Martin for a sec &#8211; do you know how many deaths Lockheed Martin are responsible for? Do you have any idea how many children – babies! – are in that percentage slaughtered? Do you know the difference between a warrior protecting his home and loved ones, and a programmed soldier, and where morality fits in there? Please look into it and then make up your own mind.</p>
<p>The people partaking in this rebellion are also doing so to protect others; the innocent, the ignorant, these census people included, and people like you, Mr Sensible. In the next census perhaps a statute would have come in, under EU policy, that these enforcers are permitted to kick our doors in and drag us out with a black bag over our heads… oh, you don’t think so? Tell that to the dead who thought they were just going to a ghetto. I apologise for getting sarcastic with you – but sometimes I am just overwhelmed by profundity and common sense. </p>
<p>Remember also, you are doing what you’ve been told to, on how you’ve been told to think. Please start thinking for yourself. You’re arguing that people are allowed to come round threatening fake laws – impersonating police officers even – to try to make you do something unlawful which will ultimately lead us into a slavery we cannot get out of; our earnings meanwhile taxed, pilfered, capitised on in every way whilst LM-owned data is distributed to the big companies, supermarkets, banks, (who own the government) for more money &#8211; all to fund more War OF Terror on our fellow human beings, whether brown, purple or yellow skinned. And for what? For money! Such as your argument… they’re just doing it for money.</p>
<p>Ps. I have seen many clips where the census enforcers have been treated with utmost respect. If that puts your mind to some ease.</p>
<p>Best wishes.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>You all seem very paranoid.  Of all the &#8216;intrusions&#8217; of the state, the Census is basically pretty benign, in my view.  Essentially, it&#8217;s a headcount, and is used to help guide government spending &#8211; schools, street lighting, hospitals, etc etc.  If you view it as Orwellian, then I&#8217;d suggest this reflects certain emotional problems on your part.<br />
On Lockheed Martin: shame such an unethical company was involved in the census, but I expect it&#8217;s down to procurement rules.  I think there is no real risk of them getting access to the data though.  In the real world, there is nothing to worry about.<br />
That&#8217;s my piece; I&#8217;m happy to stand up and be counted.  It&#8217;s simply arrogant for an individual to say &#8220;I&#8217;m not taking part in the Census&#8221; &#8211; selfish, lazy, or paranoid.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s good to be sceptical and question the state.  Of course.  And to fight against the involvement (and existence) of arms companies, and so on.  But not filling in the census isn&#8217;t an effective way of protesting.  I just think the census is a really useful thing &#8211; whether or not it&#8217;s a way of controlling us or whatever.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>@Robin,</p>
<p>Oooh, </p>
<p>In my opinion only; Census boycotting seems to have been a very valuable way to protest. </p>
<p>Through use of mediums such YT and LR.org + others &gt; people have supported each other, disseminated information and best of all documented every step of the process (evidence). </p>
<p>The Census issue appears to have created a great deal of solidarity and spread a lot of awareness. It&#8217;s been great hands on practice, a chance to test some of the information people have become privy to. It will be valuable experience going forward, for those concerned.</p>
<p>Your comments come across as incredibly patronising, condescending and they reek of subversion from top to bottom.</p>
<p>May I be so bold as to ask&#8230; what are you actually doing here?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Mr Robin although I don’t agree with what you are saying i understand where you are coming from. The whole thread does seem a lot of fuss over nothing when you take it for face value. However, from my perspective there seems to be some rudiment’s that you have failed to consider. For thousands of years the proletariats have been governed by the powers that be, this come as no surprise to those of us that have an awareness that extends beyond the immediate boundaries of the periphery. When you take a long hard look into society in fact the world over and the underlying causes of its misery you are presented with a daunting fact. 99.9% of mankind seems to be fast asleep, in a state of larval. Man obviously grows old but not quite reaching maturity, hence the larval state of immaturity. Might i add when i refer to man being asleep i mean in a metaphysical and spiritual sense.<br />
Without straying too far, I would like to remind you of a statement that Friedrich Nietzsche made some hundred odd years back and as an older man you may well be familiar with the authors work. He said, “God is dead, man is free.” This is a very significant statement, which has tremendous implications. First and foremost, freedom is innately fundamental to the individuality. The upshot is you are not an individual if you are not free; you are almost certainly part of a crown or at the very least have a mob mentality.  Individuals are not collectives or crowds, but are unique processes of individuation. However, the down side to this freedom is responsibility; please don’t misunderstand, when i refer to responsibility I’m not talking about licentiousness. Licentiousness is a sort of green card you get from your local constituent when you enrol as a social muppet. This enrolment can take the form of voting at a general election or paying for a TV license. Of course all you are doing here is giving consent to robbery.<br />
Freedom and responsibility go hand in hand they are two side of the same coin; you cannot have one without the other.  Crowds and collectives are attributes of an immature society they are just bywords that have no substance, and do very little for the cause of individuality. People only start to mature when they rebel, when they start to say NO! Enough is enough when they become lions and a little less sheepish. When they stand aside the mob and start asking question like what the fuck?<br />
Now it’s because of the lack of maturity why people fall into the collectives – if man is not throwing his responsibility on the Gods of fiction he’s throwing it on the government and of course this puts man in a sort of dormant stasis. man seems to be buzzing around but not actually making any progress simply because they are being played right into the hands of the puppeteers, the sooth Sayers, making himself/herself slaves to the system – an expendable asset of the government.<br />
When individuals are free, then and only then will you see a democratic society, in fact it ought not to be a society – societies are dead. Their structures are old and need replacing with something more dynamic, fluid like. Something more conducive to a democratic way of living whereby the INDIVIDUAL is recognised, otherwise there will never be democracy.<br />
You seem a very trusting old man Mr Robin but here lies the crux of the problem, you are not to be so trusting towards government bodies, corporate conglomerates and the likes of politicians. Patriotism might be where you stand and it may be fitting at your time of life, it’s quite understandable too. Without being facetious you are over the hill now and coming down, from what i have read. Anything for a quite life seems to be the order of the day for you. But you fail to realise, what we do today, will be the future of the children of tomorrow. Carl Marx made a very significant statement when he said the proletariats should unite, this much is true as without the working class buying into the system it would most surely tumble like a stack of cards. This is no mean feat as such a move would take a tremendous amount of courage on the part of the individual, to drop all conformities and literally stand alone would be akin to walking in the footsteps of a Jesus or Gautama the Buddha.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I haven&#8217;t heard anything further from the census people either! &#8211; no false-enforcement officers have been knocking yet. Perhaps they realise how much money they&#8217;re wasting on them as they&#8217;ve worked out how costly it&#8217;s becomming to try and fine people who do not consent?</p>
<p>I certainly won&#8217;t be letting my guard down on this however. I don&#8217;t trust them not to try and lure us into a false sense of security by dropping some silence on us. They apparently will be calling between now and September. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been told of more people than I can count not filling out their census. Can the stats be right? I think it must be more people refusing than they tell us? Why would they want us to think a smaller percentage of the population haven&#8217;t done it? So that we feel like we&#8217;re more alone than we actually are&#8230;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Finally had the census drones round. I was out but we had a painter in who is a good friend of mine and he fobbed them off over the intercom saying it wasn&#8217;t his business to deal with them and he was right. They asked if they could come in to leave a letter to which he said put it through the stair door post box. A couple of minutes later they buzzed the upstairs neighbour, a frail woman in her nineties who shouldn&#8217;t be disturbed unnecessarily, and she let them in. (I wonder if there is an offence of gaining entry to a property by deception?). They must need to put their letters in the flat concerned to count. So I now have this letter threatening prosecution, £1000 fine etc. If the Registrar General for Scotland doesn&#8217;t hear within seven days that a completed return has been received then he will arrange to have me interviewed under caution. The case details will then sent to the Procurator Fiscal to consider criminal proceedings against me. Now this is a bit strong considering I&#8217;ve had no reminder letters or anyone round to even see if I had received the forms! There is no contact details on the letter to get the forms even if I wanted them. The letter was addressed to my surname, which I presume they got from the intercom, but no property address. So how do they know that is the correct person they are aiming the threat at. That name on the buzzer could be the previous tenant! That&#8217;s the thing that underlines to me it is another scare tactic and has no legality. Anyway they are going to have trouble interviewing me any time soon as I&#8217;m about to go on holiday and then I&#8217;ll be back to the oil rig I work on. Good luck to them!</p>

`Hello,census, they both flash ID&#8217;s&#8230;.are you the occupier? No, they are away I lie. Do you know when they will be back&#8230;yes&#8230;..when?&#8230;..not telling you. And your name sir? Not telling you&#8230;.I require your name sir&#8230;.and your usual place of residence&#8230;.and why would that be exactly?&#8230;.to ascertain that you are not the occupier here and that you have yourself completed your census&#8230;.have you sir, completed your census? By what right do you have the authority to hold me at this door and ask such questions? We have every right, by law sir, it comes with the job. Really! I doubt a police officer has such rights as you. If you refuse to answer my questions then this conversation has been recorded in writing by my colleague here and you will face prosecution&#8230;.sir.<br />
Is that right&#8230;and who am I exactly?&#8230;.a blank look/response. Go away&#8230;I close the door and note them still standing there, totally silent. I wait, getting ever more irate as a full 90sec go by. I open the door&#8230;.I asked you to leave these premises&#8230;please go&#8230;now. We&#8217;ll leave when we are good and ready sir, she says, filling in some slip or other. You will leave now says I, or I shall be forced to call the police to evict you. Now that I would like to see sir she grins as she throws said slip onto the hall carpet. Good evening to you sir, as they turn &amp; walk away. Excuse me&#8230;.can I have your names please? They ignore&#8230;.excuse me! We showed our ID&#8217;s already, so tough, the other one shouts back at me.</p>
<p>Nasty, arrogant and in the wrong by any standards of decency me thinks?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an Aussie, but over here they have selected me to be in an &#8220;Australian health survey&#8221;. Naturally, I do not want to give out my private information to a deceitful corporation which has been involved in warmongering, terrorism and vote-fixing, amongst a host of other evils (especially if this corporation tries to force my compliance, rather than requesting or offering monetary compensation for it). However, I have read there is a $110/day fine for non-compliance, so I want to be very careful with my response (if any).</p>
<p>I received a letter to &#8220;the resident&#8221; in my mail the other day with the ABS (Aussie Bureau Stats) letterhead on the front, but returned it, as it was not addressed to me (my name is not &#8220;the resident&#8221;). However, a woman who I thought to be from the government has been stalking me outside my house on several occasions. I successfully avoided her the first two or three times by not answering her knocks, but she finally caught me as I was leaving my home and gave me a letter &#8211; &#8220;Dear Resident&#8221;.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t consent to taking part in this survey, but neither do I want to contract with these people by advising them of my full name if I phone them, or send them a notice opting out. I did accidentally give the woman my work number as she asked for it (and my first name).</p>
<p>What should my next move be? Should I wait for the ABS to respond to my non-communication (either by work call or home visit), or should I take the offensive and try to send them a letter with a substantial participation fee attached (conditional acceptance?), a religious reason for not taking the survey or try to use the Australian Census and Statistics Act 1905 to deny my obligation to participate?</p>
<p>Any honest advice would be well appreciated. Please help!</p>

<p>The organisers of this farce can&#8217;t possibly take all of us to court, and even if it were 100% certain that I&#8217;d be prosecuted for non-compliance, I would still rather face that day court for standing up for what I believe in, than face myself in the mirror for the rest of my life for co-operating with a census being run by torturers and unconvicted war criminals.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Rachel &#8211; I totally agree!!</p>
<p>Dee &#8211; I am not familiar with this Health Survey but it sounds awful!! I don&#8217;t doubt they may soon try this direct approach here in the UK. I know that Australian common law is based on English common law &#8211; even if Acts exist that are supposed to have abolished this (an act cannot abolish a treaty!) &#8211; but I am probably very ignorant on the law as it stands in your part of the world.<br />
The census act that we are opposing in the UK only becomes valid if the human being consents to it. It is not something they can force, whatever they say. So, if I were you I would do some research on this &#8220;Health Survey&#8221; because if ABS say it is compulsory (and threaten a fine for not complying) then they must show how it becomes compulsory (i.e. a bill must have been passed in order to make it so). Just because a Bill exists it doesn&#8217;t mean it is compulsory. I would start by researching the Health Survey; when did this come in, what bill was passed, what does it say, etc. Then look into the Australian Human Rights (I think this is the same as the UK&#8217;s Human Rights, because under the UN we drafted the universal declaration of human rights). The Health Survey probably contradicts it when held up against the Human Rights, invading your privacy/freedom, right to a fair trial (i.e. on the spot fines are illegal. You cannot be fined under common law without a fair trial and conviction). I&#8217;m sorry I couldn&#8217;t be any more help. Good luck to you!</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks very much Nicola from SE. I received a letter today in the post addressed to me &#8211; first name only, as that&#8217;s all I gave.</p>
<p>It claims they (the Australian Bureau of Stats) are requesting the information from me at present, but if the Australian Statistician (head of ABS) directs me in writing to provide the information, I am legally obliged to do so (under the Census and Statistics Act 1905).</p>
<p>I am considering sending an offer of contract to the Australian Statistician to provide exactly what they want for $1million. Then he can refuse my contract (by ignoring), or if he directs me in writing to provide my information, he is accepting the contract.</p>
<p>Does this sound like a plan that may work?</p>
