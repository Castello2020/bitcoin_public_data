Can’t we all just get along?
Article by Ethan
The ‘royal the’ and the devolution of spirituality, religion, theology and atheism.
It is absolutely essential in life to understand language and the criticality of communication. To quote my father, the infamous blues musician Jimmy Midnight, “Anyone who can learn to speak is intelligent.” And it’s true. In fact the most complicated thing most people learn to do is speak. Learning a language is incredibly difficult. Communication is intensely nuanced and complex. Effectively speaking is one aspect of communicating and effective comprehension is another. Effectively transmitting and receiving messages is incredibly difficult because the slightest moderations can have huge effects and outcomes.
The word ‘the’ is a small thing, three little letters which sometimes can be left out without impeding the intended meaning, but its inclusion can change everything, entirely. The significance of which is perhaps most easily recognizable and best explored when compared to its alternatives and further when its roots are etymologically elaborated on. The ultimate way to explain exactly what the means is through the most well read sentence in history.
“In the beginning god created the heaven and earth.” Genesis 1:1
That is the first sentence from the book of Genesis in the Bible. ‘The’ in this sentence implies that there is no other. There is no other place in time or space and there is no alternative in any way, that there is only the beginning and if you believe otherwise you are contrary to all things good and sacred. However this quite possibly is the greatest misusage of ‘the’, the biggest mistranslation there has ever been in the last 2,500 years, since Genesis first was written. ‘The’ was possibly originally this. The sentence might have more accurately originally read ‘in this beginning…’
Now that would have changed everything. What if monotheists accepted this instead of only the? They certainly would be less close-minded and practice more openness with others lifestyles and ideas. Perhaps they might understand they were not born god’s people, but by being compassionate might become god’s people. ‘This’ in exchange for ‘the’ would mean all the difference in the world. No matter how different monotheists claim to be from one another they are the same in their ardent belief that they alone are correct.
‘The’ is monotheistic and says no whereas ‘this’ is open and says yes. The etymology of ‘the’ is actually derived from the word for god which is the same as to be. El is the original Hebrew word for god. And all the desert gods of Judaism, Christianity and Islam all claim something to the effect that “I am that I am.” They all claim to be the one and only, to be being itself and the complete total ‘the.’ Elohim is the plural form of El, meaning god, Allah is possibly derived from the same root, only the feminine. Al means ‘the’ in Arabic.
“I am that I am.” ~Exodus 3:14
The ‘royal the’ as I call the monotheistic the, has devilish effects. It induces false pride, being proud of being born a certain way for instance as opposed to being proud of accomplishments since being born. It creates the ‘us and them’ mentality that has driven Israel to build walls and treat Palestinians like they were criminals on a 21st century reservation, which has convinced Muslims to react violently to silly D-movie depictions of Muhammad made only to incite their monotheistic ardent reaction. The ‘royal the’ has been behind every war there has ever been in the form of religious and national jingoism. The ‘royal the’ leads to the certainty one is among the chosen people, the leads to fighting everybody who do not behave or believe as you do. Jews, Christians, Muslims and even atheists all have ardency in common. ‘The’ is absolute and definitive, while ‘this’ offers room, the openness and forgiveness of god.
After 38 years on planet earth I think I have finally found out who in fact are god’s chosen people. I deduced as much by observing those who claim to be god’s chosen, those who claim to have the only true word of god and then comparing them to the essence of the word of god. Everyone who claims to be god’s chosen monotheist acts repugnantly towards others, they don’t consider alternative ideas, they kill and maim and fight slaughter in god’s name. Monotheists are not god’s chosen people. God’s chosen people do not kill and maim, for god or anything. Institutions got you tricked if you believe otherwise.
God’s chosen people are over here, refusing to kill each other with the completely comforting knowledge that god is in everyone, not in one form, but billions of forms and that god does not need people to enforce her dogma. The more monotheistic people are the less chance we all have to live together. The world needs more ‘this’ and less ‘the.’

There are also many people that believe the universe is God. Therefore pantheism should entail no more than that.
Atheism is the position that there is no such God, and should entail no more than that unless the atheist believes there is no God. Therefore atheism is not the belief that theism is false.
The above are primary “belief systems”, and should come under the same polytheistic umbrella: Polytheism – worshipping or believing in more than one god. Not only are there religious gods there are many other types of gods crossing the belief systems diluting any notion of there being a clear and distinct universal truth. These other gods are the sub belief systems, and, to name a few, may include: patriotism, socialism, liberalism, communism, capitalism, conservatism, spiritualism, nationalism, globalism and materialism.
The belief system is the manipulating control that enslaves. It breeds the bigot that is the egotist slave believing only the controller.
Couple this egotist and controller and we have the recipe for disinformation that keeps the truth hidden. Result of which is lies, hatred and harm. Merge egotism and free choice to speak and we have inflated sense of self-importance or superiority, entirely without skepticism or humility. Result of which we have murder, mayhem and utter chaos.
We can only speak or write by our own “free choice”, which shouldn’t be confused as “free speech”. If real free speech were allowed, we would all be living in freedom and utopia.
It may not be overt spite and hate, but nevertheless an egotistical intent has no proper principles of allowance. It always causes a negative backlash and is harmfulness. Mock, hate and cause harm to get your voice heard – it is still free choice to speak. We should, without fear, strive to impart the truth with accord to others’ feelings and actions. Altruistic concern or regard for the needs of others, entirely without ulterior motive. It may not be open peace and love, but nevertheless the altruistic intent has good principles of allowance. Be a balance between belief and disbelief and impart information about it – not for or against it. It will cause only harmlessness and shows others the truth can be found without confrontation or conflict of interest.

It matters not if he is monotheist or polytheist, he immagines that there is a supreme force and in some cases he can appeal to this supreme force. Jews, Christian, and Muslims all believe in the same supreme force, but in different ways, which brings them into conflict. The original conspirators of the universal God, termed him “El Supremo”, this was a vivid immagination that there was just one supreme God. This could well have been a bunch of drunken sheep farmers living in the Middle East, who originated the concept. Others were incited to follow the cult of El Supremo and these followers were individualy “one who strives with God”, or in their language “y’israel”. In their immagination they all became the people of El Supremo and thought of themselves as superior to those who did not believe in their concept. They were ridiculed and picked on and so another drunken sheep farmer claimed one day El Supremo will send us a saviour, and so came Jesus the annointed one, or Christ. Who changed the original beliefs of the drunken sheep farmers and set in motion another cult. Meanwhile down in Arabia a chap called Mohammad decided to promulgate his version of El Supremo and whats what, these became the Muslims. Throw in a few far fetched stories here and there and get a bunch of enthralled followers hanging on to every word, to join the cult, and thats what it’s all about
I got drunk last night and immagined some one called “New El Supremo”, who gave me a whole new set of rules to obey. I am looking for followers who will be the chosen ones of New El Supremo. A monkey and a fish have told me to get stuffed, so I was wondering, if there are any gullable humans out there? If you send me £300 I will give you the new rules and a membership card clearly stating that you have been chosen to be a superior human being. That you have got a given right to rule the world and tell all others what to do. If they refuse to obey, New El Supremo will strike them down, with a little help from the members and an automatic rifle. If you give me an extra £200, I will make you a Priest of New El Supremo, you will get a white gown and some fancy slippers. Sorry money is not refundable, but the slippers are guaranteed for two weeks.
