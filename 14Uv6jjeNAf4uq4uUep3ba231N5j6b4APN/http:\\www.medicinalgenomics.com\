Bioanalysis. 2014 Jun;6(11):1471-1485         Authors:  Gandhi AS, Zhu M, Pang S, Wohlfarth A, Scheidweiler KB, Huestis MA         Abstract         Background: Since 2009, scheduling legislation of synthetic cannabinoids prompted new compound emergence to circumvent legal restrictions. 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-(1-pentyl-indol-3-yl)methanone (RCS-4) is a potent cannabinoid receptor agonist sold in herbal smoking blends. Absence of parent synthetic cannabinoids in urine suggests the importance of metabolite identification for detecting RCS-4 consumption in clinical and forensic investigations. Materials &amp; methods &amp; Results: With 1 h human hepatocyte incubation and TOF high-resolution MS, we identified 18 RCS-4 metabolites, many not yet reported. Most metabolites were hydroxylated with or without demethylation, carboxylation and dealkylation followed by glucuronidation. One additional sulfated metabolite was also observed. O-demethylation was the most common biotransformation and generated the major metabolite. Conclusion: For the first time, we present a metabolic scheme of RCS-4 obtained from human hepatocytes, including Phase I and II metabolites. Metabolite structural information and associated high-resolution mass spectra can be employed for developing clinical and forensic laboratory RCS-4 urine screening methods.

Hippocampus. 2014 Jul 18;         Authors:  Szabó GG, Papp OI, Máté Z, Szabó G, Hájos N         Abstract         A subpopulation of GABAergic cells in cortical structures expresses CB1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1 ) on their axon terminals. In order to understand the function of these interneurons in information processing, it is necessary to uncover how they are embedded into neuronal circuits. Therefore, the proportion of GABAergic terminals expressing CB1 and the morphological and electrophysiological properties of CB1 -immunoreactive interneurons should be revealed. We investigated the ratio and the origin of CB1 -expressing inhibitory boutons in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Using immunocytochemical techniques, we estimated that approximately 40 % of GABAergic axon terminals in different layers of CA3 also expressed CB1 . To identify the inhibitory cell types expressing CB1 in this region, we recorded and intracellularly-labeled interneurons in hippocampal slices. CB1 -expressing interneurons showed distinct axonal arborization, and were classified as basket cells, mossy-fiber-associated cells, dendritic-layer-innervating cells or perforant-path-associated cells. In each morphological category, a substantial variability in axonal projection was observed. In contrast to the diverse morphology, the active and passive membrane properties were found to be rather similar. Using paired recordings, we found that pyramidal cells displayed large and fast unitary postsynaptic currents in response to activating basket and mossy-fiber-associated cells, while they showed slower and smaller synaptic events in pairs originating from interneurons that innervate the dendritic layer, which may be due to dendritic filtering. In addition, CB1 activation significantly reduced the amplitude of the postsynaptic currents in each cell pair tested. Our data suggest that CB1 -expressing interneurons with different axonal projections have comparable physiological characteristics, contributing to a similar proportion of GABAergic inputs along the somato-dendritic axis of CA3 pyramidal cells. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

All attempts to cyclize the (S)-proline derivatives with a basic pyrrolidine N-atom via [3 + 2] cycloaddition, aziridination, or bromolactamization failed.

J Neurosci Res. 2014 Jul 16;         Authors:  Fishbein-Kaminietsky M, Gafni M, Sarne Y         Abstract         In our previous studies, we found that a single ultralow dose of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; 0.002 mg/kg, three to four orders of magnitude lower than the conventional doses) protects the brain from different insults that cause cognitive deficits. Because various insults may trigger a neuroinflammatory response that leads to secondary damage to the brain, the current study tested whether this extremely low dose of THC could protect the brain from inflammation-induced cognitive deficits. Mice received a single injection of THC (0.002 mg/kg) 48 hr before or 1-7 days after treatment with lipopolysccharide (LPS; 10 mg/kg) and were examined with the object recognition test 3 weeks later. LPS caused long-lasting cognitive deficits, whereas the application of THC before or after LPS protected the mice from this LPS-induced damage. The protective effect of THC was blocked by the cannabinoid (CB) 1 receptor antagonist SR14176A but not by the CB2 receptor antagonist SR141528 and was mimicked by the CB1 agonist ACEA but not by the CB2 agonist HU308. The protective effect of THC was also blocked by pretreatment with GW9662, indicating the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. Biochemical examination of the brain revealed a long-term (at least 7 weeks) elevation of the prostaglandin-producing enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 in the hippocampus and in the frontal cortex following the injection of LPS. Pretreatment with the extremely low dose of THC tended to attenuate this elevation. Our results suggest that an ultralow dose of THC that lacks any psychotrophic activity protects the brain from neuroinflammation-induced cognitive damage and might be used as an effective drug for the treatment of neuroinflammatory conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Br J Pharmacol. 2014 Jul 9;         Authors:  Lau BK, Drew GM, Mitchell VA, Vaughan CW         Abstract         BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) play a vital role in mediating stress-induced analgesia (SIA). This analgesic effect of endocannabinoids is enhanced by pharmacological inhibition of their degradative enzymes. However, the specific actions of endocannabinoids and their degradation inhibitors are largely unknown within this pain-modulating region.         EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: In vitro electrophysiological recordings were conducted from PAG neurons in rat midbrain slices. The actions of the major endocannabinoids and their degradation inhibitors were examined on inhibitory GABAergic synaptic transmission.         KEY RESULTS: Exogenous application of the endocannabinoid, anandamide (AEA), but not 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), produced a reduction in inhibitory GABAergic transmission in PAG neurons. The AEA-induced suppression of inhibition was enhanced by the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor, URB597; while a 2-AG-induced suppression of inhibition was unmasked by the monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibitor, JZL184. In addition, application of the CB1 receptor antagonist, AM251, produced a facilitation in basal GABAergic transmission in the presence of URB597 and JZL184, which was further enhanced in the dual FAAH/MAGL inhibitor, JZL195.         CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results indicate that AEA and 2-AG act via disinhibition within the PAG; a cellular action consistent with analgesia. These actions of AEA and 2-AG are tightly regulated by their respective degradative enzymes, FAAH and MAGL. Furthermore, individual or combined inhibition of FAAH and/or MAGL enhances tonic disinhibition within the PAG. Therefore, the current findings support the therapeutic potential of FAAH and MAGL inhibitors as a novel pharmacotherapy to treat pain.

J Proteomics. 2014 Jul 18;         Authors:  Villeneuve LM, Stauch KL, Fox HS         Abstract         Many biological processes converge on the mitochondria. In such systems, where many pathways converge, manipulation of the components can produce varied and far-reaching effects. Due to the centrality of the mitochondria in many cellular pathways, we decided to investigate the brain mitochondrial proteome during early development. Using a SWATH mass spectrometry-based technique, we were able to identify vast proteomic alterations between whole brain mitochondria from rats at embryonic day 18 compared to postnatal day 7. These findings include statistically significant alterations in proteins involved in glycolysis and mitochondrial trafficking/dynamics. Additionally, bioinformatic analysis enabled the identification of HIF1A and XBP1 as upstream transcriptional regulators of many of the differentially expressed proteins. These data suggest that the cell is rearranging mitochondria to accommodate special energy demands and that cytosolic proteins exert mitochondrial effects through dynamic interactions with mitochondria. Biological Significance Although mitochondria play critical roles in many cellular pathways, our understanding of how these organelles change over time is limited. The changes occurring in mitochondria at early time points are especially important as many mitochondrial disorders produce neurological dysfunction early in life. Herein, we utilize a SWATH mass spectrometry approach to quantify proteomic alterations of rat brain mitochondria between embryonic and postnatal stages. We found this method to be highly reproducible, enabling the identification of alterations in many biochemical pathways and mitochondrial properties. This insight into the distinct changes in these biological pathways to maintain homeostasis under divergent conditions will help elucidate the pathological changes occurring in disease states.

Biochim Biophys Acta. 2014 Jul 18;         Authors:  Olszewska A, Bednarczyk P, Siemen D, Szewczyk A         Abstract         Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their metabolites can modulate several biochemical processes in the cell and thus prevent various diseases. PUFAs have a number of cellular targets, including membrane proteins. They can interact with plasma membrane and intracellular potassium channels. The goal of this work was to verify the interaction between PUFAs and the most common and intensively studied mitochondrial large conductance Ca(2+)-regulated potassium channel (mitoBKCa). For this purpose human astrocytoma U87 MG cell line were investigated using a patch-clamp technique. We analyzed the effects of arachidonic acid (AA); eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), which is a non-metabolizable analog of AA; docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The open probability (Po) of the channel did not change significantly after application of 10μM ETYA. Po increased, however, after adding 10μM AA. The application of 30μM DHA or 10μM EPA also increased the Po of the channel. Additionally, the number of open channels in the patch increased in the presence of 30μM EPA. Collectively, our results indicate that PUFAs regulate the BKCa channel from the inner mitochondrial membrane.

MGC803 cells were treated with berberine and d-limonene, alone and in combination, for 24-48 h. The inhibitory effects of these drugs on growth were determined by MTT assay. The combination index and drug reduction index were calculated with the Chou-Talalay method based on the median-effect principle. Flow cytometry and laser scanning confocal microscopy were employed to evaluate the effects of both drugs on cell-cycle perturbation and apoptosis, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential, and expression of Bcl-2 and caspase-3 in MGC803 cells. Berberine or d-limonene alone can inhibit the growth of MGC803 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Berberine and d-limonene at a combination ratio of 1:4 exhibited a synergistic effect on anti-MGC803 cells. The two drugs distinctly induced intracellular ROS generation, reduced the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm), enhanced the expression of caspase-3, and decreased the expression of Bcl-2. The combination of berberine and d-limonene showed more remarkable effects compared with drugs used singly in MGC803 cells. The combination of berberine and d-limonene exerted synergistic anticancer effects on MGC803 cells by cell-cycle arrest, ROS production, and apoptosis induction through the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway.

However, little is known about the role of Rapa in cardiac hypertrophy induced by isoproterenol and its underlying mechanism. In this study, Rapa was administrated intraperitoneally for one week after the rat model of cardiac hypertrophy induced by isoproterenol established. Rapa was demonstrated to attenuate isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy, maintain the structure integrity and functional performance of mitochondria, and upregulate genes related to fatty acid metabolism in hypertrophied hearts. To further study the implication of NF-κB in the protective role of Rapa, cardiomyocytes were pretreated with TNF-α or transfected with siRNA against NF-κB/p65 subunit. It was revealed that the upregulation of extracellular circulating proinflammatory cytokines induced by isoproterenol was able to be reversed by Rapa, which was dependent on NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, the regression of cardiac hypertrophy and maintaining energy homeostasis by Rapa in cardiomyocytes may be attributed to the inactivation of NF-κB. Our results shed new light on mechanisms underlying the protective role of Rapa against cardiac hypertrophy induced by isoproterenol, suggesting that blocking proinflammatory response by Rapa might contribute to the maintenance of energy homeostasis during the progression of cardiac hypertrophy.

Most of the functional data on these transporters are obtained from the studies performed with the protein purified from rat, eel yeast, and maize mitochondria or recombinant proteins from different sources incorporated into phospholipid vesicles (liposomes). The functional data indicate that CiC is responsible for the efflux of acetyl-CoA from the mitochondria to the cytosol in the form of citrate, the primer for fatty acid, cholesterol synthesis, and histone acetylation. Like the CiC, the citrate exported by DTC from the mitochondria to the cytosol in exchange for oxaloacetate can be cleaved by citrate lyase to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate and used for fatty acid elongation and isoprenoid synthesis. In addition to its role in fatty acid synthesis, CiC is involved in other processes such as gluconeogenesis, insulin secretion, inflammation, and cancer progression, whereas DTC is involved in the production of glycerate, nitrogen assimilation, ripening of fruits, ATP synthesis, and sustaining of respiratory flux in fruit cells. This review provides an assessment of the current understanding of CiC and DTC structural and biochemical characteristics, underlying the structure-function relationship of these carriers.

In this study, we tested the involvement of mARC in the reduction of N-oxides (amitriptyline-N-oxide, nicotinamide-N-oxide), oximes ((E)-/(Z)-2,4,6-trimethylacetophenonoxime) and a N-hydroxyamidinohydrazone (guanoxabenz). All groups are reduced by mARC proteins, and the enzymes are therefore involved in the interconversion of N-oxygenated metabolites originating from cytochrome P450s and flavin-containing monooxygenases. In addition, these structures open up further options for serving as prodrugs. Thus, with respect to these reactions, testing of candidates with N-oxygenated structures should not solely be carried out in microsomal enzyme sources but as well in mitochondria. However, differences in the reduction of oximes and N-oxides between the two isoforms, namely mARC1 and mARC2, were detectable; N-oxides are exclusively reduced by mARC1.

Herein we present a method to assess tumor mitochondrial dysfunction with three phosphorescent nanosensors, which respond to ec-, ic-, and im-O2 . Time-resolved luminescence is applied to determine the respective oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) under varying respiratory conditions. Data obtained for the OCRs and on (intra)cellular O2 gradients demonstrate that mitochondria in tumor cells are distinctly less active than those of healthy cells, resulting from restrained glucose utilization of and physical injury to the mitochondria.

To investigate the mechanism of this block, we examined the proteomic differences in the myocardial mitochondria of UT-B null and wild-type mice with nanoLC-MS/MS.Of 26 proteins clearly down-regulated in the UT-B null mice, 15 are involved in complexes I, III, IV, and V of the respiratory chain, which would strongly reduce the activity of the electron transport chain. Excess electrons from complexes I and III pass directly to O2 to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and deplete ROS-scavenging enzymes. Myocardial intracellular ROS were significantly higher in UT-B null mice than in wild-type mice (P &lt; 0.01), constituting an important cause of oxidative stress injury in the myocardia of UT-B null mice. The mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was also lower in UT-B null mice than in wild-type mice (P &lt; 0.05), causing oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction of complex V and insufficient ATP in the myocardial cells of UT-B null mice. HADHA (a trifunctional protein) and HSP60 were also down-regulated in the UT-B null myocardial mitochondria.

Our analysis identified mitochondrial changes, along with several alterations in signaling pathways, as central to the development of mature osteoclasts, while also confirming changes in pathways previously implicated in osteoclast biology.

J Alzheimers Dis. 2014 Jul 7;         Authors:  Cao C, Li Y, Liu H, Bai G, Mayl J, Lin X, Sutherland K, Nabar N, Cai J         Abstract         The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential therapeutic qualities of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) with respect to slowing or halting the hallmark characteristics of Alzheimer&#039;s disease. N2a-variant amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) cells were incubated with THC and assayed for amyloid-β (Aβ) levels at the 6-, 24-, and 48-hour time marks. THC was also tested for synergy with caffeine, in respect to the reduction of the Aβ level in N2a/AβPPswe cells. THC was also tested to determine if multiple treatments were beneficial. The MTT assay was performed to test the toxicity of THC. Thioflavin T assays and western blots were performed to test the direct anti-Aβ aggregation significance of THC. Lastly, THC was tested to determine its effects on glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and related signaling pathways. From the results, we have discovered THC to be effective at lowering Aβ levels in N2a/AβPPswe cells at extremely low concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. However, no additive effect was found by combining caffeine and THC together. We did discover that THC directly interacts with Aβ peptide, thereby inhibiting aggregation. Furthermore, THC was effective at lowering both total GSK-3β levels and phosphorylated GSK-3β in a dose-dependent manner at low concentrations. At the treatment concentrations, no toxicity was observed and the CB1 receptor was not significantly upregulated. Additionally, low doses of THC can enhance mitochondria function and does not inhibit melatonin&#039;s enhancement of mitochondria function. These sets of data strongly suggest that THC could be a potential therapeutic treatment option for Alzheimer&#039;s disease through multiple functions and pathways.

Apoptosis. 2013 Dec;18(12):1526-35         Authors:  Fonseca BM, Correia-da-Silva G, Teixeira NA         Abstract         Anandamide (AEA) belongs to an endogenous family of lipid messengers, called endocannabinoids (ECs), which exert pharmacological effects by binding to selective membrane receptors, the CB1 and CB2 receptors. Increasing evidence suggests that AEA is involved in the regulation of a variety of cell signalling pathways both in experimental models and humans. We have previously demonstrated that ECs machinery operates in decidual cells and found that AEA, the principal EC, induced apoptosis in decidual cells through CB1. Here, we investigated in rat primary decidual cells the signal transduction pathways activated upon AEA binding to CB1. We found that AEA induces a significant increase in the level of intracellular ceramide. These effects were reversed by inhibiting CB1 receptor activation with AM251. The ceramide analogue, C6-ceramide, induced a decrease in decidual cell viability and of p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Additionally, the pharmacologic inhibition of de novo ceramide biosynthesis with L-cycloserine and fumonisin B reduced the AEA-effects on cell viability and p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Furthermore, AEA and C6-ceramide induced a drop in ΔΨm, an increase in ROS production and caspase-3/-7 activation, effects partially reverted by inhibitors of ceramide synthesis and of p38 MAPK. Taken together, we showed that AEA induces a reduction in decidual cell viability by a mechanism involving CB1 activation, which results in ceramide synthesis de novo and p38 phosphorylation, followed by mitochondrial stress and ROS production, leading to apoptosis.
