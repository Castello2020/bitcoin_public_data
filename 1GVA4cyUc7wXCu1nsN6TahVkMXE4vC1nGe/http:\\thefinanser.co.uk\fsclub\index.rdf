<title>Banks need rock star coders to survive</title>

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I was having a debate the other day with two bank CEOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One runs a direct bank that is going digital and the other runs a branch based bank that is investing in digital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point in the conversation, we got into a discussion about coders and, in a surprisingly frank dialogue, both CEOs said that coders are the most critical resource for their bank today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coders make the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why Capital One has recently poached&amp;#0160;Google’s Head of Advanced Technology and Projects &lt;a href=&quot;http://recode.net/2014/07/02/capital-one-snags-googler-dan-makoski-to-lead-its-design-efforts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dan Makoski&lt;/a&gt;, whilst JPMorgan has been hiring &lt;a href=&quot;http://qz.com/207163/jpmorgan-is-poaching-talent-from-silicon-valley/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a whole host&lt;/a&gt; of Silicon Valley talent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tim-parsey/0/20b/88b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim Parsey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;– Formerly a senior vice president of design for Yahoo, Parsey, who is based in San Francisco, joined the bank five months ago. He’s head of digital customer experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linkedin.com/in/abose&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abhijit Bose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;- Bose joined JPMorgan last month as head of the firm’s data intelligence. He’s tasked with helping the firm better use customer information and habits&amp;#0160;to personalize their experiences on digital&amp;#0160;platforms like its banking apps. He was part of the founding team who helped develop Google+ (a Facebook-like social media application).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gavin Michael–&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#0160;A Ph.D. in&amp;#0160;computer science, Michael&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=757452&quot;&gt;joined&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;JPMorgan last year to run&amp;#0160;the bank’s digital focus on consumer and community banking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://newsle.com/person/claudiarichter/5913876&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claudia Richter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;–Based in San Francisco, Richter joined&amp;#0160;the bank a little over a year ago from a Silicon Valley startup called&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nexxofinancial.com/&quot;&gt;Nexxo Financial&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#0160;focused on digital payment integration. Richter is responsible for “monitoring and measuring the performance of Chase’s digital assets based on feedback and customer data.” She also has banking experience from Visa and Accenture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;strong&gt;Josh Klenert&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#0160;–Also located in San Francisco, Klenert reports to Parsey. He is involved in design—specifically, ensuring that digital applications&amp;#0160;aesthetically work&amp;#0160;across different web and mobile devices. He &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foliomag.com/2014/josh-klenert-out-huffington-post#.U2p23K1dU5Y&quot;&gt;joined&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;last month from the Huffington Post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Jamie Dimon puts it: &amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We move $10 trillion a day.&amp;#0160; We’re one of the largest payments systems in the world. We’re going to have competition from Google and Facebook and somebody else … When I go to Silicon Valley… they all want to eat our lunch. Every single one of them is going to try.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why,&amp;#0160;as will.i.am &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2012/08/30/will-i-am-stem-mars/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said recently&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#0160;“coders are the new rock stars”. &amp;#0160;Here’s Will’s take on the world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;“I think people that make apps are artists. I think that people who write code for Facebook, that’s the new Rolling Stones. Think about the Rolling Stones and the music groups of the past, they filled up stadiums. The Beatles filled up stadiums. If you take the Beatles’ songs and called them software played on hardware, that’s Facebook. Facebook is software that you play and experience on hardware. So Mark Zuckerberg, to me he ain’t nothing but freakin’ John Lennon. Jack Dorsey, he ain’t nothing but Mick Jagger. Just a whole different level, man. Just bigger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s dope, but true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coders are the new rock stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They make the difference between a mundane and rocking digital service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting that some bank folks recognise this as I had never heard such a conversation between banking people before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coders are the criticality in the future bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will differentiate the bank’s service between average and amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will deliver the difference between an engaging user experience and a brilliant experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see this today by how some coders become superstars overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Zuckerberg is a hero to many; as is Jack Dorsey; but what about Jan Koum, Evan Speigel, Sean Rad or Kevin Systrom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never heard of them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re the founders of Whatsapp, Snapchat, Tinder and Instagram respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also rock stars and billionaires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what happens with a good coder – they can transform fortunes overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the story about Tinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years old and yet the founders are made for life and act like some sort of rock star frat boy band (just look at the reports of sexism &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/81055654-0138-11e4-a938-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=uk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;around this&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if banks are going digital and they need reformation, the likelihood is that we will see a few rock star bankers who are pure coders in the not too distant future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe we’re seeing them already.&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I keep getting into debates about bitcoin and when banks should take notice of bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C’mon.&amp;#0160; If a bank hasn’t noticed bitcoin yet, then they must be a bank completely uninterested in banking strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bitcoin is important, but it’s not the be-all and end-all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it is fairly irritating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is irritating because bitcoin is being discuss as ‘legal tender’, ‘a currency’ and ‘an alternative to banking’ all over the shop, when it is none of these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend Dave Birch recently &lt;a href=&quot;%20http://thefinanser.co.uk/fsclub/2014/06/when-bitcoin-becomes-mainstream-it-will-look-just-like-real-money.html?cid=6a01053620481c970b01a3fd15d93b970b#comment-6a01053620481c970b01a3fd15d93b970b&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;that it is not ‘legal tender’ although, in Germany, some people think&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnbc.com/id/100971898#.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;it is&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virtual currency bitcoin has been recognized by the German Finance Ministry as a &amp;quot;unit of account&amp;quot;, meaning it is can be used for tax and trading purposes in the country.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bitcoin is not classified as e-money or a foreign currency, the Finance Ministry said in a statement, but is rather a financial instrument under German banking rules. It is more akin to &amp;quot;private money&amp;quot; that can be used in &amp;quot;multilateral clearing circles&amp;quot;, the Ministry said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;We should have competition in the production of money. I have long been a proponent of Friedrich August von Hayek scheme to denationalize money. Bitcoins are a first step in this direction,&amp;quot; said Frank Schaeffler, a member of the German parliament&amp;#39;s Finance Committee, who has pushed for legal classification of bitcoins.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, bitcoin is a multifaceted thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a form of value store, a form of money, a form of trade and a form of investment instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, it is a tradable commodity, like stocks and shares. Useful, but just a representation of value for as long as it has volumes of trading and liquidity.&amp;#0160; Should that volume of trading and liquidity disappear, then so will bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what people thought when bitcoins were hacked at MTGox, with the exchange bankrupting itself and, in so doing, taking a large portion of monies from its investor community (of which I was one!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Marc Andreessen, the founder of Netscape and massively influential Silicon Valley VC says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legendary entrepreneur Marc Andreessen &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pmarca&quot;&gt;@pmarca&lt;/a&gt; tells &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BeckyQuick&quot;&gt;@beckyquick&lt;/a&gt; why he is defending &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&quot;&gt;#bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/hDcQQVqoj5&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/hDcQQVqoj5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/statuses/438290861764276224&quot;&gt;February 25, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;script charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then he would say that, as he’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304026304579453501821936252&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;invested millions in it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, a virtual exchange collapses but bitcoin goes onwards and upwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s now accepted by Expedia for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-27810008&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hotel bookings&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other firms like Dell now &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/dell/10980089/Dell-jumps-on-the-Bitcoin-bandwagon.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;adopting its usage.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, most notably, Richard Branson has been making a big deal about bitcoin.&amp;#0160; First, accepting bitcoins for payments for flights on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coindesk.com/winklevoss-twins-buy-virgin-galactic-tickets-bitcoin/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Virgin Galactic&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;and, more recently, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/perianneboring/2014/05/13/bitpay-is-headed-to-the-moon-and-richard-branson-is-on-the-spaceship/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;investing in BitPay&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;during its recent $30 million Series A funding round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add to all this the excitement of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phplight.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Bitcoin_Ecosystem_1170.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the community itself&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/.a/6a01053620481c970b01a3fd362eb1970b-popup&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open( this.href, &amp;#39;_blank&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&amp;#39; ); return false&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Bitcoin_Ecosystem_1170&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a01053620481c970b01a3fd362eb1970b img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/.a/6a01053620481c970b01a3fd362eb1970b-650wi&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot; title=&quot;Bitcoin_Ecosystem_1170&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... and everyone thinks this cryptocurrency will fly high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason being that people are building the ecosystem around this digital value exchange as we speak. &amp;#0160;In fact, many compare bitcoin today to the internet twenty years ago. &amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donald Norman said this at the Financial Services Club &lt;a href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/fsclub/2012/09/you-should-take-bitcoin-seriously.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;two years ago&lt;/a&gt;, and said this to &lt;em&gt;American Banker&lt;/em&gt; this week ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid=&quot;clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000&quot; codebase=&quot;http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,47,0&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; id=&quot;flashObj&quot; width=&quot;700&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&amp;amp;isUI=1&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;bgcolor&quot; value=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;flashVars&quot; value=&quot;videoId=3675951552001&amp;amp;playerID=1617937663001&amp;amp;playerKey=AQ~~,AAABL_0MjYk~,PhQ65HAVDuaEAihLfqFJTuAr46111yns&amp;amp;domain=embed&amp;amp;dynamicStreaming=true&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;base&quot; value=&quot;http://admin.brightcove.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;seamlesstabbing&quot; value=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;swLiveConnect&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowScriptAccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot; /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... it&amp;#39;s a fledgling thing, but starting to grow and prosper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it will just crash and burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I guarantee it will crash and burn unless it is regulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a twitterfest I had recently with a couple of &lt;a href=&quot;https://storify.com/mondatoportal/mondato-twitter-chat-on-bitcoinsfuture&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;other guys&lt;/a&gt;, where my core point was that &lt;em&gt;money without government, &lt;/em&gt;is irrational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money was invented by governments to govern.&amp;#0160; That is the point of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the idea that you can have a new form of ecosystem off the regulatory network just does not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments will always focus upon markets that are dark, because that’s where terrorism, money launderers, criminals and paedophiles hang out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a dark net with a dark currency, governments will do all they can to close them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So bitcoin will only ever succeed if it is regulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And regulations are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/news/bitlicense-regulations-forked-github-bitcoin-community/2014/07/19&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;starting to happen:&amp;#0160;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On July 17, New York became the first state to attempt to regulate Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency (referred to as virtual currency in the proposal). New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Superintendent Ben Lawsky announced the so-called&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/news/ben-lawsky-nydfs-reveal-proposed-bitlicense-regulations/2014/07/17&quot;&gt;BitLicense proposal&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;on Reddit. While some in the Bitcoin community welcome regulation as a validation of Bitcoin’s right to exist, the majority oppose it as the first roots of centralization.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a number of reactions to this news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cointelegraph.com/news/112104/bitcoin-at-a-crossroads-tackling-the-bitlicense&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coin Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/a&gt;reports that the “&lt;em&gt;standardization (the BitLicense) promote in consumer protection, financial transparency, and technical security across various service providers should lead to greater levels of trust from consumers and the broader business community”; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;whilst&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/news/satoshi-nakamoto-criminal-proposed-bitlicense-regulations/2014/07/18&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cryptocoins News &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;says that &lt;em&gt;“the saddest part of these new regulations is that they could&amp;#0160;actually&amp;#0160;turn&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/tag/satoshi-nakamoto&quot;&gt;Satoshi Nakamoto&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;into a criminal after a period of 45 days if he does&amp;#0160;not decide to register his creation of the Bitcoin protocol with Ben Lawsky and the New York Department of Financial Services.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep.&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much as the community might luck to buck the government (with a ‘b’ and an ‘f’), the government is going to buck them (repeat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a point reinforced this week in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@brettking/bitcoins-failed-coup-of-wall-street-621bd309b18&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brett King&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; post on same subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where bitcoin ends up is in a newly regulated market structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This market structure will operate at three levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legitimising bitcoins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trading bitcoins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storing bitcoins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already have a structure for generating bitcoins based upon mining, the blockchain and the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then need a structure for trading bitcoins that is more reliable than the MTGox version we saw crash and burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means governments will work on issuing some form of bitcoin licensing for trade purposes, such as the New York regulations drafted this month.&amp;#0160; I almost see it as a license like the one under the Payment Services Directive for becoming a ‘payment institution’ or the emoney licence being used by Facebook to start processing payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a digital value exchange license in this case, or a virtual currency license if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, storing bitcoins will be the choice of the individual but, for the safest store, they’ll probably put them in the bank as banks have guarantees as safe stores (that’s why they have licences).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So from being the bad boy in the wild west of the net, bitcoins and Bitcoin (the unit of account and the infrastructure) moves into the mainstream model of value exchange as per stocks, shares, money and other stores of value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great article by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10559175/How-to-get-your-virtual-hands-on-some-bitcoins.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Matthew Sparkes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Telegraph &lt;/em&gt;if you’re wondering how bitcoin works in terms of buying some …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you can buy any coins you must create a “wallet” to store them. This is essentially a computer file which holds digital money. You can do this by installing the&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bitcoin.org/en/download&quot;&gt;bitcoin client&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the software which powers the currency. But be warned: if your computer is hit by hackers or a virus, or you simply misplace your files, you may lose your bitcoins. The data on your computer is what has value and once it’s gone, it’s gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative is to use an online wallet such as&amp;#0160;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blockchain.info/&quot;&gt;blockchain.info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#0160;where this data is stored in the cloud. This is easier to setup, but you will be trusting your money to a third party.&amp;#0160;Blockchain.info&amp;#0160;has been one of the larger and more reliable sites until now, but there are no gaurantees when using a decentralised, unregulated currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have a wallet you’ll see an address which looks something like this:&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blockchain.info/address/1GVA4cyUc7wXCu1nsN6TahVkMXE4vC1nGe&quot;&gt;1GVA4cyUc7wXCu1nsN6TahVkMXE4vC1nGe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This is safe to distribute and is what people would use to send you money - think of it like an account number and sort code, rather than your secret PIN. As you can see from that link, all bitcoin wallets are public. It&amp;#39;s often described as an anonymous currency but this is far from the truth. Essentially, your &amp;quot;bank statements&amp;quot; are public, but nobody knows whose they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a wallet, you can get some coins. One of the easiest options at the moment is&amp;#0160;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bittylicious.com/&quot;&gt;Bittylicious&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, whose simplicity almost makes up for its name. Rather than selling bitcoins directly, this exchange puts sellers in touch with buyers. But all of that is largely invisible to buyers - you only need to interact with the site and don’t even need to know who you&amp;#39;re buying from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter how many bitcoins you want to buy and the address you want them sent to (as above, but use yours, not mine - check it carefully, then check again), pay for them by transferring money with online banking and wait. If you’re already using Barclays’ clever Pingit app then you can also use this to pay. If you want to buy large amounts you&amp;#39;ll need to verify your identity but for smaller volumes there&amp;#39;s no need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site promises that transactions will complete in two hours, or it will refund your money. It also supports rival but similar crypto-currencies FeatherCoins and Litecoins. There are dozens of bitcoin competitors although none have gained the same amount of traction. I tried it this week and my 0.01BTC came through within minutes at a cost of £5.60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc Warne, the founder of Bittylicious, admits that his service is not always the cheapest, but avoids the costly and complex international bank transfers which some services demand, and which can make buying small amounts prohibitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people do use it to invest, they’ve heard about it and they think it’s a good idea and it’s going to go up. A fair amount of people, myself included, do use it for real things. I pay my accountant with it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think, long-term, definitely it’ll go up. Short-term, it could go in any direction. I think you must be long-term because it’s just that much more volatile, but I genuinely think it’s got a future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nobody knows what&amp;#39;s next when it comes to bitcoins, that’s the joy of it. The way it works is quite weird, although fundamentally it&amp;#39;s digital cash and everyone can understand that,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average purchase made through the site is £100, but since launching nine months ago he has seen £1.5m pass through. Currently it sells around £20,000 of bitcoins each day, although this can fluctuate wildly when it makes headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody can say for sure what will happen to bitcoin in the future: it could be accepted as the de facto online payment system for the internet, or it could fade away into an obscure chapter of digital history. But it&amp;#39;ll be fun to watch in either case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does bitcoin have a future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22.51%&amp;#0160; Yes, it will replace the pound&amp;#0160; (1,197 votes)&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;49.44%&amp;#0160; Yes, but it will only ever be an online niche&amp;#0160; (2,629 votes)&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;28% No, it&amp;#39;s just a fad&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160; (1,492 votes)&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Votes:&amp;#0160;5,318&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;My good friend Jim Marous who recently joined &lt;em&gt;T&lt;a href=&quot;http://thefinancialbrand.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he Financial Brand&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;asked me to make a comment about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bain.com/Images/BAIN_BRIEF_Building_the_retail_bank_of_the_future.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this new report&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;from Bain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a bad report and is a slight improvement on this one from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/Business_Technology/The_rise_of_the_digital_bank?cid=DigitalEdge-eml-alt-mip-mck-oth-1407&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;McKinsey&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;on &lt;em&gt;The Rise of the Digital Bank,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;but it’s not as strong as what you will hear from leading digital innovators.&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Jim kindly asked Brett King and I to provide input on the report, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://thefinancialbrand.com/41107/digital-bank-of-future-report-2014/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&amp;#39;s the result&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#0160;Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Financial Institutions Unprepared For Digital Future&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;July 21, 2014&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no question that banking is quickly becoming a digital business, supported by enhanced online and mobile offerings from traditional financial institutions as well as new market entrants. But how ready is the banking and credit union community for this transformation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Jim Marous&lt;/strong&gt;, Editor, Retail Banking Strategies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a Bain &amp;amp; Company report entitled, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bain.com/publications/articles/building-the-retail-bank-of-the-future.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Building the Retail Bank of the Future&lt;/a&gt;,” more than half of the 78 global financial institutions benchmarked lag substantially in the ability to create the “bank of the future” experience that customers already expect – integrated, on demand, real-time banking&amp;#0160;services via a combination of digital and physical assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bain found that while&amp;#0160;many banks have focused their digital investments on&amp;#0160;digitizing transactions that reduce brick and mortar cost, less has been&amp;#0160;done&amp;#0160;to make consumers’&amp;#0160;banking&amp;#0160;experience&amp;#0160;more convenient, easy and engaging through a seamless integration of channels. &amp;#0160;While consumers have definitely appreciated digital innovations such as&amp;#0160;remote deposit capture, remote bill pay&amp;#0160;and other&amp;#0160;simplified&amp;#0160;transactions delivered through a mobile app, winning&amp;#0160;the digital consumer in the future will require more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The biggest threat the digital pure plays present to incumbents is that they don’t have hang ups about cannibalizing branch networks and how the requisite shift in revenue delivery will compromise the business case for branches,” stated author, speaker and&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moven.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Moven&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;CEO/Founder&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linkedin.com/in/brettking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brett King&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;in an interview with The Financial Brand. “In fact, while lower acquisition costs and lower distribution costs are key metrics for neo-banks and P2P lenders, their ability to generate business purely through digital is the biggest single threat to the existing model of retail financial services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of not being able to provide the digital capabilities&amp;#0160;customers desire is difficulty in defending against more nimble, low-cost, digital-only entrants that are increasingly grabbing market share. The cost of losing these digital natives can be high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact,&amp;#0160;in a survey of&amp;#0160;77,000 banking consumers, Bain found that&amp;#0160;consumers&amp;#0160;who conduct the most digital transactions also have the greatest satisfaction with their banks (as measured by Net Promoter Score) and do more business with them as well. As shown below, customer loyalty scores were nearly three times higher for digitally-active customers than for less digital counterparts. There was also a correlation between digital channel use and affluence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;nps&quot; height=&quot;447&quot; src=&quot;http://thefinancialbrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/nps.png&quot; width=&quot;543&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;ad-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/hip_pocket_2014_july_b&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Generate More Loans With Hip Pocket&quot; src=&quot;http://thefinancialbrand.com/wp-content/uploads/rbs/hip_pocket_2014_july_b.gif&quot; title=&quot;Generate More Loans With Hip Pocket&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Integrating Digital With Physical&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While digital channel use will increase in the future,&amp;#0160;they&amp;#0160;will not fully replace physical channels, according to Bain. The number of branches will continue to decrease and the role and structure of branches will continue to evolve. Branch networks may be organized around a ‘hub and spoke’ configuration, with far fewer full service flagship&amp;#0160;branches being&amp;#0160;surrounded by smaller&amp;#0160;branches with limited functionality. These branches could&amp;#0160;be supplemented by video call center technology that links customers with more complex needs to remote experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.linkedin.com/in/cmskinner&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chris Skinner&lt;/a&gt;, Chairman of the&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fsclub.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Financial Services Club&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;and author of the book,&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Bank-Strategies-Launch-Become/dp/9814516465/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1405895060&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=digital+bank&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Digital Bank&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;told The Financial Brand, “A digital bank has to be built with a digital base. Interacting with the bank is then through various form factors – human, machine, device and chip. It is not about adding a new channel – mobile, tablet, social, app – to the old ones … that’s the wrong thinking. Digital infrastructure (the web) must be at the core.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what Bain refers to as Digical&lt;sup&gt;SM&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#0160;(digital+physical) transformation, some leading&amp;#0160;banks are transforming their core business – including products, channels, back office technology and organization – funded by the reduction in&amp;#0160;legacy costs and systems. Some&amp;#0160;banks have gone farther to reinvent the customer experience and provide new ways to engage and add value to customers, sometimes partnering with technology start-ups to accelerate innovation and create new propositions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skinner agrees that organizations&amp;#0160;should fund their reinvention of core infrastructure to be web-based through freezing legacy upgrades. According to Skinner, “The savings per annum in upgrades and maintenance should then be used to fund moving the data to the cloud and creating APIs and apps that leverage that cloud-based data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Digital Pure Play Competition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for traditional financial institutions to provide better digital banking is no longer an option as low-cost digital-only entrants are taking market share. Anthemis Group, an investment and advisory firm for digital financial services companies, tracks 3,000 such companies worldwide. The impact in financial services is&amp;#0160;similar to what happened in industries like music, retailing, and travel. Bain&amp;#0160;clustered the digital pure play competition into three groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aggregators&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#0160;redefine the interface between traditional banks and consumers, providing added value while squeezing profit margins. Moneysupermarket, Mint and CHECK24 bring&amp;#0160;transparency to&amp;#0160;pricing and product features, and could&amp;#0160;become a&amp;#0160;primary interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;use existing technology platforms, but leverage innovative sales and service platforms. Square, Paypal, Starbucks and many of the players in payments&amp;#0160;take what was once considered ‘marginal’ business away from banks, potentially reducing banks’ function to simply processing transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disruptors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;such as Simple, Moven, Serve&amp;#0160;and several players overseas&amp;#0160;provide alternative products and services, leveraging mobile to provide&amp;#0160;a better overall experience. Starting with a mobile-first perspective, they threaten banks’ economics in market niches that prefer a digital platform (see correlation between sales, loyalty and affluence above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making the infiltration of traditional banking strongholds easier for digital pure play competitors is the reality that shopping for financial services now begins begins online, that the power of bricks and mortar is crumbling, that the trust in traditional banks has been reduced and that traditional banks have been slow to respond to the needs of the digital consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Imperatives for Building a Stronger Bank&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bain’s research provided&amp;#0160;five imperatives that are essential for building a strong ‘bank of the future.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Combine digital and physical capabilities for a differentiated customer experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of&amp;#0160;deploying technology to replicate previous processes in an online or digital world (usually to reduce costs),&amp;#0160;customer-centric&amp;#0160;digital banks combine the best&amp;#0160;digital and physical assets to make consumers’ banking lives easier, more convenient and more engaging. In Chris Skinner’s words, “The bank does not become digital through technology. People are what will make the digital bank.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, in South Korea, Hana Bank has innovated around a core of “moving money.” The Hana N mobile platform serves as a full-service bank in a smartphone, working seamlessly with Hana’s branches. Customers can withdraw cash from ATMs via their smartphones, parents can send money to their children via their mobiles, and N money includes near-field payments technology that can be used to pay at many stores. There is even a platform that offers integrated money management, location-based offers and coupons, as well as the ability to borrow for larger purchases while in the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&amp;#0160;Rebuild the branch network … smaller, leaner, seamless&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With teller-assisted transactions declining at an annual rate of 10% to 15% for many institutions, optimizing the branch footprint is an imperative,&amp;#0160;with some organizations&amp;#0160;needing to shrink their branch network by as much as 30% over time. Unfortunately, for&amp;#0160;a US bank with 1,000 leased branches, the cost of&amp;#0160;closing 30% of a&amp;#0160;network might cost up to $120 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many organizations are either implementing or considering a&amp;#0160;hub-and-spoke configuration that includes centralized full-service&amp;#0160;advisory offices, smaller retail branches with limited functionality&amp;#0160;and self-service kiosks. Each&amp;#0160;of the new formats incorporate digital technologies to enhance the customer experience and provide self-service capabilities that customers increasingly expect. Some spoke formats have removed bank tellers altogether. According to Bain, 40% to 60% are adding in-branch tablets, video teller machines, smart ATMs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term ‘omnichannel’ is both misused and misunderstood as it relates to becoming a bank of the future. Chris Skinner has been&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/fsclub/2014/03/omnichannel-is-so-last-century-please-delete-it.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;outspoken in his distaste for the term&lt;/a&gt;, calling it ‘last century’ and hoping it will simply go away.&amp;#0160;“What banks need to do is put the consumer at the center of the engagement process and ensure that the experience is seamless with digital (web) at the core,” says Skinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;omnichannel_importance_and_progress&quot; height=&quot;466&quot; src=&quot;http://thefinancialbrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/omnichannel_importance_and_progress.png&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge grows more complex as banks introduce more solution specific&amp;#0160;mobile apps, or digital form factors based around communities of humans. With more diverse needs come more coordination across channels. But from the consumer’s perspective, seamless channel connection is nonnegotiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Overhaul the technology platform to simplify consumers’ lives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to build a strong solution on a weak foundation. Unfortunately, this is the case at most financial institutions that are trying to deliver a ‘bank of the future’ solution with a core processing system that is decades old. Bottom line, to deliver a differentiated, seamless experience to customers, most banks will need to make substantial improvements to their IT infrastructure to eliminate data silos, duplicative and/or incomplete customer data files and incompatible systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new infrastructure must&amp;#0160;allow different departments and functions to share a uniform 360 degree view of the customer data. This will also allow all frontline employees to see the entirety of a customer’s history with the organization. Organizations&amp;#0160;also need to implement technology that supports one-and-done processes and speeds up transactions by processing them in real time rather than in batches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately,&amp;#0160;only 60% of financial institutions benchmarked by Bain reported having IT upgrade&amp;#0160;plan with clear budgets and allocated investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Fund the transformation by halting&amp;#0160;legacy funding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change recommended to move forward does not come cheap. Institutions that are moving forward are funding change&amp;#0160;by simplifying their product lines, processes and organizational structure. They’re also selling real estate (branches),&amp;#0160;reducing staff, and streamlining operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boldest of financial organizations have gone as far as moving funding that was allocated for projects related to their legacy infrastructure to projects related to improving the new digital interface with customers. Again, the reality hits home as Bain found that only about half of the benchmark organizations&amp;#0160;fully understand the cost of digital change for their business, with less than 60&amp;#0160;percent of the benchmarked banks having a budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Reorganize to encourage innovation and change.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silos are the enemy of innovation and change. Innovations that are product, department or functionally based will deliver just a fraction of the potential benefits. According to Bain,&amp;#0160;70&amp;#0160;percent&amp;#0160;of the benchmarked organization organized “digital” as a standalone department. While this may sound like a way to focus resources,&amp;#0160;the standalone structure usually hinders the objective of an overarching transformation. Remember, digital is not a channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked whether they exhibit common innovation requirements, such as incentives to test new ideas, freedom to experiment and tolerance of failure, fewer than half of the&amp;#0160;benchmarked organizations&amp;#0160;said they did. Another disconnect is that digital channels are seen as competition to the&amp;#0160;branch network, with manager&amp;#0160;sales incentives&amp;#0160;creating a conflict within the organization.&amp;#0160;The branch staff also sees digital as a threat to their future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some institutions have set up innovation labs that are separate from the core business, with freedom to explore external deals and relationships. BBVA, for instance, acquired Simple and invested resources in a strategic alliance with SmartyPig. BBVA also has invested in start-up&amp;#0160;accelerators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;banking_innovation_support&quot; height=&quot;446&quot; src=&quot;http://thefinancialbrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/banking_innovation_support.png&quot; width=&quot;549&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Meeting the Needs of the Digital Consumer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digital&amp;#0160;consumer no longer sets their&amp;#0160;expectations based on other financial institutions. Their expectations are being formed by the experiences and delivery of products and services from&amp;#0160;non-banking organizations like Amazon, Apple, Uber, Zappos and even Disney and Southwest. Physical branch networks are no longer structured for a digital universe. They are costly to run and costly to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is running out. Digital pure play competitors&amp;#0160;are gaining recognition and&amp;#0160;building a base of customers. In effect, the market is moving faster than most banks and credit unions can keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most industry observers believe traditional banks can leverage their historical strengths and still compete effectively. But, it will require laser focus and the commitment to rebuilding internal and external business models around consumer&amp;#0160;priorities leveraging&amp;#0160;digital technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Skinner has a warning however, “Remember that digital just augments the interaction and takes away the friction – or should – and is not the be all and end all. But once you’re committed to digital, make sure you design it for humans.” Brett King is even more direct when he told The Financial Brand, “If bank and credit union executives don’t have a plan to deliver more than 50% of their revenue across digital by 2020 – then it’s time to start packing bags and beefing up resumes!&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to visit with Metro Bank recently, and they gave me startling stats and insights to the emerging business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched in &lt;a href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/fsclub/2010/07/metro-bank-launches-today.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;June 2010&lt;/a&gt;, Metro Bank has rapidly grown to 27 branches today, with a plan for 32 by the end of this year and 48 by the end of next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, they disappointed me immensely by being a branch-based bank, rather than a digital bank, but they are doing some interesting stuff with digital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a start, Metro Bank is a reference sell for Microsoft’s Dynamics Customer Relationship Management engine …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/i8R1uNaXTI4&quot; width=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… and the bank claims it is this use of data that is allowing them to create new account openings at a rapid rate (Metro Bank is now averaging 14,000 new account openings per month, and have increased from 275,000 customers to more than 350,000 during the first six months of 2014).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why the bank does not spend a great deal on advertising (they claim just £100,000 was spent on traditional advertising in the last year) but instead invests heavily in social media, with a team dedicated to engaging customers through social channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By way of example, one of the things that the bank has deployed is a twitter monitoring service that tracks the sentiments shared on Metro Bank and its competitors. This enables them to quickly engage with customers that are experiencing any problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s pretty clever, as is the idea of an account opening being completed in less than 15 minutes.&amp;#0160; The bank claims that once a customer sits down with one of their colleagues, 77 percent of new account openings are turned around in that time, and that includes issuance of a personalised debit and credit card, all enabled within any of their branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add on to this that the popularity of the bank’s digital channels has seen a significant uplift, and you start to realise that Metro Bank is branch-based bank built upon a digital base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why they offer customers two telephone numbers: one gets you through to their automated system to check balances etc, whilst the other connects you to a human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s giving the customer choice of whether they want the digital engagement or the human one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they are focused upon humans, with only a few – four or five – product managers amongst their 1,400 staff.&amp;#0160; This is why the bank talks about service innovation and service development, rather than product innovation or product development, with most employees front-facing customer focused people, not internal product folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is how they come up with new ideas like offering dog electronic micro-chipping for free, as a partnership with Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, or running family events and other services in their stores.&amp;#0160; They even ran a blood donor drive for one of the rotary clubs recently, when the village hall they were going to use got washed out through flooding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank also takes on board neat ideas, such as a card block in their new app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y’know how it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get home and find your card lost, but is lost or just mislaid?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you left it behind the bar on a Friday night and can’t collect until Monday morning, or maybe it’s just fallen down the back of the settee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, it’s annoying to have to get a new card issued, but Metro Bank thought about this and now offer a simple block of the card in question, using their mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find the card later, you can then unblock it in the app too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can dive into the nearest Metro Bank store and get a new card issued there and then on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No waiting and no hanging around for the card in the mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impressive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not yet.&amp;#0160; After all, the bank is making losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank lost £10.6 million in the first quarter of 2014, down from £10.8 million in the previous quarter.&amp;#0160; According to Chief Executive Craig Donaldson, the bank’s losses have now peaked and the bank should become profitable in the coming years as Metro Bank’s deposits increased to £1.6 billion at the end of Q1 2014, up 131 per cent year on year, and its total loans increased to £960 million, up 298 per cent in 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to updated figures during my meeting with the bank, deposits are now near £2 billion in mid-2014, and loans have increased to over £1 billion as the bank grows its footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19 of the 27 branches (or stores as they call them) are profitable, and each new store takes approximately 20 months from opening to move into profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, the bank expects to be profitable by 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some pictures from my visit to add impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entering the branch ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... and these doggie snacks on the counter surface (check lower centre oif last pic) ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/.a/6a01053620481c970b01a3fd361883970b-popup&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open( this.href, &amp;#39;_blank&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&amp;#39; ); return false&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;MetroBank1b&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a01053620481c970b01a3fd361883970b img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/.a/6a01053620481c970b01a3fd361883970b-650wi&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot; title=&quot;MetroBank1b&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... this is because Metro Bank loves dogs ....&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our biggest stories of the past week are ...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/fsclub/2014/07/the-top-1000-banks-in-the-world-2014.html&quot;&gt;The Top 1000 Banks in the World 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year,&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;The Banker&amp;#0160;&lt;/em&gt;magazine (to which I contribute a&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebanker.com/ftauthor/view/Chris+Skinner&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;monthly column&lt;/a&gt;) publishes their list of the Top 1000 banks. &amp;#0160;It&amp;#39;s a great research resource that I&amp;#39;ve been tracking since 1994, when half the banks in the top 10 were Japanese. &amp;#0160;Now, half of them are Chinese. &amp;#0160;Ten years ago, they were all American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/fsclub/2014/07/terrorists-will-drive-us-towards-digital-identities.html&quot;&gt;Terrorists will drive us towards digital identities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I travel the world, one thing unfolds: the passport queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/fsclub/2014/07/chris-with-intel-inside.html&quot;&gt;Chris, with Intel inside&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on the theme of&amp;#0160;digital identities, we are moving rapidly to a future based upon digital implants.&amp;#0160; I have had this vision since the&amp;#0160;Baja Beach Club&amp;#0160;began chipping customers with NFC capabilities, as who wants to take a wallet or purse to the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/fsclub/2014/07/welcome-to-your-relationship-machine-how-can-i-help.html&quot;&gt;Welcome to your relationship machine, how can I help?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I engaged in a lengthy debate yesterday about digital banking (for a change).&amp;#0160; The core of the discussion is whether humans are needed in a digital bank. Not humans to program the bank, as they’re obviously needed, but humans to service the customer.&amp;#0160; It was somewhat of a null debate, as you will definitely have a bank with no humans involved in service in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/fsclub/2014/07/banks-and-the-bejing-olympics-have-cloud-in-common.html&quot;&gt;The biggest barrier to clouds in banking is the banks themselves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the subject of cloud computing, I mentioned that it is starting to succeed by being more relevant through a vertical focus, but there is still more to be done for cloud to truly take off in banking. &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;In particular, most banks have a concern about the risk of cloud and who is accountable.&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Each year,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Banker&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;magazine (to which I contribute a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebanker.com/ftauthor/view/Chris+Skinner&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;monthly column&lt;/a&gt;) publishes their list of the Top 1000 banks. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s a great research resource that I&#39;ve been tracking since 1994, when half the banks in the top 10 were Japanese. &amp;nbsp;Now, half of them are Chinese. &amp;nbsp;Ten years ago, they were all American (apart from a few token Europeans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago, they all wanted to be dominant in their territories. &amp;nbsp;Today, they want to dominate their regions. &amp;nbsp;Ten years ago, they wanted to dominate the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest top 10 list makes for interesting reading however, as we see the Chinese banks rising to be the stablest today ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false&quot; href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/.a/6a01053620481c970b01a73deec0d4970d-popup&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a01053620481c970b01a73deec0d4970d img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot; title=&quot;Banker Top 1000&quot; src=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/.a/6a01053620481c970b01a73deec0d4970d-650wi&quot; alt=&quot;Banker Top 1000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... I just wonder, with shadow banking and non-performing loans, whether these Chinese banks will still be in the top 10 ten years from now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the list is one that I could spend hours talking about but, rather than doing so, I&#39;ll let&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Banker&#39;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;very own Brian Caplen and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebanker.com/ftauthor/view/Philip+Alexander&quot;&gt;Philip Alexander&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;do the talking. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Top 1000 World Banks 2014: Back on track?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;by Philip Alexander&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global banking profits jumped in this year&#39;s Top 1000 World Banks ranking to exceed their pre-crisis peak. So is the sector back in good health? Not universally so, reports Philip Alexander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global profits for&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Banker&lt;/em&gt;’s Top 1000 World Banks ranking for 2014, based on financial results for the end of 2013, have jumped by almost 23%, to $920bn. This means annual profits have for the first time exceeded the pre-crisis peak of $786bn in the 2007 ranking. Of course, the lesson of the crisis is to question whether these impressive results are sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebanker.com/Top-1000-World-Banks/The-Banker-Top-1000-World-Banks-2014-rankings-WORLD-Press-release-For-immediate-release&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;The Banker Top 1000 World Banks 2014 rankings - Press release - WORLD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Banker&lt;/em&gt;’s steadily deepening coverage of a growing number of data points for the banks in this ranking enables detailed analysis of that question. The first obvious answer is that banks are stronger than ever. The level of capital held by banks in this ranking continues to accelerate, with the minimum Tier 1 capital required to enter the Top 1000 World Banks now fast approaching $400m. This has almost doubled since the 2005 ranking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aggregate capital-to-assets ratio in the 2013 financial year enjoyed its largest rise since the emergency bail-outs and recapitalisations that showed up in the 2009 figures. The aggregate ratio as of the end of 2013 was 5.86%. In 1971, the first year for which&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Banker&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;compiled data for assets and capital plus reserves in what was then the top 300 banks ranking, the aggregate capital-to-assets ratio for the top 10 banks was 4.53%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ECB effect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capital-to-assets ratio for 1971 was dragged down by certain European banks – Chase Manhattan Corp notched up a ratio of 6.97%, whereas Banque National de Paris could only muster 1.22%.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Plus ça change&lt;/em&gt;, American bankers might be inclined to say. The top 10 US banks in the 2014 ranking have an aggregate capital-to-assets ratio of 7.84%. This compares with a ratio of just 4.47% for the top 10 banks in the EU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To some extent, the difference is explained by US Generally Agreed Accounting Principles (GAAP), which allow netting of derivative positions. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) used in Europe require derivative positions to be reported gross. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) proposed a compromise method of measuring asset size for its simple leverage ratio, which will incorporate some netting. Efforts to converge GAAP and IFRS have faltered, and the US regulators have instead opted simply to impose a higher leverage ratio – 6%, instead of the Basel recommendation of 3% that is likely to be adopted in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the EU is actively looking to catch up. Policy-makers have acknowledged that the American decision to recapitalise large banks immediately after the financial crisis in late 2008 has enabled a faster recovery in the sector. By contrast, European banks have recognised losses only gradually, and capital levels have remained weak, especially in the eurozone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is beginning to change. The creation of a single supervisory mechanism under the European Central Bank (ECB) in late 2013 led directly to the launch of the ECB’s comprehensive assessment, which includes a review of existing asset quality and a stress test of future solvency based on certain downside scenarios. The asset quality review is possibly the more significant part of the equation – an earlier stress test in 2011 failed to identify banks at risk because it did not address whether existing asset valuations were correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Top 1000 World Banks Ranking 2014 – Tier 1 capital-to-assets ratio&quot; src=&quot;http://www.thebanker.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/images/top-1000-world-banks-ranking-2014-tier-1-capital-to-assets-ratio/5077472-1-eng-GB/Top-1000-World-Banks-Ranking-2014-Tier-1-capital-to-assets-ratio.png&quot; alt=&quot;Top 1000 World Banks Ranking 2014 – Tier 1 capital-to-assets ratio&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;313&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects of Europe’s greater scrutiny on capital adequacy are evident in this year’s ranking. Banks in the peripheral eurozone that were damaged by slumps in asset quality are beginning to rebuild. In total, 52 banks have entered the Top 1000 ranking in 2014, and most of these are due to improvements in the timeliness of reporting data for our ranking. Of the eight that have grown their way into the Top 1000, half are from the peripheral eurozone countries, including the capital increase of almost 2000% at Bank of Cyprus following a government rescue supported by the EU. Unsurprisingly, Bank of Cyprus also tops our table of highest movers by Tier 1 capital, and the top 25 on that list includes two Greek and two Spanish banks. The capital-raising trend has continued into 2014 as banks that might fall close to the ECB’s 5.5% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio threshold under the adverse stress test scenario take pre-emptive action. Banks in Greece, Italy and Austria are leading the way, while the Slovenian government is undertaking a large-scale recapitalisation of its deeply troubled banking sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First in, first out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, Tier 1 capital in the eurozone rose by 5.3% in the 2014 ranking, while deleveraging continued – assets fell by 4.5%. But retained earnings are the easiest way to raise capital. The return on capital for US banks in the Top 1000 is 15.74%, compared with just 2.04% for banks in the eurozone. This profitability allows US banks to increase capital organically and Tier 1 capital levels rose by 6.6% in the 2014 ranking, compared with an increase of 1.3% in the asset base. The capital build-up may also partly reflect preparations for the advent of the high US leverage ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While return on capital is still weaker in Europe than in any other region of the world, it has staged a strong comeback in this year’s ranking. Western Europe’s percentage of global banking profits has risen almost seven-fold in the 2014 ranking, although it still represents just 11.1% of world profits. The peripheral eurozone accounts for two of the top five increases in profit in the world. That includes the number one improvement – Spain’s $85bn increase, returning to a still rather modest profit of $12.7bn. Greece also returns to profit, and the improvement in France (the fourth largest rise in profits) is mainly due to Crédit Agricole, which has rebounded from a $2bn loss to a $10.6bn profit after shedding its Greek subsidiary Emporiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gradual recovery in Europe is also changing the value of foreign subsidiaries. While several banks have already shed their holdings in Greece, other eurozone subsidiaries have improved their performance. Two of BNP Paribas’s group companies – in Belgium and Luxembourg – have joined the list of the top 25 most profitable foreign subsidiaries, while ING Bank’s subsidiary in Belgium has risen two places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is far too early to say that the eurozone’s woes are over. Several previously heavy loss-makers in Spain such as Bankia, Banco Popular and Banco Mare Nostrum returned to profit in 2013. But our 2014 ranking shows that there are still several others suffering heavy losses, including two among our table of top 25 largest loss-making banks. Moreover, other eurozone countries are still in the doldrums. Italian banks account for four of the largest five losses in the world. Cyprus banks recorded a loss equivalent to 80% of capital, while Slovenia has suffered a return on capital of -120%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We noted in a chart last year the different pace of losses in five eurozone countries, with Ireland recognising losses earliest and Greece suffering the sharpest individual hit in one year (2011). We have updated this chart&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebanker.com/Top-1000-World-Banks/Top-1000-World-Banks-2014-Back-on-track#Page%20126&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;, and the trend has become quite stark for Greece, Spain and Slovenia. Greece has recovered very steeply after digesting the damage from sovereign debt restructuring and recession in 2011. It is now among the top 10 countries for asset growth in this year’s ranking, although this is partly due to the two largest banks, Piraeus and Alpha, consolidating assets acquired from smaller players that were outside the Top 1000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Cypriot banks only addressed the fall-out from their exposure to Greece in 2012, with Cyprus Popular Bank put into liquidation in March 2013 and Bank of Cyprus rescued. Similarly, Slovenia was slow to recognise the losses caused by banks’ exposure to troubled state-owned enterprises. Under pressure from EU authorities, that situation changed in 2013 with a country-specific stress test. Of the four Slovenian banks that were in the Top 1000 ranking for 2012, two have dropped out of the ranking altogether due to the decline in their capital. We have calculated the chart&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebanker.com/Top-1000-World-Banks/Top-1000-World-Banks-2014-Back-on-track#Page%20126&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;using data from all four banks through the cycle. Losses accelerated massively in 2013, and the comparison with other eurozone states provides some indication of the time that may elapse before Slovenia returns to profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Top 1000 World Banks Ranking 2014 –&amp;nbsp;Global share of profits, 2014 ranking&quot; src=&quot;http://www.thebanker.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/images/top-1000-world-banks-ranking-2014-global-share-of-profits-2014-ranking/5077476-1-eng-GB/Top-1000-World-Banks-Ranking-2014-Global-share-of-profits-2014-ranking.png&quot; alt=&quot;Top 1000 World Banks Ranking 2014 –&amp;nbsp;Global share of profits, 2014 ranking&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;515&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difficulty of persuading banks in crisis-hit countries to recognise losses early is certainly not confined to the eurozone. Kazakhstan is one of the top recovery stories in this year’s ranking, with a loss on capital of 12% last year becoming a 21% return on capital this year. The financial crisis hit hard in 2009, with the country’s largest bank BTA departing the Top 1000 after its Tier 1 capital turned negative – the bank has not yet recovered its place in the ranking. The new market leader, Kazkommertsbank, managed to avoid heavy losses until 2012, when the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) instructed the lender to reclassify part of its portfolio. That led to a $1bn loss from which the bank has now recovered strongly, showing the benefits of acknowledging asset quality problems. However, Kazakhstan remains among the top 10 countries for impairments as a percentage of total operating income. The NBK governor explains in an interview with&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Banker&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;how he wants banks to be more active in their management of non-performing loans (NPLs) to end the curse of “zombie banks”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provisioning process in Romania among foreign-owned banks also appears to have been protracted. The country’s largest bank, Banca Comerciala Romana, recorded heavy losses in 2012 and has now returned to profit. The country’s second largest bank, BRD Groupe Société Générale, was more profitable in the early years of the crisis, but is now reporting steepening losses. Advisors working on the ECB’s asset quality review suspect Romanian real estate valuations could be a source of further negative surprises for eurozone banks active in the country when the results are published in October 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The persistence of high impairments is a worry for a number of EU countries as well. Although Ireland recognised NPLs relatively early in the downturn – taking heavy losses in 2010 – a full recovery seems to recede ever further into the future, with losses deepening again this year. Portugal has not suffered the kind of extreme negative returns of other eurozone crisis countries, but results continue to worsen. Its losses this year are the largest during the current cycle, which inevitably raises questions about whether the sector can return to profit as swiftly as Spain or Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Top 1000 World Banks Ranking –&amp;nbsp;Top 25 Profits for Foreign-Owned Subsidiaries&quot; src=&quot;http://www.thebanker.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/images/top-1000-world-banks-ranking-top-25-profits-for-foreign-owned-subsidiaries/5077480-1-eng-GB/Top-1000-World-Banks-Ranking-Top-25-Profits-for-Foreign-Owned-Subsidiaries.png&quot; alt=&quot;Top 1000 World Banks Ranking –&amp;nbsp;Top 25 Profits for Foreign-Owned Subsidiaries&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;597&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not much goodwill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impairment charges in all four countries are still among the top 10 worst. But while Spain, Greece and Ireland all saw sharp declines in impairments for 2013, those in Portugal are still rising. The other equally worrying situation is Italy, where impairments are also still rising two years after the peak of the eurozone sovereign debt crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of UniCredit, the largest loss in this year’s Top 1000, the largest single item was a series of write-downs of goodwill on commercial banking in Italy, Austria and central and eastern Europe (CEE). Goodwill write-downs, especially on CEE subsidiaries, have played a large part in the losses over this cycle for both Italian and Austrian banks. And they can work both ways. While foreign banks wrote off goodwill on their Greek subsidiaries, Greek banks acquiring assets from those foreigners rushing for the exits frequently recorded goodwill gains. Alpha Bank’s return to profit in 2013 was greatly assisted by a dramatic goodwill write-up of €3.3bn on Emporiki, which it acquired from Crédit Agricole for a token €1 at the start of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre-crisis merger and acquisition (M&amp;amp;A) activity played a major part in value destruction across Europe, including the RBS acquisition of ABN Amro and the Cooperative Bank’s Britannia purchase. Both these less-than-proud parents are among the top 25 loss-makers this year. Goodwill valuations cross the boundary between the heavily regulated banking sector and the self-regulated world of external auditors, but regulators are certainly beginning to pay greater attention to this opaque area. In a report published in June 2014 that covered both banks and corporates, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) called for improvements in disclosures related to business combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite the fact that issuers included in the sample recognised goodwill in most of the business combinations analysed, descriptions of the factors making up goodwill were often ‘boiler plate’ or insubstantial. Given the impact of business combinations on financial statements, ESMA believes that enhanced information by issuers would contribute to investor protection and increase market confidence,” ESMA noted in its press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Top 1000 World Banks Ranking 2014 –&amp;nbsp;Mergers and Acquisitions in Top 1000&quot; src=&quot;http://www.thebanker.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/images/top-1000-world-banks-ranking-2014-mergers-and-acquisitions-in-top-1000/5077484-1-eng-GB/Top-1000-World-Banks-Ranking-2014-Mergers-and-Acquisitions-in-Top-1000.png&quot; alt=&quot;Top 1000 World Banks Ranking 2014 –&amp;nbsp;Mergers and Acquisitions in Top 1000&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;307&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China conundrum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial reporting in Europe may be difficult to interpret, but the challenge of analysing China is on a different scale. We have long noted the uncertainty surrounding very low NPL ratios reported in China, and the growing role of the ‘shadow banking sector’, where trust companies and wealth management products provide an alternative source of credit. At the start of 2014, some of these concerns came out of the shadows, with the default or near-default of several trusts exposed to the coal mining sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the reported numbers for the Chinese banking sector still present a picture of good health. After ICBC took the top spot in the Top 1000 for the first time last year, in 2014’s ranking it has been joined by China Construction Bank at number two. And the total Tier 1 capital of Chinese banks has also overtaken that of the US for the first time ever, at $1190bn, to make it the largest single banking sector in the world. Reported NPL ratios are still about the 1% mark for the vast majority of banks. The increase in profits in China is more than $50bn: the second highest improvement in the world after Spain’s recovery from losses, and equivalent to half the size of the total profits for the whole of western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Top 1000 World Banks Ranking –&amp;nbsp;Biggest Loss Making Banks&quot; src=&quot;http://www.thebanker.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/images/top-1000-world-banks-ranking-biggest-loss-making-banks/5077488-1-eng-GB/Top-1000-World-Banks-Ranking-Biggest-Loss-Making-Banks.png&quot; alt=&quot;Top 1000 World Banks Ranking –&amp;nbsp;Biggest Loss Making Banks&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;663&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, these figures may be flattered by rolling over loans to distressed companies when they cannot repay and leaving the shadow banking sector to pick up lending to riskier customers. But banks are not immune from the risks of alternative credit, as many of them distribute the wealth management products or refinance trust companies. And it is important to look at the long-term trend, as bank assets can only grow sustainably if the underlying economic growth supports them. In the Top 1000 ranking 20 years ago, all the top six positions were held by Japanese banks. This year, just one Japanese bank – Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group – clings to the top 10, and total Japanese bank capital is less than half that of China’s. The Japanese banking boom was simply unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does China’s compare? The banking sector runs with a capital-to-assets ratio fully two percentage points lower than that in the US, despite the comparative lack of borrower information in China. This leaves it with a smaller cushion if NPLs were to accelerate. Since 1999, the average profit growth of Chinese banks has been more than 50% per year, while assets have risen by more than 20% per year. While China’s economic growth has frequently been the fastest in the world, it has never exceeded 14% per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past four years, economic growth has slowed into single figures, but Chinese bank profits have actually accelerated. The only other major economy witnessing this kind of acceleration is the US, where profits recovered strongly after the 2008 crash, but remain below the pre-crisis peak of 2006. Even with China’s economic convergence process and vast market, it is difficult to envisage growth rates in the banking sector maintaining their current trajectory unless economic growth also returns to a higher level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While questions grow around the Chinese banking boom, Japanese banks are quietly emerging from their post-bubble lost decade that began in the mid-1990s – a turnaround that was then thrown off course by the 2008 financial crisis. This year’s performance in the rankings has been skewed by the 22% decline in the Japanese yen, which hit the relative capital levels of Japanese banks in dollar terms. However, return on capital has jumped by almost two percentage points, to 12% in this year’s ranking. And there are tentative signs of Japanese banks regaining their appetite for cross-border expansion. The largest cross-border M&amp;amp;A deal to affect this year’s Top 1000 is the acquisition of Bank of Ayudhya in Thailand by Japan’s largest bank, Mitsubishi UFJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We dived deep into the data last year to use the Top 1000 as an early-warning tool for mapping potential banking sector overheating or asset quality risks worldwide. Changes in impairment levels are the most obvious danger sign, but sharp increases in loan-to-deposit ratios are also important for identifying countries with rising household leverage and banks that are becoming increasingly reliant on wholesale funding. And while asset growth is positive if sustainable, any asset growth that is fuelled by wholesale funding or occurring at a time of rising credit risk is clearly rather less reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using these indicators, Bulgaria shows up as a potential source of concern. The country has the second highest asset growth rates, and yet asset quality is deteriorating sharply. The rise in impairment charges is among the top 10, and from an already high base. Only Slovenia and Italy among the top 10 impairment increases have higher absolute levels of impairment as a percentage of total operating income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bulgaria story also points to another indicator of risk that is qualitative rather than quantitative – the dangers of M&amp;amp;A activities that are apparent from the goodwill write-offs in the eurozone. The previous wave of M&amp;amp;A before the crisis was mostly carried out by banks from developed markets moving into emerging markets. There are still a few such deals, including the BNP Paribas expansion in Poland announced late last year. But the trend has mostly reversed: emerging market banks are buying subsidiaries in their home or neighbouring countries from retreating developed-market players. Banks in Panama, Poland and Kazakhstan that are large enough to feature in the Top 1000 have all provided examples of this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk is that banks with less experience of managing integration processes and carrying out due diligence on acquired assets may suffer similar accidents to those that afflicted banks such as RBS during the financial crisis. Some emerging market regulators are already alert to the dangers. The Colombian central bank, for example, instituted a new regulation in August 2013 that required banks to eliminate goodwill from their Tier 1 capital calculations. Combined with an 8.5% devaluation of the Colombian peso (all our figures are calculated in US dollars), this led to a 37% slide in the reported Tier 1 capital of Bancolombia following its acquisition of HSBC Bank Panama. Another Colombian bank on the acquisition trail, Banco Davivienda, witnessed a 27% decline in capital. The good news is that this tough line by the regulator today reduces the risk of unpleasant surprises in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bulgaria in jeopardy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bulgaria, foreign-owned banks have been very conservative in recent years, and in some cases have withdrawn from the country altogether if it is considered too marginal to their business plans. This is partly due to the strains on parent banks stemming from the eurozone crisis, but deteriorating asset quality in Bulgaria has also contributed. The slack in the sector is being picked up by local banks that are less directly affected by events in the eurozone. First Investment Bank, one of only two locally owned Bulgarian banks in the Top 1000, acquired MKB Union Bank from Germany’s BayernLB in 2013, contributing to a 30% rise in assets. In May 2014, Corporate Commercial Bank (CCB) – which is too small to appear in the Top 1000 – acquired Crédit Agricole’s assets in Bulgaria.&lt;a id=&quot;Page 126&quot; name=&quot;Page 126&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Top 1000 World Banks Ranking –&amp;nbsp;Return on capital for crisis countries, 2007 to 2013&quot; src=&quot;http://www.thebanker.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/images/top-1000-world-banks-ranking-return-on-capital-for-crisis-countries-2007-to-2013/5077492-1-eng-GB/Top-1000-World-Banks-Ranking-Return-on-capital-for-crisis-countries-2007-to-2013.png&quot; alt=&quot;Top 1000 World Banks Ranking –&amp;nbsp;Return on capital for crisis countries, 2007 to 2013&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;341&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But locally owned banks also have smaller capital bases, less access to global liquidity and often opaque ownership structures. Moreover, foreign banks in Bulgaria are generally reporting high total impairments at between 30% and 55% of total operating income. By contrast, some of the locally owned banks report this ratio at about 20% to 25%, suggesting these banks may be slower to recognise problem assets, and the impairment ratio could continue to accelerate. For CCB, the risks crystallised just weeks after the Crédit Agricole deal closed. The Bulgarian National Bank announced in June 2014 that the bank had been placed into conservatorship because “CCB’s liquidity had been depleted and the bank had suspended making payments and conducting all types of banking transactions”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is another obvious hotspot. Sadly, the banking sector had been showing signs of improvement before the country’s slide into violence in 2014. Impairment charges, while still among the top 10 worldwide, fell by a quarter as a percentage of operating income in 2013. And asset growth was among the top 10 highest in the world, with both private and state-owned banks contributing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Top 1000 World Banks Ranking –&amp;nbsp;Top 10 Rises in Loan-to-deposit ratios by Country&quot; src=&quot;http://www.thebanker.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/images/top-1000-world-banks-ranking-top-10-rises-in-loan-to-deposit-ratios-by-country/5077496-1-eng-GB/Top-1000-World-Banks-Ranking-Top-10-Rises-in-Loan-to-deposit-ratios-by-Country.png&quot; alt=&quot;Top 1000 World Banks Ranking –&amp;nbsp;Top 10 Rises in Loan-to-deposit ratios by Country&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;257&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest rise in loan-to-deposit ratios should not come as a surprise: with large depositors facing a haircut as part of the international bail-out, Cypriot banks suffered a 41% loss of deposits. Among other countries showing sharp rises in loan-to-deposit ratios, some are less concerning. Uruguay, Gabon and Uzbekistan still have ratios well below 100%, providing plenty of funding headroom for asset growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kazakhstan’s weak spots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Kazakhstan, already mentioned among the top countries for impairments, is still some way from a healthy structure in the banking sector. The country had the third highest rise in loan-to-deposit ratios worldwide, as a 4% rise in deposits could not keep pace with a 22% rise in loans. Dependence on wholesale funding was one of the weak spots of Kazakhstan’s banking sector before the financial crisis, and government rescues of large banks have done little to improve confidence. A malicious text message campaign in early 2014 questioning the solvency of several Kazakh banks prompted fresh deposit outflows, although these were reversed once the culprits behind the false information were arrested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warning signs continue to flash in Brazil, which is on the list of top 10 loan-to-deposit ratio increases for the second year running. Azerbaijan, which we flagged as another country with a rather heated banking sector last year, is still in the spotlight. Its loan-to-deposit ratio increase falls just outside the top 10, and asset growth is one of the highest in the world. And Turkey has crossed an important threshold, with the loan-to-deposit ratio rising above 100% and climbing rather rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the sharpest rises in impairments, political risk in Egypt is clearly feeding through to asset quality. The Russian consumer lending market was already showing signs of a correction in 2013, and any broadening of US and EU sanctions during 2014 would only aggravate the problem further. However, impairments in Turkey rose by just 2.3% of operating income in 2013, despite the political turbulence. Profitability is slipping a little, and Finansbank, owned by National Bank of Greece, dropped out of the list of the top 25 most profitable foreign-owned subsidiaries worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resilience of Turkish asset quality is perhaps testament to good risk management at Turkish banks, and a well-run bank can head off most risks aside from a full-blown sovereign debt crisis or civil war. We noted Bank of Georgia last year amid a very rapid rise in assets, loan-to-deposit ratio and a doubling in impairments as a percentage of total operating income. In the 2014 ranking, asset growth has eased into single figures, outstripped by a 13.7% rise in deposits to stabilise the funding position. Impairments rose by just two percentage points of total operating income, suggesting the bank’s management has moved quickly to ensure that asset growth remains sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In certain countries, banks can only do their best to cope with the situation as they find it. Venezuela tops the list of countries for asset growth, and along with Argentina it also enjoys the highest return on capital. The asset growth and rates of return are driven by very high inflation, which in turn produces steep interest rate spreads. Leading banks are often state-owned, and have been urged by policy-makers to continue lending even into this relatively risky macroeconomic environment, and with comparatively low capital bases behind them. Still, there are opportunities for foreign banks, and BBVA’s subsidiary in Venezuela is among the top 25 most profitable foreign-owned subsidiaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational risk riddle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the BCBS has focused on two aspects of bank assets – credit risk (lending exposures) and market risk (exposure to financial markets). But the BIS ratio that we include in this ranking has a third component – operational risk, including losses from theft, technological failures, natural disasters and litigation. Historically, operational risk-weighted assets (RWAs) were the smallest component of most banks’ risk-based asset calculations, and consequently came under less regulatory scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the past year has seen a rapid rise in the size of fines paid out by banks due to enforcement actions in the US and EU over issues such as money-laundering, assisting tax evasion, manipulating financial benchmarks such as Libor, and false accounting or misleading investors over subprime mortgage securities. Fines over Libor have totalled $6bn already&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebanker.com/Markets/Capital-Mkts/A-fine-frenzy!-How-banks-are-paying-the-price-for-the-subprime-crisis&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(see our March 2014 cover story)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while JPMorgan paid out $14bn over a range of offences including mis-selling subprime securities and poor controls around the ‘London whale’ rogue trading scandal. UK banks have paid out £22bn ($37.33bn) in compensation for mis-selling payment protection insurance and the figure is still rising. At the time of going to press, France’s BNP Paribas is still discussing a settlement that could top $8bn over alleged evasion of US sanctions on Sudan and Iran. This has all brought operational risk into much sharper focus, and its significance for bank performance is no longer peripheral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Top 1000 World Banks Ranking –&amp;nbsp;Top 10 Banks for Operational Risk&quot; src=&quot;http://www.thebanker.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/images/top-1000-world-banks-ranking-top-10-banks-for-operational-risk/5077504-1-eng-GB/Top-1000-World-Banks-Ranking-Top-10-Banks-for-Operational-Risk.png&quot; alt=&quot;Top 1000 World Banks Ranking –&amp;nbsp;Top 10 Banks for Operational Risk&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;237&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switzerland is the top country for operational RWAs, which account for more than 20% of total RWAs in the country. This is no surprise: Swiss banks have faced a barrage of allegations and fines for assisting tax evasion in the US and EU. The regulatory assault can even become a threat to a bank’s very existence, with 270-year old Swiss bank Wegelin shutting down in 2013 following US tax evasion allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed markets dominate the list for the largest operational RWAs, with Thailand the only emerging market to break into the top 10. However, conflict risks in some emerging markets clearly present severe operational challenges that may be underestimated. Part of the problem of operational RWAs is that historic data is thin, filled with one-off extreme events that are far harder to model than, for instance, the performance of a decades-old mortgage portfolio. BNP Paribas actually cut operational RWAs as a proportion of total RWAs fractionally in 2013, which explains why the French authorities are warning that the fine could lead to capital erosion – the bank was underprepared for the scale of potential losses. Regulators are beginning to wake up to the difficulties of modelling operational risk. The European Banking Authority began consulting in June 2014 on rules to enable supervisors to assess banks’ modelling techniques for operational RWAs, but the journey is likely to be long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Top 1000 World Banks Ranking 2014 – Top 10 countries for operational risk&quot; src=&quot;http://www.thebanker.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/images/top-1000-world-banks-ranking-2014-top-10-countries-for-operational-risk/5077508-1-eng-GB/Top-1000-World-Banks-Ranking-2014-Top-10-countries-for-operational-risk.png&quot; alt=&quot;Top 1000 World Banks Ranking 2014 – Top 10 countries for operational risk&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;307&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if their operational risks are rising, many of the largest banks have been strengthening their Basel ratios with heavy cuts to trading activities, which reduce their market RWAs. After UBS wound down much of its fixed-income trading activities in 2013, the bank sliced more than half off its market RWAs. Market risk is now a much smaller component of the bank’s RWAs than operational risk – 6% compared with 34%. Barclays shaved more than 30% off its market RWAs, while RBS continued its long-running process of deleveraging with a further 26% cut in market RWAs. Among the banks with large trading desks, only three – BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse and HSBC – increased market RWAs in 2013, by less than 20% in both cases. Understandably, end-users of financial markets are beginning to fret about reduced liquidity as market-makers scale back their activities, especially in fixed income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US regulators remain sceptical about the value of Basel risk-based capital rules, and American banks do not report the breakdown of RWAs in their regulatory financial statements. The good news is that disclosure in general continued its improving trend in the 2014 ranking. In total, 44 banks have entered or re-entered the Top 1000 thanks to more timely disclosure of their key financial data. They include the Postal Savings Bank of China, which at almost $23bn in Tier 1 capital is by far our largest new entrant. Another 17 Chinese banks join the ranking this year thanks to improved data collection. As ever, the coverage in this ranking continues to be enhanced by the tireless efforts of our research team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Research for&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;The Banker&lt;em&gt;’s Top 1000 rankings was carried out by Adrian Buchanan, Guillaume Hingel, Valeriya Yakutovich and Alberto Berardi.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Building on the theme of &lt;a href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/fsclub/2014/07/terrorists-will-drive-us-towards-digital-identities.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;digital identities&lt;/a&gt;, we are moving rapidly to a future based upon digital implants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had this vision for some time, and every day it gets nearer and nearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vision stems back to the last decade, when the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3697940.stm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Baja Beach Club&lt;/a&gt; began chipping customers with NFC capabilities as who wants to take a wallet or purse to the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time for vacuous picture of a beach babe&amp;#0160;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/.a/6a01053620481c970b01a3fd3399e8970b-popup&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open( this.href, &amp;#39;_blank&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&amp;#39; ); return false&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;BeachBabies&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a01053620481c970b01a3fd3399e8970b img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/.a/6a01053620481c970b01a3fd3399e8970b-650wi&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot; title=&quot;BeachBabies&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… the serious point here is that having a chip inside makes sense, and makes more sense a decade later as chips become less intrusive and easier to insert into our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, here’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adguk-blog.com/2014/01/secret-plan-to-microchip-all-newborns.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the latest chip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/.a/6a01053620481c970b01a3fd339b64970b-popup&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open( this.href, &amp;#39;_blank&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&amp;#39; ); return false&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Babychip&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a01053620481c970b01a3fd339b64970b img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/.a/6a01053620481c970b01a3fd339b64970b-600wi&quot; style=&quot;width: 598px;&quot; title=&quot;Babychip&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... and they are getting smaller and smaller, as nanotechnologies take over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon you will be able to just swallow a unique chip tracker linked to your heartbeat, and most of us will have some form of nanotech chip inside if, for no other reason, than it can monitor our bodies and transmit our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the question becomes: what if the identity could be linked to other tracking and monitoring services?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, it needs to be a secure monitoring service, but what if my chip could be linked to my doctor&amp;#39;s office?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My doctor would get alerts purely in the instances of persistent unusual brain or heart activity.&amp;#0160; This would allow them to call me into the surgery and pre-analyse possibilities of a stroke or heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if my child&amp;#39;s chip could be monitored so that, if my son or daughter skipped class today, where were they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get an alert telling me that they are in the park or shopping mall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may be ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if the alert tells me that they are in a vehicle travelling north at speed, gives me an option to notify the authorities to monitor about what is taking place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a digital nightmare, but a reality that will be here in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, by having the chip inside, if that allowed you to walk across borders with no checks and no intrusion, would you use it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it meant that you felt more confident about your life, would you use it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it meant you could feel healthier, more cared for and more loved, would you use it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will all gladly accept being chipped if it means that we feel more secure and healthier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we do this, our chips will exchange information with our surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will literally be able to talk to the trees and the animals, as our chip gauges our environment and surroundings, records our movements, monitors our activities and assists us in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wirelessly, our intel inside will communicate with the internet of things to transact, inform and proactively serve us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the vision of the digital nirvana: to have every human on the net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only slight concern at that point will be: who controls the net?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/.a/6a01053620481c970b01a511e35baf970c-popup&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open( this.href, &amp;#39;_blank&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&amp;#39; ); return false&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Implant by Google&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a01053620481c970b01a511e35baf970c img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/.a/6a01053620481c970b01a511e35baf970c-650wi&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot; title=&quot;Implant by Google&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As I travel the world, one thing unfolds,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passport queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/.a/6a01053620481c970b01a73dedf25c970d-popup&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open( this.href, &amp;#39;_blank&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&amp;#39; ); return false&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Passport q&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a01053620481c970b01a73dedf25c970d img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/.a/6a01053620481c970b01a73dedf25c970d-640wi&quot; style=&quot;width: 640px;&quot; title=&quot;Passport q&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely, there is a better way to check it’s you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As here we stand, book in hand, waiting for the eye of the security guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check my face matches my race, and stamp that I may camp in their place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I give them a smile, and off we go, with a hey and a ho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I feel my fast pulse, as my passport is false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no issue, for my bodily tissue is not the real deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I spied on them and on you for that&amp;#39;s what terrorists do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean what sort of last century security system does the world manage when our identities are checked by some sleepy security guy who stamps a paper-based passbook? No wonder that mothers can travel &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2641511/Mother-flew-Spain-daughters-passport-different-colour-skin.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;as their daughters&lt;/a&gt; or that a bald man can pass for his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/07/bald-man-uses-blonde-girlfriends-passport_n_5102889.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blonde-haired girlfriend.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet this is what we use for KYC?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely, we need to have a digital check?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need digital border controls that can check a digital implant via an automated screening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/.a/6a01053620481c970b01a511e2a01a970c-popup&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open( this.href, &amp;#39;_blank&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&amp;#39; ); return false&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Passport iris&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a01053620481c970b01a511e2a01a970c img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/.a/6a01053620481c970b01a511e2a01a970c-650wi&quot; style=&quot;width: 649px;&quot; title=&quot;Passport iris&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would get rid of the queues and make travel more secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terrorists and criminals might steal my chip implant, but the implant only works if it matches my heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the near-term future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chip implant that will only function with a unique biometric, such as the heartbeat, so that we can be tracked and traced electronically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t want the chip implant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the app and strap version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/jUO7Qnmc8vE&quot; width=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, we will move to digital identities that, at their core, use a digital biometric as their raison d&amp;#39;etre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, we will all remain stuck in the last century of passbooks and stamps.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I engaged in a lengthy debate yesterday about digital banking (for a change).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of the discussion is whether humans are needed in a digital bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not humans to program the bank, as they’re obviously needed, but humans to service the customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was somewhat of a null debate, as you will definitely have a bank with no humans involved in service in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some say that’s ridiculous, but the increasing use of robotics and sentient intelligence means that we will soon get to the stage where the automated services we use will feel human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the film &lt;em&gt;Her&lt;/em&gt; and you get a sense of the near-term automated machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film’s strapline at the opening is that: “it&amp;#39;s not an operating system; it&amp;#39;s a consciousness”, and the lead character played by Joachim Phoenix gradually falls in love with a near future styled &lt;em&gt;Siri&lt;/em&gt;, played by Scarlett Johansson (as the voice).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this film and other developments around us are demonstrating is that machines will soon have emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will deal with technology that feels human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the Japanese have been pushing for several years with robotics …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/DF39Ygp53mQ&quot; width=&quot;650&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… and the combination of sentience and robotics will deliver a very human engagement in an automated form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the dream of the developers: to develop technologies that are more intelligent than the human brain; and it dates back to the 1950s when the &lt;em&gt;Turing Test&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Singularity&lt;/em&gt; became a vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Turing Test &lt;/em&gt;was set by scientist Alan Turing in the 1950s when he stated that “a computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human”.&amp;#0160; Some say that a system called Eugene achieved this last month, although the Turing Test &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/jamiebartlett/100013858/no-eugene-didnt-pass-the-turing-test-but-he-will-soon/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;still stands&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;according to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However it will happen one day soon and, when it does, we then achieve &lt;em&gt;The Singularity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.singularityweblog.com/17-definitions-of-the-technological-singularity/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Singularity &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;is a phrase first used by mathematician John Von Neumann who is reported as stating that :&amp;#0160;“the ever accelerating progress of technology … gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.”&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are nearing this state, with some saying that it will be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/louis-del-monte-interview-on-the-singularity-2014-7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;within the next thirty years:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today there&amp;#39;s no legislation regarding how much intelligence a machine can have, how interconnected it can be. If that continues, look at the exponential trend. We will reach the singularity in the timeframe most experts predict. From that point on you&amp;#39;re going to see that the top species will no longer be humans, but machines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louis Del Monte, physicist, entrepreneur, and author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Revolution-Serve-Replace-ebook/dp/B00K1PNIR6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Artificial Intelligence Revolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, all in all, we are moving towards a world where hum-drum jobs, like talking to us about cancelling a credit or debit, will be dealt with by human-style machines we trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we move beyond &lt;em&gt;digital banking&lt;/em&gt; and ot a state of &lt;em&gt;emotional banking, &lt;/em&gt;a term used by Meniga at &lt;a href=&quot;http://warrencammack.co.uk/index.php/2013/11/24/next-bank-sydney-2013/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Next Bank Sydney&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;to talk about the humanised digital bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is that the future digital bank will not be human.&amp;#0160; It will be a machine with emotions, and that day is already near&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, to really push the envelope and to recognise that most banks are cost cutters rather than service improvers, if we can get to a world in the near future where relationship managers could be replaced by relationship machines, you bet your bottom dollar that the banks will be the first to deploy such technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The biggest barrier to clouds in banking is the banks themselves</title>

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Returning to the subject of cloud computing, I mentioned that it is starting to succeed by being more relevant through a &lt;a href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/fsclub/2014/04/cloud-computing-comes-of-age-thanks-to-vertical-alignment-to-banking.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vertical focus&lt;/a&gt;, but there is still more to be done for cloud to truly take off in banking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, most banks have a concern about the risk of cloud and who is accountable.&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a payment is dropped it creates great reputational risk, and this is a valid concern.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160; If a trade is missed, even with zero latency, the issue exposes the bank to fundamental weaknesses in its investment operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not like dropping a phone call or a plane taking off late.&amp;#0160; The movement of monies and access to profits in a secure and resilient fashion is a fundamental and, for today’s technology in banking operations, there is the core issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the risk of system failure or IT exposure that causes most banks to want to control the whole operation internally.&amp;#0160; Develop and build within the bank, run and maintain within the bank, operate and support within the bank.&amp;#0160; That has been the mantra for decades and it is hard to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that banks do not use cloud services.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160; Outsourcing and offshoring are good examples of where banks have moved to lower cost business models, and the move to operational expenditure rather than capital expenditure for their operations.&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what have they outsourced and offshored?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems development and call centres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-strategic services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing of any core exposure or value, such as trading and payments processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even today, there are few banks that outsource their core payments processing and, when a bank does, it is usually to a trusted counterparty bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest barrier for cloud therefore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add on to these issues the scare stories of companies such as Netflix being unavailable at peak times due to Amazon Web Services and you can see why banks are avoiding cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon claims it is the type of contract Netflix signed up for that was at stake, but who is to blame when there is an outage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a bank has an outage, is the blame with the bank’s systems, the contracts they sign up for with cloud providers, the service providers to the cloud providers, the communications firms that link the bank to the cloud services... who’s to blame?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, for all the good intentions of Service Level Agreements (SLAs), can they really be enforced if you have multiple issues between diverse providers in different geographies with different national laws?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the risk of cloud causing outage to mission critical services is the biggest barrier to cloud adoption, even when it is offered in a bank-specific verticalised approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it was best summed up by a colleague at a recent meeting, who said that banks have done all they can to ensure they have fault tolerant computing, at the expense of customer-centric services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it is the mission critical uptime that is the focal point of technology in banking, especially in core services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until cloud providers can prove their ability to provide banks with mission critical uptime under a pay-as-you-go agreement can be delivered 100% accurately every time, banks will still be nervous about moving core systems operations into cloud-based services, no matter what the gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, there’s no gain without pain, and banks just cannot afford the sort of pain that might be unleashed if there were a cloud meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the back of this article, a friend pinged me the following (published on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businesscloudnews.com/2014/06/18/bank-of-england-cio-think-twice-about-cost-security-data-sovereignty-in-the-cloud/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Cloud News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in June):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bank of England CIO: ‘think twice about cost, security, data sovereignty in the cloud’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_190362&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;John Finch, CIO of the Bank of England was speaking at the Cloud World Forum in London on Wednesday&quot; height=&quot;172&quot; src=&quot;http://www.businesscloudnews.com/files/2014/06/john_finch.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Finch, CIO of the Bank of England was speaking at the Cloud World Forum in London on Wednesday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firms looking to adopt cloud-based services should consider the security and data privacy implications associated with moving critical systems into the cloud, and not let vendors drive their technology strategies for them, according to Bank of England CIO John Finch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finch, who was speaking at the Cloud World Forum in London on Wednesday, told an audience of enterprise IT professionals and technology vendors that businesses should consider the data sovereignty implications when moving into the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you go to a partner to host your data, you need to ask questions. Do you know where the boxes it runs on are and do you know the legislation that covers those boxes?” he said. “One well-known provider promises your data will stay in Europe. But with this provider the boxes sit in the Nordic region somewhere. Who here knows Nordic law?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that businesses should exercise caution when it comes to assessing cloud service providers’ approach to security, a huge area of concern for the Bank&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bankingtech.com/227792/financial-services-in-the-firing-line-for-cyber-attacks-says-ex-cia-chief/&quot;&gt;and the rest of the financial services community&lt;/a&gt;among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Remember, when you go to a third-party provider you are placing some of your security posture in their hands. That may be a good thing if they have the expertise, but remember you are leasing part of their perimeter,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While stressing the challenges associated with bringing more cloud services into organisations more barodly he did say that he didn’t want to seem like a “cloud denier,” acknowledging the many benefits his among others have realised as a result of using these platforms (he said he couldn’t discuss specific systems for security reasons) – agility, reduced cost, and faster time to market for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Finch also suggested that cloud vendors have had a tendency to over-promise and under-deliver, particularly on the cost of cloud services, and that businesses should resist letting vendors set their technology strategy for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All the vendors will be telling you ‘you don’t need IT teams, they’ll do the heavy lifting for you.’ That is sometimes true, and there are cases where cloud can be a real enabler, but that doesn’t mean it’s always right,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The vendors will also tell you there is a financial upside but my answer is, don’t let their bean counters tell you how to count your beans, go and see an external accountant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England is&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businesscloudnews.com/2014/06/02/cloud-in-financial-services-what-is-it-not-good-for/&quot;&gt;&amp;#0160;among a number of financial services companies&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;stressing caution when it comes to cloud adoption, in large part because of the often significant cost implications of a security breach, but also because of data sovereignty restrictions within some contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/div&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our biggest stories of the past week are ...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/fsclub/2014/07/q-why-are-banks-organised-in-product-silos-a-mckinsey-.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Why are banks organised in product silos? A: McKinsey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often hear the lament from bankers that their business is designed around products, rather than customers. Why is this? According to an article I stumbled across recently, it’s all McKinsey’s fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/fsclub/2014/07/how-bank-twitter-fails-are-killers.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How bank twitter #fails are killers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve blogged before about twitter fails, specifically JPMorgan&amp;#39;s disaster&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/fsclub/2013/11/askjpm-no-way-jpmorgans-social-media-disaster.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;last November&lt;/a&gt;, and it illustrates how companies are finding it challenging to adapt to the new connected world. Another great example of such behaviour was sent to me by a friend this week. A little known chappie with the twitter handle UKDazza made&amp;#0160;an innocent tweet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/fsclub/2014/07/customer-focus-in-banking-where-is-it.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer focus in banking: where is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had another fine evening at the Financial Services Club the other night, debating&amp;#0160;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;customer focus in banking: where is it?&amp;#0160;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;with a debate between: Owen Woodley, Managing Director, Retail Banking, Lloyds Banking Group; Derek French, Head of the Campaign for Community Banking Services (CCBS); and Anthony Thomson, co-Founder Metro Bank and Atom Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/fsclub/2014/07/britain-leading-the-way-in-digital-banking.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Britain: leading the way in digital banking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the author of a book called&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Bank-Strategies-launch-digital-ebook/dp/B00K0GL8IW/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;qid=1404805354&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Bank&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&amp;#0160;&lt;/em&gt;a headline that reads&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;Brits embrace digital banking&amp;#0160;&lt;/em&gt;cannot be ignored.&amp;#0160; Sure enough, it’s the publication of the British Banker’s Association’s report&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;The Way We Bank Now&lt;/em&gt;, the second report analysing the move to phone and online banking by the great British public.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160; This year it shows some startling moves and stats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thefinanser.co.uk/fsclub/2014/07/to-branch-or-not-to-branch-is-the-wrong-debate.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;To Branch Or Not To Branch&amp;quot; is the wrong debate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, the Chief Executive of the British Banker’s Association, Anthony Browne, announced that the traditional bank branch is dead. Writing in&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;The Sunday Telegraph,&amp;#0160;&lt;/em&gt;Browne states that the halcyon days of olden banking is a misnomer.&amp;#0160; It was far more difficult to deal with banks pre the digital era, as you were restricted to times and appointments, and were forced to physically go visit the branch and your manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160; &amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The major general news stories of the past week include ...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
