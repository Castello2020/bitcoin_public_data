Great Question Jul7
comment
C# 4.0 optional out/ref arguments
Maybe decent, but elegant is definitely on another league. The fact there's no better solution doesn't mean this is state-of-the-art by decree.

What does the [Flags] Enum Attribute mean in C#?
if((myProperties.AllowedColors & MyColor.Yellow) == MyColor.Yellow) wouldn't be better if((myProperties.AllowedColors & MyColor.Yellow)>0) instead?

Do I need to worry about inlining in Unity/C#?
@TheodorosChatzigiannakis 1. macros are ugly: I do this for code clarity, so using macros would defeat the purpose; 2. Unity likely wouldn't support them anyway: it doesn't even support project-wide defines, let alone macros!
