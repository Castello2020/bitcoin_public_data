Can I temporarly disable automatic login while booting?
Unfortunately it's not as easy as it looks. Currently I've no clue on how to pick the right moment to hit shift, and after managing to make it work twice after this answer was posted, I never managed it again since. Hence, I have to unaccept the answer.

@patrix nice idea! Cannot do it now but hopefully I'll edit it later.

@TomGewecke IMAO yes, they are profundly wrong. What the OP actually wants to do is change the layout, so he should just change the layout. Doing strange workaround makes no sense under any point of view.

How can I change the priority of number and symbol keys?
I've created a layout for programmers: it's in Italian, but you could easily do the same thing for any other layout.

I believe my ex has an enterprise account. We live together and share itunes.
I'm not sure what you're asking, but if you're living with someone else, you are at their mercy whatever you do, you'll never be 100% safe. So just forget about it.

Loading screen is no longer blue (it was blue in 10.3 IIRC?), but except this little detail, it worked! : )

@bmike if you buy a Mac the day before that model gets upgraded, you will basically have an inferior product spending the same amount of cash. Hence, you can say that the real value of a Mac decreases with time from release to the upgrade. As soon as it's released it's at full value, so if you instead buy something else, you get a product which isn't at full value instead. This is what I meant, hope it's clear now.
