Two years have passed, do you have any update? : ) We'll be playing our yearly game in a few weeks, and we still have to decide the exact details.

How much would it cost to get started with Magic: The Gathering?

@AlexP I understand, that makes some sense and I accept that. However, my point (clearly didn't state it well enough) is that regardless of playing standard or vintage, buying boosters still makes no sense.

@Greg as I said, it could be too powerful even if you limited that to one resource...

Is there any way to rehabilitate the “junk rare” Lost In The Woods?
IMHO it would be cool to have a tag for this kind of question "rehabilitating junk MTG cards"
