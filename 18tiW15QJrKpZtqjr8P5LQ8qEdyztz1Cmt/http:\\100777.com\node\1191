<p>Aerial spraying of the crystals via chemtrails was deployed on Chinese and Korean populations during the Korean War. Many veterans of the war later developed Multiple Sclerosis. The army recognized that the MS was Brucella-related and paid the veterans compensation. Although the Brucella micoplasma can lay dormant for decades, it can be triggered by vaccines. Vaccines have been mandatory in the US military since 1911.<br/>
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/why.htm" title="http://jahtruth.net/why.htm">http://jahtruth.net/why.htm</a></p>
<p>Besides MS, this bacterium has been linked to a variety of diseases including; AIDS, cancer, diabetes, Parkinsons, Alzheimers and arthritis. In 2000, Dr. Charles Engel of the National Institute of Health stated that the brucella mycoplasma was probably responsible for chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia as well.</p>
<p>In addition to the aerosol vector, mosquitoes were heavily tested as pathogen dispersal agents. In the 1950s, the Dominion Parasite Laboratory in Belleville, Canada was raising 100 million mosquitoes per month. They were then shipped to Queens University in Kingston and other facilities where they were infected with the crystalline disease agent.</p>
<p>A large outbreak of chronic fatigue was reported in 1957 in Punta Gorda, Florida. The previous week a huge influx of mosquitoes was reported. The National Institute of Health stated that 450 persons became ill with chronic fatigue within the month. Many such tests have been carried out on civilians over the last 50 years.</p>
<p>Dr. Maurice Hilleman, Merck's current chief virologist, stated recently that the Brucella pathogen is now carried by everyone in North America and possibly the world.</p>
<p>In 1993, Dr. Shyh-Ching Lo, senior researcher at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology patented several virulent strains of mycoplasma. He stated in his own patents that they cause chronic fatigue syndrome. The Institute is currently reconstructing the 1918 Spanish Flu, inserting it into contemporary flu strains and enhancing its lethality. The Spanish Flu killed 675,000 Americans in the 1918-1919 interval. Many of the dead were vaccinated soldiers. Anyone born after 1918 has no immunity to the Spanish Flu.<br/>
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/heal.htm" title="http://jahtruth.net/heal.htm">http://jahtruth.net/heal.htm</a></p>
<p>Since 9-11 all US airports have been under military control. According to one credible source, there is a subrosa project known as 'Cloverleaf' that uses domestic air carriers retrofitted with special tanks to spray civilian populations with a variety of chemicals.</p>
<p>This retired government scientist goes on to say that reconstructed versions of the flu could be inserted into vaccines along with a more benign strain of the inoculum in order to slow the progression of its more deadly component. Chemicals in the chemtrails reported nationwide over the preceding decade, may assist the viral envelope to fuse with lung cells, guaranteeing ease of penetration and infection. People will pass along the flu to others and then start dropping like flies. This will cause a panic demand for more flu shots, thus accelerating the cycle. Persons not so inoculated will be blamed for spreading the disease.</p>
<p>In 2002 the Department of Health and Human Services purchased 286 million doses of vaccine from British supplier Acambis. The Washington Post reported in September of that year that the entire population of the United States could be vaccinated within 5 days.</p>
<p>Concomitantly, the Department drafted a law known as The Model Emergency Health Powers Act. The Act can demand that any individual be vaccinated. Failure to comply will be considered a felony.</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 4:2 Ye shall not ADD unto the word which I command you, neither<br/>
shall ye diminish [ought] from it, that ye may keep the Commandments of the<br/>
"I AM" your God which I COMMAND you.<br/>
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/kofkad.htm" title="http://jahtruth.net/kofkad.htm">http://jahtruth.net/kofkad.htm</a></p>
<p>The latest wonder cure promoted by the medical establishment is genetic vaccines. They are hailed as the last line of defence between humans and mycoplasma. But Dr. Rebecca Carley declares that the DNA components in these vaccines can be incorporated into our own DNA which in turn could cause the extinction of all (vaccinated) life on earth.</p>
<p>At least two dozen microbiologists around the world have died violently in the last few years. Curiously, some of them were working on DNA sequencing. The most famous was Dr. David Kelly who died in July 2003. Working for the Mossad, Kelly orchestrated the defection of Russian microbiologist Vladimir Pasechnik, who had been working on a doomsday biological weapon capable of destroying one third of the planet's population.</p>
<p>In October 2004, Dmtry Lvov, head of the Russian Virology Institute declared that up to one billion people around the world could die during the next pandemic. It would appear that the human herd is about to be culled in spectacular fashion. For whatever reasons, the dead microbiologists wouldn't go along with the program.</p>
<p>In order to ensure maximum confusion, an edition of the New York Times from January 2002 reported that the US government had seen fit to declassify hundreds of germ warfare cookbooks. Although Lee Harvey Oswald's bank account information is sealed for another 50 years, federal agencies have been routinely selling biowarfare documents to researchers through the Internet and even over the telephone.</p>
<p>The Times reported on the dangers of tainted vaccines as far back as February 1962. It turns out that the polio vaccines of the 50s &amp; 60s were virally contaminated with diseased monkey kidney tissue, possibly accounting for the huge spike in cancer cases thereafter.<br/>
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/heal.htm" title="http://jahtruth.net/heal.htm">http://jahtruth.net/heal.htm</a></p>
<p>But vaccines don't require tainted monkey tissue to be considered dangerous. The Physician's Desk Reference for 1998 lists any number of toxic vaccine ingredients including; formaldehyde, aluminium, phenoxyethanol (antifreeze) and human diploid cells (from aborted fetal tissue).</p>
<p>In May of 1987 the austere Times of London reported on its front page that the smallpox vaccine administered by the World Health Organization had triggered AIDS. 100 million vaccinated Africans were at risk. Areas with the largest amount of inoculations showed the greatest concentrations of AIDS cases. Robert Gallo was quoted in the article as endorsing the figures and stating that, "AIDS researchers will keep their mouths shut because they are paid to do so."</p>
<p>In 1992 WHO director David Heymann stated that, "The origin of AIDS is of no importance to science today."</p>
<p>The Times also reported last December that Gulf War Syndrome had been positively linked to vaccines. More than 100,000 veterans currently suffer from the syndrome contracted in 1991 during Desert Storm. 20,000 veterans have died so far.<br/>
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/theiofk.htm" title="http://jahtruth.net/theiofk.htm">http://jahtruth.net/theiofk.htm</a></p>
<p>Last March, Haruna Kaita, a pharmaceutical scientist and dean of a Nigerian university took samples of the latest WHO vaccine to India for analysis. Serious contaminants were found including sterility agents.</p>
<p>In 1995 the Catholic charitable organization Human Life International accused the WHO of attempting population control in Africa and elsewhere.</p>
<p>In April 2000 the Observer newspaper reported that the pharmaceutical leviathan GlaxoSmithKline sponsored experiments on children at Incarnation Children's Center in New York City. Children as young as four were given multi-drug cocktails. In other experiments, six-month old babies were injected with double doses of a measles vaccine. More than 100 orphans and babies were used in 36 experiments.</p>
<p>This sort of experimentation has occurred with increasing frequency. Last year the Environmental Protection Agency received $2.1 million from the American Chemistry Council to conduct studies on children from impoverished families in Duval County, Florida. The children will be exposed to a variety of known toxins over a two year period. The study will determine how chemicals are absorbed, ingested and inhaled by children ranging in age from infants to 3 year olds. For taking part in the study, families will receive $970 and a tee-shirt.</p>
<p>What can be done--</p>
<p>Many parents believe that they cannot enrol their children in school without having them inoculated. But vaccines have always been voluntary. Dr. Zoltan Rona says that parents must demand exemption forms from school administrators. Exemptions can be made for spiritual or religious reasons. Rona states that parents may have to insist on having a vaccination waiver or declination form, and then have it notarized in order to present to school officials.</p>
<p>Also, before consulting a doctor, it may be prudent to consider the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association vol. 284 July 26, 2000. Therein is stated with astonishing frankness that American medical doctors are responsible for 250,000 deaths per year. Half of these deaths are attributed to the negative effects of wrongfully prescribed drugs. Interestingly, in the opening statement of the Hippocratic Oath, doctors make a declaration to Apollo. In the Greek vernacular, the word Apollo means destroyer (Satan).<br/>
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/heal.htm" title="http://jahtruth.net/heal.htm">http://jahtruth.net/heal.htm</a><br/>
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/why.htm" title="http://jahtruth.net/why.htm">http://jahtruth.net/why.htm</a></p>
<p>It may also be prudent to heed the advice of former National Institute of Health director James Shannon who stated, "The only safe vaccine is the one that is never used." This advice certainly resonated with President George W. Bush. On October 13 of last year in the middle of the US Presidential debates, Bush emphatically declared, "I haven't got a flu shot and don't intend to."</p>
<p>One month later Reuters carried a related and interesting item published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Harvard researcher Gerhard Scheuch stated that nasal inhalation of a simple saline spray can stop the flu virus and tuberculosis dead in their tracks. For reasons perhaps best known to Merck and others, this potentially life-saving information did not receive wide distribution in the popular press.<br/>

<p>Aircraft Spraying AEROSOL Over KIEV, Ukraine<br/>

<p>Authorities in Kiev, Ukraine, Deny [WGFT: Well, they would, wouldn't they] Spraying of "Aerosolized Medication" By Aircraft Over City</p>
<p>The office of Emergency Response in the district of Desniansko, Kiev, are tonight (30th Oct.) strongly refuting reports that light aircraft were spraying a substance over the city intended to counter a "swine flu pandemic" in Ukraine.</p>
<p>It was reported that light aircraft were seen over the Forest market area of the city (close to the Forest metro station) and they were spraying an aerosol substance intended to "counter swine flu", this of course would constitute forced medication (WG Ed: or bioweapon poisoning) of the population.</p>
<p>The editors of local newspapers in KIEV received dozens of phone calls from concerned residents and shop owners in the Forest market area of the city reporting they had observed several light airplanes circling in the sky during the day spraying an unidentified aerosol into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Retailers and local business people reported they were advised to "stay indoors" during the day by local authorities.</p>
<p>Local newspapers contacted government administrators in KIEV and were told ..... (WG Ed: Blah, blah, blah = 'Don't alarm the masses').</p>
<p>Reports of helicopters and light airplanes spraying aerosols over KIEV, LVIV, TERNOPIL, and other cities throughout Ukraine are tonight flooding online forums and websites, hundreds of people have verified the reports with their own eye-witness accounts.</p>
<p>Ukraine Dead Increase to 239 - Still No Sequences<br/>
Recombinomics Commentary ~ November 12, 2009</p>
<p>1,253,558 Influenza/ARI<br/>
65.615 Hospitalizations 239 Deaths</p>
<p>The above numbers are from the latest update from the Ukraine Ministry of Health. The number of deaths increased 26 to 239, so 50 new deaths have been reported in the past 2 days. Although the virus continues to spread (only 5 of the 27 reporting areas have not topped the epidemic threshold) many of the deaths are still being reported from the hard hit areas in western Ukraine (see map). </p>
<p>However, the biggest jump in cases was 6.096 in KIEV to 89,339.</p>
<p>The steady increase in the high level of deaths continues to raise concerns about genetic changes in the H1N1. In this morning's press conference the WHO discussed the need for prompt treatment with Tamiflu, but did not address genetic changes in Ukraine. Only general statements on the stability of the H1N1 were made in response to questions on genetic changes in Ukraine. Today's conference is a week after the last comments on the Ukraine H1N1 sequences which indicated that there were no large changes, but an update would be forthcoming in a "few days". It has now been over a week and no updates on genetic changes have been forthcoming.</p>
<p>THE RELEASE OF THE SEQUENCES FROM<br/>
UKRAINE IS LONG OVERDUE.</p>

<p>MORE LOW FLYING SPRAYING REPORTS - POLAND - NOW PNEUMONIC PLAGUE SYMPTOMS THERE!</p>
<p>The Flu case site has reports of LOW FLYING PLANES SPRAYING IN POLAND - NOW PEOPLE ARE IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM WITH PNEUMONIC PLAGUE SYMPTOMS!</p>
<p>Article:</p>
<p>Reports are coming in of people dying of symptoms similar to the pneunomic plague in an Emergency Room in Bialystok in the north east of Poland.</p>
<p>A doctor reported treating three patients with symptoms similar to the pneumonic plague, including burned lungs. One the patients died in his arms. The doctor said that it appeared be a bacterial infection and that no antibiotics worked. He also thought it could be a more virulent strain of the swine flu.</p>
<p>The victims came from small villages close to Bialystok.</p>
<p>Low flying aircraft were heard in the region a few nights ago.</p>
<p>Cases similar to the pneumonic plague have also be reported in Lithuania, close to the Polish border and to Bialystok.</p>
<p>The appearance of something resembling the pneumonic plague in Poland shortly after low flying aircraft made carried out unexplained missions during the night time in the same area has parallels with the recent incident in the Ukraine.</p>
<p>Witnesses reported low flying planes carrying out aerosol spraying shortly before the pneumonic plague was diagnosed in victims a few days later.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian government and WHO moved swiftly to declare the swine flu virus had mutated to become more dangerous and implement martial law.</p>
<p>This is an email from Poland:</p>
<p>My friend a doctor who works in Emergency Room in Bialystok (Eastern North of Poland) called me saying that he had 3 cases of patients with symptoms similar to the pneumonic plague. "If it is h1n1, so it means that it has changed for very virulent form and it kills in matter of hours". One patient died in his hands. I do not know what happened to other two. He is going to inform me how's the situation, but he expects it to get much worse. No antibiotic works for the disease! </p>
<p>This wouldn't be payback to the Polish people for the Poland government NOT buying the Swine Flu Vaccine would it? (my conspiracy side)<br/>

<p>More Reports of Low Flying Planes:</p>
<p>Reports are coming in of planes flying low tonight over Cracow in Poland also over Derby in the Peak District in the UK.</p>
<p>"We're getting info from our readers in England - there are several slow and low flying planes over Derby "working" for a quite long time (inf from 11;07PM), there is a high wind." </p>
