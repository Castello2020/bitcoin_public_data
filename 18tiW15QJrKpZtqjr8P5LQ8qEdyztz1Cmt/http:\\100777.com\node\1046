by Paula Demers Every time I turn around I will hear over the news, or read in the
paper of the tremendous over population of our planet. This is very
interesting, because if you took the entire population of the world
(roughly seven billion people), and stood them side by side in the
state of Texas, each person would have 1000 square feet! There are
261,914 square acres in Texas (that figures to seven trillion square
feet). So there is enough room just in Texas for every person in this
world to get a piece of land 32 ft. X 32 feet! And that's just Texas!
There is no overpopulation problem! This planets just not big enough
for the rich and the poor to live together, that's the real problem! The above paragraph
is misleading. The problem is not so much over-population itself but
the over-concentration of vast amounts of people into large cities of
very expensive slave-dwellings, where they cannot grow their own food
and live free and healthy lives - JAH.
http://jahtruth.net/greeneco.htm We are also told through various media sources, that we are using up
the earth's precious resources. Yet we have the technology to find a
license plate on a car by use of a satellite. We
have the technology for our government to listen to every phone call
going on in the United States by use of a computer. This computer has
about 400 key words, that if it picks up on any of these words, will
record the phone call. We have the technology to put a computer
chip containing all information on a person in the back of their hand
the size of a grain of rice. We have the technology to put all
information on a person on a strip in the back of their license, that
can be run though a little machine and call up all info on that person.
Is the media trying to tell us that we don't have the ability to use
the earths precious resources wisely to feed and cloth everyone on the
planet? I mean, our government pays farmers not to grow food. Food in
third world countries (e.g., India) is stored in buildings and left to
rot. What is going on here? What would be the purpose of stressing a
fact that isn't even true? For those of you folks who have read the
Iron Mountain Report, you will notice that they stress that the
population would have to be at a controllable level. They give many
examples on how the population could be brought down to a level that
would be controllable. The simple fact is that (according to them),
there are simply too many people on the earth to be controlled at this
point. Most of the world's
17 major fishing-grounds are fished-out due to over-fishing to feed
people living in cities who are unable to grow their own food because
their very expensive slave-dwelling has no land on which they could
grow it and be self-sufficient and thus free from slavery - JAH http://jahtruth.net/syst.htm The following information is taken from the report written by Dr. J
Coleman , (copyright 1992: 2533 North Carson Street, Carson City, NV
89706) "Global 2000: A Blueprint For Global Genocide." I will be using
quotes out of the
report that should get every reader thinking. http://jahtruth.net/300.htm In the first paragraph of the report Dr. Coleman wrote, he stated, "In 1979 I received a copy of a massive
document commissioned by the Club of Rome and written by Cyrus Vance,
three days after President James Earl Carter accepted it as official
U.S. Policy....Global 2000 was unknown outside the Committee of 300 and carefully
chosen official inside U.S. Government circles...." Keep in mind that
many of the ideas for "Goals 2000" came from 19th century thinkers and
writers such as Jeremy Bentham, William Petty-the Earl of Shelburne,
H.G. Wells and Lord Bertrand Russell. (page one, paragraph three) http://jahtruth.net/darth.htm "In his book 'The Impact of Science on
Society' Russell expounded his views on how the world's population
ought to be controlled, so as not to become a threat to the privileged
rulers...." (page three, paragraph five) "We are also witnessing the Great Plagues
of 1987-2000 in the form of a, herpes, cholera, smallpox,
tuberculosis....Aids, as we know, is an artificially induced virus
which in effect is a cancer of the blood. The first experiments were
conducted in Africa on the border of Sierra Leone and Nigeria..." (page
four and five paragraph's five and one) "...namely that the world is populated
with too many redundant people who must not be allowed to procreate and
consume scarce natural resources..." (page five paragraph five) "..jobless people be confined in
concentration camps, run by a joint stock company for profit....Once
committed to concentration camps, inmates would never leave there
alive." (Page six, paragraph two) "Bentham, Shelburne, Wells and Russell
hated the idea of education for the masses....systems in operation that
would allow people to have a vocabulary of no more than 500
words....might help to explain why Alexander King of the Club of Rome
was commissioned to destroy education in America.....A destructed
education system qualifying millions who can barely read and
write....will ensure a society in which the majority can and will be
easily manipulated by men like President Bush, Cyrus Vance, Lord
Carrington and James Baker III." (page six, paragraph five) "The First and Second World Wars were wars designed to kill
millions....wer e not successful enough hence the new methods outlined
in the Global 2000 Report." (page seven, paragraph two) "the mechanism of agriculture and the
industrialization of the world was a terrible mistake....it has led to,
and presently supports, a mass of people who perform no indispensable
service....consuming the limited resources and destroying the
environment of the globe....which they...the Committee of 300
representing the 'preordained leaders' of the world, say is
theirs.....the remedy...lies in destroying an economy based upon
agricultural and industrial expansion, because these support larger and
larger populations of unwanted 'useless eaters'." (page seven,
paragraph seven) http://jahtruth.net/greeneco.htm
"The 'surplus population' thus created is
targeted for death as 'useless eaters' in terms so clearly expressed in
the Global 2000 Report." (page eight, paragraph four) "By the year 2000 the world SHALL have
rid itself of at least 100 million 'useless eaters' and by the year
2050, the number culled SHALL amount to not less than 400 million."
(Page nine, paragraph four) "By the year 2000...cases of AIDS in
America will have reached 10 million, with millions more dying of
AIDS-related diseases like tuberculosis, meningitis, cholera and more
than likely, from bubonic plague. These events were planned and they
are ongoing." (Page nine paragraph five) http://jahtruth.net/why.htm The quotes I have given from Dr. Coleman's report sound pretty
unbelievable. Or do they? Let's take a look at what is happening in our
country. In the report, Dr. Coleman mentioned abortion and the gay life style. Abortion has killed
about 36 million babies. Many in America have been conditioned to
believe this is not murder, but it has reduced America's population by
36 million. The gay life style was
encouraged, because with same sex partners, there is no procreation.
The education system in America has "dumb downed" our children so
much that people are going to and graduating from college who can't
read. Out-come-based Education does not teach the basics of reading,
writing and arithmetic. It is training our children to become "global
citizens". The environmental movement is bringing man down to a level lower
than the animals. In public schools, children are being taught to
worship "Mother Earth". People can no longer do with their property
what they want, but are accountable to the government if they want to
add a room to their house, put a side walk up, cut a tree down. Our weather is being controlled. Droughts, earthquakes, floods,
hurricanes are rampant. People are starving to death because of
droughts in their countries and the food being shipped to them is being
left to rot in storage houses. Aids is rampant. The behaviors that cause the spread of Aids is
being encouraged by our government. Civilian labor camps are being put up on military installations. Saw
an interesting article in the Daily News, January 8, 1995. It was
called "Doing Time On The Outside". It talks about using prisoners to
do work, like construction or road work, while they are in prison to
save the taxpayers money. A sign on outside the Department of
Corrections said, "Inmate Work Crews, Reducing Costs to Taxpayers". As
I was reading the article, the thought kept going through my mind, "Is
this how they are going to get people used to seeing prisoner slave
labor?" Global 2000 doesn't seem to have a list of people who they want to
get. It seems that they consider most of the population "useless
eaters". I do imagine they will go after people fighting this first.
There was no evidence that folks who keep quiet and don't try to get
the word out would be safe. No one will be safe. The Committee of 300
believe that the world is theirs to do with as they want. The rest of
us are excess baggage. This report reminds me of a scripture verse. Matthew 24:21-22, "For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not
since the
beginning of the worl= d to this time, no, nor ever shall be. and
except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved:
but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened." end - Paula Demers. The above is a brief insight into a disease of the mind, the
following is an overview of how the disease has spread across the
world and now infects the minds of the majority. Most do not realise that if we support a political party or any of
the environmental groups, including the greens and green peace then we,
that is YOU and I, support the Club of Rome's objective which is to
remove all 'useless eaters', this effectively means you and your
family, if not then it must be the family next door, because they are
talking about over 50% reduction in the world's population, the ones
that they will look to remove first are those who love freedom,
because individual freedom is not on the
agenda. http://jahtruth.net/illumin.htm
Ask this question: are you supporting
the people who are working to eliminate you by whatever means they can,
cancer, aids, war, starvation, abortion are just some of the means
devised and implemented via world-wide campaigns put in place by these
maniacs to reduce the population. Too monstrous to believe, well think
again, look at the evidence, there is official documentation of the
plan that sets out and supports this official agenda. Yes, it is
extremely difficult for the average mind to come to grips with their
plan. It is beyond human belief, but it is the plan and it being
implemented as you read about it.
When you come to realise what the
plan is you will not only understand why trillions are spent on war and
peanuts on preventing disease and starvation.
Ask yourself why
research into, for instance, breast cancer, childhood cancer and other
diseases is forced to rely on public donations while your taxes are
used to control and kill people in far off places, or ask why the
children's hospitals need to run care-bear programs to raise funds.
http://jahtruth.net/heal.htm
When you ask these questions, you will
also come to realise that this monstrous program is only possible when
the monsters promoting genocide on a massive scale, control of the
popular media who in turn control your attitude and finally what you
think, who also control who will win the seats in the parliaments. If
you are naive enough to believe that the people control who wins the
seats in the parliaments then the popular media mind control program
includes you in their list of victims. http://jahtruth.net/politics.htm
If you believe in not damming rivers, letting the bush take over
farmland, the right of local councils to decide whether you can cut
down a tree on your property then you are a victim of the brainwashing
carried out by the popular media under instructions from the supporters
of the Club of Rome's agenda. The truth is the truth, whether you
accept the truth will depend on the level of success of the popular
media has had brainwashing you.
Why is that people say, - "don't
believe everything we see in the popular media", and at the same time
believe everything the popular media promotes? Why, because they
repeat the lie until we accept it as the truth.
The popular media
promote anything and everything that supports the lie while denying the
existence of all creditable evidence that proves the lie to be what it
is, a lie. Don't believe this? The ask yourself why the popular media
has not covered the President Jimmy Carter's accepted Global 2000 as
official U.S. Policy and the fact that it has not since been rejected
and the popular media never mention it.
Regards, Joe Bryant The ONLY solution is to enforce The Plan
against the N.W.O.
mass-murderer perpetrators of 911 and the phoney
war on terror, all of
the above and much more:- http://jahtruth.net/plan.htm

THIRD-WORLD POPULATIONS
Submitted by xeper (not verified) on May 26, 2007 - 22:47 The simple fact that third-world populations are sustained solely as use by first-world populations toward the maintaining of slave-populations or as fodder for the advancement of a take-over of some shanty town nation is understood however not much voiced as a reality except by the bleeding-heart liberals. We are capable of sustaining ourselves without the use of those that should have been mercifully eliminated years ago. The brutal, uneducated, and unskilled of the planet hinder first-world populations that continue to sustain them, not only trillions of dollars that should be used for our advancement and survival, but also daily places an ever increasing burden of fighting the criminality and poverty those populations bring into first-world populations. An expediant eradication of that which serves no useful purpose either for us nor for them is the only remedy and must be implimented swiftly before those who would be our slaves soon become our masters in that they will continue to ever more curtail our advancement and threaten our very survival. reply

Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on December 12, 2008 - 16:48 people who believe in the irradication of "useless masses" are no longer human. You are a vile beast. The "useless eaters" are only living in these situations because they are pushed into them. If the reality of self sufficiency which is available to the entire world was ever to be created, those who are in control would lose almost all of it. Which is good. The only way to save the world is irradicate the ellitists thinking and those who will not change that view...you are the evil and your future is grim. Your time is almost over, a a new age is dawning and your world will crumble.

Submitted by Pierre F Lherisson (not verified) on July 2, 2009 - 10:47 According to a 2003 U.N report, 25,000 people die each day from starvation.People that are living in third world countries are the most affected.
Draconian actions will be taken when this problem will become an acute crisis worldwide.Economic imperatives will dictate the implementation of Cold logic as substitute for ethics.A breakthrough in space exploration permitting us to live in other planets seem to be our only hope.

Good read...but
Submitted by UFO Bob (not verified) on April 10, 2012 - 04:37 I agree that there is no real over crowding issue but also feel that although we could all quite happily live in Texas, you seem to be forgetting all the cattle and animals that those people consume. Then there is all the shipping and making of goods in China for Western consumption. Most of the poor in the world (the vast majority of the world population, I might add) do live a meagre existence..... We're the ones who expect consumer goods and the latest gadgets. Of course, this is all changing as the rest of the world comes online and wants the US lifestyle with all the trimmings. I don't disagree with the threat that all these educated, clued up people might pose to the ruling elite but it's not quite as simple as it might first appear. reply
Your right that the problem
Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on September 13, 2012 - 16:26 Your right that the problem is not easy. A lot of people do want the resource consuming lifestyle America has. However instead of unblocking
a lot of the patents/ inventions that could extend these resources and develop New Energy like Teslas invention (see Thrive the movie) the
Elite chose to suppress them and perpetuate a false reality for their control and wealth purposes...Imagine what creativity could be unleashed and
it would be great to see humanity as caretakers and masters of resources rather than a perpetual drain on them as Americans are drilled in school...

Your article is very interesting and I read it with much enthusiasm. There are about 900 million useless eaters in India. You can take all of these and give them space in Texas,NY,California,Virginia or Maryland. Good luck!
