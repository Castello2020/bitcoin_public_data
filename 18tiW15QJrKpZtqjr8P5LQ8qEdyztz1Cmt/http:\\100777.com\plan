<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><b>Hello and welcome </b>to
the newest and most unique Freedom Concept on the Internet. Your decision
to print out and read this booklet will be the wisest one you will ever
have made. <b>THIS</b> is the information that the men of the New World
Order are <b>absolutely terrified</b> that you will discover, because contained
in this free e-booklet and related free links, and other materials, are
the seeds of their destruction. I guarantee that after reading this, your
life and the way you look at life, will be changed forever!</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Study this material very
carefully. In less than 180 days you could help defeat the New World Order
using the <b>ONLY</b> plan that is <b><font color=#000000>guaranteed
to work</font></b>, which you are about to learn. With God on your side,
helping you every step of the way, you'll be amazed at what you can achieve
in such a short time!</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Let me give you an example
of why it's important to get all of the facts before making a decision.
If I promised you $5 million to jump out of an airplane without a parachute,
would you do it? If you quickly answered "no" you lost an easy $5,000,000.
You see, the plane I was asking you to jump from was parked on the ground.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Don't lose a great opportunity
by "jumping" to conclusions about the concepts you are about to read. Please
go through the entire booklet before you make any judgments.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Have you been futilely searching
to live a joyful life in Peace, Freedom, and Justice under the rule of
men's laws, only to find yourself on the outside looking in to their "Just
Us" <a href=http://jahtruth.net/syst.htm>system</a>? Are you tired of having your wealth,
freedom, and God-given rights constantly eroded, or even brazenly stolen,
by evil people working for an <a href=http://jahtruth.net/syst.htm>unjust system</a>, stacked
against you, and controlled by an unseen few? Have you been reading and
hearing about an ever-increasing number of other freedom-loving people
who have been actively battling the system, and caused you to wonder, "if
so many people are waking up to what's <b>really</b> going on, then why
are things continuing to get worse?" Have you been bravely fighting your
OWN good fight, possibly even winning some battles or suffering persecution
by the forces of evil, but feeling like the small but important victories
are simply drops in the ocean? Does all this make you feel like the New
World Order is going to win no matter what you do, and you've even considered
giving up - that fighting it isn't worth all the effort? That is <b>exactly</b>
how the N.W.O. wants you to feel, isn't it?</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Take heart, don't lose faith,
all is not lost yet. Deep down, you <b>know</b> that Good will ALWAYS triumph
over evil in the end, or you wouldn't have already felt the desire to fight
evil and injustice, and help put things right. Can it possibly be that
the forces of good are not prevailing against evil, because the freedom-fighters
have <b>not yet</b> discovered HOW to fight them correctly? It has been
said that, except for God our Father, and Christ - The Master, six of our
greatest teachers are: Who, Why, What, When, Where, and How. In order to
help you understand the <b>only </b>way HOW to wisely fight and defeat
the New World Order, this booklet will draw from the source of all Wisdom
(Father and His Christ), and present that Wisdom through the eyes of these
six great teachers. Rejoice, your prayers have been answered and your <b>search</b>
for The Way to True freedom, peace, and prosperity is now over, but the
work to achieve it is just beginning.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>OK. Let's get going. I know
you are eager to learn how to finally defeat the New World Order, and in
doing so, be delivered out of the <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/syst.htm>slavery</a></u>
of its sinister system. There is a lot to learn, and a very short time
left in which to learn it, so follow this very carefully and whatever you
do, <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/if.htm>don't quit</a></u> - your life depends on learning
this vital information!</font></font>

<h1>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font color=#1822CD>CONDITIONS FOR SUCCESS</font></font></h1>
</p><p><br/><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Before we proceed I want
you to put aside any preconceived ideas you may have on how to defeat the
New World Order. Forget all the advice you've been given until now. You
need to concentrate on every single word you are about to read. If you
are skeptical, put your doubts aside until you've finished reading the
whole booklet, then you can decide whether the information I'm giving you
is credible or not. In the meantime, just read on!</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>If you have already had some
negative experiences fighting the New World Order, forget about that too!
You <b>must</b> understand that you have been working with fatally flawed
concepts and techniques... even though they are still being used and taught
by almost every "patriot/freedom fighter" Guru in America. Ask yourself,
if any of these previous theories <b>really</b> worked, then why is the
New World Order continuing to advance unabated toward its goal of totalitarian
world domination, with the state of the world rapidly getting worse?</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The fact is, that all the
other hotly promoted freedom techniques you may have heard about just <b>don't</b>
work in the real world! To be truly successful in fully reclaiming ALL
of your God-given rights of Life, Liberty, Peace, Joy, Health, and Abundant
Prosperity, you will have to completely re-think your strategy and precepts.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>What I am going to show you
is the new, simple all-conquering method that needs to be used by ordinary
people to liberate themselves. Once you discover these techniques and start
using them, you will wonder why <b>everybody</b> doesn't adopt the same
strategies! They can make you FREE, sure and simple! The answer is <b>SO</b>
obvious and logical that it has escaped the "patriot" community for decades,
and was right in front of them and you <b>ALL</b> the time. Now is the
time to have the scales removed from your eyes, and clearly see things
as they really are.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>It is important to realize
that fighting the New World Order is not at all like fighting an adversary
who fights fair or follows rules. Nothing in the deceitful web of the Babylonian
beast system is what it appears to be... except the fact that right now
they have you tightly in their clutches, because you have not yet learned
the right way to break free! I'll be talking quite a bit about the true
nature of the Beast, and how to correctly fight on a whole different level,
but right now, I just want you to understand that you can't think like
a regular freedom-fighter and expect to be successful against this type
of evil opponent!</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Most people come into the
freedom movement, learning a few things, and then thinking they can prepare
a dynamite "revocation and rescission" letter stating: they have learned
about the fraud of the system, and that they are giving notice of revoking
all implied contracts like having a social security number; and send certified
copies of the letter to one or more government agencies, and then expect
to receive a letter back saying, "Ok, now that you've caught us, we admit
it. We are dreadfully sorry for sinning exceedingly. We acknowledge and
confirm that you are no longer subject to our tyrranical bureaucracy, please
don't send us any more money, and we will leave you alone from now on.
And please don't send this confirmation letter to any of your freedom-loving
friends." The results are invariably very disappointing! You can pack your
letter with all sorts of questions and demands to be shown the valid laws
that give them the alleged authority to do the fraudulent things they are
doing, knowing that there are none, and you supply every court-case cite
in the book (from your endless hours of legal research) that clearly demonstrates
why you are NOT subject to their fraudulent laws... but it still won't
work!</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>It wasn't until I started
studying the Bible techniques of <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/mosgib.htm>Moses</a></u>,
David, Jesus, and some other highly successful spiritual giants, that I
began to see where I was going wrong. I'm going to let you in on their
secrets in a few minutes!</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Now I started to rethink
my definition of success! I still wanted to be prosperous, but what's the
good of having bundles of money stashed away in a bank account, unless
you have the good health and freedom to enjoy it with your family and friends!
What good is it if you have to work 18 hours a day on the system's <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/workers.htm>treadmill</a></u>,
seven days of the week, or even gain the whole world and lose your soul
(Luke 9:25)?</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>You've got to be able to
earn your daily bread automatically and without spending a lot of time
and energy doing it!</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>That freedom is what characterized
the really successful dragon-slayers, and it's what I want for you and
me! It's why I am sharing and giving you all this information free. If
you follow it exactly as I've laid it out, it will bring you the kind of
freedom that you've always dreamed of! In only a few weeks, you'll see
the change in your life beginning. Then, gradually, the flow will increase,
and the workload will diminish, until you'll be able to put your life on
auto-pilot and turn your attention to the things that make life worthwhile.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The first step in becoming
a winner is to start thinking like one! You probably already know that
a good self-image is important to your general well-being, but it's unlikely
that you really realize how crucial it is to your success! If you are going
to be free, you have to know that you are going to win. You have to view
yourself as a truly free person and start thinking and acting like one.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>One of the most effective
things you can do to bolster your self-image is to make sure that you are
emulating Jesus at all times. <b><i>Matthew</i></b> 17:19 Then came the
disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?</font></font>
<br/><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>17:20 And Jesus said unto
them, <font color=#1822CD>Because of your <b>unbelief</b>: for verily
I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say
unto this government, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove;
and <b>nothing</b> shall be impossible unto you.</font></font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Now that your commitment
to freedom and prosperity is firm, tell your family and friends. Study
the Master's Plan! Make sure everyone knows you are serious! You are going
to be working very hard for the next couple of months, and you will need
their support. Set your mind on establishing The Kingdom and there'll be
nothing holding you back. Go for it!</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Moses said: "Proclaim Liberty
throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof."</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>That's true, but there are
some rules you must follow to make the Kingdom a reality!</font></font>
<br/>&nbsp;
<h1>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font color=#1822CD>THREE IMPORTANT KEYS
TO SUCCESS</font></font></h1>
</p><p><br/><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><b>The first key is Divine
Timing.</b> Being in the right place at the right time and being on the
right side. Well, this <b>is</b> the right time and the right place. You
wouldn't be reading this if you didn't already believe that, would you?
Get in tune with God's Master Plan - not only fighting injustice The Way
He wants you to, but doing those things at the right times that He wants
them done. But you must also make sure you are completely on the right
side.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>"To every [thing there is]
a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: A time to be <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/resure.htm>born</a></u>,
and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up [that which
is] planted; A time to kill, and a time to <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/heal.htm>heal</a></u>;
a time to break down, and a time to build up; A time to weep, and a time
to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; A time to cast stones,
and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to
refrain from embracing; A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep,
and a time to cast away; A time to tear, and a time to sew; a time to keep
silence, and a time to speak; A time to love, and a time to hate; a time
of war, and a time of peace." <b><i>Ecclesiastes 3:1-8</i></b>. By the
time you finish reading this booklet, you will learn that <b><font color=#000000>NOW
is the time to fight.</font></b></font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><b>The second key is God-guided
Vision.</b> You have to be able to see the opportunity and predict your
eventual success. I hope that by the end of this booklet I will have opened
your eyes to the fantastic opportunities available to you in the Master's
Plan. If I can do that, you'll be on your way to a fulfilling, wonderful
new life. Within a very short time, you'll have more freedom than you ever
dreamed possible.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><b>The third key is determined
Action.</b> This is <b>the most critical of the three Keys</b>... taking
immediate advantage of the opportunity at hand.... getting started right
away before the window of opportunity closes! Everyone knows that "every
journey begins with just a single step" but some illogical fear of failure
keeps most people from ever starting on the road to freedom! However, all
of these fears vanish if you have an all-consuming goal. Obstacles are
nothing but frightful things that appear when you take your mind off your
goals. If you are serious about establishing a free and prosperous society,
then read on.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Actually, I could think of
a thousand reasons for not becoming involved even though I hate the Beast-system!
So could you. But that will never lead us to a life of freedom and prosperity. We
should instead, examine every opportunity for ways that the Master's Plan
can work for us. Remember, opportunity knocks just once. Misfortune leans
on the doorbell!</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Knowing that success is the
result of actions not intentions, would you put off setting out on that
journey to freedom, if I can show you how to do it quickly, with practically
no capital outlay, and a minimum of effort? I hope not, because that is
exactly what I am going to do and I am trusting that you'll grasp the concept
and run with it as fast as you can!</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Whatever you do, don't let
this amazing opportunity slip out of focus. When you have finished reading
this manual, act immediately! Pass it to as many other people as you can.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Wisdom says that if you are
going to make a change in your life, you should do it immediately and determinedly!
Whatever you do, when you finish reading this booklet, get started immediately
developing your new life ....and do it "determinedly"... with all the energy,
enthusiasm and determination you can muster! You've got to be either part
of the steam roller, or part of the pavement.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The three keys above are
the catalyst that make the following Success Secrets work. But they won't
do you any good if you don't act at once and put them to work for you right
away. Remember, you aren't alone in wanting to be free. There are millions
of other people trying to set themselves free too and they are your potential
allies! Don't wait until they've committed to something else that will
only fail, like all the other plans they have made in the past! Start today
and you could be free and prosperous, within 180 days!</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>As important as they are,
however, the keys will do nothing more than get you started on the road
to success. Now you have to learn how to "walk the walk". To do that you
will need to know some important background information, to put things
in perspective and keep you in balance.</font></font>

<h1>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font color=#000000>AN IMPORTANT LESSON
FROM HISTORY</font></font></h1>
</p><p><br/><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>It has also been said
that, "Those who refuse to learn from the mistakes of history are doomed
to repeat them". That makes sense, doesn't it?</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>If that quote holds true,
then in order to understand your situation of today, and avoid making the
same tragic mistake(s), it would be helpful to search back in time for
an identical situation, then examine and compare it to yours. What created
those circumstances, both then and now? How were those times the same as
today, and how were they different? Can you think of an identical situation?
If none comes immediately to mind, then please allow me to pick one that
can be found in what has proven to be the <b>MOST (ONLY) reliable and accurate</b>
history book in the world: The Holy Bible (King of kings' Version; and
previously, the Authorised king James Version).</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The beginning of our story
takes place nearly 4,000 years ago. Through a unique sequence of events,
as described in the Book of Genesis chapters 37 &amp; 38-41, Joseph, the
eleventh son of Jacob/Israel became the governor/ruler of all of Egypt;
second only to, and as appointed by, the pharaoh. When famine struck Egypt
and the rest of the known world, including the land of Canaan where Jacob
and his family dwelt, Joseph saved all his kin, as detailed in Genesis
chapters 42-45, by bringing them from Canaan, feeding them for the remaining
five years of the famine, and the pharaoh giving them land in the Goshen
territory, which was the best land in all of Egypt (Gen. 47:5-11).</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The Israelites in Egypt,
initially under Joseph and in succeeding generations, prospered and multiplied
immensely. They were a separate nation within the geo-political boundaries
of another nation, but were not under man-made Egyptian law. Under God's
Perfect "Royal Laws of Liberty", with Him as their only Ruler, each Israelite
family was economically independent. They had their own land within Egypt,
they grew their own crops, raised their own livestock (cattle, dairy cattle,
sheep, and possibly fowl &amp; other small game), and made their own clothes
from their own wool, cotton, and animal skins, and did so in <b>such abundance</b>
that they could share or sell their surplus goods. In short, God supplied
<b>more
than</b> all that they needed to sustain themselves. They knew their neighbors
well and there was a strong sense of community. Except for the busy planting
and harvesting seasons, they had plenty of free time to enjoy the blessings
of living free, quiet lives and also the time to
<b>pass on their Godly
knowledge and customs</b> to their children (Deut. 6:7).</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Without having a formalized
system of written laws, for several generations the early Israelites were
giving God's demonstration of how wonderful it was to live under His Laws,
with Him as their only sovereign; living in joy, peace, freedom, self-reliance,
and prosperity, and their number grew from the 75 that initially occupied
Goshen, including Jacob/Israel, to around three million Israelites (Ex.
1:6-7). Then a pharaoh and his advisors came to power in Egypt, who didn't
know (or didn't care to know) how God had used His servant Joseph to save
Egypt, and were very fearful of being overrun by the Israelites, so they
sought to bring them under Egyptian control. Instead of marvelling at their
system of success and wanting to join them, the pharaoh plotted with his
government advisors to take them and their property another way (Ex. 1:8-10).
They couldn't attack the Israelites militarily because the Egyptians were
far outnumbered, and the Israelites were a closely knit community, despite
their vast numbers.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The Israelites would have
to be tempted, seduced, and deceived, into <b>volunteering</b> into bondage
- gradually and subtly - and then the pharaoh could "legally" (under men's
laws) confiscate their wealth. The details of this process are sketchy
at best, but it appears that Egypt underwent a huge program of "public
works construction projects", of such a grand scale that created enough
steady-paying jobs in the cities to offer/entice the flourishing and industrious
Israelite population.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>If the pharaoh's target audience,
the Israelites, already had all that they needed, as provided by God, then
exactly what could have possibly influenced them to give up that idyllic
way of life to work in the cities? That is hard to know for certain, but
the Israelites <b>were</b> giving God's demonstration in the midst of the
Egyptian Empire and at the crossroads of the entire known world at that
time, so it was only a matter of time before outsiders and travelers would
see their example and desire to reject Satan's market-system and man-made
Egyptian "laws" themselves, and want to <b>join</b> Israel, spreading the
word, and enlarging Israel's borders. God's Plan was to gradually graft-in
the surrounding peoples &amp; nations until the entire world became the
Kingdom of Heaven on Earth. Since Satan's plan is the opposite of God's
plan, he couldn't sit still and let that happen. He <b>HAD</b> to get the
Israelites away from giving God's demonstration and into his worldly market-system.
He is the ultimate salesman/con-man, and it was all-important for him then
(as it <b><u>always</u></b> is), to attempt to thwart God's Plan, so he
not only (telepathically) dictated to the Egyptians all the most appealing
things to say, but was also whispering in the mind's ears of the Israelites
the things that would most cause them to believe those lies.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>We human+Beings have a very
long and consistent history of listening to Satan's seductive lying voice,
then believing it, giving in to temptation, and doing our own will (Satan's
really) instead of God's; you only need to read the stories of Adam &amp;
Eve, Cain &amp; Able, Noah vs. the rest of the world; and Abraham vs. the
people of Sodom &amp; Gomorrah for proof of that. Given our Free-will,
God allows Satan to tempt us as much as he wants (Job 1:6-12, 2:1-10),
which provides God with countless opportunities to <b>know</b> which voice
we prefer to listen to: either <b><font color=#1822CD>God</font></b>
(through the Holy Spirit) or <b><font color=#CC0000>Satan</font></b>
(through the selfish human nature); and whether we choose to do good or
evil.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Also, human memories are
short, and humans tend to get complacent when everything is going great.
They are more likely to relax their standards and over time <font color=#000000><b>forget
</b><u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/nsong.htm>the very foundations and principles</a></u></font>
they followed that brought them to that "everything is going great" situation.
Complacency can breed the mind-set of wanting to try "new, foreign, exotic,
etc." things - because "having it all" isn't enough for humans: the selfish,
greedy, <font color=#000000><u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/natgra.htm>human nature</a></u>
</font> <b>always</b> wants more. This also seems to foster a short-term
or short-sighted perspective. Perhaps, especially to the young adults,
life in the city appeared more exciting than "just watching the grass grow".
The easily accessible shops with their availability, amounts, and varieties
of: foods, clothing, goods, idols, entertainment, and "modern conveniences"
of those times, could have been very dazzling and seductive. They probably
started out just working in the cities and commuting from their farms,
maybe believing the jobs would only be temporary, but then actually sold
the farms and bought houses in the cities to be closer to their jobs, after
it appeared the "employment" was permanent, thereby losing their independent
ability to feed and clothe themselves.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Whatever the specific "carrots
on the sticks" were, the Israelites were lured into leaving the land to
initially work in the Egyptian government/market system as "employees".
Because they had <b>volunteered</b> into joining the Egyptian economic
system, and were receiving "benefits" from it, they were then bound by
Egyptian law and required to pay the 20% "increase tax" previously established
for the Egyptians by Joseph (Gen. 47:23-26). After a couple of generations
of living in the cities/flesh-pots of Egypt, the Israelites lost their
knowledge and experience of agriculture and would have found it difficult
to return to that simpler more healthy way of life. Once they became dependent
on their Egyptian government jobs, the Israelites became economic slaves,
and then later turned into out-and-out slaves.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>As a people, the Israelites
went from enjoying an unequalled existence of peace and abundance, letting
God provide for their earthly needs, under His Royal Laws of Liberty, to
joining Satan's market system and putting their faith in the "market forces"
influences of: supply and demand - and their inherent fluctuations and
even artificial manipulations. These fluctuations may have created boom
&amp; bust cycles, and under those conditions, the Israelites may have
had to borrow (usury) during lean times. They also may have borrowed during
plentiful times in order to buy "big ticket" items that they felt they
needed immediately (instant gratification), instead of putting money aside
over time to save up and buy them without usury. The Israelites had assimilated
into, and adopted, the <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/xmas.htm>idolatrous
Egyptian ways</a></font></u> and customs, and were no longer giving God's
demonstration. The descendants of Jacob/Israel had clearly fallen a long
way from believing only God, as Abraham did - and they had to be humbled,
before God would fulfill His unconditional promises made to Abraham.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Allowing the Israelites to
fall into Egyptian slavery served an important purpose in God's <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/mastplan.htm>Master
Plan</a></font></u>: to <b>train</b> and <b>prepare</b> them to be His
SERVANT nation and DEMONSTRATION people (Matt. 23:11-12; Mark 9:34-35;
Luke 22:24-27). Hopefully, <b>remembering</b> our slavery and <b>remembering</b>
being delivered from it by God, would help us to always remain <b><font color=#1822CD>grateful</font></b>,
<b><font color=#1822CD>obedient</font></b>,
and, above all, <b><font color=#1822CD>humble</font></b>, and that yearly
<b>reminder</b> was the main purpose for the Feast of <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/passnot.htm>Passover</a></font></u>
(Ex. 13:3-10; Deut. 8:2-3, 16:1-12, 24:17-22), but it is the doom of men
that they forget - even with written Laws and <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/teltn.htm>other
reminders</a></font></u>. Could that be the reason why Father is once again
allowing us to suffer under our enemy's burdens? So when He delivers us
(those who turn to Him) a third time out of slavery, we will NEVER again
forget; like we did twice before; how awful it is to believe that we know
best, wrongfully believing we can run the world better than Him, rather
than simply trusting and obeying God, AND humbly doing His Will instead
of our own?</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Another reason the Israelites
may have been more easily lured away from, and then forgotten, their Godly
principles was because those principles were taught orally, from memory.
Once people spent too much time working daily in the market system and
became pre-occupied with "having and getting", those oral teaching customs
fell out of practice. The next time, it would be different. The written
<b>Mosaic
Covenant</b>: the Commandments, Laws, Statutes, Judgments, Agricultural
Policy, Economic Policy, and Diet, <b>AND</b> the Israelites' knowing,
their voluntarily, and intentionally <b>sworn oath</b> to <b>DO</b> according
to that Covenant (Ex. 19:7-8; Deut. 5:23-29, 26:16-18, 27:11-26, 29:14-15;
Josh. 24:15-16); was to serve as <b>the schoolmaster</b> to bring men to
Christ (Gal. 3:23-27), and as an objective reference guide for the people
to know if/when they were doing wrong and how to correct it. The Sabbath
Law/Commandment sets aside one full day of rest per week, to be used to
study and teach The Law, without any distractions such as any type of work.
The Levitical priests were to administer The Law, including performing
the sacrificial rites for those people who transgressed The Law and who
brought their sin offerings for atonement (at-one-ment), to restore their
"oneness" with God.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The ancient Israelites of
about 1500 B.C. had been in Egypt for 430 years (Ex. 12:40), though it
is unclear exactly how much of that time they were free versus how many
years they were in transition to, and then in, outright bondage. What IS
clear is that their oppression reached a point where the suffering under
pharaoh's "laws" became so unbearable, they cried out to God for deliverance
(Ex. 2:23-25). God heard their cries and through His servant Moses, led
them out of Egyptian slavery (Ex. 3:1-12). On Mt. Sinai, God gave Moses
the "Perfect Laws of Liberty", in the form of the stone tablets containing
the first Ten Commandments, and 5 scroll Books of His Laws, Statutes, Judgments,
Agricultural Policy, Economic Policy, and Diet; also known as The Torah
(Hebrew, meaning "<b>The Law</b>"), which comprises the first five books
of The Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Would keeping The Law be
any easier or different for the Israelites who witnessed firsthand God's
Power in: the 10 Plagues of Egypt, the Fire in the Sky, the parting of
the Red Sea, the manna from heaven, the water from the Rock, etc.? Unfortunately,
even with all those miracles and wonders that God showed them still fresh
in their minds, they still doubted and disobeyed Him and, among other disgraceful
incidents, they created the golden calf, while Moses was on Mount Sinai
receiving the stone tablets and 5 scroll Books of The Law. Moses even said
later, "Ye have been <b>rebellious</b> against the "I AM" from the day
that I knew you" (Deut. 9:24). Later, during the Joshua-led conquest of
Canaan, the Israelites didn't always follow God's instructions (Deut. 7:1-6,
12:1-3, 20:1-18), not always completely destroying the conquered people
and their idols (Josh. 7:1, 11-26, 13:13, 16:10, 17:12-13).</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>When Moses presented God's
Laws to the people, it was part of a spiritual <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/marguide.htm>marriage</a></font></u>
ceremony: God the husband, the <b>nation</b> as His wife, and taking His
name - thence being called "Israel" (meaning: "Champion of God"), and the
Israelite people as the "children of Israel". It was at this wedding ceremony
that all parties took their solemn vows and entered into a <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/covt.htm>Covenant</a></font></u>
relationship. Except to some extent during the reigns of kings David and
Solomon, Israel as God's wife-nation, has <b>never</b> kept its promises
made at Mt. Sinai, and has never fully been God's "demonstration people"
on Earth, of how wonderful it is to live under His Perfect Laws of Liberty.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>We are told in Deuteronomy,
chapter 28, that if we <b>follow</b> The Law, we will be <b>Blessed</b>
and <b>everyone</b> will enjoy their share of the <b>abundance </b>of crops
that God promised that <b>He</b> would make grow in the land (<b>without</b>
the need for chemical sprays and fertilizers), and <b>He</b> would fight
our enemies for us (Deut. 20:3-4, 28:7); but if we <b>don't </b>follow
<b>The
Law</b> and allow <b>greedy evil men</b> to make up <b>their own laws</b>
to suit themselves, the land would <b>fail</b> and we <b>will
</b>suffer
slavery, oppression, pestilence, disease, famine and death (the rat race
- employee is just a modernized word meaning <b>slave</b> - <i>think about
it</i>) under The Curses written into The Law as a punishment for not following
it.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>God, unlike men, ALWAYS keeps
His promises, and warned us pointedly in those same Books of The Law, that
we WOULD be unfaithful to Him, and when we did He would put away His wife,
the nation Israel, and drive the children into the hands of our enemies,
and then make us forget who we are (our Kingdom Identity). He also promised
that if we, the "children of Israel" would turn to Him and return to keeping
<b><u>His</u></b>
Laws in The Covenant, even in the <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/signs.htm>Latter Days</a></u>,
then He would deliver us (Deut. 4:23-40) out of our enemy's hands.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The Israelites had failed
to keep His Laws in the Promised Land of Palestine. The Kingdom was first
split into the 10-tribed Northern Kingdom of Israel and the 2-Tribed Southern
Kingdom of Judaea. Then, because the Israelites failed to repent and return
to His Laws, just as God promised/prophesied, the people of the Northern
Kingdom were carried off into captivity and slavery again, this time by
the Assyrians, around 722 B.C. The people of the ten northern tribes were
released from Slavery, when the Assyrian Empire fell (Isa. 66:19), because
they had repented and sworn to go forth into a new land to keep The Law
there, that they had not kept in their own land. Over time they migrated
("scattered abroad") to the North &amp; West to God's appointed "place
of safety" in "the isles afar off", and then eventually lost the <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/celtisr.htm>knowledge
of their identity.</a></u></font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Also as God had promised,
because they also failed to repent and return to His Laws, the people of
the Southern Kingdom were similarly carried off into captivity and a second
period of slavery, this time by the Babylonians around 604 - 588 B.C.,
with some dispersing to the North &amp; West, but also a remnant returning
to Palestine. The people of the Southern Kingdom were released to return
to Jerusalem to rebuild the House of God and keep The Law there and throughout
Judaea.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>About 600 years later, God
our Father sent His eldest Son, known to us on Earth as Christ Jesus, to
be an incarnated, living <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/noti.htm>example</a></u> of The Way
(Covenant) in action and how we must <b>be</b> in order to enter His Kingdom,
in other words, how to keep here on Earth, God's unchanging Laws of the
Universe. Christ Jesus came not to destroy The Law and the Prophets, but
to fulfill them, and even added the <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/sprtlzd.htm>spiritual</a></u>
dimension, plus two Commandments - making the 12 Laws of Heaven - the <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/comand.htm>Twelve
Commandments</a></u>. The Law was the schoolmaster to bring us to Christ,
and Christ came the first time and will soon come again, as The Master
to bring us (those who want to) back to keeping The Law.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>God also promised that, in
the "Latter Days", He would send a leader to re-gather and reunite ALL
12 Tribes of Israel under one <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/christfg.htm>banner</a></u>,
or ensign (Isa. 11:1-16), and deliver them a third and final time out of
the slavery of men's evil laws and system, that they have sold themselves
into, again. Why did God make all these promises to, and a Covenant with,
the Israelites? What was so special about <b>them</b>? For the answer to
those questions, we must briefly go further back in time to Abraham, who
was the twentieth generation of the lineage of Adam, and tenth generation
from <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/noah.htm>Noah</a></u>.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/abraham.htm>Abraham</a></u>
loved his son Isaac more than anything else in the world. <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/isaac.htm>Isaac</a></u>
was the "miracle" son and heir that he waited 100 years to have; but Abraham
loved God even more. He was given the ultimate test to prove that love
by having to offer Isaac as a sacrifice to God; and having passed the test,
was stopped by God at the last moment, and became a "friend of God". After
Abraham proved his faithfulness, God made promises to him and his descendants
- promises that were unconditional, and taken together are known as the
Abrahamic Covenant. When God used His servant Moses to lead Abraham's descendants
out of Egyptian slavery, He made some more promises to them, but unlike
the Abrahamic Covenant, the "Mosaic Covenant" was wholly conditional. His
promises were either Blessings or Curses, and what they received depended
on whether or not the Israelites were keeping their promises to God under
that contract / Covenant.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Is there anything vaguely
familiar to you about this story? Could a parallel be drawn between it
and America's history beginning with the Puritans and Pilgrims, in the
early 1600's, to its accelerating decline over the last 100 years, to today?
Although most of them are asleep in its matrix, can you see that <b>all</b>
Americans have been secretly led into, and are now under, an oppressive
system of economic bondage, as God predicted, -</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><b><i>"But this [is] a people
robbed and spoiled; [they are] all of them trapped in [pigeon] holes,"</i></b>
(like 9 to 5 pigeon holes, the jobs that they have, where they work as
slaves for the system), <b><i>"and they are hid in prison houses:"</i></b>
(a lot of people have been wrongly imprisoned), <b><i>"they are for a prey,
and no-one delivereth [them]; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore [their

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>- and only a short time away
from being turned into obvious slaves? Can you see that it has been a patiently
gradual process (known as "Fabianism") of getting the would-be slaves to
<b>unknowingly
volunteer</b> themselves into slavery, little by little, until the oppressors
decide it is the right time to remove the veil of deception - just as the
Egyptian pharaohs did to the early Israelites?</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>You may be thinking, "when
did God predict all this would happen <b>in America</b>? Nothing is ever
mentioned about Americans in the Bible and Koran." The Covenant was made
between God and the Israelites of 3,500 years ago, so how did YOU become
obligated to perform under that Covenant? When did YOU become a "modern
Israelite"? Later in this booklet you will find a listing of the "modern
dispersion" Israelite nations of today's world. Depending on what you have
read and studied, you may or may not know that if you are living in one
of those countries, which includes; but is not limited to; all of the English-speaking
nations, then you are most likely a true racial descendant of Jacob/Israel,
or you are a "stranger" (non-Israelite) living within the gates/camp of
Israel. According to The Law, ALL of Jacob/Israel's descendants, and ANYONE
living within True Israel's borders, including non-Israelites, <b>are bound
by The Covenant.</b></font></font>

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>All that is happening to
the True Israelites today, is <b>all</b> predicted in <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/theiofk.htm>prophecy</a></u>
in the Holy Bible. If you study The Bible closely, you would find that
a full two-thirds of it is prophecy. When properly interpreted, it is clear
that more than ninety-nine percent of those <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/enoch.htm>Biblical
prophecies</a></u>, which are given by The Ruler of The Universe (Who ALWAYS
keeps His promises), have <b>already</b> been fulfilled in exact and <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/asean.htm>minute
detail</a></u>, as can be proven by comparing His Prophecies to <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/chiefdan.htm>known
world history</a></font></u>. In fact, these prophecies have been fulfilled
in <b>SUCH</b> exact and minute <b>detail</b>, that it is but a <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/bibcode.htm>tiny
demonstration</a></u> beyond our limited comprehension, of the awe-inspiring,
infinite mind that conceived and meticulously carried out this <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/mastplan.htm>Master
Plan</a></font></u>. Ask yourself, wouldn't it be reasonable and logical
to believe that the remaining less than one percent of those prophecies
will also be fulfilled, likewise, in exact and minute detail?</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>What about our Free-will
to choose to keep The Covenant or not? Wouldn't that affect the carefully
laid-out blueprint? God's Plan for us was set-up in such a way that the
history of the True Israelite people, and the rest of world history for
that matter, has always flowed along two possible paths. God's promises
were stated in such a way that He was always able to keep them, whether
<b>we</b>
kept our promises or not.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>So that's the situation that
we're in today, but not for any lack of God's warnings to us. He's <b>told</b>
us what would happen: the people have their noses to the grindstone, everybody's
oppressed, and people have been robbed under false legislation. YHWH ("I
AM"), or Father, has been calling to His people, and He says:</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><b><i>Isaiah</i></b> 42:18
Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.</font></font>
<br/><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>42:19 Who [is] blind, but
My servant? or deaf, as My messenger [that] I sent? who [is] as blind as
[he that thinks he is] perfect, and blind as the "I AM"'s servant (Israel)?</font></font>
<br/><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>42:20 Seeing many things,
but thou takest no notice; opening the ears, but he heareth not.</font></font>
<br/><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>42:21 The "I AM" is well
pleased for His Righteousness' sake; <b>He will magnify The Law</b>, and
make [it] honourable (Deut. 33:21).</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>He's obviously not talking
about physically deaf and blind people, He's talking about <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/etvisit.htm>spiritually
deaf and blind</a></u> people, because He says "Look and hear that you
may see and hear"; and the "I AM"'s servant, the messenger, the people
that He's talking to, are the people Israel, the "10 Lost Tribes" of True
Israel which includes the American people. As you have read above, and
will find later in the "modern dispersion" listing, you are included as
a modern Israelite. You'll notice in verse 21 it says, "He will magnify
<b>The
Law</b>, and make [it] honourable". He <b>doesn't</b> say the American
Constitution, which we'll discuss in detail later in this booklet. He
<b>doesn't</b>
say the <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/britmon.htm>English Legal System</a></u>. He says
"The Law", and He means <b>His Law</b>, in the Bible, in the Torah, which
is in The Covenant, the original of which is buried at the Hill of Tara,
and that's what we need to recover - as an unmistakable, undeniable Call
for <b>everyone</b> to return to it.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Some would observe that because
of modern technology (including communications/monitoring), and the fact
that every territory on the Earth is claimed to be ruled by one man-made
government or another, that the oppressive situation is much worse today
than in any previous era, including the times of the pharaohs. That may
be true, but one common element in the "voluntary slavery" process is the
loss of personal, self-sustaining land, regardless of levels of technology
(see <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/illumin.htm#Protocols>Protocol 6, #4</a></u>). The majority
of Americans are now living in cities and suburbs for the convenience of
living near their place of work. They only need a "job" because they have
left God's Laws and His blessings, and the land which provided all of their
needs. The trend of people leaving the self-sustaining land to move to
the cities, and leaving the farming of the nation's food supply in the
hands of less people, created a "farming market-system industry", and created
the necessity of those fewer farmers to borrow money for automated, labor-saving
farming equipment to work their larger farms. Who did they borrow money
from? The Hidden Hand banksters, of course. Then, through the Hidden Hand's
manipulation of the financial, futures, and commodities markets, they drove
many farmers into bankruptcy and forced them to sell their farms to <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/gmterm.htm>corporate
farming companies</a></u> owned by... the <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/horse.htm#HidHan>Hidden
Hand</a></u>.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Those in the suburbs and
more rural areas may have enough land for a token vegetable garden and
some fruit trees, but nothing like a fully self-sustaining amount of acreage
sufficient to include grainfields and livestock grazing, plus the facilities
to store and process those raw foods into "dinner table" forms of meat,
breads, dairy, etc. They still have to go to the supermarket for most of
their food, fulfilling <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/columb.htm>Columba/Columcille's
prophecy</a></font></u> about "Milk over the country will be churned in
one churn" (centralization of food production, processing, and distribution),
and be <b>dependent on someone else</b> to ensure a plentiful supply, and
at a fair price (see <a href=http://jahtruth.net/illumin.htm#Protocols>Protocol 3, #7</a>).
In the cities (high concentrations of Satan's evil market system) it is
even worse, as people are packed into row-houses, tenement buildings, and
high-rises, without any land except perhaps a window/terrace flower box.
Even those who believe they own their land are deceived, because if they
are paying property taxes to the current "legal owner" (under men's fraudulent
legislation), then they are only the equitable owner - a tenant, like in
the feudal system (please see the Ames excerpt below). The fastest way to
find out who is the <b>legal</b> owner is to stop paying property tax and
see who sends you notices, or knocks on your door, demanding payment.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>In addition to being land-less,
and having to buy the basic living necessities like food, clothing, electricity,
water, etc., from someone in the market system, your oppressive enemy monitors
and controls your day-to-day personal life. They maintain this control
through compulsory: permits; zoning ordinances; government inspectors and
"needing" their approval; universal identification numbers, like the Social
Security Number, required for almost every application form and transaction;
licenses (marriage, business, professional, hunting, fishing, etc.); birth
certificates; state-issued travel documents (driver licenses, passports);
registration of property (cars, boats, etc.), etc.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>They also use sophisticated
and comprehensive information collection and processing like: closed circuit
t.v. cameras on street corners to monitor neighborhoods, with "eliminating
street crime" given as the official reason; the census and computerization
of all personal records with sharing or selling of your information by
those who have access to it; computer software with trojan horses and backdoors
built-in, to snoop through your personal computer files; fingerprint and
DNA databanks; and progression to an electronic-commerce "cash-less" system,
to track every single transaction; and more. This is to say nothing of
the fact that since you are operating in their market system, you are forced
to use their "money" as well, and they control and manipulate its relative
value. Your enemy has its own private, corporate <b>police</b> (Note: they
are NOT lawful "peace officers") and other various "law" enforcement agencies
and bureaucracies, to make sure you comply with their <b>policies</b>,
created by the legislation of <b>political</b> parties and <b>politicians</b>,
making more and more things "illegal" to extort fines and other moneys
from honest Law-abiding people.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Are the modern Israelites
crying out yet for God's help, or have things not gotten quite unbearable
enough yet? Do you have children? Then you are forced to have their healthy
bodies injected with some kinds of substances (does anyone <b>really</b>
know what is in those syringes?) under the government's vaccination/innoculation
program (<b><a href=http://jahtruth.net/illumin.htm#Protocols>see Protocol 10</a></b>), or
they can't attend compulsory government public or private schools. Do you
"home-school" your children? Then you must do so in accordance with their
rules, approved curriculum, and supervision. Stephen Ames in Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania, while fighting the tax system, was being persecuted under
the official government charge (among other unfounded and ludicrous charges)
of "teaching from The Bible, without training". The <b>real</b> reason
is: that he is dangerous to the Hidden Hand's plan because he researches,
uncovers, and promotes the Truth of their frauds. Here is an excerpt from

<font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Government agencies, like the
Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS) in New Jersey, will come to
your home with a court order, abduct your children, and put them into their
sinister foster care system. Many of these foster parents in that system
are unfit, to say it kindly, and are only doing it to receive government
living subsidies which they spend on themselves. There are countless accounts
of children unnecessarily living in unhealthy (physically &amp; mentally),
unloving, and even dangerous environments, being repeatedly moved from
one foster home to another, and suffering from sexual and other abuse;
in addition to the initial and ongoing trauma of being taken from their
happy, stable, natural family. Meanwhile, the natural parents' life is
hell attempting to find and regain custody of their own children, and all
of this nightmare situation is usually based on a mere (usually trumped-up)
<b>suspicion</b>
of the natural parents impropriety, which the government agency never bothers
to prove. It sounds like the agency is correctly named, since the <b>service</b>
it seems to provide is the forced, unlawful <b>division</b> of the <b>youths</b>
(children) from their Godly <b>family</b>.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>God created humans as males
and females as part of His plan for teaching, with the human family being
the most basic unit of society for instruction. In fact, The Law <b>commands</b>
the parents to <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/olamfod.htm>teach The Law</a></u> to their
children (Deut. 6:4-9, 11:18-20). Satan's government/market system, with
its "state-as-owner-and-protector from cradle to grave" mentality, attempts
to destroy God's plan by usurping the natural parents and The Law's place
in the life of a child. If that is the opposite of His plan, then why would
God let that happen? As briefly mentioned earlier, The Covenant contains
Curses as a punishment. Among those Curses, God promised to deliver YOU
<b>into</b>
the hands of your enemies (Deut. 28:25, 47-52, 68), and give your children
to your enemies (Deut. 28:32, 41).</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Are you still wondering <b>why</b>
all this is happening yet AGAIN? Why did Father allow this to happen to
you? Why would He curse and punish His people? Why did He allow you to
end up trapped in pigeon holes, robbed and spoiled, hidden in prison houses,
to be for a prey, and no-one is delivering you; for a spoil, and none says,
Restore your share to you? Hopefully you've already discovered and understand
the reason "why". History has repeated itself because of the two tragic
unlearned lessons of: 1) failing to analyse the mistakes of the past, to
avoid repeating them, and 2) failing to realize that the root cause is:
living under men's laws instead of keeping God's Laws in The Covenant.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><b><i>Isaiah</i></b> 42:24
Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the "I AM",
He against Whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in His Ways, neither
were they obedient unto His Law.</font></font>
<br/><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>42:25 Therefore He hath
poured upon him the fury of His anger, and the strength of battle: and
it hath set him (Israel - the American people and all the other related
peoples) on fire round about, yet he understood not; and it burned him,
yet he took [it] not to heart (did not learn from it).</font></font>
<br/><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><b><i>Hosea</i></b> 4:6
My people are destroyed for lack of My Knowledge: because thou hast rejected
My Knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to
Me: seeing thou hast forgotten The Law of thy God, I will also forget thy
children. 4:7 As they were increased, so they sinned against Me: [therefore]
will I change their glory into shame.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Quite clearly Father is telling
you that He has allowed this to happen to teach you a lesson, and the reason
it's all happened, is because you haven't kept His Law. You haven't kept
His Ways, His Statutes, and His Judgments, "neither were they obedient
unto His Law." The Israelites are suffering under it, and they <b>still
haven't learned the lesson</b>! That you're only suffering, and you are
only being allowed to suffer by Father, because they/you're not keeping
His Law, which was given to Israel to <b>protect</b> them/you from oppression
by these rich and powerful people of the New World Order. In Scripture
it says, "I will go [and] return to My place, till they (Israel) <b>acknowledge</b>
their offence, and seek My face: in <b>their affliction</b> they will seek
Me <b>early</b>" (Hosea 5:15). So He is allowing all this to happen to
His people, for them/you to be afflicted, so that they/you will seek Him,
and seek the solution to their/your problem (Ps. 119:65-80).</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Now that you have a better
understanding of WHO <b>YOU</b> ARE and WHY this suffering has happened
to you, then the obvious solution of WHAT to do and WHEN to do it would
be: come out of the worldly Egypt/Babylon slave/market system, and return
to God's Royal Laws of Liberty, <b>now</b>!</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>But wait a minute, what about
those people who <b>are already</b> trying to come out of Egypt/Babylon,
and are suffering persecution for their efforts, and perhaps you are one
of them? Are you someone who is living as best he can without using a Social
Security Number, opted out of the income tax system, driving a car without
a state-issued license and license plates, etc., and dealing with all of
the bureaucratic and "legal" attention that goes along with it? With the
good intention of becoming more successful fighting the enemy, some "freedom-lovers"
manage to find and form groups with like-minded people (strength in numbers).
These well-intentioned people keep getting themselves into trouble because
they don't understand what the Bible says, and they don't understand that
God has already told them all this is going to happen, and He's told them
exactly what to do to put it right. He will let them get into trouble,
and you'll have Wacos, and you'll have all sorts of other problems until
you turn back to God in your affliction, you seek Him early, and return
to His Law.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Your enemy knows exactly
what all these "resistance" groups are doing. They send their agents to
infiltrate them, and while these covert agents pretend to be against the
New World Order, they monitor and encourage those true freedom-loving people
to show themselves, so the Hidden Hand know who to pick-off or round-up
at the right time (<a href=http://jahtruth.net/illumin.htm#Protocols>See Protocol 18</a>).
All the while, the N.W.O. distracts the sleeping masses with entertainment,
sports, gossip, etc. (<a href=http://jahtruth.net/illumin.htm#Protocols>Protocol 13, #3</a>).
It gets to a point where you become paranoid and don't know who you can
trust anymore. In trying to protect and preserve your privacy and freedom,
you live your life almost like a fugitive, trying to <b>live between the
cracks in the system</b>, waking up every day wondering, "is THIS the day
when they bang on my door and move against me?" Wouldn't the simpler solution
be to scrap the counterfeit system altogether and just live?</font></font>

booklet, the question was posed, and part of the answer was given in the
question: Can it possibly be that these well-intentioned people are not
prevailing against evil, because the freedom-fighters have <b>not yet</b>

INTO the hand of your <b>enemies</b>, as a punishment, and it is apparent
that He has made good on that promise, then it would seem there is another
WHO involved. God has also promised to help you deliver yourself OUT of
your enemy's hand (Deut. 30:1-8), IF you do it <b>His Way</b> and follow
His instructions <b>exactly</b>. Before we can look at the When, Where,

of the world wide conspiracy that can simply be called by one name: the
<b><font color=#CC0000>Hidden
Hand</font></b>.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>There is nothing new about
the "New World Order". What you may not be fully aware of is that the current,
organized, Satanic conspiracy for world domination against God and His
"champion of God", Jacob/Israel, provably goes back at least 2,600 years,
and the seeds of its origin are provably almost 4,000 years old! How can
that be <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/bibproof.htm>proven</a></font></u>?
By looking it up in our ultra-reliable history (<b>His</b> story) book,
written by the Ruler of the Universe, Whose words are <b><u>never</u></b>
wrong.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Earlier in this booklet it
was stated that God made unconditional promises/blessings to Abraham (Gen.
22:15-18), because he <b><u>proved</u></b> his worthiness through his humility
and 100% trust in God. God promised to exceedingly multiply and bless Abraham
and his descendants, and give them possession and control of the key strategic
areas of the Earth, and that ALL families of the Earth would eventually
be blessed - through <b>Abraham</b> and his seed (Gen. 12:1-3): specifically
through the lineage of <b>Isaac</b> (Gen. 21:12, 26:1-6) and <b>Jacob</b>
(Gen. 25:23, 28:10-15), since God repeated those blessings <b>directly</b>
to them.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Abraham had passed on God's
unconditional Blessings to his rightful heir, Isaac, who possessed the
lawful Birthright, being the eldest/only son of Abraham's first wife, Sarah.
Abraham previously had a son, Ishmael, with Sarah's handmaid/bondwoman,
Hagar, and after Sarah's death (Gen. 23:2) he would also have other sons
with his second wife, Keturah (Gen. 25:1-2), but according to The Law,
Isaac possessed the natural Birthright unless he somehow proved himself
to be unworthy. Isaac <b><u>proved</u></b> his worthiness of both the Blessing
and the Birthright, (just as Abraham did - through his humility and 100%
trust in God) by allowing himself to be sacrificed by Abraham on Mt. Moriah.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Then came the potential for
division or conflict, and where the seeds of today's conspiracy are found,
when Isaac and his wife Rebekah had twin sons, Esau and Jacob. What was,
and still is, the significant difference between Jacob/Israel and Esau/Edom
that has caused this major, world-wide conflict between their descendants?
The answer will be revealed in the following paragraphs, and in the rest
of this booklet.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>According to The Law of the
Firstborn, the elder of the twin brothers, Esau possessed the natural birthright
over Jacob, and ordinarily should have had that and also received the blessing,
passed on from dad to son. However, Esau <b>sold</b> his birthright to
the younger twin Jacob for a bowl of pottage (Gen. 25:29-34). On top of
that, Esau would later take a wife from outside the Shemitic, approved
kindred stock, when he married a Hittite from the daughters of Canaan.
Canaan was the cursed son of Ham (Gen. 9:25-27), who was the youngest of
Noah's three sons (Gen. 9:18, 10:6).</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Previously, Abraham set about
the solemn parental obligation of choosing a suitable bride for his son
Isaac, and before sending out his eldest servant to find her, he made the
servant swear to <b><u>not</u></b> let Isaac choose a wife from the daughters
of Canaan, but from the stock of his own former country and his own kindred
(Gen. 24:1-9, 32-38). The servant went to Abraham's former country, prayed
to God to send him the right woman for Isaac, and lo and behold the first
woman to come along was Rebekah. Isaac not only <b>humbly and obediently
trusted</b> and accepted the God-guided choice made for him by his dad
(Matt. 23:9), but it turns out he fell in love with her as well.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>When it came time for Esau
to marry, he <b>arrogantly made his own choices </b>(two Canaanite women,
Gen. 26:34; and later, an Ishmaelite, Gen. 28:8-9), and disregarded his
grand-dad Abraham's instruction to carefully choose from the Shemitic,
"Covenant" stock, and avoid the local daughters of Canaan (Hamites). These
Canaanite marriages were very grievous to Isaac and Rebekah (Gen. 26:35).
From these two incidents alone (selling the birthright, and the Canaanite
marriages) it is clear, Esau was not inclined to "do the works of Abraham",
and doesn't seem deserving to receive and pass on The Blessing given by
God to Abraham, which had been passed on to Isaac.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>As Isaac aged and neared
death, there came a time when he told Esau that he would pass on his Blessing
to him, after Esau went out hunting and brought him some venison, and Rebekah
overheard this conversation. The Bible is silent on whether or not Isaac
(or anyone else except the two brothers) knew that Esau had previously
sold his birthright to Jacob. After Esau went out to hunt the deer, Rebekah
acted to fulfil God's intentions that <b>He</b> told her directly (Gen.
25:21-23), concerning her sons. Rebekah convinced and helped Jacob to deceive
Isaac by having him wear Esau's clothing, and pretending to be Esau just
long enough to receive The Blessing from Isaac that went along with The
Birthright (Gen. 27:1-30). Despite having some qualms about it, Jacob <b>humbly
and obediently trusted</b> and accepted the God-guided choice made for
him by his mom (Gen.27:6-14), who herself trusted that God's Word to her
would be successfully fulfilled.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>When Esau returned from hunting
and realized that Jacob now also had The Blessing, he cried bitterly and
desperately begged Isaac to bless him also. Self-pitying Esau, doesn't
accept responsibility and blame for <b>SELLING</b> his birthright, but
instead complains: "Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted
me these two times: <b>he took away</b> my birthright; and, behold, now
he hath taken away my blessing." Isaac had already given to Jacob, the
entire blessing that he received from his dad, Abraham, who had received
it directly from God; a blessing that now included Jacob's brethren and
entire nations bowing down to serve him (Gen. 27:28-29); but because Isaac
loved his <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/contra.htm>firstborn</a></font></u>
Esau so much that he wanted to give him <b>some</b> kind of blessing, under
the circumstances, he gave him the best blessing he could:</font></font>
</p><p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><i>Genesis</i> </font></font></b><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>27:39
And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall
be away from the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;</font></font>
<br/><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>27:40 And by thy sword shalt
thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass <b>WHEN
thou shalt have the dominion</b> (Deut. 28:47-48), that thou shalt break
his yoke from off thy neck.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Esau hated Jacob because
of the blessing he received, especially compared to what he had expected
- the blessing that Jacob had received. He swore to get even... he swore
he would kill Jacob after Isaac died. While Esau's wrath was still hot,
Isaac and Rebekah sent Jacob to Rebekah's brother Laban's house in Padanaram,
for refuge and to also select a wife from their Covenant kindred. Jacob
and Esau would not see each other again for over 20 years, and Esau never
did personally exact his revenge against Jacob, but some of Esau's descendants
NEVER forgot what they were/are deluded into believing was stolen from
them, and the directors and members of the Hidden Hand, have been actively
and relentlessly working to steal back The Birthright and The Blessing,
ever since.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The Hidden Hand's propaganda
apparatus deceptively promotes their claim of racial descent from Abraham,
Isaac, and <b>Jacob</b>/Israel, even though most of the men at the highest
levels of the <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/illumin.htm>Hidden Hand</a></u> privately <b>know</b>
full well that they are <b><u>NOT</u></b> descended from Jacob/Israel.
They know, and are proud of the fact, that they are descended from Esau/Edom,
and they are also descended from non-Abrahamic, other lineages, and have
been actively working to enslave or eliminate Jacob's true descendants
for over 2,600 years.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>How have the <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/freedman.htm>conspirators</a></u>
been trying to steal The Birthright and Blessing? By fraudulently creating
similar conditions in order to make it <b>appear</b> to be the same way
that Jacob "stole" it (as they would wrongfully see it) from Esau. They
are publicly wearing Jacob/Israel's "clothing" and pretending to be True
Israel (Matt. 7:15-20), thereby deceiving the true Israelites out of their
rightful heritage, as part of their grand scheme of getting them to volunteer
into bondage, in order to make them spiritually and materially destitute
to the point where they willingly trade their inheritance for worldly possessions.
The Edomites are not trying to deceive Isaac (who is long gone) into giving
it to them, and following Divine Will, but by deceiving Israel's blinded
(to their true identity) descendants. It is not for the Edomites, or even
the Israelites for that matter, to decide who carries the Birthright and
Blessing, it is God's right to choose.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Despite the Hidden Hand's
propaganda and attempts at deception, it doesn't change the fact that 95%
of all modern Jews are not true racial Israelites, they are Khazar Jews
descended from Esau/Edom. The Khazar Jews, or Eastern Jews, were an ancient
warrior race of Turkish (Edomite / Idumean - Esau) origin who had interbred
with the Ashkenazim and converted to Judaism en masse at the end of the
8th century AD. Although basically Turkish, the Khazar state bore little
resemblance to the other Turkish empires of central Eurasia. It was headed
by a secluded supreme ruler of semi-religious character called a khagan
- who wielded little real power - and by tribal chieftains, each known
as a beg. The Khazars seem to have been more inclined to a sedentary way
of life, building towns and fortresses, tilling the soil, and planting
gardens and vineyards. Trade and the collection of tribute were major sources
of income. They were conquered by the native Russians and the mass of Khazars
remained in Russia under their own closely-knit Talmudic government. They
ghettoised themselves and lived under strict Talmudic Law, segregating
themselves as far as possible from their host nation, except in the areas
of occupation which could be used to carry out the Talmudic edicts to profit
from their host. The Ashkenazim people are descended from Japheth (Gen.
10:1-3), the eldest of Noah's three sons.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Also, contrary to what some
"Kingdom Identity" people believe, the Germanic, Latin, and Slavonic peoples
are NOT racial Israelites, either; in fact, they have been True Israel's
enemies throughout history. The Germanic people are descendants of the
Assyrians who migrated north and west after the fall of their empire. One
of many clues is that the German Knight's cross is identical to the Assyrian
Knight's cross. Germany has <b>always</b> fought against <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/britca.htm>Great
Britain</a></u> at every chance, and never fought with them. The Latin
people are obviously descended from the Romans, who are descended from
the <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/robab.htm>Babylonians</a></font></u>.
The Slavonic people are descended from Japheth and, not being Shemites,
could not possibly be racial Israelites. All true racial Israelites are
descended from one of the twelve sons of Jacob/Israel, who was descended
from Abraham and Isaac, who were descended from Shem (Shemites/Semites),

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The real tragedy is that
all of this conflict is so unnecessary, and ANYONE can become a Spiritual
Israelite, without resorting to force, deception, theft, or any negative
or evil means. If all of these conspirators would have used their supposedly
superior intellect in the loving and positive direction, and constructed
a society that kept only God's Laws, thereby <b>HELPING everyone</b> keep
The Covenant, the conspirators would have already easily <b>earned</b>
through their good works, a share of the Birthright and Blessing that they
have been so deviously working to steal. By going about it the evil way
that they have, the conspirators have only guaranteed that they will NEVER
be blessed (Matt. 21:19), and all of their wasted efforts will only get
them thrown into <b><font color=#CC0000>The Fire</font></b> along with
Satan, soon, on Judgment Day.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>What <b>is</b> a Spiritual
Israelite, which is much more important than being a Racial Israelite?
The word "Israelite" simply means champion of God - "<b>THOSE WHO DO GOD'S
WILL</b>". It does <b>NOT </b>refer to the Israeli nation of today or the
jews, it refers to "<b>those who DO God's Will</b>", i.e. the "children
of God." Anyone who <b>DOES </b>God's Will, (champions His Cause) not his
own, is a "child of God" by adoption or "Israelite" (Hebrew). The 12 tribes
of Israel is meant, not only literally, but also metaphorically, to represent
<b>ALL</b>
the tribes of the world (Luke 13:29) because of the grafting into Israel
of the gentiles. <b>ANYONE</b> who <b>KEEPS</b> the <b>COMMAND</b>ments
and <b>DOES</b> God's Will is automatically an Israelite and grafted-in
(Matt. 12:48-50, Mark 3:33-35, Luke 8:21), even someone who is racially
a Khazarian jew, Assyrian, Babylonian, Hamite, or Japhethite, etc. What
about someone who currently and wrongly belongs to an organized religion
such as jews, christians, moslems, hindus, <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/buddha.htm>buddhists</a></u>, etc.? Yes, once enlightened to <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/x_files.htm>The
Truth</a></font></u>, anyone that <b>KEEPS</b> The Covenant and <b>DOES</b>
God's Will until the End, <b>will be</b> among the "Elect" who inherit
The Kingdom. What our human bodies <b>are</b> is not as important as what
we (our <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/celtrein.htm>Spirit Beings</a></u> / Minds) <b>BELIEVE</b>
and <b>DO</b>, and it is <b>that</b> which will determine whether or not
we enter The Kingdom.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The easiest and best example
of the "grafting-in" is: Mohammed, who, like all arabs, was descended from
Abraham through Ishmael - not Isaac and Jacob/Israel. Mohammed was not
religious, he was just a believer, who strove himself, and taught the striving,
to do God's Will. Mohammed was given the third part of The Bible, known
as the Koran (the gospel of <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/louis.htm>unity</a></u>), in order
to enlighten and unite all mankind. The True Koran, which can be found
in the <b><font color=#1822CD>King of kings' Bible</font></b>, is <b><u>not</u></b>
the <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/hadith.htm>Hadith</a></font></u>,
and is in complete harmony with both the Old and New Covenants/Testaments
of The Bible, when correctly interpreted. The Hadith is what the <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/kaba.htm>Meccans</a></font></u>
wrongfully use as a foundation for the moslem/islamic religion, just as
the non-Israelite jews wrongfully use the Talmud as the basis for the jewish
religion, instead of following the True Torah. Although a true, racial
Israelite is more likely to answer the Call to come out of Babylon and
fight for God, you should think of <b>every person</b> as a potential ally
and give them the same chance to prove themselves (Matt. 12:30, Luke 11:23,
John 8:30/King of kings' Bible) through their works.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Conversely, it is <b>not
enough</b> just to be a racial Israelite, either of the 10-tribed House
of Israel (Joseph) or the 2-tribed House of Judah, if you're not keeping
The Law and obeying God. The Israelites were, and still are, forever meant
to be the "Salt of the Earth" (Num. 18:19; 2Chr. 13:5). Only by faithfully
keeping The Covenant and doing God's Will, is His blessing Power realized.
It is <b>that</b> keeping Power which not only maintains the "Salt" at
its freshest and best, but that pure and unspotted "Salt" helps to preserve
from corruption, and multiply His blessings, in every portion of the world
in which He places it (Gen. 12:3; Matt. 5:14-20). Not by activity in this
case, but simply by its existing, by <b>serving</b> as an effective <b>demonstration</b>,
by its <b>quality</b>. Otherwise, the salt is good for nothing except to
melt winter ice on sidewalks/pavements for safe walking under foot (Matt.
5:13).</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Jesus told you about the
Roman centurion. When the centurion asked him to cure his servant, he said,
"I haven't found so much faith, no, not in Israel." - as in this man (Matt.
8:5-10,13; Luke 7:1-10). Then he made the statement that, "many shall come
from the East and West, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and
Jacob, in the Kingdom of Heaven", and the children of the Israelites would
be cast out into outer darkness (Matt. 8:11-12). So, it's no good just
being a racial Israelite and thinking that everything depends on that,
and you don't have to do anything. If you're not championing God's Cause
to reinstate His Laws, Statutes, and Judgments, and to set-up His Kingdom
on Earth, then you're not really an Israelite - not in the true sense of
the word. You claim to be one of His people, but you can't be His people
if you don't obey Him. You are the children of whom you obey. If you obey
God you are His children, if you obey Satan then you are Satan's children.
You must choose whom you will obey (Josh. 24:14-15).</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Think about that. Think about
it very, very carefully. Who are you <b>really</b> serving? If you don't
fight them, then you are part of the problem and you are serving the New
World Order, and they are serving Satan, and that means that by default
you are serving Satan. In the words of Edmund Burke, "All that is necessary
for evil to triumph, is that good men do nothing". You have to fight these
people. God has told you if you don't do it and reinstate His Laws, that
He's going to burn you up, because it's only through your works, by fighting
these people and reinstating God's Law, that you will prove to God whose
side you are on (2Esdras 9:7; James 2:12-26). It's no good just saying,
"oh, well, we're on your side, but we're going to sit here and do nothing
and we're going to help the New World Order, because we're not going to
fight them." There is no sitting on the sidelines as a spectator - YOU
have to fight them. Anyone who is not <b>actively</b> <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/fightfor.htm>fighting
for God</a></u> against evil, <b><u>His</u></b> Way, is automatically helping
Satan and his Hidden Hand system, and will NOT be among the "Elect" (Matt.
22:1-14).</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Why would you <b>WANT</b>
to actively or passively help the Hidden Hand achieve their goals? Do you
even know what their short and long term goals are? In other words, what
does stealing back the Birthright &amp; Blessing mean to <b>them</b>? What
would be in it for you if they succeed? Do you think you will be well-rewarded
and accepted into their elite club with open arms? They will <b>pretend</b>
to welcome you, as long as having you "on side" serves their purpose, but
do you want to know what the evil men of the Satanic Hidden Hand <b><u>REALLY</u></b>
think about you, behind their phoney smiles and "glad" handshakes? Do they
consider you to be a "Sovereign Citizen" or among the "God's Chosen People",
or even a human+being? In order to gain some insight, please read the following
quotes and excerpts from their own documents, which are not editorialized
or paraphrased - they are verbatim, in their own words:</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><b>Protocol 2, #5 </b>"Each

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>"This is quite clear from
the following passages quoted from the Talmud and other Rabbinical talmudic
writings, which also show the continuing agenda of world domination through
the destruction and manipulation of the Gentile nations, which is still
carried forth by the elders and their followers over 600 years after it
was first accepted by them as their so-called official Yahwist manifesto:&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>'Just the Jews are humans,
the non-Jews are not humans, but cattle.' (Kerithuth 6b, page 78, Jebhammoth
61). 'The non-Jews have been created to serve the Jews as slaves.' (Midrasch
Talpioth 225). 'As you replace lost cows and donkeys, so you shall replace
non-Jews.' (Lore Dea 377,1). 'Sexual intercourse with non-Jews is like sexual
intercourse with animals.' (Kethuboth 3b). 'The birth rate of non-Jews
has to be suppressed massively.' (Zohar 11, 4b). 'It is permitted to deceive
a Goi.' (Babha Kama 113b), 'Do not have any pity for them, for it is said
(Deuter. Vii,2): Show no mercy unto them. Therefore, if you see an Akum
(non-Jew) in difficulty or drowning, do not go to his help.' (Hilkoth Akum
X,1). 'Even the best of the Goyim should be killed.' (Abhodah Zarah 26b,
Tosephoth). 'When a Jew has a gentile in his clutches, another Jew may
go to the same gentile, lend him money and in his turn deceive him, so
that the gentile shall be ruined. For the property of the gentile (according
to our law) belongs to no one, and the first Jew that passes has the full
right to seize it.' (Schulchan Aruk, Law 24)&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Again, there are many more
such instances in the Talmud where the Gentile - especially the Christian
- is labelled as subhuman and as merely there to be exploited or exterminated.

in the Talmud as the inheritance of the Gentile nations, supposedly under
Yahweh, but really under Satan."&nbsp;</font></font>

You have been called here to recapitulate the principal steps of our new

<h1>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font color=#FF0000>THE PROTOCOLS OF THE
LEARNED ELDERS OF ZION</font></font></h1>

</p><p><br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Now that you have a better
idea of WHO your enemy is, let's examine WHAT their plan of conquest has
been. Their strategy that they laid out was compiled into a document known
as "The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion", and a copy had managed
to come to light in France in 1884, and through a series of copies and
translations, were first published in England and America in 1920. The
story of how it came into general circulation is contained in the "The
<u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/"illumin.htm#Protocols Proof">Protocols</a></u>
of the Learned Elders of Zion, Proofs of an Ancient Conspiracy", by Ivan
Fraser.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>In its travels and translations,
The Protocols have managed to avoid being completely suppressed, and its
content has also survived numerous attempts over the years at being discredited
by the Hidden Hand. Much in the same way that God has preserved His Truth
as revealed in The Holy Bible, despite numerous attempts by evil people
to delete, alter and mistranslate/misteach parts of The Bible, God has
preserved this "anti-Bible" and its authenticity, to help His people understand
our enemy and their Satanic plan at the right time, to enable us to act
in accordance with His Master Plan to destroy His/our enemy. To give you
a general idea of how your destruction has been arrogantly and deviously
planned by the Hidden Hand, the following are only the headings and sub-headings
of each of the 24 Protocols.</font></font>

OF MAN-MADE

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Most patriots are focusing
all their efforts on protecting, defending, and restoring the 1787/1789
Constitution for the united States of America (as compared to the 1871
U.S. [Inc.] Constitution, for the District of Columbia), but few if any
realize what a fruitless exercise that is, especially when they are labouring
under the <b>false belief</b> that these or <b>any</b> man-made Constitution
keeps, or is even based on, God's Laws. Most people are unaware that the
constitution was <b>given</b> to them by the people of the New World Order
in order to distract, deflect, and keep them away from God's Law. The Hidden
Hand never could have set up the New World Order if God's Law was in force,
so they had to put in the Constitution. They've written all these nice
speeches<b>*</b>, that sound very noble, but the whole thing is to keep
people away from God's Laws. If people had kept God's Laws, then there
would <b>be</b> no New World Order; there would have been no Ruby Ridge,
no Waco, no Sand Point, Idaho - all of these things (and the very real
prospect of more of the same in the future), none of these things would
have happened.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><b>*Protocol 5, #8: "</b>In
all ages the people of the world, equally with individuals, have accepted
words for deeds, for they are content with a show and rarely pause to note,
in the public arena, whether promises are followed by performance. Therefore
we shall establish show institutions which will give eloquent proof of
their benefit to progress."</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><b><i>Leviticus</i></b> 25:10
And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout
all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto
you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return
every man unto his family.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>A perfect illustration of
deeds not following "show" words and symbols, is the Liberty Bell. The
united States of America claim to be the land of the free, and a portion
of the above Torah quotation was inscribed on their Liberty Bell: "Proclaim
liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof." Conveniently
for themselves and their NWO bosses, the authors of the constitution omitted
the rest of The Law, and this partial quotation was/is only propaganda,
paying lip-service to appear noble, while disguising the fact that in practice
the government acts in opposition to God's Law. The partial Bible reference
from Leviticus is written on the Liberty Bell, but neither is it, nor its
principle, written anywhere in the constitution. The Law says that every
50 years shall be a jubile year, which includes all debts being canceled,
and every Israelite's possessions restored to them. It has been 212 years
since the 1789 ratification of the constitution, which means if The Law
<b>was</b>
being kept, and the American people were doing what God wants them to do,
then there should have been jubile years in: 1839, 1889, 1939, and 1989,
in which all debts were canceled, right? Were YOUR debts canceled, and
your possessions restored to you in 1989? It is therefore not surprising
that the Liberty Bell is cracked and will not ring.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>What we're really up against
as far as the New World Order is concerned, is that Satan gets the New
World Order and his politicians, who are all part of that, to make up rules
and regulations to prevent people from doing what God wants them to do,
and they make up other rules in order to force people to do things that
God doesn't want them to do, in order to control the people. The tragic
situations at Ruby Ridge, Waco, etc. were the result of people doing it
wrong. Your enemies claim authority from the constitution, and justification
from their legislation for their criminal actions. The only way to defeat
the New World Order, and it is the ONLY way to defeat the New World Order,
is to get rid of all their legislation and go back to God's Laws.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>You should read the full
text of the Protocols to learn of your enemy's master plan for your enslavement
and destruction, and how "constitutions" fit into that plan, but since
it may not become immediately obvious to you, further explanation is probably
necessary to point out just where the American and <b>ALL</b> other government
"constitutions" have come from - <b>written by</b> the Hidden Hand, as
part of their devious Satanic plot of world control and domination.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><b>Protocol 10, #10:</b>
"Liberalism produced <b>Constitutional States</b>, which took the place
of what was the only safeguard of the goyim, namely, Despotism (Deut. 17:14-20);
and a <b>constitution</b>, as you well know, is nothing else but a school
of discords, misunderstandings, quarrels, disagreements, fruitless party
agitations, party whims - in a word, a school of everything that serves
to destroy the personality of State activity... Then it was that the era
of <b><font color=#006600>republics</font></b> became a possibility that
could be realised, and then it was that we replaced the ruler by a caricature
of a government - by a president, taken from the mob..."</font></font>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><b>Protocol 3, #2:</b> "The
constitution scales of these days will shortly break down, for <b>we have
established them</b> with a certain lack of accurate balance in order that
they may oscillate incessantly until they wear through the pivot on which
they turn. The goyim are under the impression that they have welded them
sufficiently strong and they have all along kept on expecting that the
scales would come into equilibrium. But the pivots - the kings on their
thrones (Deut. 17:14-20) - are hemmed in by their representatives, who
play the fool, distraught with their own uncontrolled and irresponsible
power."</font></font>

<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><b>Protocol 10, #8:</b>
"Under various names there exists, <b>in ALL countries</b>, approximately
one and the same thing: <b>Representation</b>; Ministry; <b>Senate</b>;

have divided up among themselves all the functions of government - <b><font color=#006600><i>administrative;
legislative; executive</i>*</font></b>; wherefore they have come to operate
as do the organs in the human body. If we injure one part in the machinery
of State, the State falls sick, like a human body, and ...will die."</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>If you believe that your
rights come from men who write constitutions, then you have to believe
your rights can be taken away by men in those same positions of power,
whereas if you believe (as you should) that your rights come from God,
then only God can take them away. In this section is a side-by-side comparison
which highlights just five of the many possible differences between <b><font color=#1822CD>God's
Laws</font></b>, and the <b><font color=#006600>United States Constitution</font></b>,
and the <b><font color=#CC0000>Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion</font></b>.
You will probably not be surprised to learn that The Protocols are the
complete and exact <b>opposite*</b> of God's Laws, but you may be very
surprised to discover that the American Constitution is <b>also</b> in
OPPOSITION* to God's Laws, and in HARMONY with The (Satanic) Protocols.
That really shouldn't be <b>too</b> surprising when you take into account
the fact that most of America's "founding fathers" were masons, and that
the Masonic Lodge had been infiltrated by (Illuminati founder) Adam Weishaupt
in 1777; had been taken over by the Hidden Hand, before the American Constitutional
Convention of 1787, and is still to this day under complete control and
direction of the Hidden Hand.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>* The word/name "Satan" is
Hebrew, and means "The OPPOSER". After reading the full text of The Protocols,
you should also realize that no man or group of men, on their own, are
capable of conceiving them. The hand of evil men may have written them
out, and taken the credit, but of ideas so sinister and a plan so devious,
the true author who dictated them into their minds could only be: <b><font color=#CC0000>The
Opposer, Satan</font></b>.</font></font>

<td>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>On September 17, 1787 twelve State
delegates approved the Constitution for the united States of America, and
the States became the Constitutors. What is the legal definition of the
term, "constitutor"? A <b>Constitutor:</b> In the civil law, one who, by
simple agreement, becomes responsible for the payment of another's debt.

<b><i>(Blacks
Law Dictionary 6th Ed.) </i></b>The States were now liable for the United
States debt owed to the King of England, but the people of America were
not yet liable, because they were not a party to the Constitution since
it was never put to them for a vote. On August 4, 1790 an Act was passed
that, for all intents and purposes abolished the States and created Federal
Districts. In this Act each District was assigned a portion of the debt.
Then the states reorganized their governments, which had to be done because
the States needed to "legally" (under men's laws) transfer the bonded obligation
for debt repayment from the states to the people. The original State Constitutions
were never submitted to the people for a vote, so the governments wrote
new constitutions and submitted them to the people for a vote, thereby
<b>binding the people to the debts</b> owed to Great Britain. Once again,
deception is used to get the people to unknowingly volunteer into bondage.</font></font></td>

<br />&nbsp;
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Because of the general disinformation
surrounding the American Revolutionary War (1775-1781) promoted by the
Hidden Hand in their publishing/education/media apparatus, most American
patriots automatically revere the men who led that apparent rebellion against
Great Britain, and established the united States of America as a separate
nation. What people do not know is that the so called "founding fathers"
and king George (remember the king or queen of England is a member of the
Hidden Hand) were working hand-in-hand to bring the people of America to
their knees, to <b>install a Central Government</b> (see Protocol 5, #1
below) over them and to bind them to a debt that could not be paid. This
is not to say that ALL the key men of that era were knowingly among the
greedy, evil conspirators, but it appears that most were. One example of
a possible exception is Patrick Henry who, when told of the proposed federal
Constitution, is reported to have said, "I smell a rat."</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The American Revolutionary
War, at least to give the <b>appearance</b> of separating from Great Britain,
was necessary to fulfill Jacob's blessing/prophecy to his grandson, Manasseh
(Gen. 48:19), although the participants were not consciously acting to
that end, but the American "founding fathers" did miss a genuine opportunity
to start fresh and <b>forget</b> and depart (2Tim. 2:19) from the failed
&amp; unjust ways of men's laws, edicts, and decrees, that their ancestors
had fled from in England, and instate God's Laws as the Law of the Land
of their new nation, as the pilgrims on the Mayflower had begun. Instead,
they were influenced by their human egos, greed, and the Hidden Hand's
masonic tenets to draft and implement a man-made constitution. Ironically,
the name Manasseh is a Hebrew word that means "forgetting, or making forget"
(Gen. 41:51).</font></font>

<h1>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font color=#1822CD>LOOPHOLE DELUSIONS</font></font></h1>

</p><p><br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The Hidden Hand have
fraudulently created and implemented man-made, copyrighted legislation
(wrongfully called "laws") to control the unsuspecting masses. They know
there is a percentage of people who possess the characteristics of fighters,
and are inclined to resist evil, even if these traits are dormant. These
people are very dangerous to them if they should somehow wake up on their
own and start fighting them, and organizing others to fight. So the Hidden
Hand lay traps to neutralize them in a more controlled process by purposely
setting up their governments and legislation with flaws, loopholes, and
legal remedies and reliefs. The "resistors" will find and use these loopholes,
and follow one, two, or all of three general methods in seeking to conquer
the evil Beast legal system, and will share knowledge of the loopholes
with other resistors.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The first method is to use
common law to openly fight the flaws/fraud in their private "laws". The
second method is to withdraw financial support and managing their wealth
"offshore" - believing they can insulate themselves or avoid fighting.
All these people are attempting to wind around the system, like a snake,
trying to live within the cracks of Satan's worldly system; always looking
for and then utilizing the loopholes, without ever realising that these
loopholes were SET-UP by the Hidden Hand. The New World Order have their
legislators create more and more man-made "laws", to make more Lawful things
illegal, which serves two purposes. First is to get away with stealing
more and more of the people's wealth and freedom, while no-one objects,
and secondly to draw the latent resistors out into the open, who either
do object or seek to gain advantage in "using" the loopholes built into
the fraudulent system.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Their so-called "laws" are
proven to be separate laws from what they and their own people follow,
as witnessed by the <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/clint.htm>Clinton</a></font></u>

impeachment charade, while these "laws" are <b>selectively</b> enforced
against whom they choose - usually God-fearing, honest people who (not
knowing any better) are "just trying to get along" within the system, but
especially against those who are doing their best to stay out of "Babylon"
entirely and not play the world's games. The people at Ruby Ridge, Waco,
Sand Point, and others, had not broken ANY of God's Laws, which are the
ONLY valid laws on this planet. When those honest "victims" don't cave-in
and give the Hidden Hand what they want under their legislation, then military
force is used, which often creates a well-publicized stand-off or siege
situation, and the media presents the criminal government people as benevolent
protectors of both: the children in those situations, and of the country.
It doesn't matter to them that, in reality, those children were in <b>no
danger</b> until the government itself <b>created</b> that dangerous situation.
The disinformation from these types of incidents are promoted by the media
to make examples of the real victims, in order to discourage the marginally
resistant percentage of the "sheeple" from fighting the system.</font></font>
</p><p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font color=#1822CD><font size=+1>Common
Law</font></font></font></b>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The road to Hell-Fire is
paved with good intentions. Almost all the people of the world have been
blinded and conditioned to the point of accepting one man-made set of laws
or another as being a valid foundation for government, instead of simply
getting back to God's Laws and His government. Those people/patriots who
are most inclined to resist and fight the Hidden Hand are bright enough,
and will more easily recognize the flaws and injustices of their system,
and be more motivated to take action, to expose and prosecute their frauds.
Unfortunately, these same righteous people who are attempting to do the
right thing, are misguided enough to diligently research and discover the
remedies and reliefs that are provided in <b>their legislation</b>, falling
right into the Hidden Hand's trap.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>If you build your case using
<b>their</b>
"laws", seeking to receive <b>their</b> remedy or relief, filing your actions,
counterclaims, motions, etc., in <b>their</b> courts/"temples", under <b>their</b>
rules of civil or criminal procedure and rules of evidence, and asking
<b>their</b> black-robed priests (judges) to give a ruling to correct the
injustice under <b>their</b> laws, then no matter how that judge rules
you have already lost. You have given power to the Beast by recognizing,
acknowledging and validating <b>their</b> "laws", otherwise you wouldn't
have used them to seek justice.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The object of Satan's exercise
is to keep you going in circles using THEIR "laws" to support/justify your
righteous position instead of using God's Laws. This not only continues
to lend credibility and legitimacy to the Hidden Hand's unLawful system,
but guarantees income for JUDGE$ and &pound;AWYER$. By first accepting
the false validity of man-made legislation, most people waste time and
effort getting caught up in arguing the "merits" of man-made forms such
as capitalism, socialism, communism, objectivism, parliaments, congresses,
etc. They protest and peck at various aspects of the system, depending
what issue(s) they believe directly affect them or matter(s) to them most:
income taxes; property taxes; gun control; mortgage usury; travel issues:
driver licenses and passports; natural/organic farming vs. chemical fertilizers;
nutrition supplements vs. pharmaceutical establishment; multi-national
companies and globally managed economy; etc.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The Hidden Hand is a seven
headed Hydra, so if you cut off one head it still has six more to attack
you with, and while you turn your attention to fight the other heads, the
head that was cut off will grow back. Even if you don't look for injustice
to fight, they use their agents such as legislators, police and bureaucrats
to find, charge, and "summon" you into their courts. This puts you in a
position of having to somehow defend yourself against their illegal legislation,
even if it's only something small like a traffic ticket, zoning ordinance
"violation", etc. What everyone <b>should</b> be doing is scrapping <b>ALL</b>
the man-made legislation and reinstating God's Laws, then all of these
little battles will be wiped away in one stroke.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>In his Sermon on the Mount,
Christ Jesus said <b>not</b> to go <b>voluntarily</b> into their "law"
courts, and instead to settle quickly with your adversary (Matt. 38-44).
If you are living your life as close to Christ as possible, then there
shouldn't be any valid reason that someone would or could want to sue you,
but even Christ said that you WILL be brought before their judges, so you
have to be <b>dragged</b> into their courts (Matt. 10:16-23; Mark 13:9-13),
and when you are, then you must use and defend God's Laws, to challenge
their unLawful legislation. It is only Good that conquers evil, and using
Satan's legislation to argue one point or another about his legislation
will never divide his evil house, which is why Satan's Hidden Hand have
set it up that way (Matt. 12:23-30).</font></font>

</p><p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font color=#1822CD><font size=+1>Article
3 courts / common law</font></font></font></b>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>There are some constitutional/common
law clubs and groups that are attempting to work the supposed loophole
that they are Citizens under the 1787/1789 Constitution for the united
States of America, instead of the slaves / citizens under the 14th Amendment
and the 1871 United States (Inc.) Constitution. They are spending a lot
of time, money, and effort learning the laws of men and using their rules
of procedure and evidence to present their cases to a judge employed by
the Hidden Hand, hoping and expecting he will rule in their favor and set
a precedent for other patriots to win their similar cases.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The people who are more advanced
in studying and fighting cases under men's laws using the 1789 Constitution,
are calling for the return of "Article 3" courts, as cited in the American
Constitution of 1789, and they note that the only courts currently in use
are the legislative courts under Article 1, and military courts under Article
2. The President, an office created in Article 2 of the Constitution, is
commander-in-chief of the military, and these courts have the military
gold-fringed U.S. flag hanging in them, showing what (de facto law) venue
they are operating under. These well-meaning but misguided patriots are
even taking to establishing their own Article 3 judicial courts, operating
under the de jure common law, when in reality they should set up God's
Royal Law Courts and enforce only His Laws, Statutes and Judgments.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>There are several problems
with their Article 3 approach. The first is that the men who are establishing
and running these courts are doing so to enforce men's laws and not God's.
The second problem is that they are breaking the twelfth Commandment: Thou
shalt not judge. We are only allowed to enforce God's Laws through His
Judgments, and anyone who judges another by anything other than God's Judgments,
then condemns himself to being judged in the same way by God. The third
problem is of enforcement. Perhaps you've heard of various groups winning
judgments in common law courts, against government officials and judges,
which is fine, but then how are those judgments carried out?</font></font>
</p><p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font color=#000000><font size=+1>Offshore
Patriots</font></font></font></b>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Many patriots and freedom/privacy-loving
people are moving and managing their money using "offshore" entities, in
order to keep their own private affairs away from bureaucratic snoops,
and to legally avoid taxes by following the letter of their "laws". On
the surface this might seem like a wise plan, but it is really a delusion
and living in denial. At some point, even these offshore "tax haven" entities
must interface with the Hidden Hand's computerized financial "system".
The world's financial system is linked together in a computerized information-exchange
network, so when you access your money at an Automated Teller Machine (ATM)/Cashpoint,
or make a purchase at a shop, with a debit or credit card issued from an
offshore bank, <b>they know</b> where you have your money.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The managers and promoters
of these offshore companies think the laws of those countries, and the
fact that certain countries don't have a "tax treaty" with the U.S. or
other governments, will protect them if a legal action is brought against
them. They also feel that they are playing the "big boys" game because
they are using the same kinds of complex structures such as irrevocable
trusts, international business corporations (IBC's), limited liability
companies (LLC's), dual citizenship in the tax haven, etc., and setting-up
their business and managing assets in the very same tax havens as those
same super-rich "big boys". These offshore managers are under the false
sense of security that if THEY are attacked, then the "big boys" would
also be vulnerable to attack, and wouldn't risk that. Why should that matter,
when as previously explained, the HIDDEN HAND have SET-UP <b>ALL</b> THESE
"GOVERNMENTS" to begin with? At the time that suits the Hidden Hand, they
will move in and confiscate the "patriots'" assets and leave their own
untouched. If you doubt this, then please see Protocol #3, #11-12: "Universal
economic crisis - "<b>Ours</b> they will not touch"</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The Hidden Hand have designed
the tax and usury systems to transfer as much money as possible from the
people into their own hands (See Protocol 20). It is estimated that the
richest 5% of the world's population now control over 95% of the world's
wealth. When the in-flow of tax and interest money stops, THEY <b><u>DO</u></b>
take notice. Despite setting up loopholes as traps, they really don't like
it when the people get wise to, and use them, in the sense that it temporarily
decreases the amount of money they are stealing... but they are very patient
thieves. Since it isn't worth it to them to go after every little guy separately,
they let particular plans/programs go on for a while so more and more little
people use a particular tax-avoidance/privacy entity, and when there are
<b>enough</b>
fish in the net, <b>then</b> they move in to confiscate all that money
at one time. As already noted, they don't bother with due process and following
their own "laws"; they simply confiscate or freeze the assets, and either
have a long drawn out court battle which drains the assets of your offshore
entity managers, or use their military force under some pretense. Of course,
the media that they own will trumpet their actions as benevolent and paint
the innocent people as criminals.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>At any rate, the Hidden Hand
own the banks, and have substituted; in place of exact weight and value
hard currencies such as silver and gold; worthless paper money whose "value"
was created out of thin air with the magic of the printing press (See Protocol
20), and whose continuing value is controlled by them in the currency markets.
No matter where you put your money, THEY still control it. Buying and holding
gold and silver bullion coins seems like a good idea, but where will you
spend it when almost all shops deal only in "legal tender"? If you pay
for something with a real silver dollar, the shop will accept it at <b>face
value</b> the same as a Federal Reserve Note dollar, rather than at its
<b>real</b>

value. Also, gold and silver coins can be forcibly confiscated by the Hidden
Hand just like any other property.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>"...Let us use all our force
to <b>replace the circulation of gold by that of paper</b>: our banks will
absorb the gold, and we shall decide then what value the paper money will
have, this will make us the masters of every man's existence..."</font></font>

</p><p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font color=#000000><font size=+1>Brothers
in Arms</font></font></font></b>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The third general method
of fighting what the New World Order is planning and building towards,
is by armed resistance. Patriots base their right to own and use firearms
on the Second Amendment to the American Constitution. As previously explained,
man-made legislation and even constitutions can be changed, and frequently
are. Changes that reduce or take away a fundamental, unalienable right
are usually made after the people have been sufficiently conditioned to
accept and even desire a particular change, while the defenders of that
right must somehow fight and neutralize the propaganda, to prevent that
re-conditioning of society. Both sides are constantly battling to influence
legislators and public opinion. Those who are familiar with gun issues
know that the Hidden Hand has been running a relentless campaign for many
years to outlaw the private ownership of firearms in America. They create
and utilize high profile cases through mass-media propaganda, like Ruby
Ridge, Waco, and high school shootings such as Columbine, Colorado, USA,
to manipulate public opinion against private gun-ownership. This is necessary
to enact man-made legislation to "legally" take away the People's right
to self-defence, especially to defend themselves against a tyrannical government.
Student witnesses involved during the high school incidents have mentioned
<b>other</b>
shooters - adults - dressed in black, killing students, but these accounts
are curiously absent in mainstream media reports. If God's Laws were in
force, then <b>there would be no battle</b> over public opinion, and no
threat of losing your God-given right of self-defence, since God's Word
is unchanging.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>There is a relentless drive
in Northern Ireland to take all the guns away from the Provisional Irish
Republican Army (IRA), who, along with the unionist paramilitaries, are
the only people left with guns, who could use them to resist the NWO. These
weapons are therefore seen as a threat to the NWO and so all of the politicians,
including American and U.N. politicians, are desperately trying to disarm
these people as quickly as possible. The best and most just solution would
be to repeal the firearms legislation and give all of the people the individual
ability to defend themselves against unprovoked vicious and brutal attacks,
according to The Law.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>At Ruby Ridge, Randy and
Vicky Weaver broke no laws. A female neighbour was deceived into believing
he had broken a law by sawing the barrel of his shotgun. There is no law
in The Bible against what he did. Nowhere in The Bible does it give men
the right to make up laws. In fact it expressly forbids men from doing
so.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Randy broke no law, nor commandment.
Therefore he committed no crime and neither did his wife, who was murdered
by a sniper in cold blood. There is no law in the Bible giving that sniper
(Lon Horiuchi) the right to murder Vicky Weaver, nor to give him immunity
from prosecution. If he fired the shot that killed Vicky Weaver then he
is a murderer pure and simple and should be treated and punished as such.
If Janet Reno ordered the FBI in to Waco then she is guilty of mass-murder
and should be arrested for her crimes, along with all others co-responsible
for the crimes committed at Waco. The Branch Davidians broke no law by
having firearms. There was therefore no legitimate reason for the assault
by the ATF who were committing a criminal offence and breaking The Law
by attacking Waco. If they were killed whilst perpetrating that crime it
is their own fault for breaking The Law, and according to God's Law the
Davidians have committed no crime by so doing.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Police who enforce illegal
laws are committing a crime by so doing and should be treated as criminals,
just as the Davidians did by killing them in self-defence. Don't be deceived
by the badges and uniform/s that they are wearing, in order to deceive
you into believing they are enforcing the law when in reality they are
breaking The Law and are actually criminals impersonating policemen. Your
minds have been conditioned to believe that these people are carrying out
The Law, when in reality they are committing criminal acts against Law
abiding citizens. You have all been mind-controlled to have inverted vision
and to see things backwards, the way Satan wants you to see them.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The way we have been conditioned
to see the police, is wrong, and it's reminiscent of the John Carpenter
film: <a href=http://jahtruth.net/theylive.htm>"They Live"</a>, where everyone needs to put
on the special glasses and see things as they really are, not the way that
you've been taught to see them.  You have to break through that programming
and inverted vision and see the world through God's eyes, not through Satan's
eyes, as you have been wrongfully taught to do.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The best example I can give
you of this is another John Carpenter film: "Starman", where an extra-terrestrial
who has been invited by Voyager 2 to come to visit Earth, and that could
have been Jesus, or could have been God Himself coming in that UFO. It
is set as science fiction, but it tells a valid story; that this extra-terrestrial
was invited by the Voyager 2 probe to come to visit Earth, and as soon
as he does so he is attacked by criminals in various uniforms and crashes
in Michigan at Cheboygan Bay.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>He sees these uniformed people
clearly as the criminals that they really are and when attacked by these
uniformed criminals for doing absolutely nothing wrong, he aims to shoot
these uniformed criminals, because that's how he sees them, and he sees
them correctly, because his mind hasn't been programmed to see things backwards.
But the woman with him; who has been brainwashed into having inverted vision;
tries to stop him because she thinks they are policemen enforcing the law,
and so God punishes her for doing so, and under divine justice she is shot
and killed by the police that she is wrongfully defending. That's Perfect
Divine Justice. The bullies in the uniforms are eventually scared and they
run away when the Mother-Ship arrives to rescue him, just as will happen
when the Reaping begins, but there will be nowhere safe enough for them
to hide.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>No matter if they are using
one, two, or all three of the above general methods of fighting the system,
"constitutional defenders" claim to be "Sovereign Citizens" subject only
to God, and that their constitutional government is only supposed to be
their servant. Read Protocol #1, item # 28: "The abstraction of freedom
has enabled us to persuade the mob in all countries that their government
is nothing but the steward of the people who are the owners of the country,
and that the steward may be replaced like a worn-out glove." If the "Sovereign
Citizen" belief is true, then why do its believers even feel they NEED
man-made constitutions? If they are truly subjects of God, then why are
they putting man-made constitutions and governments between themselves
and their King, and not following God's Laws? If they are Sovereign Citizens,
why is their servant government able to take away their property for not
paying the government what the government fraudulently demands from them?</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>God our Father is the Almighty,
All-Knowing, One True and Ever-Living God. He is the source of our rights
and freedoms, and powerful enough to protect, defend, and guarantee those
rights and freedoms. If you falsely and wrongfully believe that your rights
and freedoms come from man-made constitutions, and you put your faith (trust)
in them expecting a mere written document to guarantee those rights and
freedoms, then you are practicing a <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/newgr.htm>form of idolatry</a></u>,
which is the worshipping of false gods, and the breaking of the first and
most important Commandment. What is the force behind this paper god? Does
a piece of paper have the power to protect and defend you, and deliver
your enemies into your hands? Not only that, but the hero-worship of the
so-called "founding fathers" (Matt. 23:9) is also idolatry. If you are
a "constitution restorationist" is it now becoming obvious to you why God
would only be helping you fight evil to a certain point, but NOT fully
blessing your efforts, and NOT leading you on to total victory over the
Babylonian Hidden Hand system?</font></font>

God, and he lost?</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Here is the shocking Truth
about the American <b>con</b>stitution, and it is the unkindest cut of
all. After spending all that time, effort, and resources attempting to
secure your rights and freedoms under the man-made constitution, the bottom
line at the end of the day is: YOU ARE <b><u>NOT</u></b> EVEN A <b>PARTY</b>
TO THE CONSTITUTION! It is a contract between: the <b>States</b>, the <b>founders</b>
(through their insider legal establishments of those incorporated States),
and the <b>king of England</b>. The constitution itself was not signed

<b>by</b>
any human, it was only signed "In witness" on behalf of the States. Since
you are not a party to that contract, then you can't possibly have ANY
rights under that contract. This, and ALL <b>con</b>stitutions are just
part of the elaborate <b>CON</b> by the Hidden Hand. Think about it, just
exactly WHO are the "We the People of the United States" that the
<b>con</b>stitution
refers to who formed the "Union"? Most patriots jump to the conclusion
that it includes <b>every</b> American "Sovereign" Citizen, don't they?
But is that conclusion correct? Where in the document is the term defined,
which could support that conclusion? It doesn't really say it anywhere,
does it? This myth is what the Hidden Hand's educational system teaches,
so that's a very good reason to be suspicious straight away. Once again
we turn to the research of Stephen Ames, and his essay entitled "The Ultimate
Delusion", demonstrating the contrary, where he states:</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>"...Now the creditors of
the United States which included the King wanted [to be] paid the Interest
on the loans that were given to the United States. So Alexander Hamilton
came up with the great idea of taxing alcohol. The people resisted so George
Washington sent out the militia to collect the tax which they did. This
has become known as the Whiskey rebellion. It is the Militia's duty to
collect taxes. How did the United States collect taxes off of the people
if the people are not a party to the Constitution? I'll tell you how. The
people are slaves! The United States belongs to the founding fathers, <b>their</b>

posterity and Great Britain. America is nothing more than a Plantation.
It always has been. How many times have you seen someone in court attempt
to use the Constitution and then the Judge tells him he can't. It is because
you are not a party to it. We are SLAVES!!!!!!! If you don't believe read
Padelford, Fay &amp; Co. vs. The Mayor and Aldermen of the City of Savannah.
14 Georgia 438, 520 which states 'But, indeed, no private person has a
right to complain, by suit in court, on the ground of a breach of the Constitution,
the Constitution, it is true, is a compact but he is not a party to it.'..."</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Bearing the above in mind,
please read again both the Preamble to the <b>con</b>stitution and Article
7, and you will see it in a whole different Light:</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>"<b>We the People of the

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>"Article. VII. The Ratification

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>So, hopefully you see, and
if you don't you aren't paying attention, that even if you were 100% successful
in fully restoring your rights and freedoms under a <b>con</b>stitution,
then you have really gained nothing, <b>you have only been conned</b>.
Since constitutions are written by the Hidden Hand to further their goals,
you will have <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/lecture.htm>sacrificed</a></font></u>

your time, effort, relationships with family &amp; friends, resources and
maybe even your life, and will have simply gone in a circle - playing right
into your enemy's hands. Constitutions are set up as a trap by your enemy,
and those who reach the end of that blind alley are like Dorothy, the Scarecrow,
the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion, searching for the mythical Wizard of
Oz. At the end the only thing they find is just a man behind a curtain
pushing buttons and pulling levers to create illusions of power. This "wizard"
could give them nothing that they didn't already have.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>By contrast, God is totally
honest and upfront, and clearly states that, as an Israelite, you ARE a
party to The Covenant (Deut. 29:10-15). Isn't it strange and tragic that
so many well-intentioned people have sacrificed and suffered so much to
support and defend an illegal and imaginary set of laws and government
(imagine-nations) that they aren't even a party to, and ignored the only
valid and real Laws and Government on the planet that they ARE a party
to, and rightful heirs of? Everything in the world could have been SO different
over the last 3,500 years if, as a people and as a nation, Israel would
have just kept The Covenant as they/we had promised. The entire planet
would be God's Kingdom of Heaven on Earth.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The otherwise invincible
Hidden Hand has an Achilles' Heel that can and must be exploited if you
want to defeat it, and you'll soon read <b>how</b> that weak-spot can be
quickly and successfully attacked and fatally-wounded, which will bring
their whole house of cards crashing to the ground (Dan. 2:34-45). Do you
doubt that God <b>can</b> and <b>will</b> help you defeat the Hidden Hand,
if you fight His Way?  If so, please read the following Proof of Divine

<br />&nbsp;
<h1>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font color=#000000>EVIDENCE / PROOF OF
GOD FIGHTING FOR ISRAEL</font></font></h1>

</p><p><br /><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><i>Isaiah</i> </font></font></b><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>54:17
No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper (if you obey Me); and
every tongue [that] shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn.
This [is] the heritage of the <b>servants</b> of the "I AM", and their
Righteousness [is] from Me, saith the "I AM".</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Does God just sit back and
leave everything to us? In other words, does He not exercise Divine Intervention? 
It would be totally illogical for someone to create an amazingly intricate
and important Plan and then relinquish all control of its implementation,
wouldn't it? It would be especially illogical for someone like God Who
is all-powerful, all-knowing, and completely fair and unbiased, to trust
its carrying-out to beings who couldn't possibly understand all its aspects,
let alone the reality of our severely limited powers as human+beings. Let
us also not forget the fact that time and again we have proven to be very
disobedient, stiff-necked and untrustworthy. If you were in God's position,
would you trust <b><u>US</u></b> 100% to be able to carry out His plan
without Divine help?</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>God created, sustains, and
governs the entire Universe, and even taking into account our Free-will,
not even the tiniest, seemingly insignificant detail escapes His attention
or His control. EVERYTHING happens to each of us for a reason, and He either
causes it to happen or allows something to happen, in order to fulfill
His Loving Purposes for us - for those who turn to Him and seek to do His
Will, with His help and guidance. This is why the first and <b>most important</b>
of the 12 Commandments is: <b>YOU</b> shall love, honour, cherish and obey
the Lord your God (love, good and truth) with <b>ALL</b> your heart, with
<b>ALL</b>
your mind, with all your soul and with all your strength and Him <b>ONLY</b>
shall you serve and <b>OBEY</b>, forsaking <b>ALL</b> others.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Doing God's Will includes
keeping His Commandments, Laws, Statutes, Judgments, Agricultural Policy,
Economic Policy, and Diet. How could it be otherwise? God will help you
fight and win your battles, if you fight His Way. You will be guided <b>every</b>
step of The Way when you fight for God, and the first step to learning
HOW to fight Father's Way is to learn how to get in tune with <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/flute.htm>His
Voice</a></font></u>, in order to be able to understand and follow His
instructions. It becomes a partnership - He tells you what to do, and you
carry out those instructions, and then on to joyful victory! To begin learning
how to tune into God's Voice, from the only person on the planet qualified
and capable of teaching you, you first need to read and digest his book,
"<b><font color=#1822CD>The Way home or face </font><font color=#CC0000>The
Fire</font></b>". There are countless instances throughout known world
history where God has manifested His power in this physical plane, to undeniably
assist His soldiers, but just in case none of them come immediately to
mind, the following are some examples:</font></font>
</p><p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font color=#000000><font size=+1>Ancient/Biblical:</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Moses and the Parting
of the Red Sea</font></font></b>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>This is among the most famous
examples of God fighting for Israel. As described in Exodus 14:1-31, God
led Moses and the rest of the Israelites out of Egypt to the shores of
the Red Sea. Pharaoh believed they were trapped by the sea and could go
no further, so he hardened his heart and pursued them. God's "pillar of
the Cloud" came between the Egyptian army and the camp of Israel, preventing
the Egyptians from attacking, and then God parted the Red Sea after instructing
Moses to raise his hands over the sea. The Israelites crossed the parted
sea on dry land, and once across, while the pursuing Egyptians were also
crossing the sea on dry land, God rejoined the waters and drowned all the
Egyptians.</font></font>
</p><p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Joshua and the Conquest
of Canaan; The Battle of Jericho; The Sun Stands Still</font></font></b>

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>When God led the Israelites
out of Egypt, He promised to give them the land of Canaan, a land "flowing
with milk and honey"; but not without having them <b>do their part</b>
(a partnership, remember?) to battle the inhabitants - His Way. The Book
of Joshua gives a number of accounts of God fighting for/with Israel, as
Joshua led them in the conquest of Canaan. Among the many examples of God's
omnipotence, to show ALL the people in Canaan's surrounding regions that
God Himself fights for Israel, there are two especially well-known extraordinary
events during that campaign.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The first is: the walls of
Jericho falling down flat. The Israelites were instructed by God to have
all the armed men, seven <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/celtdrd.htm>priests</a></font></u>
blowing seven trumpets of rams' horns, and The Ark of The Covenant, compass
(march around) the city once per day for six days, and for the other Israelites
to be silent. Then on the seventh day they compassed the city in the same
manner, but as per God's instructions, did so seven times, and on the seventh
time, ALL the people shouted greatly (Joshua 6:1-20), and the walls of
Jericho fell down flat. Then the Israelite soldiers went in and conquered
the city.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The second especially noteworthy
miracle during the Joshua-led conquest of Canaan, is the Battle of Gibeon,
when the sun and the moon stood still for an entire day, at Joshua's request
to God (Joshua 10:6-14). All things are possible with God, and no miracle
is impossible for Him - for the faithful who are obedient and believe (Genesis
18:14; Matthew 19:26; Mark 9:23-24; Luke 18:27)</font></font>
</p><p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>David and Goliath</font></font></b>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Along with the "Parting of
the Red Sea", this is probably one of the best known God-aided military
battles in the entire Bible (1Sam. 17:4-52). Goliath, the Champion of the
Philistines was over nine feet tall, powerfully built, and heavily armoured.
Like the New World Order treats you, he arrogantly scoffed at the puny
(by comparison) youth standing before him. The youth David, who could not
wear a worldly suit of armour because of its weight, was armed only with
a sling, five stones, and the spiritual armour of faith that God would
fight for/with him (1Sam. 17:45-47). David quickly slung one stone and,
God-guided, it sunk into Goliath's forehead - killing him instantly (see
also Dan. 2:34-35, 45 and <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/emmau2.htm>the
Stone</a></font></u> that does the same to the giant Babylonian beast system
represented by the gigantic statue in Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon's
nightmare).</font></font>

</p><p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font color=#000000><font size=+1>The
Modern British Empire Era:</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The word "British" is Hebrew
and means the "People of the Covenant", that means, the "People Israel
of the Covenant".</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>In Jacob's famous dream of
The Ladder, God prophesied that Jacob's descendants would spread abroad
to the West (<u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/amerca.htm>U.S.A.</a></u>), and to the East (<u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/ausnz.htm>Australia,

of the world, and was prophesied (and did) possess the [sea] gates of its
enemies (Gen. 22:17).</font></font>

Zion [Tara].</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The "Lost" Ark of The Covenant,
which contains the two stone tablets with the Ten Commandments written
on them, as well as the original five scroll books of The Law given to
Moses by God at Mt. Sinai, is buried in an underground chamber <b>underneath</b>
(not in) the Mound of The Hostages (2kings 14:14; 2Chronicles 25:24), at
the <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/kells.htm>Hill of Tara</a></font></u>
(Torah), in <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/meath.htm>County Meath</a></font></u>,
Ireland. Its recovery will be the greatest event to happen on this planet,
and considering the accelerated declining state of the world, not a moment
too soon. Along with The Ark are buried: Israelite queen <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/tephisum.htm>Teia

<u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/jere.htm>Jeremiah</a></font></u>

treasures. When shown to the world, <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/socio.htm>The

True, that no-one can argue with, and not just a book of nice stories and

from the Israelite <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/bkofke.htm>Tribe

<u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/horse.htm>America,

descendants of the "Ten Lost Tribes of Israel", and will reveal that to

of Destiny (Lia Fail / Bethel / Jacob's Pillar) and it fulfilling its destiny,
for which it was named The Stone of Destiny, as God's Throne on Earth.</font></font>

Rom. 11:25-26). Once it is recovered, then The Ark will become the focal
point for all the people around the planet (and there won't be many of
them) who want to keep God's Laws, and who want to help each other and
put the world right, and will be drawn like a magnet to The Ark and <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/closeenc.htm>gather

said He would send EliJAH the Prophet, and he will tell the people that
they <b>must remember and return</b> to the Laws given to Moses at Sinai
(Malachi 4:4-5). If Israel, does not return to His Laws and get rid of
Babylon, then He will smite the Earth with a curse and burn everybody up
(Malachi 4:1). As already explained, it is not hard to believe that these
are indeed the <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/nostb.htm>"End Times"</a></font></u>.
It is now time for mankind to see that he is going the <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/envird.htm>wrong

<h1>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font color=#000000>THE FIVE STEPS TO DEFEATING
THE NEW WORLD ORDER</font></font></h1>

</p><p><br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>God has told us in the
Scripture that He hates Esau (the Synagogue of Satan and their New World
Order), and is wanting to help you as He has always helped Israel when
the people have done His will. It is His expressed Will that you defeat
them, so He will undoubtedly help us to destroy the Synagogue of Satan
/ N.W.O., once we agree to obey Him and do it His way.</font></font>

</p><p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><i>Malachi</i> </font></font></b><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>1:2
I have loved you, saith the "I AM". Yet ye say, Wherein hast Thou loved
us? [Was] not Esau Jacob's brother? <b>saith the "I AM": yet I loved Jacob,</b></font></font>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>1:3 <b>And I hated Esau</b>,
and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.</font></font>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>1:4 Whereas Edom saith,
We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places;
thus saith the "I AM" Lord of hosts, <b>They shall build, but I will throw
down</b>; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The
people against whom the "I AM" hath indignation <b>for ever</b>.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><b><i>Revelation</i></b>

3:9 <font color=#1822CD>Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of
Satan, which say they are Jews, and are NOT, but do LIE (Idumeans); behold,
I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that
I have loved thee</font>.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>But He won't help unless
we do His Will and follow His orders.  We know from Scripture and History
that God has always helped His people defeat their enemies when we do it
His way.</font></font>
</p><p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font color=#000000><font size=+1>The
First Step is: A Clear Goal - The Kingdom of Heaven on Earth</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The first step in accomplishing
any task successfully is to already know what the end result will be that
you are working towards. The goal of Our Mission should be: establishing
God's Kingdom of Heaven on Earth, which is a society based on spiritual
values of Pure Love, Humility, Truth, Peace, Joy, Trust, Unselfishness,
Freedom, and Abundance.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>For a preview of what your
life would be like, living under <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/godgovmt.htm>God's
system of Laws</a></font></u> in The Kingdom, after the war has been won
and Babylon has fallen, in comparison to life in the world today under
Satan's Babylonian market system, please read Chapter 28 of Deuteronomy
(the "<u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/blescur.htm>Blessings and Curses</a></font></u>"
chapter). You have been living under the "Curses" clause (Deut. 28:15-68)
for failure to keep His Laws, so read that part first. Then compare that
to all the wonderful BLESSINGS (Deut. 28:1-14) you can have showered upon
you and your loved ones, by returning to keeping The Covenant. Can you
even compare that to what any man-made constitution gives you (even <b>if</b>

the most benevolent man-made constitutional government <b>could</b> be
fully upheld and enforced)? Your Free-will choice should be easy.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Establishing The Kingdom
can ONLY be accomplished by destroying man-made laws and governments, and
reinstating, and living as Israelites under, God's "Royal Laws of Liberty",
with only God our Father as our <b>only</b> Supreme Ruler and Authority,
and His duly appointed Christ as our Earthly King. So the <b>immediate
Goal</b> is to reclaim for God, from the satanic N.W.O., the territories
currently inhabited by the modern dispersed Israelites, starting in the
Manasseh territory called <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/spaprop.htm>America</a></font></u>;
and destroy all man-made legislation, and FORCE the Federal Reserve Bank
to give back the <b>Trillions</b> of dollars that it has stolen from the
people since 1913. When divided equally, this money should make <b>every</b>

person in America an <b>instant millionaire</b>. In the next section of
this booklet, you will find the specific Plan on how to achieve our goal.</font></font>
</p><p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font color=#000000><font size=+1>The
Second Step is: YOU - Learning HOW to fight the right way - for God, His
Way.</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><b><i>Hosea</i></b> 4:6 My
people are destroyed for lack of My Knowledge: because thou hast rejected
My Knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/rabbis.htm>priest</a></font></u>
to Me: seeing thou hast forgotten The Law of thy God, I will also forget
thy children.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>In the time between NOW and
THEN (living in the established Kingdom of Heaven on Earth), we are fighting
a Holy War, using spiritual warfare tactics that you are most likely unfamiliar
with. Your Spirit Being must be properly trained to become a disciplined
soldier, following Divine orders, and knowing HOW to fight that kind of
war. Learn how to put on the Whole Armour of God (Eph. 6:10-19), and wield
His Sword of Truth (the <b><u>real</u></b> "<u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/starwar.htm>Light
Sabre</a></u>") to conquer His enemies. It may come to a "conventional"
fight, but at the moment our weapons are not necessarily carnal (2Cor.
10:3-7).</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Do you have what it takes
to be a <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/dune.htm>Holy Warrior</a></u>? You will be battling
the forces of supreme evil, and you can't win if you fight without God's
help (Num. 14:36-45), or try to do it your own way, so you need the Force
of Supreme Goodness as your <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/yodas.htm>ally</a></font></u>,
and when you have <b><i>THAT</i></b>, then <b>you can't lose</b>. Of course,
that Force of Supreme Goodness is: God our Father, and the only way to
tap into and use His Force is to learn to do His Will. You can't expect
anyone else to keep God's Laws, if you aren't setting the example and already
doing it yourself, so it is vital that you get yourself sorted out first
by personally returning to keeping God's Laws, Statutes, Judgments, Agricultural
Policy, Economic Policy, and Diet.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>To begin your <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/gnost.htm>spiritual
training</a></font></u>, you must have your head (mind) anointed with the
"oil of understanding" (Psalm 23:5, Matt. 25:1-13, 1John 2:20), or you
won't be able to fully comprehend and carry-out The Plan. You not only
need to <b><u>fully</u></b> understand what you are fighting against, but
more importantly what you are <b>fighting FOR</b>. You need the crucial
knowledge that is explained and found <b>only</b> in the Book, called "<b><font color=#1822CD>The
Way home or face </font><font color=#CC0000>The Fire</font></b>", because
that's what the option is. You either keep God's Law and go home, or you
face The Fire. And in the Book, everything that you need to know is covered,
written by JAH.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The information in  "<b><font color=#1822CD>The
Way home or face </font><font color=#CC0000>The Fire</font></b>" contains
THE critical key piece to the "jigsaw puzzle of life" that makes all the
pieces of God's mysteries of life on Earth fit. This book definitively
answers the age-old question, "What on Earth am I doing here?" People tell
you that God created the Earth and humans, but nobody tells you why. Was
He bored? You will learn <b>why</b> it was necessary for God to create
the Earth, why it was <b>necessary</b> for Him to create humans; and what
a Being is, where it came from, and why it's placed inside a human, that
then makes a human+Being. Among other things, you will also learn <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/why.htm>why</a></u>
you are now in a position of having to <b>fight</b> for your right to enter
God's Kingdom, and the core/root reasons you've been searching for of why
your enemies of the Hidden Hand are running the world the illogical and
destructive way that they are, and why they are always working toward your
enslavement and misery. If you want more details of the book, at the end
of this booklet you'll find a URL web link where you can go to read a little
bit about it and to see the address where you can send for it.</font></font>

</p><p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font color=#000000><font size=+1>The
Third Step is: Unity - All singing the "New Song" from the same song-sheet.</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Satan has been "dividing
and conquering" us, therefore we must unite to defeat him. Ever since Adam
and Eve, Satan has been very successful at organizing and dividing human+Beings
on planet Earth, by using their egos, into many different groups, filling
them with various "philosophies", "doctrines", and "ideas" in order to
pit them against each other, to keep them fighting each other his way,
for 6,000 years and certainly at least the last 2,600 years.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The "patriot" and "constitutional
restoration" movements suffer from ill-conceived plans and being divided
into too many splinter groups. The only effective way to WIN is to UNITE
all faithful, God-fearing, freedom-minded people under one banner or ensign
and work as one unit, under the right leader who is carrying-out the only
plan that will succeed, at the proper time. Working with a unified purpose
is what our evil enemy does, and look at the "success" they've enjoyed.
Wouldn't it be wise for us to do the same?</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Also, there are many Moslems
in America. The Moslems are also commanded in The Koran (Sura 5:8 and 16:91)
to keep The Covenant and God's Laws in The Torah. So you should think of
them as potential allies, not necessarily as enemies. You have people that
I've heard of like the Promise-Keepers, and they also have a large following,
and they cannot call themselves Promise Keepers and break The Covenant
- their promise to God. And then there are the Christian Militias, of whom
there are many in Michigan and elsewhere in America.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>That gives a power-base of
millions of soldiers to arrest the legislators and the usurers and put
them on trial, under God's Law. Once the alphabet soup brigade find out
the truth, they will divide along the lines of whom they follow - God or
the New World Order. You have to force the legislators to repeal all legislation
or be tried for treason against God, and suffer the penalty in God's Law,
which is execution, if found guilty of treason.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><b><i>Acts</i></b> 5:29 Then
Peter and the [other] Apostles answered and said, <b>We ought to obey God
rather than men.</b></font></font>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>5:30 The God of our fathers
raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.</font></font>

<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>5:31 Him hath God exalted
with His right hand [to be] a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance
to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.</font></font>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>5:32 And we are his witnesses
of these things; and [so is] also the Holy Spirit, whom God hath given
to them that obey him.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><b><i>1Peter</i></b> 4:17
For the time [is come] that Judgment must begin at the House of God: and
if [it] first [begin] at us, what shall the end [be] of them that obey
not the gospel of God?</font></font>
</p><p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font color=#000000><font size=+1>The
Fourth Step is: Leadership - Follow the Rightful Leader.</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Who is capable of uniting
ALL of those diverse, yet similar people, and leading them to victory?
The person who is chosen and sent by God. There are a few examples: Moses,
Joshua, Christ Jesus. Joshua's conquest of Canaan. Mohammed and his followers
attacked the evil <u><font color=#000000><a href=http://jahtruth.net/mecca.htm>Meccans</a></font></u>, but failed to take the city only because that wasn't what God wanted
them to do, but they easily conquered all other places for God when it
was God's Will.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The Leader would come from
the Tribe of Joseph/Ephraim (Gen. 49:10, 22-24), whose body would be born
in <font color=#000000><u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/joarim.htm>England</a></u>.</font></font></font>

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>If you are someone who is
currently leading a group of people in a particular strategy of fighting
the New World Order, then that has been a good thing, up to a point. Father
has obviously blessed you with the talent and experience to organize, recruit,
and manage tasks and people and I'm sure you will have learned a lot from
the experience: both good and bad lessons. I can't suggest strongly enough
that you read and take fully to heart all the information in this booklet
and related web links, put away your ego, learn true humility, and do what
it is now time that Father wants you to do - which is to merge/join your
group under the Leader that God has chosen.</font></font>

</p><p><br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>If you have read this
booklet all the way through to this point, then you now know <b>Who</b>
you are and <b>Who</b> your enemy is; you know <b>Why</b> your enemy is

efforts to defeat your enemy and gain true freedom have failed; you know

<b>What</b>
caused you to be under your enemy's yoke to begin with; you know <b>When</b>
to start fighting; you know <b>Where</b> the battle will be fought, and

and Win</font></b> that battle - and the Plan is amazingly simple.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Legislation is the NWO's

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Rothschild lied when he said,
"I care not who makes a country's laws as long as I make their money." 
He judged everyone by his own standards and assumed that everyone was like
him and had their price. Unfortunately, it appears he was right about the
majority of people. The fact that the New World Order got their puppet
politicians to enact the Federal Reserve Act in 1913, and the fact that
they had John F. Kennedy killed when he went to repeal it, is proof that
Rothschild lied.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Their Achilles' Heel is The
Bible - Torah Law in The Covenant that prohibits not only legislation but
usury upon which their system thrives. Cut off their illegal legislation
and usury and they will fall. They claim to be God's chosen people but
break God's Laws. Throw the Bible Law at them and see how they squirm.
They cannot claim to be God's chosen people and break His Laws. It's one
or the other.</font></font>

to and keep God's Laws. The first part of The Plan is for you, and many
other people just like you from around America, to send a warning to legislators
that <b>ALL</b> man-made legislation is treason against God's Laws, the
only valid Laws on planet Earth, and allow them 15 days to repent - by
repealing <b>ALL</b> man-made (therefore illegal) legislation. This warning
is in the form of a letter called, the "Proclamation of Liberty", and you
will find a copy of it at the end of this booklet. This letter is already
formatted and ready to photocopy and mail out. It just needs you to do
it.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The legislators will never
do it on their own if they believe "the party" is going to continue carrying-on
for them as it always has, so you have to <b>force</b> the legislators
to repeal all legislation, or be tried and <u><a href=http://jahtruth.net/astrl.htm>executed</a></u>

for treason against God. If you send that "Proclamation of Liberty" out
to all the legislators, then they have a decision to make. They either
return to God's Laws or they suffer the penalty. Hopefully none of the
legislators will refuse to obey God, and refuse to repeal all this false
legislation that they've used to enslave you, and then nobody will be punished.
But the choice is theirs. And your choice is whether you obey God or whether
you obey the New World Order (remember, you are the children of whom you
serve), and suffer what they have in store for you. If you want to defeat
them, then you have to do what God has told you to do. There is NO other
alternative.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Legislators take and carry-out
their marching orders from the Hidden Hand because they are bribed and/or
threatened. They are told that if they don't pass this or that legislation,
then the Hidden Hand will carry out all sorts of actions against them,
including death. Our Mission is to first make these legislators MORE afraid
of God and His soldiers than of the Hidden Hand, to the point where no
one will even want to be a legislator anymore. Just sending warnings have
no effect if the terms are not carried out. If you state that you will
do something after a certain time limit if your demand is not met, and
then you fail to follow through and do that thing, then your demands will
NOT be taken seriously. However, if you warn ALL the legislators, and then
one by one the sentences are carried out against those who failed to satisfy
God's demand before the time limit was up, then those legislators who remain
will be more likely to act positively.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Hopefully they won't be necessary,
but "enforcement units", which can be individual people acting alone, must
be ready to carry out the arrest and prosecution, where there is any doubt
of guilt, and the Lawful execution of all treasonous legislators. This
requires your unwavering total commitment to serving God and championing
His Cause (thereby becoming an Israelite by the true definition of the
word), even unto death.</font></font>

<h1>
<font face="Times New Roman"><font color=#000000>CONCLUSION</font></font></h1>

</p><p><br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The House of Jacob and
the House of Esau have been battling each other throughout history, beginning
when Jacob and Esau themselves were still inside Rebekah's womb (Genesis
25:22-23).</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>In comparing correctly interpreted
Bible prophecy to known world history, with very few prophecies left to
be fulfilled, there is little doubt that these are the "<a href=http://jahtruth.net/signs.htm>End
Times</a>". God has promised in these times to bring an end to Satan's
rule and influence over the world (Daniel 2:26-45), first by bringing Satan's
Babylonian market system crashing down to the ground, and then destroying
Satan himself and ALL his followers, once and for all. After the "Elect"
have been gathered, the Earth will be Reaped and then remade. Then the
"Elect" will return to the new Garden of Eden - the newly restored Earth
(Revelation 21:1-8). Just exactly what and how the detailed sequence of
events in His Master Plan will come to pass, only God knows, but the time
of "Two Possible, Parallel Paths" of prophecy fulfillment will soon end
and become One Path.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Those of us who have chosen
to fight for God - His Way - against Satan, have the peace of mind that
comes from knowing God and His Christ, and that we are definitely on the
winning side. We have God's promise that He will choose the House of Jacob/Israel
and that He will NEVER restore the Birthright or Blessing to Esau/Edom.
In fact, He has promised to utilise the descendants of the House of Jacob
to destroy the "wise" Edomites (Hidden Hand conspirators) for taking advantage
and stealing Israel's substance while the "I AM" was chastising the children
of Israel (Obadiah 1:18). God has promised to expose the secrets of the
Hidden Hand, and confound their leaders and visible agents, making them
inadvertently publicly say The Truth (Obadiah 1:6-15).</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The New World Order is not
new, and it's been going on for at least 2,600 years. When are you going
to stop it? There's only one way to stop it, and that is to go back to
keeping God's Laws, and to make the legislators back down. The legislators
are bought or frightened by the New World Order, to keep making up this
legislation, to rip you off, make you poor, and enslave you. So, the only
way that you're going to stop that from happening, is if these legislators
are more afraid of you than they are of the New World Order. And the only
way that they are going to be more afraid of you is if you tell them what's
going to happen to them if they don't keep God's Law and get rid of all
this illegal legislation that they've made up. You have to put the fear
of God into these people. What are you waiting for?</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>I can help you to do that,
and I will help you to do that, if you want me to. I've told you in this
booklet what the situation is. I've told you what the options are. This
Proclamation of Liberty AND its enforcement, is the straw that is guaranteed
to break the New World Order's back, but it's no good if you don't agree
to do it, and you don't make lots and lots of copies, and send it to all
the legislators. If you enforce this Law, and you make them afraid of God,
and you as His people, you will win. I believe there's 537 of them, including
the V.P. and the President. There's only 537 of these people who are messing
up your life, how many of you are there? There must be thousands of you,
if not millions of you. You have to stop bickering, falling out, and squabbling
with ego problems amongst yourselves, and get yourselves together, united
in one cause, and God has told you that there is only one way to do this.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>I just hope that you make
the right decision and decide to do it. I can send you proof from the Scriptures,
I can talk till I'm blue in the face, it will make no difference if you
don't do it. And if you don't do it, I'm very sorry, but you're going to
burn, and that's the Scripture. You either believe God or you don't, and
then if you believe Him then you have to obey Him, and you have to do His
Will. He's told you that He would let all of this happen to you to teach
you a lesson for not keeping His Law, but He's also told you that He would
fight with you and for you, and that you will win, it says so in the Scriptures
that you will win, if you fight. I hope that you will send for this book,
"<b><font color=#1822CD>The Way home or face </font><font color=#CC0000>The
Fire</font></b>", and I hope you will study it, and then you will know
where I'm coming from, and you will know all that you need to know in order
to decide whether you want to fight, or whether you want to lose. Because
one way or another you are going to lose if you don't fight. So, really,
it's up to you.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><b><i>Isaiah</i></b> 52:2
Shake thyself from the dust; arise, [and] sit down, O Jerusalem: <b>loose
thyself from the bands of thy neck</b>, O captive daughter of Zion.</font></font>

"I AM", Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without
money.</font></font>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><b><i>Micah</i></b> 4:13

and I will make thy hoofs brass: and <b>thou</b> shalt beat in pieces many

unto the Lord of the whole earth.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Now, I don't want you to
go around unnecessarily killing people - that's not the object of the exercise.
You send out the Proclamation of Liberty to the legislators, then it's
up to them. They either obey God, or under God's Law, which is the only
Law on this planet that is legal, then they have to suffer the consequences. 
But somebody will have to carry that out, and that's what it also says
in The Law, it says that YOU have to enforce The Law, and THAT will keep
you free.</font></font>

</p><p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font color=#1822CD><font size=+1>Order
and study the "King of kings' Bible".</font></font></font></b>
<br /><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>"Seek and ye shall find.
Ask and ye shall be given..."</font></font></b>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>     This is without question
the most complete and accurate translation of The Holy  Bible.  The culmination
of nearly 50 years of preparation. The King of kings' Bible provides a
unique interpretation of the Books of The Old Covenant, The New Covenant
and The Koran; and includes important Books and parts of Books that were
previously removed by various churches and religious organisations. All
three Books are fully cross-referenced so that for the first time, readers
will understand the relationships and complete harmony with them.</font></font>

<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>     The Book of God's first
Prophet, <font color=#1822CD>Enoch</font> (Idris), through whom God prophesied
that His Revelations would be tampered with - and some of the Revelations
removed and ignored - has been correctly translated and reinstated.</font></font>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>     Chapter 34 of the <font color=#1822CD>Book
of Ezekiel</font> is presented in its correct interpretation. Mis-translations
of Christ's teaching in Matthew ch. 6 and ch. 23 have been corrected so
that Matthew now rightfully contains the fulfillment of Ezekiel ch. 34.</font></font>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>     <font color=#1822CD>The
Book of Tephi</font>, lost until recovered in 1897 has been reinstated.
It essentially picks up where the Book of Jeremiah leaves off, and chronicles
the voyage of: Jeremiah, Tephi, the Pillar Stone of Jacob, and The Ark
of The Covenant, from the "uprooting" in the fallen Jerusalem in 588 BC,
to the "planting" in Ireland in 583 BC.</font></font>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>     Accurate translation
has resulted in the word "community" being used instead of "church", and
"holy people" instead of "saints".</font></font>

<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>     The whole of the Gospel
according to <font color=#1822CD>Thomas</font> has been reinstated, as
has the last chapter of <font color=#1822CD>The Book of Acts</font>.
The <b>Third Book</b> of the <font color=#1822CD>Revelation</font> to
John, which was previously removed from the Revelation, has been restored.</font></font>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>     In the Holy Koran,
Ishmael is now correctly identified as Isaac, which now identifies Moriah
in Jerusalem as the Holy City - Surah 2:125 and 2:127. The Koran is, for
the first time, fully cross-referenced to The Old and New Covenants.</font></font>

<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>     In the New Covenant,
the words of Christ are in <b><font color=#1822CD>blue</font></b>, which
is <b><font color=#1822CD>God's</font></b> colour, instead of the usual
and wrongful <b><font color=#ED181E>red</font></b>, which is <b><font color=#ED181E>Satan's</font></b>
colour.</font></font>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>     There are also many
other areas of these important Books where historical interference has
been corrected - too numerous to list here. You will read many books and
verses that the various and ancient "vested interests" have deliberately
hidden from you over the years.</font></font>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>     The <b><font color=#1822CD>King
of kings' Bible</font></b> is dedicated to world peace and understanding.

And this have they kept; and much has the Lord tried (and tested) them
(Sura 29:2-3); and their souls (Beings) have been found pure, that they
might bless His name. All their blessings have I related in a Book; and
He has rewarded them; for they have been found to love heaven with an everlasting
aspiration (ch. 39:8). God has said: While they have been trodden down
by wicked men, they have heard from them revilings and blasphemies; and
have been disgracefully treated, while they were blessing Me. And now will
I call the souls (Beings) of the righteous from the Generation of Light
(Thom. 8:8), and will change those who have been born in darkness; who
have not [whilst] inside their bodies been recompensed with glory, as their
faith may have merited.</font></font>
</p><p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1><i>Ephesians</i> </font></font></b><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>5:8

of those who have faith: from the depths of darkness He will lead them
forth into Light. Of those who reject faith the patrons are the evil ones
(Enoch 15:8): from Light they will lead them forth into the depths of darkness.
They will be Companions of the Fire, to dwell therein (for ever).</font></font>

Hi JS, 
</p>
<p>
Indeed a house divided shall not stand. That&#39;s what The Master says. The Plan is The Master&#39;s Plan and the ONLY way to UNITE the house/s. 
</p>
<p>
Matthew 10:36<br />
<font color="#0000ff">And a man&#39;s foes shall be they of his own household.</font> 
</p>
<p>
Matthew 10:34<br />
<font color="#0000ff">Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.</font> 
</p>
<p>
<font color="#000000">Those who accept to live under The Law, with Christ as King, shall be united. Those who do not, shall be divided even further. In seeking to accomodate evil, they shall be destroyed by it.</font> 
</p>
<p>
It is your choice to unite yourself with The Master&#39;s Plan, with your freewill. For anyone who does not do so, the future looks very bleak. Ultimately, in the NWO (Satan&#39;s kingdom) T.H.E.Y. are shaping, believers in Christ shall be persecuted (way above what they are persecuted now). So we need to stand together. 
</p>
<p>
You cannot unite God&#39;s people with Satan&#39;s people. If that is the solution you are seeking, I&#39;m assured that you will be very disappointed, to say the least. We have God&#39;s word on that. 
</p>

GOD IS TRUTH, truth is it wasent that Eve was cast out of the Garden of Eden because she ate of the Tree Of Knowledge,....no, it was because the Serpent told Eve that the Fruit of the Tree Of Knowledge She would be as smart as GOD, where the SIN Lies herein is that instead of goin to The Father, GOD, to ask if the Serpent was bein deceitful, Eve BELIEVED an untru stament and acted upon impulse rather than ask the Father, GOD,is this true? This was the first &quot; Turning Away &quot; from the Word, Which IS TRUTH, Which IS GOD, Free Your Mind,

    Government is the child of religion, so cast out Satan with Beelzebub. Jesus wasn&#39;t a Christian, Buddha wasn&#39;t a Buddhist. Men created systems around their teachings, perverting the original message. Simply stated enough, <em>&quot;You cannot serve God and mammon.&quot;</em> Mammon, in this case, being <u>the laws of men</u>. Individual self-accountability is the only solution. Love the Creator, not His creation as the New Ager&#39;s do, most of whom, subconciously wish to exterminate the human race in order to save the planet. We must guard against giving power to words, symbols, and images. For <strong>God</strong> is <em><u>so much more</u></em> than just a word. The Golden Rule cannot be broken, so love your enemies because if you hate them, you&#39;ve become them. May the Source of all that exists continue to bless <u>each and everyone of us!</u>

    The only real way is grass roots education.  Plant that mustard seed into everyone's brain and show them tangible proof.  A good start is the owl on the dollar bill the owl over washington DC (the grounds plans) and then pictures/images from Bohemian grove with Nixon/Reagon. 

If that don't get their attention the next time you talk about conspiracy stuff they'll know you've shown them tangible proof the last time.  Then they'll awaken on their own when they see media stories etc. 

It is hard to reach the masses.  But plant that seed everywhere.  When the time is right, people will rise up overnight.

    <p>Dear author,</p><p>  In the third paragraph of the section titled Recovery of The Ark of The Covenant, Rev. 26:8-13 is parenthesized ().  I am really enjoying your website so far, but believe this may be a typo, since I am unaware of any chapter beyond 22 (twenty-two) in the book of Revelation.  If it is&#39;t too much trouble, would you mind sending me an email with the intended bible reference (book/chapter/verses) so that I may go back to your publication and the bible as it applies to this paragraph?  I&#39;d appreciate it greatly!  </p><p>Your brother in Christ,  </p><p>Eric</p>      </div>

    This article has given me so much, the will to fight for god and hope. I have known about the NWO for a long time now and have been looking for someway to stop them pretty much since I learned of their control over the world. To be honest for the longest time, I saw the christian faith as one of their tools of social control(and to some extent they did morph it to that) but this teaches of the christian faith in a light that I have never seen it before. I have wanted nothing more for the longest time than to have some power some way that I could help stop what I was seeing going on all around me. Thank you for giving me hope, and the ability to fight against this most evil of enemy&#39;s.        </div>

    <p>I am against the NWO but by replacing it with Gods Law aren't we then just a slave to God. I am not trying to mock God in anyway but having not been brought up in a religious family I myself am not 100% convinced by Gods existence. I realise that you might be "banging your head against the wall" when I say that but I am looking for direction. I want to defeat the NWO, in your opinion is this possible if I am not sure of my belief in God? I also feel that many people either do not believe or struggle to accept Gods existence, therefore when people rise up against the NWO quoting the Bible etc they will not be taken seriously. Is there another   way? Or can the same methods be used minus the religion part! Can everyone against the NWO unite regardless of their  belief in God, but with the same objectives of not being a slave to the NWO? </p>

    <p>Do you have a plethora of evidence as he does, to suggest against what he has said? Are you a sheep who can easily be herded in any direction the government wants you to go? I believe you, my friend, sound like the insane out of touch idiot when you were just presented with something as serious as this, and given major facts and proof, and you still are as ignorant to simply not believe it. What is your basis for attacking the poster and disagreeing with what was said? do your research! There is website after website, and document after document, and video after video proving that we are allowing the government to defame the constitution and enslave us all. </p>

    <p>Hi.<br />
I found your Web Site by Google<br />
And I wish you the best you can get,<br />
the peace of God through Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Welcome to visit my Site.<br />
Allan Svensson, Sweden</p>
<p>Why does the revival tarry?  It is because God's<br />
people tarry to obey the powerful command of<br />
the Lord in Rev. 18:4.  This is the most powerful<br />
revival message of the Lord to his people in our time.<br />

<p>As in the days of Lot, it is now. Lot was not interested<br />
to leave Sodom. God sent two angels to rescue him,<br />
and they must persuade him to leave Sodom. When<br />
he yet lingered, one of the angels said to him:<br />
"Flee for your life sake ..."<br />
Just like as Lot, God's people are not interested to<br />
leave the great Babylon, but finally they must flee<br />
for their life from there.<br />

<p>God's people are destroyed for lack of knowledge<br />
because their preachers have rejected knowledge.<br />
Hosea 4:6-11.  Instead to preaching the truth of the<br />
Assembly of God, they have preached lies about the<br />
Assembly of God. The Pentecostalists have abused<br />
the expression "Assembly of God" and used it as a<br />
name of their church.</p>

    <p>"The meek shall inherit the earth"  The Lord God allows the people who are in power to be there,  even if we do not like who it is we HAVE to humble ourselves and submit in order to receive the blessing.  If you want to put yourself under the law, then the Bible sais you put yourself under a curse.  I prefer the GOSPEL and the saints who have gone before me... I would rather trust my God, rather be  beheaded, imprisoned, stoned, thrown into the fire whatever.... just like Shadrack Mesach and Nebindigo I will abide under the Lord and his plan.  If I try to save my life I would just loose it anyway.  HUMBLE YOURSELF EXCEPT reality and prepare to usher in our King for the TRUE NEW WORLD ORDER Praise be to Jesus of Nazareth who was and is and IS COMING SOOOOOOOOOON WOOOOHOOO I LOVE YOU LORD SO MUCH!  The Lord does not give us a spirit of fear.  Get ready to DIE for him like he died for you, because that might just be what you have to do.</p>

<p>... everyone hear don't listen to these people. I was once a person who thought constantly about the world's end, the new world end, revelations, and this "second coming of Jesus"</p>
<p>listen to me... these people are the false teachers.</p>
<p>your following the wrong guys.<br />
these websites and these types of people... its the false prohpets Jesus was talking about.</p>
<p>Luke 17 20;21... and so on.</p>
<p>Jesus second coming and the coming of the lord has nothing to do with this real world.</p>
<p>LISTEN TO ME..<br />
in star wars episode 3.<br />
many of you as I probably would guess have seen it..<br />
I should knoe... I used to be one of you.<br />
One of those who sought to find the Anti-christ.<br />
I was wrong.</p>
<p>God's Kingdom will come from within..<br />
and the second coming of Jesus will come from us.<br />
not from the sky or the clouds.</p>
<p>the revelations is internal and not external.</p>
<p>in Star WARS episode 3..<br />
you may think you found the hidden emperor.<br />
the emperor as the New world Order.<br />
and the supposed "signs"...</p>
<p>you guys are being mislead just like the jedi were.<br />
You are actually following the seperatist.<br />
YES!<br />
the people talking about the New World Order are the actual bad guys. many people will turn away from this message..</p>
<p>I could careless..LMAO :]<br />
those people have no lives. in fact those people who are thinking about the worlds end and new world order... tell me how much of your life has been taken over by it.<br />
How many movies and songs must be about it.<br />
How much do you live for it..<br />
its taken over your life.. clouding your mind like the Sith clouded the Jedi.<br />
You will chase the Sepreatist and the supposed bad guys..<br />
_._gah.</p>
<p>think about it.<br />
most people are very skeptical of the world.<br />
many people think that there are bad guys out there like Specter from 007 or people like the Masons.<br />
Especially with WArs beaking out and figting and chaos.<br />
How easy is it to believe in the bad guys...</p>
<p>now..<br />
think about how hard it is to believe that this site is the bad guys. that the people who are consuming the way you think and live your life are the bad guys.</p>
<p>I bet many people will say I'm the worker for the BAd guys..<br />
LMAO.. go ahead. believe them... but think ABOUT it before you do .__.<br />
am I really.</p>
<p>You won't hear from the good guys cause there busy living there life. Doing things of passion... finding God's kingdom is actually "AT HAND"...</p>
<p>yes as in its not coming!<br />
 but already AT HAND!<br />
in your HANDS!<br />
people who live there life...<br />
MUSICANS! ARTISTS!<br />
SINGERS! ATHLETES!<br />
TEACHERS! POETS!<br />
MARTIAL ARTIST!<br />
THE PEOPLE WHO TRY HARD TO FIGHT FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE!<br />
like Naruto.. lmao<br />
>___<</p>
<p>DATEBYAO!</p>
<p>anyways...<br />
sure I could be the bad guy.<br />
and you could be actually being clouded by me..<br />
but don't listen to me.<br />
listen to your heart.<br />
Do you think God really wants you to live this way.</p>
<p>I once was in the clutches of these types of people..<br />
the people in SHEEPS CLOTHING!<br />
its easy to see the cults.. the people who pretend to be good.<br />
its easy to see crazy people who believe in DEVILS!<br />
but is it easy to see the people... who are part of this against NWO crap.<br />
because really... this isn't living.<br />
They got you clouded..</p>
<p>live your life.<br />
and seeking out God's kindgom.</p>

btw...<br />
MAtthew 17: 19-20<br />
doesn't say goverment!...In the bible it says "MOUNTAIN!"<br />
These people are changing the scripture on you... and only the people who don't read the bible and have week minds will be affected by this...</p>
<p>Don't be idiots.<br />
When I say get a life... I don't mean it harshly.<br />
;/ I mean it to help you. get out there and see the world.<br />
Live. LOVE. LAUGH.<br />
even for the people who made this orginization.</p>
<p>BTW! O.O<br />
There is no fear in Love... there is only Fear in not being perfect infront of it.</p>
<p>John8;4 and John8;14<br />
....<br />
or is it John 4;8 and John 4;18</p>
<p>one of those says that God is love.</p>
<p>I don't knoe why I just stated this verse.<br />
I felt like I just had to Pwahaahaha! :DD</p>
<p>may be it helps one of you who reads this.. I ono >__< well<br />
good luck to all of you reading this comment.<br />
... Ihope you don't get sucked into this </p>
<p>I WAS ONCE BLIND! but now I can see :]<br />
I'm here to spread a word of joy and hope.<br />
to help those who are lost and being dragged into this NWO crap that even I used to believe.</p>
<p>I was posed once a question by my freshman year English teacher... it was after I kept on telling people about the New World order and this how the bad guys are in EUROPE and they even have a symbol on the DOLLAR! OH NO  :S</p>
<p>my teacher asked me as I was on my rage of being crazy and thinking I knew more than my classmates:</p>
<p>"Are you truly Happy with your life?"</p>
<p>... I had no answer.<br />
it seemed the thinking and consuming of my mind by this New World Order stuff made me loose myself.. and who I truly was... I reaized how unhappy I was thinking about the New World Order and this stupid ReVELATIONS CRap.</p>
<p>3 years later and I'm here.<br />
realizing that the bible is actually an inverted triangle..</p>
<p>where as you read the bible it starts from talking about us as a people... then about us as indiviusals... and then.. it talks about our internal struggles... internal stuggles is the Revelations.</p>
<p>SO before I go... I'll let you knoe how I got out.</p>
<p>I was a sinner.<br />
just like you.</p>
<p>but God came to me... and asked through people, music, movies, books, and HOPE! LOVE! AND OHANA!<br />
He asked through these things...which I call the Holy Spirit:</p>
<p>1."Are you truly happy?"<br />
2. LUKE 17 20;21<br />
3. I accept you...( don't ask me why I accept you.. its my story :>)</p>
<p>Goodluck brothers and sisters out there.. hope you find heaven and Jesus... not in the sky... not Far away.<br />
NOT IN SPACE..PWhahaha.<br />
but I hope you find heaven within you. and hope Jesus comes from within you.</p>
<p>and since God is Love...<br />
I hope..<br />
You find heaven through love.</p>
<p>PEACE :><br />

    <p>you guys must not know this but the people your are trying to destroy made the bible and the book is just another way of control. Not sure if you've heard of the peagan religion but umm the compareability is ridiculus. All gods are born on the 25th of December for a reason and if ya dont know. Look it up. and Yes dont get me wrong I believe in a higher power but if he was the god in the bible (which I hope for) this planet would of been underwater centuries ago. I find it pretty hard to believe there was more evil happening back then then there is today.</p>

Religion is a bad way to control people because of dogmas, its harder to change it when you see you need to change your tatics or something like that. And chistian religon is like that.</p>
<p>The only way would be to have some sort of very open religion that chistianity is not one of them</p>

<p>Religion is the source of all of our current problems, from overpopulation, to covert controlling schemes. Right now a widespread awakening is occuring, and a deviation from the nonsense that is driving us off a cliff. </p>
<p>I am a buddhist, and I see how distorted the original prophet's message has become. Buddhism is non-theistic, I believe in mutual energy exchange, and reincarnation etc but none of the nonsense in the Christian fantasy universe that has perversed our interpretation of reality. The religions are very similar, if you can see the message without the cultural baggage then you will find salvation, and it isnt to expect to live for all of eternity with all of your beloved ones in the clouds smiling down on the sinners below. What a joke. I didnt even read past the first paragraph, i made it to GOD and was disgusted. Do the authors/moderators of this site truly have our interest at heart or is this actually NWO disinformation? "No no, return to confiding in the system that has enslaved you, return to christ our messiah, he will descend from the heavens to save all the faithful"! give me a break....</p>

  <div class="submitted">
    Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on January 5, 2009 - 01:01  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <p> Your intent “seems” genuine, although, the Bible and in fact religions of all manner are and have been tools used (and strengthened) by the people involved in bringing about a NWO. Citing the King James Bible as a reliable historic foundation to start developing strategies against a NWO suggests your strategy has been drawn from your religious beliefs and bias. Evidence drawn from religious text such as the Bible gives no one the strength to defy the forces of a NWO and actually proves how easily we the majority can be fooled. What chance does the world have against a NWO if theories such as this are offered as a solution? The actions of the NWO are real and the proof is there, available and ready to be exposed. Therefore, we need a real strategy - one that is not based on religion but on exposing the tangible, undeniable truths about how we have been mislead and the future of our existence on this planet.</p>
<p>Your distaste for institutions is well founded, however, implying all employees of these institutions are guilty of helping the NWO both demonstrates a weakness with your argument and diminishes your credibility. How do you hope to awaken the world if you are accusing many of them to be part of the conspiracy?    </p>
<p>The individuals working to create a NWO are in fact a very small group of the population that have names and addresses like the rest of us. In fact, members of this elite group, namely the Rockefeller’s, Rothschild’s and Morgan’s have been known about for years.</p>
<p>The only way to stop a NWO is the “unlawful”, but, necessary incarceration of these families for crimes against humanity. What government or army or police force would dare this feat knowing that the world’s armies are funded and intern controlled by these families and knowing that world wars have been fought, brother and against brother with both sides being funded by the same families. </p>
<p>An army that marches behind a banner of humanity and not under the influence of profit and power.   </p>
<p>Ironically, the masters of our universe if taken and held for their crimes would comfortable fit in a single jail cell. </p>
<p>Finally, as more of a point to ponder rather than my own personal belief. Why do you think we would be in a better position without these forces at work? Sadly, our history and indeed present action against each other does not reflect an image of the magnificent human spirit you think these people are enslaving. If we truly are god like creatures, why were we taken so easily by a handful of men that turned us upon each other? Perhaps the most telling question: Would you do the same thing as them if given the chance?</p>

    <p>Well, that would be a MAGNIFICENT idea to jail those families for doing these things to us and hurting our artists, actors, singers, models, photographers, and our media. By now, America should've learned from Germany and Hitler's mistakes and made a resolve not to do the same things they did. It's time for our president to wake up and do something about this if he wants me to vote for him. I'm considering voting all independents.</p>

    <p>Ever learning but never coming to a knowledge of the truth. There is simply nothing that we can do except wait on God to do it himself. Not your god but the one true God of love. You have been poisoned by the leaven of hate which is the idea that God will let be lost a single one of us. He did not ask our permission when he drew us all to himself on the cross, nor when he was resurrected. Your plan is the plan of Empire and if you really believe it then you are just chumps. He who lives by the sword shall die by it--not because another will kill him, but because what you do to or wish on your brother you do to yourself. The day of judgement is the day of light. Hell is a school. You are going to feel pretty stupid sitting there next to all of the people you condemned.</p>

    <p>from a very earlier age  i have always believed in god and have tried to go through this life loving people and gaining knowledge, i have never read the bible but believe strongly in the commandments because it was something that was taught in school and i dont believe that god does not love me and others because of that, i believe that god has a plan for us and that is to fight the new world order almost like god is saying " you are with me or with satan, say no to the microchip for that is the mark of the beast, say no to id cards, say no to war and globalisation, fight the new world order, support our family in the usa because what usually happens is that when the usa sneezes the whole world has a cold!, fight marxism, facsism, complacency, ignorance, believe in god, love and the good in humanity, spread the word about the new world order, action and belief and god can only beat them, surely byou can believe in god and not have read the bible?, </p>
