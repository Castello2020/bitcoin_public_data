Introduction</p>
<p>The document known now as <b><i>The Protocols of the Learned
Elders of Zion</i></b> is one of the most important documents ever
to come to light in the world. In fact, it can be described as the
blueprint for the domination of the world by a secret
brotherhood.</p>
<p>It is graphic in its contempt for those who will be its victims,
in its profound understanding of the human condition and mind; and
it is equally graphic in detailing the methodology it will use
against, and with the complicity of, the world's population, in
such a way as to go unrecognised by the vast majority of the
participants.</p>
<p><b>The document has achieved fame and infamy in its
time.</b></p>
<p>Essentially, the accusations levelled against it are that it is
a fraud and a forgery. Some say it is a report of a genuine
conspiracy but has been blamed on the Jews in order to hide its
true origins, and that to believe it to be genuinely Judaic shows
one to be 'anti-Semitic'. This kind of black propaganda and
emotional reaction arises quite naturally in the course of events
whenever any proof of the ancient conspiracy against humanity is
uncovered.</p>
<p>Despite a general misconception amongst certain
politically-aligned groups and ill-informed individuals - including
Jews and non-Jews alike - that the Protocols are a 'proven fraud',
this is not the case, as I will show.</p>
<p>The cry of 'anti-Semitic' is a standard one and almost automatic
from ill-informed, if often well-intentioned individuals who have
little background knowledge of the vast history and consciousness
of the perpetrators of the 'world revolution'. The majority of
people remain drastically unaware of the conspiracy because a vital
aspect of the conspiracy is to hide itself behind many walls of
secrecy, as the following information will show. Those that would
call 'anti-semitism', or say 'there is no conspiracy', are amongst
the greatest victims of the very conspiracy they vehemently
deny.</p>
<p>Someone who has lived in a box without windows for their entire
life might genuinely cry out 'there is no sun, it is a myth, a
vicious lie and anti-boxism'. There remains, however the
unalterable fact that there is a sun and those that point this out
to the one in the box, in an attempt to enlighten and free them
from self-imposed ignorance, are not automatically 'anti-boxists'
or feel any sort of hatred towards boxes or those who live in them
at all.</p>
<p><b>Neither is the reporting of the following document
anti-Semitic.</b></p>
<p>It is a call to the attention of those who may have been born
into the current age of suppression and propaganda, and have yet to
recoup some of this information which until very recently was
openly discussed on a global scale. However, since the triumphs of
Zionism and the further implementation of mass mind / information
control since the Second World War, with regards to anything
remotely Jewish, such information has been buried through
censorship and revision of history-books by the very power which
imposed the conspiracy in the first place. The Protocols make it
quite clear that 'anti-semitism', meaning 'anti-Judaic', is an
'indispensable' part of the plan for world domination. It will be
used for 'the management of our lesser brethren'. This document
makes chilling reading for both Jews and Gentiles alike when one
looks back to the treatment of Jewry during the Second World War;
that a self-appointed elite should be willing to sacrifice and
allow the persecution of their 'lesser brethren', for the greater
aim of world domination, should be a wake-up-call to all of Jewry,
the vast majority of whom constitute what the authors of the
Protocols deem to be 'lesser brethren'.</p>
<p>'Anti-Semitic' is a phrase which means 'against Semites' but has
come to be used solely as meaning 'anti-Jewish'. The irony inherent
in this ill-used phrase is that the Semitic Arabs are actually
amongst the greatest victims in the crime and fraud known as
Zionism, in which Russian Jews, who are racially
<b>non-Semitic</b>, in the first half of the Twentieth Century,
fostered and executed a plan (as prophesied by God through Ezekiel
11:15) to create an officially recognised Jewish homeland in
Palestine. The result of which was the mass displacement and
persecution of the indigenous Arab citizens. This is without doubt
'anti-semitism' at its worst. And yet to state this plain fact
openly today is to invite the accusation of being 'anti-Semitic'! I
will also show in this work that the ordinary Jewish people,
unbeknownst to themselves, have been victims to the same ancient
agenda and are considered by the Elders to be necessary sacrifices
to their cause. As the British; American and other Anglo-Saxon and
Celtic peoples are also descended from Shem/Sem, they are also
Semitic peoples. Therefore anyone who is anti-British or
anti-American is anti-Semitic, in the true definition of the term.
But, of course, as explained in the Protocols, it is the Jews who
publish the dictionaries and so they define the words according to
their plan.</p>
<p>The main point pertinent to this work is that the plan and
execution of this agenda was predicted and detailed in the
Protocols, before the Zionist plan began to be put into action
openly on the world stage. More dramatically, however, the agenda
outlined in the Protocols was foreshadowed by over 2,000 years of
similar documents, edicts and statements.</p>
<p>The document itself attributes the authorship of these self-same
conspiratorial Protocols to the highest echelons of world Jewry. It
would be <b>madness</b> to ignore the possibility that this
document is genuine and authored by those claimed, simply because
certain people find it offensive. Because if it is genuine, then
people absolutely should find it offensive! It is the greatest
single betrayal of both Jews and Gentiles imaginable. Even if it
were not authored by a Jewish elite, the fact that world Jewry have
suffered along the very lines as predicted in the document, should
be enough for every Jew alive to give this document their full
attention.</p>
<p>Both Communism and Zionism can be seen to be the two means by
which the Protocols unfolded during the early Twentieth Century.
Whilst Communism acted to tear down the Russian aristocratic system
and replace it with a tyranny and dictatorship led predominantly by
Jews, placing a vast area of territory and human resources into the
hands of the conspirators, Zionism used the false accusation of the
need for the establishment of the prophesied Jewish homeland to
re-home the Eastern Jews who were being badly persecuted in Russia
at the time. In fact, as is shown by government documents of the
time, the accusation of mass anti-Semitism and pogroms in Russia at
the turn of the century (against Jews who are non-Semitic; being
descendants of Japheth, not Shem) is massively exaggerated. This
was essentially a Press-led propaganda tactic employed in the West
to further the aims of Zionist interests and to ease the passage of
the masses of Eastern Jews who emigrated to the West around the
late 19th and early 20th Century. According to Zionist Rabbi
Stephen Wise, until 1900, American Zionism was confined to
immigrant Jews (Khazar Ashkenazim decended from Japheth, not Shem -
Genesis 10:3), and the mass of American Jews (mainly German
'Western' Sephardim) were opposed to it. However, by 1910, a
million Jewish immigrants had arrived in America from Russia and
the Zionist lobby began to represent a significant number of
voters. Today, Jews represent approximately 3% of the American
population but occupy more or less 90% of all the key positions in
the US-Administration. Just as in Russia following the Bolshevik
Revolution, the number of Jews numbered around 10% of the
population, whereas the number of Jews in the Bolshevik government
was approximately 90%.</p>
<p>Another interesting 'coincidence', President Franklin Roosevelt
(from a Jewish family) had seventy-two advisors around him when he
led the USA into World War II of whom fifty-two were known Jews.
The Elders of Zion consist of the <b>Sanhedrin</b>, the highest
Jewish authority since Biblical times, officially numbering 71, and
the Judaic texts also reveal the existence of a king, making 72.
Whilst in Britain in 1999, the Labour government admitted that it
has 72 official 'advisors' or 'spin-doctors' (professional-liars).
Both Roosevelt and Blair have implemented social 'reforms' called
the 'New Deal', which in the USA was also known by those in the
know as the 'Jew Deal'. Do we see here history repeating
itself?</p>
<p><b>As the well tried and tested truism says: those who refuse to
learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them.</b></p>
<p>The British and American governments were manipulated by the
Zionists - against the overwhelming opposition of the Western Jews
and the Palestinian Jews and the majority of Gentiles - to commit
themselves to the creation of an official Jewish homeland in
Palestine, which had nothing to do with British national interest,
at an enormous cost during a time - the First World War - when all
manpower and resources were desperately needed to fight the
enemy.</p>
<p>Why this should have occurred is against all logic. However, the
most revealing insight into the modus agendi and the modus operandi
of the world manipulators is acquired through reading the
Protocols.</p>
<p>Not only does this document illuminate the reason for the
massive success of international Zionism, but it also provides
profound insight into every single political situation of the last
century and sheds great light on much of what has transpired for
the past 2,600 years on the world stage.</p>
<p><b>Stunningly, virtually everything planned for and predicted in
the Protocols has provably come to pass. This document is as
pertinent today as it was when it first came to light in
1905.</b></p>
<p>Recent world political history has been provably controlled and
manipulated by Russian Jews, who have <b>no</b> racial ties or
origin in the land of Palestine, who flocked to the West a century
ago. That century has provably unfolded according to the Protocols,
which ascribe themselves to the elite of world Jewry. The earliest
Israelite holy works (The Torah), right up to the latest (Jewish
Talmud and Zohar) have continually promised that the world would be
delivered to the true Israelites and that the Gentile nations would
be consumed; grafted into and ruled by the single Chosen People who
would govern them. That this would be a 'coincidence', and the
Protocols a mere act of deceitful anti-semitism, has to be the
grossest form of ill-logic.</p>
<p><b>The <a href="/index.php?q=node/view/48#Protocols">Protocols of the Learned Elders of
Zion</a> is a document which should be read by all</b>. No other
single document provides us with such a clear understanding of why
the world is gradually moving towards a One World Government,
controlled by an irreproachable <a href="http://jahtruth.net/horse.htm">'Hidden Hand'</a>. In fact, in the
Protocols, we are given clear insights as to why so many
incomprehensible political decisions are made in both local,
national and international politics, which seem to continually work
against the favour of the masses and in favour of the vested
interests of the banking / industrial cartel - the global power
elite.</p>
<p><b>We ignore it at our peril.</b><br/>

Historical Background</p>
<p>The Satanic Conspiracy, being executed by the Synagogue of Satan
as Christ calls them (Rev. 2:9*), against YHWH ("I AM" - God); the
true Israelites and The Torah, to replace them, and it, with
themselves and the Jewish Talmud has been in existence for at least
2,600 years as is confirmed by YHWH ("I AM") Himself in the Books
of His Prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel.</p>
<p>* Rev. 2:9 <font color="#3333FF">"I (Christ) know thy works, and
tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and [I know] the
blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are <b>NOT</b>, but
[are] (Idumeans) the <b>Synagogue of Satan</b>."</font></p>
<p>It is a <b>FACT</b> and not a theory, that there has been an
on-going <b>CONSPIRACY</b> for at least 2,600 years; according to
YHWH's Own personal Testimony in The Bible; as a result of which
Jerusalem and Solomon's Temple were both destroyed and The "Lost"
Ark of The Covenant was removed from Judah, by Jeremiah and taken
to a safe place and hidden. YHWH did this to allow the <a href="/01.htm">CONSPIRACY</a> to run its course, so that ALL those who
took part in the <a href="/01.htm">CONSPIRACY</a>, either actively
or passively by not keeping The Covenant and The Torah and thereby
using The Torah to fight against the Conspiracy and thus ALLOWING
it to happen, would demonstrate their continued treason against Him
and The Ark would be kept safe until it was needed again, at the
right time, to destroy the Conspiracy:-</p>
<p><a href="http://jahtruth.net/request.htm">http://jahtruth.net/request.htm</a></p>
<p><b>Jeremiah around 590 B.C</b>.<br/>
11:1 The Word that came to Jeremiah from the "I AM", saying,<br/>
11:2 Hear ye the words of The Covenant, and speak unto the men of
Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;<br/>
11:3 And say thou unto them, Thus saith the "I AM" God of Israel;
Cursed [be] the man that obeyeth not the words of this
Covenant,<br/>
11:4 Which I commanded your fathers in the day [that] I brought
them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying,
Obey My voice, and do them, according to all which I command you:
so shall ye be My people, and I will be your God:<br/>
11:5 That I may perform the Oath which I have sworn unto your
fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as [it
is] this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O "I AM".<br/>
11:6 Then the "I AM" said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the
cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye
the words of The Covenant, and DO them.<br/>
11:7 For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day [that]
I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, [even] unto this day,
rising early and protesting, saying, Obey My voice.<br/>
11:8 Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every
one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring
upon them all the words of this Covenant, which I commanded [them]
to do; but they did [them] not.<br/>
11:9 And the "I AM" said unto me, A <b>CONSPIRACY</b> is found
among the men of Judah (Jew-dah), and among the inhabitants of
Jerusalem.<br/>
11:10 They are turned back to the inequities of their forefathers,
which refused to hear My words; and they went after other gods to
serve them: the House of Israel (Ten Northern Tribes) and the House
of Judah (Two Southern Tribes) have broken My Covenant which I made
with their fathers.<br/>
11:11 Therefore thus saith the "I AM", Behold, I will bring evil
upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they
shall cry unto Me, I will not hearken unto them.<br/>
11:12 Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem
go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they
shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.<br/>
11:13 For [according to] the number of thy cities were thy gods, O
Judah; and [according to] the number of the streets of Jerusalem
have ye set up altars to [that] shameful thing, [even] altars to
burn incense unto Baal.<br/>
11:14 Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a
cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear [them] in the time that
they cry unto Me for their trouble.<br/>
11:15 What hath My beloved to do in Mine House, [seeing] she hath
wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee?
when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.<br/>
11:16 The "I AM" called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, [and]
of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult He hath kindled
fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.<br/>
11:17 For the "I AM" Lord of hosts, that planted thee, hath
pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the House of Israel
(Ten "Lost" Tribes - Britain and U.S.A.) and of the House of Judah
(The Two Tribes that are Jewish), which they have done against
themselves to provoke Me to anger in offering incense unto
Baal.<br/>
11:18 And the "I AM" hath given me knowledge [of it], and I know
[it]: then thou showedst me their doings.<br/>
11:19 But I [was] like a lamb [or] an ox [that] is brought to the
slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me,
[saying], Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let
us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no
more remembered.</p>
<p>Further proof provided by YHWH via His Prophet Ezekiel that the
Jewish Conspiracy against Him is an historical FACT and not a
theory.</p>
<p><b>Ezekiel around 585 B.C.</b><br/>
22:17 And the Word of the "I AM" (YHWH) came unto me, saying,<br/>
22:18 Son of man, the "House of Israel" (the Ten "lost" Tribes -
Britain and USA) is to Me become dross: all they [are] brass, and
tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are
[even] the dross of silver.<br/>
22:19 Therefore thus saith the Lord "I AM"; Because ye are all
become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of
Jerusalem.<br/>
22:20 [As] they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and
tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to
melt [it]; so will I gather [you] in Mine anger and in My fury, and
I will leave [you there], and melt you (Malachi 4**).<br/>
22:21 Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of My
wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.<br/>
22:22 As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye
be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the "I AM"
have poured out My fury upon you.<br/>
22:23 And the Word of the "I AM" came unto me, saying,<br/>
22:24 Son of man, say unto her, Thou [art] the land that is not
cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.<br/>
22:25 [There is] a <b>CONSPIRACY</b> of her prophets in the midst
thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured
souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have
made her many widows in the midst thereof.<br/>
22:26 Her priests have violated My Law, and have profaned Mine
Holy things: they have put no difference between the Holy and
profane, neither have they showed [difference] between the unclean
and the clean, and have hid their eyes from My Sabbaths, and I am
profaned among them.<br/>
22:27 Her princes in the midst thereof [are] like wolves ravening
the prey, to shed blood, [and] to destroy souls, to get dishonest
gain.<br/>
22:28 And her prophets have daubed them with untempered [mortar]
(the UNO and NATO - see ch.13*), seeing vanity, and divining lies
unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord "I AM", when the "I AM" hath
not spoken.<br/>
22:29 The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised
robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have
oppressed the stranger wrongfully.<br/>
22:30 And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the
hedge (defences), and stand in the gap before Me for the land, that
I should not destroy it: but I found none.<br/>
22:31 Therefore have I poured out Mine indignation upon them; I
have consumed them with the fire of My wrath: their own way have I
recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord "I AM".<br/>
23:1 The Word of the "I AM" came again unto me, saying,<br/>
23:2 Son of man, there were two women (Israel and Judah), the
daughters of one mother (Israel - 12 Tribes):<br/>
23:3 And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed
whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and
there they bruised the teats of their virginity.<br/>
23:4 And the names of them [were] Israel the elder, and Judah her
sister: and they were Mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus
[were] their names; Samaria (Israel - 10 Tribes) [is] Aholah, and
Jerusalem (Judah - 2 Tribes) Aholibah.</p>
<p>* <b>Ezekiel</b> 13:-<br/>
13:1 And the Word of the "I AM" came unto me, saying,<br/>
13:2 Son of man, prophesy against the prophets (politicians) of
Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of
their own hearts, Hear ye the Word of the "I AM";<br/>
13:3 Thus saith the Lord "I AM"; Woe unto the foolish prophets,
that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!<br/>
13:4 O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts
("Desert Fox").<br/>
13:5 Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge
(defences) for the "House of Israel" (Britain and USA) to stand in
the battle (of Armageddon) in The Day of the "I AM".<br/>
13:6 They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The "I
AM" saith: and the "I AM" hath not sent them: and they have made
[others] to hope that their words would be confirmed.<br/>
13:7 Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a
lying divination, whereas ye say, The "I AM" saith [it]; albeit I
have not spoken?<br/>
13:8 Therefore thus saith the Lord "I AM"; Because ye have spoken
vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I [am] against you, saith
the Lord "I AM".<br/>
13:9 And Mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and
that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of My people,
neither shall they be written in the writing of the "House of
Israel", neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye
shall know that I [am] the Lord "I AM".<br/>
13:10 Because, even because they have seduced My people, saying,
Peace; and [there was] NO peace; and one built up a wall (U.N.),
and, lo, others daubed it with untempered [mortar]:<br/>
13:11 Say unto them which daub [it] with untempered [mortar], that
it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O
great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind ("<a href="http://jahtruth.net/theiofk.htm">Desert Storm</a>") shall rend
[it].<br/>
13:12 Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you,
Where [is] the daubing wherewith ye have daubed [it]?<br/>
13:13 Therefore thus saith the Lord "I AM"; I will even rend [it]
with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing
shower in Mine anger, and great hailstones in [My] fury to consume
[it].<br/>
13:14 So will I break down the wall (U.N.) that ye have daubed
with untempered [mortar], and bring it down to the ground, so that
the (Elders of Zion / <a href="/index.php?q=node/view/48#main">Illuminati</a> / NWO)
foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye
shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I
[am] the "I AM".<br/>
13:15 Thus will I accomplish My wrath upon the wall (U.N.), and
upon them that have daubed it with untempered [mortar], and will
say unto you, The wall [is] no [more], neither they that daubed
it;<br/>
13:16 [To wit], the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning
Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and [there is]
no peace, saith the Lord "I AM".</p>

<p>YHWH has told the world on the last page of the Old Covenant /

Revelation to John, in Revelation/Apocalypse 14:3 and 15:3.</p>
<p><b>Revelation</b>:-<br/>
14:3 And they sung as it were a "<b>New Song</b>" (Isaiah 42:10)
before the Throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and
no man could learn that "Song" <b>EXCEPT</b> the hundred [and]
forty [and] four thousand, which were redeemed from the Earth.</p>
<p>15:3 And they sing the "Song of Moses" (The Torah - Old Covenant
- Deut. 31) the servant of God, <b>AND</b> the "Song of the Lamb"
(New Covenant), saying, Great and marvellous [are] Thy works, Lord
God Almighty; just and <b>TRUE</b> [are] Thy Ways, Thou King of the

harmonised and referred to as the "<b>New Song</b>" by Christ in
Revelation 14:3 and 15:3 above and by God in Isaiah 42:10.</p>
<p><b>Isaiah</b>:-<br/>
42:10 Sing unto the "I AM" the "<b>New Song</b>" (Rev. 14:3;

<p><a href="http://jahtruth.net/request.htm">http://jahtruth.net/request.htm</a></p>
<p>Since c. 600 BC, there has been a conspiracy by a few to conquer
and destroy the many. The few are identified in the Bible as the
Synagogue of Satan who falsely claim to be from the tribes of Judah
and Benjamin and who ghettoised themselves at Jerusalem under the
Talmud. This would be the origin of the people we call 'the Jews'.
A small sect of people ruled with an iron hand of tyranny and fear
by a minority of apostate / counterfeit <a href="http://jahtruth.net/rabbis.htm">Levitical</a> priests who
<b>claimed</b> (falsely) to speak for Yahweh, whose house on Earth
was the Temple in Jerusalem and to be His Chosen people, when they
are not, but are, in reality, His enemies, whom He hates (Malachi
1:1 - 2:11). Using this deception they have claimed that the
Scriptures about Israel refer to them and that they should destroy
anyone who will not accept their evil Talmud and lordship; as they
did to Jesus.</p>
<p><i>If thou shalt indeed...do all that I speak, then I will be an
enemy unto thine enemies...and will destroy all the people to whom
thou shalt come.</i></p>
<p>And one of the main observances demanded of God, for which His
reward will be utter defeat of the enemy, was written in
Deuteronomy 12:2:</p>
<p><i>Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations
which ye shall possess served other gods.</i></p>
<p>This was reconfirmed by Christ, as is recorded in Matthew 6
where <a href="http://jahtruth.net/nomos.htm">Jesus commanded his
followers NOT to pray in churches</a>.</p>
<p>The above plan, clearly defined, to deliver the world unto the
Synagogue of Satan through the extermination and enslavement of the
Gentile nations is to be carried out according to Satan's wishes
and it is Satan who dictated the Protocols to the Elders of Zion.
No man, or men, could have thought up the Protocols, only Satan
himself could have done so and then telepathically dictated them to
his synagogue. The Protocols are the opposite of The Covenant and
demonstrate precisely why YHWH wrote <a href="http://jahtruth.net/covt.htm">The Covenant</a> exactly as He did,
forbidding any other legislation or any alteration of The Covenant,
to prevent those who kept it from being deceived by counterfeit
Satanically inspired man-made legislation like the
Jewish/Babylonian Talmud; <a href="http://jahtruth.net/hadith.htm">Hadith</a> and all human government
legislation; etc.</p>
<p>According to Torah lore, every time the true Israelites are
persecuted or come across any kind of misfortune, this is defined
as the literal manifestation of Yahweh's disfavour. It is a sign
that the Israelite people have strayed further from God's favour
and are being punished. This means that the Israelite people must
strive to be observant of The Law to find favour in God's eyes
which will culminate in leading them back to the 'Promised
Land'.</p>
<p>This is a highly significant point in relation to the Protocols
which state that anti-Semitism is a necessary part of the
fulfilment of the ancient agenda, in which many Jews will be
sacrificed to the cause, so that the Synagogue of Satan can steal
the 'Promised Land' again from its rightful true Israelite
owners.</p>
<p>The most recent example of how so-called anti-Semitism has been
used by the Elders to massively advance their agenda towards world
control from the seat of kingship in Jerusalem, is the Second World
War, during which millions of Jews were persecuted, resulting in an
almost global drive to facilitate the fulfilment of the Judaic
'return' to Palestine and the creation of the Jewish state in
Israel (Ezekiel 11:15 Son of man, thy brethren, [even] thy
brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the House of Israel
wholly, [are] they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[Zionists] have said, Get you far from the "I AM": unto us is this
land given in possession - Idumean zionists - <a href="http://jahtruth.net/emmau2.htm">22/4/1948</a>).</p>
<p>The later <a href="http://jahtruth.net/rabbis.htm">Levitical</a>
writings of the early centuries AD, by the Rabbinical caste, takes
the concept of 'Gentiles' one step further, to define them merely
as 'animals', or 'cattle' - goyim. This we find in the writings
known as the Talmud.</p>
<p><i>'The Talmud consists of 63 books of legal (?), ethical (?)
and historical writings of the ancient rabbis. It was edited five
centuries after the birth of Jesus. It is a compendium of law and
lore. It is the legal code which forms the basis of Jewish
religious law and it is the textbook used in the training of
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/rabbis.htm">rabbis</a>.'</i><br/>
<b><i>(Rabbi Morris N Kertzer - article 'What is a Jew', from Look
magazine 1952)</i></b></p>
<p><i>'Is the literature that Jesus was familiar with in his early
years yet in existence in the world? Is it possible for us to get
at it?...To such enquiries the learned class of Jewish rabbis
answer by holding up the Talmud...What is the Talmud? The Talmud,
then, is the written form of that which, in the time of Jesus was
called the traditions of the elders and to which he makes frequent
allusions.'</i><br/>
<b><i>(Michael Rodkinson [with Rabbi Isaac M Wise] - 'History of
the Talmud' my emphasis)</i></b></p>
<p>And what opinion did Jesus have of the Learned Elders of Zion;
the <b>Sanhedrin</b> and their traditions; that caused them to fear
him and have him crucified?:-</p>
<p><i><b>Matthew</b> 15:1 Then came to Jesus lawyers and
politicians [from the Idumean Sanhedrin], which were of Jerusalem,
saying,</i><br/>
<i>15:2 Why do thy disciples transgress the Tradition of the
Elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</i><br/>
<i>15:3 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also
transgress the COMMANDment of God by your Tradition?</i><br/>
<i>15:4 For God Commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother:
and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the
death.</i><br/>
<i>15:5 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to [his] father or [his]
mother, [It is] a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by
me;</i><br/>
<i>15:6 And honour not his father or his mother, [he shall be
free]. Thus have ye made the Commandment of God of none effect by
your Tradition (Talmud).</i><br/>
<i>15:7 [Ye] hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you,
saying,</i><br/>
<i>15:8 This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and
honoureth me with [their] lips; but their heart is FAR from
me.</i><br/>
<i>15:9 But in vain they do worship Me, teaching [for] doctrines
the commandments of men (man-made laws).</i></p>
<p><i>They answered (the Jews) and said unto him, Abraham is our
father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were <a href="http://jahtruth.net/abraham.htm">Abraham</a>'s children, ye would do
the works of Abraham...<b>If God were your Father, ye would love
me...Ye are of [your] father the devil</b>, and the lusts of your
father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode
not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he
speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the
father of it. And because I tell [you] the truth, ye believe me
not. Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why
do ye not believe me? He that is of God heareth God's words: ye
therefore hear [them] not, because ye are not of God.</i><br/>
<b><i>(John 8:39-47 my emphasis)</i></b></p>
<p><i><b>Matthew</b> 23:1 Then spoke Jesus to the multitude, and to
his disciples,</i><br/>
<i>23:2 Saying, The lawyers and the politicians sit in Moses' Law
seat:</i><br/>
<i>23:3 All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe of God's Law
(The Torah), [that] observe and do; but do not ye after their
example: for they say, and do not (and make up their own laws
against God's Orders - Deut. 4:2).</i><br/>
<i>23:4 For they bind heavy burdens (the Talmud) and grievous to
be borne, and lay [them] on men's shoulders; but they [themselves]
will not lift one of their fingers to remove them.</i><br/>
<i>23:5 But all their works they do for to be seen by men: they

&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Learned Elders of Zion, the rabbinical caste, are
acknowledged to exist. It is plain that the reported sentiment of
Jesus is that they were worshippers of a 'god' other than the one
of love and forgiveness which he preached. In fact he defines the
Judaic god to be the 'father of lies', in other words - Satan.</p>
<p>This is quite clear from the following passages quoted from the
Talmud and other Rabbinical talmudic writings, which also show the
continuing agenda of world domination through the destruction and
manipulation of the Gentile nations, which is still carried forth
by the elders and their followers over 600 years after it was first
accepted by them as their so-called official Yahwist manifesto:</p>
<p><i>'Just the Jews are humans, the non-Jews are not humans, but
cattle.' (Kerithuth 6b, page 78, Jebhammoth 61). 'The non-Jews have
been created to serve the Jews as slaves.' (Midrasch Talpioth 225).
'As you replace lost cows and donkeys, so you shall replace
non-Jews.' (Lore Dea 377,1).'Sexual intercourse with non-Jews is
like sexual intercourse with animals.' (Kethuboth 3b). 'The birth
rate of non-Jews has to be suppressed massively.' (Zohar 11, 4b).
'It is permitted to deceive a Goi.' (Babha Kama 113b), 'Do not have
any pity for them, for it is said (Deuter. Vii,2): Show no mercy
unto them. Therefore, if you see an Akum (non-Jew) in difficulty or
drowning, do not go to his help.' (Hilkoth Akum X,1). 'Even the
best of the Goyim should be killed.' (Abhodah Zarah 26b,
Tosephoth). 'When a Jew has a gentile in his clutches, another Jew
may go to the same gentile, lend him money and in his turn deceive
him, so that the gentile shall be ruined. For the property of the
gentile (according to our law) belongs to no one, and the first Jew
that passes has the full right to seize it.' (Schulchan Aruk, Law
24)</i></p>
<p>Again, there are many more such instances in the Talmud where
the Gentile - especially the Christian - is labelled as subhuman
and as merely there to be exploited or exterminated. The ultimate
goal is again clearly defined in the Talmud as the inheritance of
the Gentile nations, supposedly under Yahweh, but really under
Satan.</p>
<p>This has fundamental implications for our times, as the
Protocols will clearly show. The Protocols are merely another
document in a long history of documents to outline the Satanic
counterfeit of the plan first manifested in The Torah Book of
Deuteronomy, which was hijacked by the Jews and corrupted by them
in their Talmud. And, <i>'The Talmud is to this day the circulating
heart's blood of the Jewish religion. Whatever laws, customs or
ceremonies we observe - whether we are orthodox, conservative,
reform or merely spasmodic sentimentalists - we follow the Talmud.
It is our common Law.'</i> <b>(Herman Wouk - 'The Talmud').</b></p>
<p>There is no room here to trace the journey of the Talmudic
manifesto through history to the present day, for that I refer the
reader to the encyclopaedic masterwork, 'The Controversy of Zion'
by Douglas Reed. However, suffice it to say that this same
destructive principle, intimately associated with Jewry and more
specifically the hereditary and self-appointed elect of Zion, is
readily traceable throughout world history to the present day,
although today's history-books are very reluctant to document it,
for reasons which will be obvious by reading the Protocols.</p>
<p>The purpose of this brief history is to show that the Protocols
are not a unique work, unprecedented in history, but are the
product of an ancient heritage which has remained unbroken and
unaltered since at least the middle of the first millennium BC.</p>
<p>In 1492, Chemor, Chief <a href="http://jahtruth.net/rabbis.htm">Rabbi</a> of Spain received the
following reply from the Grand Sanhedrin (Elders of Zion) to his
plea for advice on how to deal with their threatened expulsion
under Spanish Law; it illustrates well how the same ancient agenda
was still being adhered to by the elect at this time:</p>
<p><i>'Beloved brethren in Moses (another lie), we have received
your letter in which you tell us of the anxieties and misfortunes
which you are enduring. We are pierced by as great a pain to hear
it as yourselves.</i></p>
<p><i>The advice of the Grand Satraps and the <a href="http://jahtruth.net/rabbis.htm">Rabbis</a> is the following:</i></p>
<p><i>1. As for what you say that the king of Spain obliges you to
become Christians: do it, since you cannot do otherwise.</i></p>
<p><i>2. As for what you say about the command to despoil you of
your property: make your sons merchants that they may despoil,
little by little, the Christians of theirs.</i></p>
<p><i>3. As for what you say about making attempts on your lives:
<b>make your sons doctors and apothecaries (pharmacists/chemists),
that they may take away Christian's lives.</b></i></p>
<p><i>4. As for what you say of their destroying your synagogues:
make your sons canons and clerics in order that they may destroy
their churches.</i></p>
<p><i>5. As for the other vexations you complain of: arrange that
your sons become advocates and lawyers, and see that they always
mix in affairs of State, that by putting Christians under your yoke
<b>you may dominate the world and be avenged on them</b>.</i></p>
<p><i>6. Do not swerve from this order that we give you, because
you will find by experience that, humiliated as you are, you will
reach the actuality of power.</i><br/>
<i>(Signed) Prince of the Jews of Constantinople'</i><br/>
<b><i>(Julio-Inigrez de Medrano - 'La Silva Curiosa' 1608 my
emphasis)</i></b></p>
<p>The above could almost be read as a prophecy of what was to come
in Europe. Many Jews did exactly as above and became intimate with
the established aristocratic order; becoming doctors, advisors,
private occultists and most significantly bankers to the
aristocracy and royal houses. The most famous example of this being
the House of Rothschild. This then gives us a very clear idea of
the methods which the Elders were prepared to employ to fulfil
their ancient manifesto. Again, there is clearly a direct
correlation between the beliefs and methods of the 14th century
Elders and those who originated the plan in c. 600 BC.</p>
<p>More than a prophecy, however, was the above 'advice' to the
Spanish Jews. For, according to Talmudic Law, the words of the
rabbis are deemed to be the words of God. In fact, the Talmud goes
even further by declaring (with blasphemous lies) that the
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/rabbis.htm">rabbis</a> are actually
advisors to Yahweh when He is uncertain (which He never is and
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/hadith.htm">He has condemned their
Talmud in Holy Scripture</a>):</p>
<p><i>'Jehovah himself in heaven studies the Talmud, standing; as
he has such respect for that book.' (Tr. Mechilla) 'The teachings
of the Talmud stand above all other laws. They are more important
than the Laws of Moses (The Torah).' (Miszna, Sanhedryn XI, 3).</i>
How did the Talmud get to be in heaven when it was written by evil
men, in direct opposition to God's Commandment in Deuteronomy
4:2???</p>
<p>Thus the Elders have placed themselves above even God (like
their master Lucifer/Satan tried to do - Isa. 14:12*). Thus these
so-called 'men of God' have actually defined themselves as
'God-men'. Therefore, such an edict from the Grand Sanhedrin will
have literally been heeded as 'divine' instruction and therefore
Law.</p>
<p>* <b>Isaiah</b>:-<br/>
<i>14:12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the
Morning (Star)! [How] art thou cut down to the earth, which didst
weaken the nations!</i><br/>
<i>14:13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into
heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit
also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the
North:</i><br/>
<i>14:14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be
like (take the Place of) The Most High.</i></p>
<p>It is unsurprising then, given the legal instruction to convert
to Christianity in order to 'dominate the world and be avenged',
that thousands did just that, often with disastrous consequences
for the Gentile host population.</p>
<p>One famous Jewish convert to Christianity was <b>Torquemada</b>,
the Inquisition's first <b>Grand Inquisitor</b> who had entered the
Dominican order (even before the edict of 1492) and eventually rose
to be the most powerful and most feared man in <a href="http://jahtruth.net/spaprop.htm">Spain</a>, causing the torture and
deaths of thousands of people. Critics of the Protocols often cite
the horrors of the Inquisition as an example of 'proof' that the
Church has a greater historical basis for being the head of the
conspiracy, as do they often cite the example of the Jesuit order
as being at the inner core rather than the Judaic Elders. However,
given the Talmudic/rabbinical edicts to infiltrate and destroy, as
well as the repeated stated aims of the Illuminati and Protocols,
it is not inconceivable that Jews living in accordance with their
religion have played a significant part in these two organisations
from the beginning:</p>
<p><i>The newly founded Society of Jesus...Saint Ignatius. His
secretary Polanco, the only person present at his deathbed, was of
Jewish descent. So was Lainez, one of his first and greatest
converts, was of Jewish descent...In a short time, as the young
Jesuit organization became a power for Catholic reform and
propaganda, Jews were attracted to it, as they are always attracted
to centers of influence, in such numbers that it was found
difficult to keep out those who wished to destroy the order and the
Church, under pretext of working for them. Thus a nephew of the
great and Catholic Jew Polanco followed him into the society, and
caused such difficulties and dissensions that for years he nearly
drove his superiors to despair.</i><br/>
<b>(Philip II, William Thomas Walsh, p. 95)</b></p>
<p>It is entirely in accordance with Talmudic law for Jews to
deceive Christians and even believe their tenets, whilst at the
same time working to destroy them from within. We will never know
the full extent to which this policy has been employed by the
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/horse.htm">'Hidden Hand'</a>.</p>
<p><b>Furthermore, there have even been several Jewish
popes:</b></p>
<p>Anacletus II (1130-1138), Innocent II (1130-1143), Calixtus III
(1168-1178), Clement VIII (1424-1420), Alexander VI (1492-1503),
and even Pius XI (1922-1939). In addition, Gregory VI (1045-1046)
and others may have been Jews or part-Jews. Anacletus II, Calixtus
III, and Clement VIII are generally classified as antipopes.<br/>
<b>(Dietrich Eckhart, Bolshevism From Moses to Lenin, translation
and footnotes by William L Pierce)</b></p>
<p>Pope Alexander VI is a very good example of a corrupt pope. He
was one of the infamous Borgias, father of Lucrezia (with whom he
was accused of having an incestuous affair), and was appointed by
his uncle. His reign as pope included the period just after the
expulsion from Spain of 160,000 Jews who refused to convert to
Christianity, the latter years of Torquemada's brutal campaign, and
the vast majority of <a href="http://jahtruth.net/spaprop.htm">Columbus's</a> invasion of the West
Indies.</p>
<p>In the 13th Century, another Jewish work began to gain
recognition. The Zohar is a 5 volume work which examines the Judaic
Torah and the Jewish mythologies from a mystical stance, and which
is the heart of the Jewish magical system known as the Kabbalah.
The Kabbalah is deemed to be an ancient oral tradition handed down
from mouth to ear (the root being QBL - 'from mouth to ear') since
Levitical times, and it's origin is 'attributed' to Moses.</p>
<p><i>From 1400 onward the sanctity of the Zohar became more widely
acknowledged in kabbalistic circles, and the criticisms of it which
was heard here and there in the 14th century (e.g., in Joseph ibn
Waqar who wrote: "the Zohar contains many errors of which one must
be wary, to avoid being misled by them") died down. At this time
the spread and influence of the Zohar were confined mainly to Spain
and Italy, and it was very slow to reach the Ashkenazi lands and
the East. The great elevation of the Zohar to a position of
sanctity and supreme authority came during and after the period of
the expulsion from Spain, and it reached its peak in the 16th and
17th centuries.</i><br/>
<b>(Encyclopaedia Judaica, 1997)</b></p>
<p>The fact that this work was accepted; amongst the Spanish and
Italians at the time of the letter from the Grand Sanhedrin to the
Chief Rabbi of Spain; is yet further proof of the existence of the
ancient conspiracy and its acceptance amongst the Jewish hierarchy.
It would hardly be reasonable to suppose that the Zohar would not
be known to the elders, as rabbinical teaching has it that it
originated from the earliest elders. The Zohar repeats the ancient
agenda in its own way. It states that the Messiah will declare war
on the whole world and all the kings will retaliate. But:</p>
<p><i>'...the Holy One, blessed be He, will display His force and
exterminate them from the world.'</i></p>
<p>Which is confirmed by Christ in Luke 19:27 and Revelation 17:14;
21:27 (29:27 in <a href="http://jahtruth.net/kofkad.htm">The King of
kings' Bible</a>).</p>
<p>Following which:</p>
<p><i>'Happy will be the lot of Israel, whom the Holy One, blessed
be He, has chosen from amongst the goyim of whom the Scriptures
say: "Their work is but vanity, it is an illusion at which we must
laugh; they will all perish when God visits them in His wrath." At
the moment when the Holy One, blessed be He, will exterminate all
the goyim of the world, Israel alone will subsist, even as it is
written: "The Lord alone will appear great on that day."'</i><br/>
<b>(Zohar, section Schemoth, folio 7 and 9b; section Beschalah,
folio 58b)</b></p>
<p>Confirmed by Christ in Revelation chapters 5 and 7.</p>
<p>How similar this sentiment appears to the Deuteronomic assertion
that: <i>'the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people
unto Himself, above all people that are on the face of the
Earth...Thou shalt be blessed above all people...And thou shalt
consume all the people which the Lord thy God shall deliver thee;
thine eyes shall have no pity upon them...And He shall deliver
their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from
under heaven; there shall no man be able to stand before thee,
until thou have destroyed them...' Showing an unbroken tradition
held as sacred by the Elders of Zion, passed down 'from mouth to
ear' for over 2,000 years!</i> Unfortunately for them, they are not
true Israel and they will be destoyed too (Zechariah 12:10-11).</p>
<p>In the 18th century we find yet another manifestation of the
ancient conspiracy, this time in the works of Adam <a href="/index.php?q=node/view/48#weishaupt">Weishaupt</a>, who founded in Bavaria his secret order
of the <a href="/index.php?q=node/view/48#main">Illuminati</a> in 1776. Many regard
Weishaupt's philosophy and work to be the true single origin of the
Protocols. However, I have to disagree strongly. Weishaupt's papers
and agenda were discovered in July 1785 when an Illuminati emissary
named Lanze was struck down by lightning whilst carrying them to
Silesia (a true 'Act of God'). The document, called The Original
Writings of the Order of the Illuminati, created such a case
against them that the order was legally suppressed. However, it
never really ceased to exist and exists to this day within secret
orders such as Freemasonry.</p>
<p>The stated aims of the Illuminati were to destroy the existing
order of society and replace it with a New World Order:</p>
<p><i>'...he proposed as the end of Illuminism the abolition of
property, social authority, of nationality, and the return of the
human race to the happy state in which it formed only a single
family without artificial needs, without useless sciences, every
father being a priest and magistrate...'</i><br/>
<b>(Henry Martin - <i>Histoire de France</i>)</b></p>
<p>The above plan will become very familiar to the reader upon
reading the Protocols. Indeed this socialist stance was the very
heart of the bloody conflict known as the French Revolution of
1789, which has been shown to have been orchestrated by Illuminist
Freemasons. There is no documented proof of that time that the
Illuminati were Judaic besides circumstantial evidence. Unless,
however, it is agreed that the Protocols are genuine, then we do
have that proof, as they state clearly that the same secret society
which wrote the Protocols were also the 'hidden hand' behind the
French Revolution. If the Protocols are genuinely sourced in the
work of the Elders of Zion, then we have no reason to doubt this
assertion. Therefore we have every reason to believe that Weishaupt
and the Illuminati were an order dedicated to the fulfilment of the
ancient conspiracy, and that the 'hidden hand' behind Weishaupt
was, in fact, the Elders of Zion.</p>
<p>It is always useful to look at who benefits from any upheaval on
the world stage. The result of the French Revolution was that the
Jews benefited enormously and in effect filled the vacuum of power
created by the destruction of the former aristocracy. In 1806,
Napoleon remarked:</p>
<p><i>'By what miracle did whole provinces of France become heavily
mortgaged to the Jews, when there are only sixty thousand of them
in this country?'</i><br/>
<b>(Letter quoted in MSS of Napoleon', 1811)</b></p>
<p>In the same vein, the only bodies to have substantially
benefitted from both World Wars were the Zionists, who gained an
entire homeland, and the Communists who inherited a sizeable share
of Eastern Europe. Whilst the West suffered enormously in terms of
indebtedness to the multinationals and banks, which were also
largely in the hands of Jewish financiers. It is an <b>obscene
delusion</b> that is held amongst the mind-controlled masses of the
Western world, who believe that the 'Allies', the 'good guys', won
the wars. The fact remains that the hidden Jewish power elite, who
never get their hands dirty or have to fight in any form of
conflict, have won virtually every war, large or small, of the 20th
Century.</p>
<p><i>'Israel won the war [WW I]; we made it; we thrived on it; we
profited from it. It was our supreme revenge on
Christianity.'</i><br/>
<b>(The Jewish Ambassador from Austria to London, Count Mensdorf,
1918).</b></p>
<p><i>'If you will look back at every war in Europe during the
nineteenth century, you will see that they always ended with the
establishment of a 'balance of power.' With every reshuffling there
was a balance of power in a new grouping around the House of
Rothschild in England, France, or Austria. They grouped nations so
that if any king got out of line, a war would break out and the war
would be decided by which way the financing went. Researching the
debt positions of the warring nations will usually indicate who was
to be punished.'</i><br/>
<b>(Economist Stuart Crane)</b></p>
<p><i>'He who sheds the blood of the Goyim, is offering a sacrifice
to God.'</i><br/>
<b>(<a href="http://jahtruth.net/hadith.htm">Talmud</a> - Jalqut
Simeoni)</b></p>
<p><b>Weishaupt's vision of a</b> New World Order of reason,
including the destruction of Christianity and the abolition of
property, was the forerunner of not only the French Revolution, but
also <a href="http://jahtruth.net/horse.htm">the Russian
Revolution</a>, which was provably orchestrated by Jews to the tune
of the conspiracy <b>as outlined in the Protocols</b>.</p>
<p>Again, confirmed by the Protocols in retrospect, is the manner
in which the Illuminati (the Elders) would execute their plans on
the world stage. They would use Freemasonry, as the host, into
which their agents would insert themselves and manipulate Europe's
aristocracy, royalty, politicians and thinkers from within an
already established ancient order, which up until that time had
been a Gentile organisation dedicated to carrying forth the secrets
of the ancients; the very secrets and wisdom which the
Judeo-Christian fraternities had sought to eradicate from Gentile
knowledge.</p>
<p><i>'For in concealment lies a great part of our strength. For
this reason we must always cover ourselves with the name of another
society. The lodges that are under Freemasonry are in the meantime
the most suitable cloak for our purpose...As in the spiritual
Orders of the Roman Church, religion was, alas! only a
<b>pretence</b>*, so must our Order also in a nobler way try to
conceal itself behind a learned society or something of the
kind...'</i><br/>
<b>(Weishaupt)</b></p>
<p>* <b>2 Corinthians</b> 11:13-15<br/>
<i>11:13 For such [are] <b>false</b> apostles, <b>deceitful</b>
workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of
Christ.</i><br/>
<i>11:14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an
angel of light.</i><br/>
<i>11:15 Therefore [it is] no great thing if his ministers also be
transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be
according to their works.</i><br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The implication of the above quote is that Roman Catholicism -
the very origin and executor of <a href="http://jahtruth.net/rabbis.htm">Christianity</a>* - was merely a front
for a hidden agenda operated from behind the scenes by a 'hidden
hand'. A most revealing statement when the above information on how
Jews were ordered to convert to Christianity in order to
'<b>dominate the world and be avenged</b>'. This is an awesome
concept to accept for most Christians, as it implies that
Christianity was essentially a stepping-stone to the greater
Judification of the world, and that its usefulness to the cause has
been deemed fulfilled by the secret ancient order which nurtured
it.</p>
<p>* <a href="http://jahtruth.net/darth.htm">http://jahtruth.net/darth.htm</a></p>
<p>Weishaupt entered Freemasonry in 1777, a year after the official
formation of the Illuminati. Despite profoundly despising
Freemasonry and Catholicism, <a href="/index.php?q=node/view/48#weishaupt">Weishaupt</a>
(who was a Catholic Priest) used both systems for his purposes. He
constructed the Order on the lines of the Jesuit Order and inserted
the Illuminati Order into the Freemasonic Order. He devised a
system of the pyramidal structure of a honeycomb, wherein each
operative of the agenda would operate within his own information
'cell'; so, should he be discovered, he would be unable to reveal
the secrets of anyone else operating in their own cell. These
compartmentalised agents would apparently operate in isolation,
whilst others higher in the chain of hierarchy would be able to
observe and guide those below them by having an overall picture of
the unfolding agenda. The very few have managed to control the very
many with this simple power structure for aeons. This way,
Weishaupt infiltrated Freemasonry and Illuminism took over the
order from within. He soon began remoulding the structure of
Freemasonry and inventing degrees of initiation which were,
according to him, really only smokescreens and tools for the
agenda. Through becoming the architect of modern Freemasonry,
Weishaupt was able to recruit the keenest minds of his time into
Illuminati level Freemasonry, whilst using the existing Freemasonic
structure as a smokescreen, through which he could influence the
spectrum of European aristocracy; royalty and all the levels of
European social hierarchy over which Freemasonry dominated as the
common element. Through the control of schools and centres of
higher learning, new initiates of the highest intellect and moral
predisposition were drawn to work for the agenda, either knowingly
or unknowingly.</p>
<p>I draw the readers' attention to the orders given to the Chief
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/rabbis.htm">Rabbi</a> in Spain, to have
the Jewish sons masquerade as their enemy in order to bring about
their enemy's downfall. Some researchers have concluded that
Weishaupt was himself a Jew. However, what is known as fact is that
he was himself surrounded by Jews in his associations. Jewish
writer, Bernard Lazare stated definitely that 'there were Jews,
Cabalistic Jews, around Weishaupt.' The similarity between
Weishaupt's agenda and that of the Elders is striking. Although not
overtly Judaic, the Weishaupt papers showed a methodology which
would achieve the same ends as the ancient conspiracy: <a href="/node/view/255">a World Order run by a self-appointed elite</a>. One clue
to the origin of the ideas of Weishaupt came in the following
statement made in his papers: '...the head of every family will be
what Abraham was, the patriarch, the priest, and the unfettered
lord of his family, and Reason will be the only code of Man.' Which
has striking similarities to the words of Moses Mendelssohn, the
spiritual leader of German Jewry, and one of the men queried to be
one of the 'Jews...around Weishaupt':</p>
<p><i>'Our Rabbis unanimously teach that the written and oral laws
which form conjointly our revealed religion are obligatory to our
nation only...We believe that all other nations of the earth have
been directed by God to adhere to the laws of nature, and to the
religion of the patriarchs.'</i><br/>
<b>(M Samuels - '<i>Memoirs of Moses Mendelssohn</i>')</b><br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the Weishaupt agenda became public via
an accident ('Act of God') whereby secret documents came into
public possession; therefore these documents and Weishaupt himself
may merely represent but a part of the greater agenda. He may only
ever have been a local branch-manager in a greater honeycombed
hierarchical structure, whose strings were pulled by agents beyond
even his knowledge. A mass of evidence weighs heavily in favour of
Weishaupt being but a worker-bee in the system which he only
apparently initiated via his Order of the Illuminati.</p>
<p>For a fuller picture of this stage of the conspiracy, I refer
the reader to 'Secret Societies and Subversive Movements', by Nesta
H Webster.</p>
<p>Through Freemasonry, the Illuminati secretly orchestrated the
fate of Europe, and from Europe the World.</p>
<p>The implementation of the Talmudic New World Order was clearly
seen and accurately predicted in the 18th Century by Benjamin
Franklin:</p>
<p><i>'I fully agree with General Washington, that we must protect
this young nation from an insidious influence and impenetration.
The menace, gentlemen, is the Jews.</i></p>
<p><i>In whatever country Jews have settled in any great number,
they have lowered its moral tone; depreciated its commercial
integrity; have segregated themselves and have not been
assimilated; have sneered at and tried to undermine the Christian
religion upon which that nation is founded, by objecting to its
restrictions; have built up a state within the state; and when
opposed have tried to strangle that country to death financially,
as in the case of Spain and Portugal.</i></p>
<p><i>For over 1,700 years, the Jews have been bewailing their sad
fate in that they have been exiled from their homeland, as they
call Palestine. But gentlemen, did the world give it to them in fee
simple, they would at once find some reason for not returning. Why?
Because they are vampires, and vampires do not live on vampires.
They cannot live only among themselves. They must subsist on
Christians and other people not of their race.</i></p>
<p><i>If you do not exclude them from these United States, in their
Constitution, in less than 200 years they will have swarmed here in
such great numbers that they will dominate and devour the land and
change our form of government, for which we Americans have shed our
blood, given our lives our substance and jeopardized our
liberty.</i></p>
<p><i>If you do not exclude them, <b>in less than 200 years our
descendants will be working in the fields to furnish them
substance</b>, while they will be in the counting-houses rubbing
their hands. I warn you, gentlemen, if you do not exclude Jews for
all time, your children will curse you in your graves.</i></p>
<p><i>Jews, gentlemen, are Asiatics, let them be born where they
will nor how many generations they are away from Asia, they will
never be otherwise. Their ideas do not conform to an American's,
and will not even though they live among us ten generations. A
leopard cannot change its spots. Jews are Asiatics, are a menace to
this country if permitted entrance, and should be excluded by this
Constitutional Convention'.</i><br/>
<b>(Statement made in a "Chit chat around the table during
intermission", at the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention of
1787. This statement was recorded in the dairy of Charles
Cotesworth Pinckney, a delegate from South Carolina - my
emphasis)</b></p>
<p>Then in the 19th Century, Benjamin Disraeli, a baptised Jew,
proclaimed:</p>
<p><i>'...the world is governed by very different personages from
what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes...The
influence of the Jews may be traced in the last outbreak of the
destructive principle in Europe. An insurrection takes place
against tradition and aristocracy, against religion and
property...The natural equality of men and the abrogation of
property are proclaimed by the secret societies who form
provisional governments and men of Jewish race are found at the
head of every one of them.'</i><br/>
<b>(From statement to House of Commons in 1852)</b></p>
<p><b>In Russia, the new power within Judaism was gaining
strength.</b></p>
<p>The Khazar Jews, or Eastern Jews, were an ancient warrior race
of Turkish (Edomite / Idumean - Esau) origin who had interbred with
the Ashkenazim and converted to Judaism en masse at the end of the
8th century. They were conquered by the native Russians and the
mass of Khazars remained in Russia under their own closely-knit
Talmudic government. They ghettoised themselves and lived under
strict Talmudic Law, segregating themselves as far as possible from
their host nation, except in the areas of occupation which could be
used to carry out the Talmudic edicts to profit from their
host.</p>
<p>From Russia the Khazarian Jews - otherwise called Ashkenazim -
migrated into Poland, Hungary, Czechoslavakia and Eastern Germany.
There again they maintained the self-imposed ghetto community which
was ordained by Talmudic Law.</p>
<p>In 1865 a certain Jewish Rabbi named Rzeichorn delivered a
speech at Prague. It is a very accurate summary of many aspects of
the Protocols which would come to light several decades later. The
following document was published eleven years later by Sir John
Radcliff, who was assassinated shortly afterwards, giving testimony
to the powers of the secret organisation of inner elite Jewry even
then. It is also a stark eye-opener for anyone who harbours the
impression that true orthodox Judaism is a religion, like others,
based upon the pursuit of spiritual betterment, love and universal
peace. Just like the Protocols, since this document was published,
the plan described within it has provably come to pass:</p>
<p><i>"Gold in the hands of experts will always be the most useful
weapon for those that possess it and an object of envy for those
who are without it.</i></p>
<p><i>"With gold one can buy the most upright consciences, with
gold one can fix the value of every stock, the price of every
merchandise, one can loan it to states that afterwards one holds at
ones mercy.</i></p>
<p><i>"Already the principal banks, the stock-exchanges throughout
the world, the loans to all the governments are in our
hands.</i></p>
<p><i>"The other great power is the press. By ceaselessly repeating
certain ideas, the press in the end makes them considered as
truths. The theatre renders similar services, everywhere theatre
and press follow our directives. By an indefatigable campaign in
favour of the Democratic form of government, we will divide the
Gentiles amongst themselves in political parties, we shall thus
destroy the unity of their nations, we will sow the seeds of
discord (Deuteronomy 28:14*; Matthew 12:25). Powerless, they will
have to accept the law of our bank, always united, always devoted
to our cause.</i></p>
<p>*<b>Deuteronomy</b> 28:14 And thou shalt not go aside from any
of the Words which I command thee this day, [to] the right hand
(politics), or [to] the left (politics), to go after other gods to
serve them.</p>
<p><b>Matthew</b> 12:25 And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said
unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to
desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall
not stand:</p>
<p><i>"We will push the Christians into wars, by a judicious
exploitation of their pride and stupidity. They will massacre each
other and thus make more space where we can place our own
people.</i></p>
<p><i>"The possession of land has always procured influence and
power. In the name of social justice and equality, we will divide
the great properties; we will give small fragments of these
properties to the peasants who desire them with all their heart,
but who will soon be indebted to us by the very exploitation of
these properties. Our capital will enable us to become the real
masters. In our turn we shall become the great owners of land, and
this possession will assure our power.</i></p>
<p><i>"Let us use all our force to replace the circulation of gold
by that of paper: our banks will absorb the gold, and we shall
decide then what value the paper money will have, this will make us
the masters of every man's existence.</i></p>
<p><i>"We have amongst ourselves many fine orators capable of
feigning enthusiasm and of convincing the masses! We will send them
amongst the nations to announce the changes that will make the
happiness and prosperity of mankind.</i></p>
<p><i>"By gold and by flattery, we will win the proletariat, who
will take on their shoulders the job of exterminating Christian
capitalism. We will promise to the workers salaries that they have
never even dared dream of, but we will also heighten the price of
all necessities, so much so, that our profits will be even
greater.</i></p>
<p><i>"In this manner we will prepare the revolutions that the
Christians will conduct themselves and out of which we shall
collect the fruits. By our jokes and by our attacks we will render
their priests ridiculous and eventually odious, their religion as
ridiculous, as odious as their priests. We shall become masters of
their souls, because our pious attachment to our religion will
prove to them the superiority of our souls.</i></p>
<p><i>"We have already established men of ours in all the key
positions. Let us make every effort to furnish the goys with
lawyers and doctors. Lawyers get to know about every interest.
Doctors, once they cross the threshold of a house, become the
confessors and directors of their patient's conscience. But above
all, let us get the control of the education, of the schools. By
them we will spread the ideas that are useful for us, and we will
mould the children's brains as we wish. If one of us falls into the
claws of justice by misfortune, let us all go to his aid, finding
as many witnesses as may be needed to save him from his judges
until the moment comes when it will be us who will be
judges."</i><br/>
<b>(Rzeichorn, published by Sir John Radcliff in 1876)</b></p>
<p>The preceding quotation was written in 1943 in John Amery's
<i>England and Europe</i>, to which he adds:</p>
<p><i>We have only to add from the Judisk Tidskrift No. 57, 1929,
the following short passage we owe to the pen of a certain
BLUMENTHAL:</i></p>
<p><i>"Our race has given to the world a new Messiah, but he has
two faces and bears two names, on one side he is called ROTHSCHILD,
head of the great capitalists, on the other,</i> <a href="http://jahtruth.net/horse.htm">Karl MARX</a><i>, the high priest of
the enemies of capitalism."</i></p>
<p>BLUMENTHAL could have added now that if his Messiah has two
faces he also has two masks, that of ROOSEVELT and American
imperialism, and that of STALIN and the Communist paradise. Between
the two, the <a href="http://jahtruth.net/britca.htm">British
Empire</a> is indeed trapped.</p>
<p>How all of the above <b>seems</b> to echo the preceding Mosaic
edicts in the Old Testament, according to which Rabbi Rzeichorn is
to be considered a righteous man for his apparent strict observance
of the Laws of YHWH, but remember that appearances can be and often
are deceptive. A counterfeit will deceive no-one and will be
useless if it does not appear to be the same as the genuine article
it seeks to replace; but even a carefully-made counterfeit will
fool only those who do not know the difference:</p>
<p><i>This day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear of
you upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall
hear the report of you, and shall tremble, and be in anguish
because of you. (Deuteronomy 2:25) For the Lord your God blesses
you, as he promised you; and you shall lend to many nations, but
you shall not borrow; and you shall reign over many nations, but
they shall not reign over you. (Deuteronomy 15:6) Both your male
slaves, and your female slaves, which you shall have, shall be of
the nations that are around you; of them shall you buy male slaves
and female slaves. Moreover of the children of the strangers that
do sojourn among you, of them shall you buy, and of their families
that are with you, which they fathered in your land; and they shall
be your possession. (Leviticus 25:44-45) And I will shake all
nations, so that the treasures of all nations shall come; and I
will fill this house with glory, says the Lord of hosts. The silver
is mine, and the gold is mine, says the Lord of hosts. (Tanach -
Twelve Prophets - Chagai / Hagai Chapter 2:7-8)</i></p>
<p>And from the Talmudic writings of the <a href="http://jahtruth.net/rabbis.htm">Rabbis</a> of the ages, Rzeichorn
shows himself to be merely repeating the views of the other
self-proclaimed 'god-men' of his 'tribe':</p>
<p><i>"Thou shalt not do injury to your neighbor, but it is not
said, 'Thou shalt not do injury to a goy." (Mishna Sanhedryn 57).
When you go to war, do not go as the first, so that you may return
as the first. Five things has Kannan recommended to his sons: 'Love
each other; love the robbery; hate your masters; and never tell the
truth' (Pesachim F. 113-B) "A Jew may rob a goy - that is, he may
cheat him in a bill, if unlikely to be perceived by him."
(Schulchan ARUCH, Choszen Hamiszpat 28, Art. 3 and 4). "Those who
do not confess the Torah and the Prophets must be killed. Who has
the power to kill them, let them kill them openly, with the sword.
If not, let them use artifices, till they are done away with."
(Schulchan Aruch, Choszen Hamiszpat 424, 5) "All property of other
nations belongs to the Jewish nation, which consequently is
entitled to seize upon it without any scruples. An orthodox Jew is
not bound to observe principles of morality towards people of other
tribes. He may act contrary to morality, if profitable to himself
or to Jews in general." (Schulchan Aruch, Choszen Hamiszpat
348).</i></p>
<p>It was from Jews of these fiercely Talmudic Eastern European and
Russian communities that the philosophy of Zionism was launched
upon the world political stage at the end of the 19th Century. The
fact that the eastern Jews had absolutely no racial ties or rights
to this was not taken into account in the later creation of the
Jewish state of 'Israel' by the worldwide cabal of Zionists in
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/emmau2.htm">1948</a> (see Ezekiel 11:15).
Of course, the concept of Zionism also has sinister implications
for the world's Gentiles, as we have witnessed from the Talmudic
passages previously cited. The main excuse used to convince the
West that Zionism was desirable, was the mass reporting in the
press of terrible persecution of Jews in the homeland. This was
essentially press-led propaganda to generate sympathy for the
cause.</p>
<p>At the same time as Zionism was being fermented in the West and
continued to gain support there in essentially Protestant (Old
Testament biased) political minds, who wished to aid the cause of
their religious forebears, so in the East the philosophy of
Communism was being developed and began to grow as a substantial
political force. The Communist philosophers and leaders were drawn
from Talmudic Jewish areas of Russia. The very ideal of Communism
was to destroy the existing social order and rule over Russia, then
to take that further towards a world revolution. Again, the
passages of Deuteronomy, the Talmud and the Protocols illustrate
this is the exact same agenda as has been shown to be an ancient
conspiracy maintained and executed throughout the past 2,600 years
up until this point in question.</p>
<p><b>Zionism and Bolshevism succeeded in the same week in</b>
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/horse.htm">1917</a><b>.</b></p>
<p>The former in London, when the British government finally
committed itself to the establishment of a Jewish Palestine, and
the latter in Moscow at the outbreak of the Bolshevik
Revolution.</p>
<p>One bitter irony of this saga was that having conquered Russia
under a Judaic government, Bolshevism had destroyed the very reason
for which Zionism officially came into being - the alleged
persecution of the Jews in Russia. The Communist government,
consisting largely of Jews, made anti-Semitism illegal. But this
was all very conveniently forgotten as the British and American
Zionists ploughed forward on their 'Holy' mission.</p>
<p>Zionism and Communism were undoubtedly two sides of the same
coin. The situation is well summarised by the following passage
from Douglas Reed:</p>
<p>In the tradition of Edmund Burke and John Robison, George
Washington and Alexander Hamilton and Disraeli, Mr Winston
Churchill wrote:</p>
<p><i>'It would almost seem as if the Gospel of Christ and the
gospel of anti-Christ were designed to originate from the same
people; and that this mystic and mysterious race had been chosen
for the supreme manifestations, both of the divine and the
diabolical...From the days of 'Spartacus' Weishaupt to those of
Karl Marx, and down to Trotsky (Russia), Bela Kun (Hungary), Rosa
Luxembourg (Germany) and Emma Goldman (United States), this
worldwide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation and for the
reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of
envious malevolence and impossible equality, has been steadily
growing. It played, as a modern writer, Mrs Nesta Webster, has so
ably shown, a definitely recognisable part in the tragedy of the
French Revolution. It has been the mainspring of every subversive
movement during the nineteenth century; and now at last this band
of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great
cities of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the
hair of their heads and have become practically the undisputed
masters of that enormous empire. There is no need to exaggerate the
part played in the creation of Bolshevism and in the bringing about
of the <a href="http://jahtruth.net/horse.htm">Russian Revolution</a>
by these international and for the most part atheistical Jews (the
Synagogue of Satan - Rev. 2:9). It is certainly a very great one;
it probably outweighs all others.'</i></p>
<p>This is the last candid statement (discoverable by me) from a
leading public man on this question. After it the ban on public
discussion came down and the great silence ensued, which continues
to this day. In 1953 Mr Churchill refused permission (requisite
under English Law) for a photostat to be made of this article
(Illustrated Sunday Herald, February 8, 1920), without saying
why.</p>
<p><i>'...Mr Winston Churchill in 1922 (when he was Colonial
Secretary), "Unauthorised statements have been made to the effect
that the purpose in view is to create a wholly Jewish Palestine.
Phrases have been used such as 'Palestine is to become as Jewish as
England is English' " (a direct rebuke to Dr Weizmann) "His
Majesty's government regard any such suggestion as impracticable
and have no such aim in view. Nor have they at any time
contemplated the disappearance or subordination of the Arabic
population, language or culture in Palestine" (in the Second World
War, as Prime Minister, and after it as Opposition leader, Mr
Churchill gave his support to the process here denied).</i><br/>
<b><i>(The Controversy of Zion,</i> Douglas Reed<i>)</i></b></p>
<p>Of course, Churchill would go on to be one of the pivotal
figures of world history, working closely with Jewish and
non-Jewish Zionist bankers and politicians such as the Rothschilds.
He was undoubtedly an agent of the Illuminati/Elders by then.</p>
<p>Since the Second World War, the whole subject of the ancient
conspiracy, the Jewish hatred of the Gentile nations, and the very
historical records which show the massive destructive influence
which the Jews have had upon mankind, have all been made taboo. The
average person reacts with outrage and horror today at the very
suggestion that the Jewish people may be anything other than the
world's most persecuted race. But the average person has absolutely
no information on which to base his or her opinion. The reaction to
exposure of the ancient conspiracy is merely a pre-programmed
Pavlovian reaction, created and instilled by the very perpetrators
of the same ancient conspiracy. And today, very few will dare speak
above a whisper of that all-encompassing Judaic oppression of
mankind. Just like the Jews of old became Christians in order to
escape persecution, so has most of the general population become
agents of Judaism, knowingly or unknowingly, as in the days of the
Biblical Esther:</p>
<p><i>And in every province, and in every city, wherever the king's
command and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast
and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for
the fear of the Jews fell upon them.</i><br/>
<b><i>(Esther 8:17)</i></b></p>
<p>It is extremely rare today to find information about the ancient
conspiracy, due to the mass censorship of the printed word, and the
unwillingness of the general population to consider as a
possibility something which they have been brought up since birth
to see as outrageous and ridiculous. Each generation is born into a
world of greater and greater censorship and <b>illusion</b>*.
Eventually, it will be impossible to trace the true history of the
Jews and their destructive influence. Everyone will have become so
Judaised that the very thought of a Judaic oppression will be alien
to the minds of all.</p>
<p><i>* <b>Revelation</b> 12:9</i><br/>
<i>12:9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent,
called the Devil, and Satan, <b>which deceiveth the whole
world</b>: he was cast out to the earth, and his angels (you - Luke
9:55) were cast out with him (Matthew 25:41).</i></p>
<p>How unusual then it was to hear the following words on a major
television news station (CNN):</p>
<p><i>'Every race has inherited traits. In the case of the Jews
they include trading, money-changing, usury, and a loathing for
"productive labor" which is scorned as beneath the dignity of the
Jews in their "bible" called "THE TALMUD." (<b>NOT</b> The
Torah/Pentateuch - JAH)</i></p>
<p><i>The Jews have not changed since the days when Jesus Christ
took up a whip and drove "the money changers out of the Temple."
Jews have always united to form monopolies. Today they control all
the department store chains and speciality shops along with the
lucrative jewellery and animal fur trade. Jews dominate the fields
of all precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, tin, lead,
etc. They will always band together to drive Gentile competitors
out of business.</i></p>
<p><i>Today America is being flooded with Jewish immigrants from
Russia and even 20,000 per year leave Israel for the U. S. - all
with dollar signs in their eyes. Jews have used their vaunted
money-power to seize control of the Democratic Party and constitute
over 50% of all its financial contributions. Today they are buying
up more and more major U. S. companies. While only 3% of the
population, the Jews control over 25% of the nation's wealth and
this percentage rises every year. They are the only racial group
totally organized to work for political domination over
America.</i></p>
<p><i>Opposition to the Jews did not begin in Germany but dates
back before the birth of Christ over 2,000 years ago! Study the
statements made by "The world's greatest men." They reveal why the
"wandering Jews" have made enemies out of every host country that
ever accepted them.'</i><br/>
<b><i>(Shimon Peres Israeli Prime Minister, talking about Orthodox
Jewish Rabbis on CNN, November 14, 1995)</i></b></p>
<p>The blatant 'swagger' and admission by those aligned with Israel
is allowed to go almost unchallenged by the cowering West. They are
allowed to express anti-Gentile sentiments in their own country,
about themselves, which would be classed as 'anti-Semitic' for
someone to merely report in the West. The following extract
appeared in an article the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, discussing
the killing of 100 Lebanese civilians in April of the same
year:</p>
<p><i>"We killed them out of a certain naive hubris. Believing with
absolute certitude that now, with the White House, the Senate, and
much of the American media in our hands, the lives of others do not
count as much as our own ..."</i><br/>
<b><i>(Ari Shavat. Reproduced in the New York Times, May 27th,
1999)</i></b></p>
<p>Had the above been said by a Gentile, then the force of Jewry
and the ignorant Gentile 'politically correct' would undoubtedly
have been brought against its author.</p>
<p>The Judaic/Zionist onslaught seems almost impossible to oppose,
when all courageous efforts by men of integrity to inform the world
of the ancient conspiracy fall largely on deaf, and even offended,
ears. One can only imagine what kind of a better world we would
have today, had the masses rallied in support of those opposing the
<b>ancient</b> <b>conspiracy</b>, rather than condemning them, or
opposing them. Today, the Establishment is awash with Illuminati
agents who don't even need to be coerced, bribed and threatened
into conforming to the Illuminati agenda, like their predecessors
did in the earlier half of the Twentieth Century. The Jewish
Zionist leader, Chaim Weismann stated in 1920:</p>
<p><i>'We told the authorities in London; we shall be in Palestine
whether you want us there or not. You may speed up or slow down our
coming, but it would be better for you to help us, otherwise our
constructive force will turn into a destructive one that will bring
about ferment in the entire world.'</i><br/>
<b><i>(Judishe Rundschau, No. 4, 1920, Germany)</i></b><br/>
<i>...so stated the Jewish banker, Paul Warburg:</i></p>
<p><i>'We will have a world government whether you like it or not.
The only question is whether that government will be achieved by
conquest or consent.'</i><br/>
<b><i>(February 17, 1950, as he testified before the U.S.
Senate)</i></b></p>
<p>And what unified power exists that could bring entire nations to
their knees to surrender to the tyranny of that single power?
Surely none other than that ancient secret society which
interpenetrates the other societies, secret and open. A secret
society so intrinsic within non-Jewish culture that the inherent
culture does not even realise how Judaised it is. A cabal of
parasitic Satanists so self-assured that it has on numerous
occasions openly admitted its existence and paraded itself before
the goyim as if to both test the apathetic gullibility of the host
and to gloat at its own mastery of the art of deceit. And still the
masses of the Gentile nations and the majority of the Jewish people
ignore or even defend the dreadful imposition of the few
self-appointed 'god-like' Elders upon the world's population. One
such example of this Jewish 'swagger' is expressed in the words of
Jewish Philosopher, the <a href="http://jahtruth.net/rabbis.htm">Rabbi</a> Marcus Eli Ravage:</p>
<p><i>If you really are serious when you talk of Jewish plots, may
I not draw your attention to the one worth talking about? What use
is it wasting words on the alleged control of your public opinion
by Jewish financiers, newspaper owners and movie magnates, when you
might as well justly accuse us of the proved control of your whole
civilisation by the Jewish Gospels? (Beware: he is here trying to
cast doubt on The Bible for his master Satan and his Synagogue -
the Elders of Zion - who, in the Protocols, have vowed to destroy
religion and stop people from believing God - JAH.)</i><br/>
<i>You have not begun to appreciate the real depth of our guilt.
We are intruders. We are disturbers. We are subverters. We have
taken your natural world, your ideals, your destiny, and played
havoc with them. We have been at the bottom not merely of the last
great war but of nearly all your wars, not only of the Russian but
of every other major revolution in your history. We have brought
discord and confusion and frustration into your personal and public
life. We are still doing it. No one can tell how long we shall go
on doing it. ...And the end is still a long way off. We still
dominate you. At this very moment your churches are torn asunder by
a civil war between Fundamentalists and Modernists, that is to say
between those who cling to our teachings and those who are striving
by slow steps to dispossess us.</i><br/>
<b>(An article for <i>The Century Magazine</i>, Vol. 115, January
1928. No. 3)</b></p>
<p>On 12 January 1952, Rabbi Emanuel Rabinovich was asked to give a
keynote speech to the Emergency Council of European <a href="http://jahtruth.net/rabbis.htm">Rabbis</a> in Budapest, Hungary. The
implications of the following extract are chilling for all to read
(especially socialists, communists, 'radicals', politically-correct
pressure-groups of all types, and Jewish pressure-groups such as
the Anti-Defamation League) who would promote pro-Jewish policies
and who would refute that there is a policy to use race relations
to degrade society. Here is as blatant an admission as you are
going to get and further evidence that the Protocols are very real
and actively being updated to synchronise with current world events
and the social status as it develops. However, as can be seen from
the following, the Jewish Illuminati don't always get it their own
way:</p>
<p><i>"Greetings, my children! You have been called here to
recapitulate the principal steps of our new program. As you know,
we had hoped to have twenty years between the wars to consolidate
the great gains which we made from World War II, but our increasing
numbers in certain vital areas is arousing opposition to us, and we
must now work with every means at our disposal to precipitate
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/ww3-2.htm">World War III</a>.</i></p>
<p><i>"The goal for which we have striven so concertedly for three
thousand years is at last within our reach, and because its
fulfilment is so apparent, it behooves us to increase our efforts
and our caution tenfold. I can safely promise you that before ten
years have passed, our race will have its rightful place in the
world, with every Jew a king and every gentile a slave! (applause
from the gathering)</i></p>
<p><i>"You remember the success of our propaganda campaign during
the 1930's, which aroused anti-American passions in Germany, at the
same time we were arousing anti-German passions in America, a
campaign which culminated in the Second World War. A similar
propaganda campaign is now being waged intensively throughout the
world. A war fever is being worked up in Russia by an incessant
anti-American barrage, while a nationwide anti-Communist scare is
sweeping America. This campaign is forcing all of the smaller
nations to choose between the partnership of Russia or an alliance
with the <a href="http://jahtruth.net/amerca.htm">United
States</a>.</i></p>
<p><i>"Our most pressing problem at the moment is to inflame the
lagging militaristic spirit of the Americans. (The failure of the
Universal Military Training Act was a great setback to our plans,
but we are assured that a suitable measure will be rushed through
Congress immediately after the 1952 elections.) The Russian as well
as the Asiatic peoples, are well under control, and offer no
objections to war, but we must wait to secure the
Americans.</i></p>
<p><i>"This program will achieve its objective, the <a href="http://jahtruth.net/ww3-2.htm">Third World War</a>, which will surpass
in destruction all previous contests. Israel, of course, will
remain neutral, and when both sides are devastated and exhausted,
we will arbitrate, sending our Control Commissions into all of the
wrecked countries. This war will end for all time our struggle
against gentiles. We will openly reveal our identity with the races
of Asia and Africa. I can state with assurance that the last
generations of white children are being born. Our Control
Commissions will, in the interests of peace and wiping out
inter-racial tensions, forbid whites to mate with whites. The white
women must cohabit with members of the dark races, the white men
with black women. Thus the white race will disappear, for mixing
the dark with the white means the end of the white man, and our
most dangerous enemy, will become only a memory.</i></p>
<p><i>"We will embark on an era of ten thousand years of peace and
plenty, the Pax Judaica, and our race will rule undisputed over the
earth. Our superior intelligence will easily enable us to retain
mastery over a world of dark peoples.</i></p>
<p><i>"There will be no more religions. Not only would the
existence of a priest class remain a constant danger to our rule,
but belief in an afterlife would give spiritual strength to
irreconcilable elements in many countries. We will, however, retain
the rituals and the customs of Judaism as the mark of our
hereditary ruling caste, strengthened by our racial laws so that no
Jew will be allowed to marry outside our race, nor will any
stranger be accepted by us.</i></p>
<p><i>"We may have to repeat the grim days of World War II, when we
were forced to let the Hitlerite bands (Hitler was a Jew and so
were some of his generals) sacrifice some of our people, in order
that we may have adequate documentation and witnesses to legally
justify our trial and execution of the leaders of America and
Russia as war criminals, after we have dictated the peace. I am
sure you will need little preparation for such a duty, for
sacrifice has always been the watchword of our people, and the
death of a few thousand Jews in exchange for world leadership is
indeed a small price to pay.</i></p>
<p><i>"To convince you of the certainty of that leadership, let me
point out to you how we have turned all of the inventions of the
white man into weapons against him. His printing presses and radios
are the mouthpieces for our desires, and his heavy industry
manufactures the instruments which he sends out to arm Asia and
Africa against him. Our interests in Washington are greatly
extending the Point Four program for developing industry in
backward areas of the world so that after industrial plants and
cities of Europe and America are destroyed by atomic warfare, the
whites can offer no resistance against the larger masses of the
dark races, who will maintain an unchallenged technological
superiority.</i></p>
<p><i>"And so, with the vision of world victory before you, go back
to your countries and intensify your good work, until that
approaching day when Israel will reveal herself in all her glorious
destiny as the Light of the World!"</i><br/>
<b>(Quoted in Canadian Intelligence Service, Sept 1952 and in US
publication <i>Common Sense</i> 1952)</b></p>
<p>The writer Eustace Mullins reports in his book <i>The History of
the Jews</i>, that a double agent, who had infiltrated the inner
circle of the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith revealed
to him that the publication and circulation of Rabinovich's speech
had caused the Jews to postpone all of their plans for a
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/ww3-2.htm">Third World War</a>. The
translator from Yiddish of the quote, Henry H. Klein, was a Jew
who was horrified by the plans of his own people. He died in New
York the day after a meeting with a CIA man, and the CIA now
possess a copy of this document.</p>
<p>And here it is so interesting to compare the above admission
that the Jewish people are considered 'sacrifices' to a greater
cause of world takeover by their elite brethren. As well as a mass
of scientific and historical evidence that the Second World War was
simply a tool for the furthering of the New World Order agenda,
circumstantial evidence also exists for the planned sacrifice of 6
million people as part of the process. The Jew Ben Hecht, in his
book <i>Perfidy</i>, quotes Max Nordau at the World Zionist
Conference of 1911:</p>
<p><i>'The same righteous governments are preparing complete
annihilation for six million people.'</i></p>
<p>However, as true history has shown, the six million figure was
never reached in the so-called Holocaust except as a symbolic
number used to magnify the Jewish losses and gain support for
Zionism. Although, undoubtedly millions of Jews and non-Jews did
indeed suffer and were a bloody sacrifice to the god of the Elders
of Zion.</p>
<p><i>'There is scarcely an event in modern history that cannot be
traced to the Jews. We Jews today, are nothing else but the world's
seducers, its destroyer's, its incendiaries...Our last revolution
is not yet made.''</i><br/>
<b>(Jewish writer, Oscar Levy, <i>The World Significance of the
Russian Revolution</i>)</b></p>
<p>And so too say the <b><i>Protocols of the Learned Elders of
Zion</i></b>.</p>
<p>Time and time again, throughout history, Jews and Zionists have
repeated these same anti-Gentile views, all of which resonate in
perfect sympathy with this infamous document, so often condemned as
a fraud and anti-Semitic. Even if the Protocols had never existed,
there would be ample proof of the very conspiracy which they
document so graphically. How nonsensical are the cries of
'anti-Semitic!' and 'fraud!' in relation to the Protocols. How
could anyone who knows the true history of Judaism and the
background of this document (in the next section) decry their
authenticity? (Unless they are complicit in their crimes).</p>
<p>The enormous challenge we face, Gentiles and Jews alike, is
whether we will wake up to the truth in time to be effective
against the full implementation of the plot against mankind which
has provably been in existence for at least 2,600 years - before
'the last revolution is...made'.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="prorigin"></a><br/>
History of the Origin of the Protocols</p>
<p>In order to provide the most concise and detailed information on
the origin of the Protocols themselves I will quote here
extensively from the book '<i>Waters Flowing Eastward</i>' by L
Fry:</p>
<p>The protocols given to the world by Nilus are only the latest
known edition of the Jewish leaders' programme. The story of how
the latter came into general circulation is an interesting one.</p>
<p>In 1884 the daughter of a Russian general, Mlle. Justine Glinka,
was endeavouring to serve her country in Paris by obtaining
political information, which she communicated to General Orgevskii
<font size="-1">4</font> in St. Petersburg. For this purpose she
employed a Jew, Joseph Schorst,<font size="-1">5</font> member of
the Miz-raim Lodge in Paris. One day Schorst offered to obtain for
her a document of great importance to Russia, on payment of 2,500
francs. This sum being received from St. Petersburg was paid over
and the document handed to Mlle. Glinka.<font size="-1">6</font></p>
<p>She forwarded the French original, accompanied by a Russian
translation, to Orgevskii, who in turn handed it to his chief,
General Cherevin, for transmission to the Tsar. But Cherevin, under
obligation to wealthy Jews, refused to transmit it, merely filing
it in the archives.<font size="-1">7</font></p>
<p>Meantime there appeared in Paris certain books on Russian court
life <font size="-1">8</font> which displeased the Tsar, who
ordered his secret police to discover their authorship. This was
falsely attributed, perhaps with malicious intent,
<font size="-1">9</font> to Mlle. Glinka, and on her return
to Russia she was banished to her estate in Orel. To the
marechal de noblesse of this district, Alexis Sukhotin, Mlle.
Glinka gave a copy of the Protocols. Sukhotin showed the
document to two friends, Stepanov and Nilus; the former had
it printed and circulated privately in 1897; the second,
Professor Sergius A. Nilus, published it for the first time
in Tsarskoe-Tselo (Russia) in 1901, in a book entitled <i>The
Great Within the Small</i>. Then, about the same time, a
friend of Nilus, G. Butmi, also brought it out and a copy was
deposited in the British Museum on August 10, 1906.</p>
<p>Meantime, through Jewish members <font size="-1">10</font> of
the Russian police, minutes of the proceedings of the Basle
congress <font size="-1">ll</font> in 1897 had been obtained and
these were found to correspond with the Protocols.
<font size="-1">l2</font></p>
<p>In January 1917, Nilus had prepared a second edition, revised
and documented, for publication. But before it could be put on the
market, the revolution of March 1917 had taken place, and
Kerenskii, who had succeeded to power, ordered the whole edition of
Nilus's book to be destroyed. In 1924, Prof. Nilus was arrested by
the Cheka in Kiev, imprisoned, and tortured; he was told by the
Jewish president of the court, that this treatment was meted out to
him for "having done them incalculable harm in publishing the
Protocols". Released for a few months, he was again led before the
G. P. U. (Cheka), this time in Moscow and confined. Set at liberty
in February 1926, he died in exile in the district of Vladimir on
January 13, 1929.</p>
<p>A few copies of Nilus's second edition were saved and sent to
other countries where they were published : in Germany, by
Gottfreid zum Beek (1919); in England, by The Britons (1920); in
France, by Mgr. Jouin in La Revue Internationale des Societes
Secretes, and by Urbain Gohier in La Vieille France; in the United
States, by Small, Maynard &amp; Co. (Boston 1920), and by The
Beckwith Co (New York 1921). Later, editions appeared in Italian,
Russian, Arabic, and even in Japanese.</p>
<p>Such is the simple story of how these Protocols reached Russia
and thence came into general circulation.</p>
<p>Mr. Stepanov's deposition relative to it is here given as
corroboration.</p>
<p><i>" In 1895, my neighbour in the district of Toula, Major
(retired) Alexis Sukhotin, gave me a manuscript copy of the
Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion. He told me that a lady of his
acquaintance, whose name he did not mention, residing in Paris, had
found it at the house of a friend, a Jew. Before leaving Paris, she
had secretly translated it and had brought this one copy to Russia
and given it to Sukhotin.</i><br/>
<i>"At first I mimeographed this translation, but finding it
difficult to read, I resolved to have it printed, making no mention
of the date, town, or printer's name. In this I was helped by
Arcadii Ippolitovich Kelepovskii, who at that time was chief of the
household of Grand Duke Sergius.</i><br/>
<i>He gave the document to be printed by the district printing
press. This took place in 1897. Sergius Nilus inserted these
Protocols in his work and added his own commentary.</i></p>
<p><i>Signed PHILIP PETROVICH STEPANOV."</i></p>

Privy Councillor, and (in 1897) Chief of the Moscow Kursk Railway

&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="prgenuine"></a><br/>
Fraud or Genuine?</p>
<p>The fact remains that there is no documentary proof that the
Protocols of the Elders of Zion are what they say they are.
Allegations of forgery and fraud have dogged their public history.
However, despite many opinions to the contrary, the documents have
never been proved to be fraudulent.</p>
<p>I have provided here some tiny amount of the vast amount of
circumstantial evidence which indicates that the Protocols are
simply one of many documents to betray an agenda of world
domination which remains unchanged, stretching back through time to
its first incarnation as the Book of Deuteronomy - the Second Law
as given to Moses by Yahweh. The fact that the Protocols are
demonstrably the agenda to which the world's politicians have
orchestrated public and secretive manoeuvres to bring the world to
the brink of a New World Order under a One World Government, is
almost impossible to refute.</p>
<p>That such a proven agenda could have arisen in the 19th century,
contemporary with the unfolding political events therein - the
Bolshevik Revolution, two World Wars and Zionism - is possible, but
extremely unlikely. Because it also fits very well many of the
events which unfolded in the previous centuries too. In fact, the
very centuries considered - stretching all the way back to the 7th
Century BC, where I have shown, a remarkably similar document was
written by the Levitical priests who ruled the people of Jerusalem.
And no conspiratorial document of its type has ever been found to
pre-date this period.</p>
<p>As we have seen, to declare the Protocols a 'Catholic'
conspiracy blamed upon Jews would be tantamount to calling
Deuteronomy one too, and many other biblical books which predate
the formation of the Roman Church by many centuries. Nevertheless,
there is ample proof to show that the <a href="http://jahtruth.net/darth.htm">Catholic Church</a> has played an
enormously useful role in the implementation of the ancient
conspiracy by acting as a carrier for Judaic ideas, and as a
vehicle for infiltration by Marranos, Jewish popes and Illumined
Freemasons (such as the P2 lodge).</p>
<p>It is my belief that the Protocols are what they say they are.
However, to believe that this conspiracy against mankind is purely
orchestrated and executed by Jews would be nonsensical. Even the
most cursory glance through the pages of history proves the fact
that Gentiles of all denominations have played major roles in the
implementation of this plan - never more so than under the banner
of <a href="http://jahtruth.net/darth.htm">'Christianity'</a> -
knowingly or unknowingly; whilst the majority of the world's Jews
have had no knowledge of, or have given no support to, the plan to
which they have signed their name by declaring themselves to be
'Jewish'. In fact, the largest opposition to Zionism in the
formative years of this century came from Western Jews and native
Palestinian Jews. However, since the Second World War and the
Holocaust, it has even become somewhat of a faux pas and considered
anti-Semitic for even Jews to declare opposition to Zionism and
Talmudic extremism.</p>
<p>This is a great testament to the truth that history is written
by the winners. And the winners always use history to programme the
next generation to accept their own agenda unquestioningly. As the
following Protocols will so ably demonstrate.</p>
<p>The Publisher's (Flanders Hall Publishing Company, New Orleans)
Foreword to the revised edition of '<i>Waters Flowing Eastward</i>'
mentions the following:</p>
<p><i>Several arguments against the authenticity of the Protocols
are examined in the book. It may be well to mention here a
completely new argument, for their authenticity. In 1937, a Russian
ex-officer of the Czarist Intelligence Service asked to see a
friend of ours. The Russian ex-officer was accompanied, on the
occasion of the meeting, by a man well and favourably known to our
friend. The ex-officer informed our friend and his wife that, in
1897, he had been called from Washington, where he was working for
the Czarist government, and sent to Basle, Switzerland, where the
first Zionist Congress was being held that year. He was given a
small detachment of picked secret service men. While the Jews were
in secret conclave, his men staged a sham fire and dashed into the
room shouting Fire! Fire! In the ensuing confusion he made his way
quickly to the President's or Lecturer's table and took possession
of all the papers that were on it. These papers contained the
originals of the Protocols.</i></p>
<p><i>This Russian officer escaped out of <a href="http://jahtruth.net/horse.htm">Russia in 1917</a> and lived mostly in
Paris. He was an old man in 1937. Needless to say our friend's
veracity and reliability are unquestioned.</i></p>
<p>Critics of the Protocols' genuineness have claimed that they
were a forgery, derived from earlier documents and used as
propaganda against the Jews by their opponents. As I hope I have
shown here, the documents most certainly do derive from an earlier
common source, but that does not make them forgeries, any more than
latest encyclopaedia can be condemned as a deliberate forgery
because previous works of an almost identical nature already
exist.</p>
<p>This argument also falls down on another point, which actually
operates in favour of the theory of the Jewish origin, rather than
against it. It has often been argued that the Protocols bear
remarkable likeness to a book called '<i>Dialogues aux Enfers entre
Machiavelli et Montesquieu</i>' (also known as the '<i>Geneva
Dialogues</i>'), published anonymously in Brussels in 1865.
However, the passages quoted as being plagiarised from the
<i>Geneva Dialogues</i> for the Protocols are remarkably similar to
those in a book published in 1850, called, similarly,
'<i>Machiavelli, Montesquieu and Rousseau</i>' by Jacob Venedy. And
Venedy was a Jew and a Freemason! He was a revolutionary and also a
close associate of the <a href="http://jahtruth.net/horse.htm">Jew Karl
Marx</a> (real name Mordecai,) and Maurice Joly, the true author of
the Geneva Dialogues! 'Marx's father Heinrich, whose original name
was Hirschel ha-Levi, was the son of a rabbi and the descendant of
talmudic scholars for many generations.' (<i>Encyclopaedia
Judaica</i>, 1997). Marx's Communist Manifesto is clearly
Illuminist, and very much in parallel with the Protocols.</p>
<p>One can't have one's cake and eat it on this line of enquiry, I
am afraid. All roads lead to Zion!</p>
<p><i>"...there is much in the fact of Bolshevism itself. In the
fact that so many Jews are Bolsheviks. In the fact that the ideals
of Bolshevism are consonant with the finest ideals of
Judaism."</i><br/>
<b>(The Jewish Chronicle, April 4, 1918)</b></p>
<p><i>'Some call it Marxism I call it Judaism.'</i><br/>
<b>(The American Bulletin, Rabbi S. Wise, May 5, 1935)</b></p>
<p>The Protocols were initially published in the Russian newspaper
<i>Snamia</i> in 1903 and are believed to have been also published
in 1902/1903 in the newspaper <i>Moskowskija Wiedomosti</i>.
Despite a copy of the book written by Professor Sergyei Nilus (an
official at the Department of Foreign Relations at Moscow) being
registered in the British Museum on August 10th, 1906, they were
otherwise unknown outside of Russia until after the Bolshevik
Revolution when Russian emigrants took copies to North America and
Germany. In Bolshevik Russia, they carried the death sentence for
anyone found to be in possession of them. (As far as I am aware,
the entire document deposited in the British Museum has never been
fully translated into English).</p>
<p>The Protocols gained widespread recognition upon their
translation into English, in 1920. They soon became notorious.
Esteemed newspapers such as <i>The Times</i> and <i>The Morning
Post</i> (whose Moscow correspondent Victor E Marsden was
responsible in 1921 for the translation used in this document)
covered the story in numerous articles, much to the chagrin of
world Jewry, who immediately began the propaganda bandwagon
rolling. They not only denied that the Protocols were a Jewish
plot, but also that there was any plot whatsoever. The latter was
quite clearly false to all educated men and women of the time.</p>
<p><i>'Probably so much money and energy were never before in
history expended on the effort to suppress a single document.' The
period of 1920 'marks the end of the time when the Jewish question
could be impartially openly discussed in public.'</i><br/>
<b>(Reed - '<i>The Controversy of Zion</i> ')</b></p>
<p>The Press was firmly under the thumb of the vested interests.
Those that went against the grain and published information on the
Protocols were soon brought into line or brought down by financial
and political pressure. As an example, in 1920, Lord Northcliffe,
the owner of several newspapers, as well as being joint proprietor
of <i>The Times</i>, caused to be published in <i>The Times</i> an
article called '<i>The Jewish Peril, a Disturbing Pamphlet, Call
for Enquiry</i>'. This article on the Protocols called for a proper
investigation into the documents. In February 1922, he set about a
fervently anti-Zionist mission, a series of articles about what was
really going on in Palestine. On August 14, 1922 Northcliffe died
of ulcerative endocarditis. He had been confronted on a train to
Evian-les-Bains in June by the editor of <i>The Times</i>, Mr
Wickham Steed, with a doctor who had certified Northcliffe
'insane'. On the strength of this he was barred from entering the
offices of <i>The Times</i> by a police guard, and his
communications were ordered to be ignored by the staff. All of this
despite showing no outward signs of madness to those who later
commented on his appearance or state of mind. However, he had
stated that he believed his life was in danger and that he was
being poisoned. This whole story was suppressed until the
publication of '<i>The Official History of the Times</i>', thirty
years later in 1952!</p>
<p>Thus, one man who had enough power and will to challenge the
Protocols and Zionism on an international stage to an audience of
millions, who was committed to illuminating the world as to the
true agenda, had been removed.</p>
<p>The often cited 'fact' that the Protocols are a 'proven fraud',
is easily dismissed, as it is actually entirely untrue and based
upon a very specific court case. Numerous unsuccessful attempts had
been made by world Jewry to have the Protocols denounced as a
forgery. But it was not until 1933 that any legal action was taken
in this respect:</p>
<p><i>On 26th June, 1933, the Federation of Jewish Communities of
Switzerland and the Berne Jewish Community brought an action
against five members of the Swiss National Front, seeking a
judgment that the Protocols were a forgery and a prohibition of
their publication. The procedure of the Court was astounding, the
provisions of the Swiss Civil Code being deliberately set aside.
Sixteen witnesses called by the plaintiffs were heard, but only one
of the forty witnesses called by the defendants was allowed a
hearing. The judge allowed the plaintiffs to appoint two private
stenographers to keep the register of proceedings during the
hearing of their witnesses, instead of entrusting the task to a
Court official.</i></p>
<p><i>In view of these and similar irregularities, it was not
surprising that, after the case had lasted just on two years, the
Court pronounced the Protocols to be a forgery and demoralising
literature. The decision was given on 14th May, 1935, but it was
announced in the Jewish Press before it was delivered by the
Court?</i></p>
<p><i>On 1st November, 1937, the Swiss Court of Criminal Appeal
quashed this judgment in its entirety. Jewish propagandists,
however, still declare that the Protocols have been "proved" to be
a forgery.</i></p>
<p><i>It was natural that the Jews should try to discredit the
Protocols, for their growing fame was focussing more public
attention on other revealing utterances.</i><br/>
<b>(<i>Waters Flowing Eastward</i> - revised and updated by Rev.
Denis Fahey)</b></p>
<p>The second trial found in favour of the Jewish lobby and fined
the defendants 100 francs costs. But this had nothing to do with
the Protocols. It was due to another article which was included in
the prosecution, entitled Schweizerm&auml;dchen h&uuml;te dich vor
sch&auml;ndenen Juden (Swiss Girls Beware of Dishonourable Jews).
The court had stated that this was 'Jew-baiting' and an 'attempt to
defame the Jews as a body'. The Jewish lobby, who had written in
their journals that the Protocols were a proven forgery later were
forced to change their stance to that their authenticity had not
been furnished. But a popular myth survives of the former
stance.</p>
<p><b>The fact remains, that the Protocols are NOT a proven
forgery.</b></p>
<p>The fact also remains that since their publication, world events
have unfolded exactly according to their description. We are
gradually being mobilised into a New World Order. The One World
Government is being facilitated by the gradual movement of nation
states into larger power blocks such as the European Union and
NAFTA etc. The United Nations has come into power as a global
police force under the excuse of being a protector and benefactor
of the world, exactly as outlined in the Protocols. The Jews have
symbolically 'returned to Palestine', as the State of Israel now
exists as the official universal 'homeland' of all Jews, despite
the vast majority of Jews having no racial connection with Israel
whatsoever.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that the Protocols are a fraud and that there
is no conspiracy. But I believe that the information here
presented, which is but the tiny tip of an enormous iceberg,
constitutes ample evidence of an ancient conspiracy orchestrated by
<a href="/node/view/255">a self-appointed elite</a>, who are at least
intimately associated with the core elect of international Judaism
and have been for a very long time.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="prnote"></a><br/>
Important Note</p>
<p>The very fact that such a conspiracy involving a small core
elect from Zionist Judaism exists does <b>not</b> implicate the
mass of the Jewish people in the conspiracy. Nor does it blame only
those of Jewish persuasion for being complicit. The mass of Jewish
people have no desire to see the New World Order instituted, nor do
the majority even know of the existence of the conspiracy. Jewish
people per se should not be judged according to their religious
beliefs or racial descent as being a part of the conspiracy, as
most Jews follow a far more tolerant version of Judaism which has
reformed many of the extreme elements of their historic creed.
Furthermore, many Jewish people have been sacrificed to the cause
outlined in the Protocols through the misguided belief of the
elders that the 'end justifies the means', and all who fall for the
cause are greatly exalted in the eyes of Yahweh.</p>
<p>The above information is provided so that Jews and Gentiles
alike can become more aware of what a small percentage of
self-appointed elite members of the Jewish religion believe and
adhere to as their Holy Law.</p>
<p>Comments in the following text related specifically to 'the
Jews' which superficially seem to implicate all Jews do <b>not</b>
reflect my own attitude to this issue as I have already
established. However, these were the words of those individuals
quoted and of the publishers who presented the following document
many decades ago, and I hesitate to censor them.</p>
<p><b>This document is meant to challenge hatred; racism and
deceit; NOT ferment it.</b><br/>

<b>Editorial Note</b>
<p>Comments in the following text related specifically to 'the
Jews' which superficially seem to implicate all Jews do not reflect
my own attitude to this issue as I have already established.
However, these were the words of those individuals quoted and of
the publishers who presented the following document many decades
ago, and I hesitate to censor them.</p>
<p>This document is meant to challenge hatred, racism and deceit,
<b>NOT</b> ferment it.</p>
<p>In the following presentation I have combined two methods of
printing the Protocols for ease of use. I have maintained the
headings and kept the introductory commentaries as provided by the
Marsden translation of Nilus's document. I have also used the
method (as employed by Bible translators) of numbering the
paragraphs for ease of further referencing.</p>

PREFACE
The author of this translation of the famous Protocols was himself
a victim of the Revolution. He had lived for many years in Russia
and was married to a Russian lady. Among his other activities in
Russia he had been for a number of years a Russian Correspondent of
the MORNING POST, a position which he occupied when the Revolution
broke out, and his vivid descriptions of events in Russia will
still be in the recollection of many of the readers of that
Journal. Naturally he was singled out for the anger of the Soviet.
On the day that Captain Cromie was murdered by Jews, Victor Marsden
was arrested and thrown into the Peter-Paul Prison, expecting every
day to have his name called out for execution. This, however, he
escaped, and eventually he was allowed to return to England very
much of a wreck in bodily health. However, he recovered under
treatment and the devoted care of his wife and friends. One of the
first things he undertook, as soon as he was able, was this
translation of the Protocols. Mr. Marsden was eminently well
qualified for the work. His intimate acquaintance with Russia,
Russian life and the Russian language on the one hand, and his
mastery of a terse literary English style on the other, placed him
in a position of advantage which few others could claim. The
consequence is that we have in his version an eminently readable
work, and though the subject-matter is somewhat formless, Mr.
Marsden's literary touch reveals the thread running through the
twenty-four Protocols.
<p>It may be said with truth that this work was carried out at the
cost of Mr. Marsden's own life's blood. He told the writer of this
Preface that he could not stand more than an hour at a time of his
work on it in the British Museum, as the diabolical spirit of the
matter which he was obliged to turn into English made him
positively ill.</p>
<p>Mr. Marsden's connection with the MORNING POST was not severed
by his return to England, and he was well enough to accept the post
of special correspondent of that journal in the suite of H.R.H.,
the Prince of Wales on his Empire tour. From this he returned with
the Prince, apparently in much better health, but within a few days
of his landing he was taken suddenly ill, and died after a very
brief illness.</p>
<p>May this work be his crowning monument! In it he has performed
an immense service to the English-speaking world, and there can be
little doubt that it will take its place in the first rank of the
English versions of "THE PROTOCOLS of the Meetings of the LEARNED
ELDERS OF ZION."</p>
<p><a name="introduction"></a></p>
INTRODUCTION
Of the Protocols themselves little need be said in the way of
introduction. The book in which they are embodied was published by
Sergyei Nilus in Russia in 1905. A copy of this is in the British
Museum bearing the date of its reception, August 10, 1906. All
copies that were known to exist in Russia were destroyed in the
Kerensky regime, and under his successors the possession of a copy
by anyone in Soviet land was a crime sufficient to ensure the
owner's of being shot on sight. The fact is in itself sufficient
proof of the genuineness of the Protocols. The Jewish journals, of
course, say that they are a forgery, leaving it to be understood
that Professor Nilus, who embodied them in a work of his own, had
concocted them for his own purposes.
<p>Mr. Henry Ford, in an interview published in the New York WORLD,
February 17th, 1921, put the case for Nilus tersely and
convincingly thus:</p>
<b><i>"The only statement I care to make about the
Protocols is that they fit in with what is going on. They are
sixteen years old, and they have fitted the world situation up to
this time. THEY FIT IT NOW."</i></b>
Indeed they do!
<p>The word "Protocol" signifies a pr&eacute;cis gummed on to the
front of a document, a draft of a document, minutes of proceedings.
In this instance, "Protocol" means minutes of the proceedings of
the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion. These Protocols give
the substance of addresses delivered to the innermost circle of the
Rulers of Zion. They reveal the converted plan of action of the
Jewish Nation developed through the ages and edited by the Elders
themselves up to date. Parts and summaries of the plan have been
published from time to time during the centuries as the secrets of
the Elders have leaked out. The claim of the Jews that the
Protocols are forgeries is in itself an admission of their
genuineness, for they NEVER ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THE FACTS
corresponding to the THREATS which the Protocols contain, and,
indeed, the correspondence between prophecy and fulfilment is too
glaring to be set aside or obscured. This the Jews well know and
therefore evade.</p>
<p>The presumption is strong that the Protocols were issued, or
reissued, at the First Zionist Congress held at Basle in 1897 under
the presidency of the Father of Modern Zionism, the late Theodore
Herzl.</p>
<p>There has been recently published a volume of Herzl's "Diaries,"
a translation of some passages which appeared in the JEWISH
CHRONICLE of July 14, 1922. Herzl gives an account of his first
visit to England in 1895, and his conversation with Colonel
Goldsmid, a Jew brought up as a Christian, an officer in the
English Army, and at heart a Jew Nationalist all the time. Goldsmid
suggested to Herzl that the best way of expropriating the English
aristocracy, and so destroying their power to protect the people of
England against Jew domination, was to put excessive taxes on the
land. Herzl thought this an excellent idea, and it is now to be
found definitely embodied in Protocol VI!</p>
<p>The above extract from Herzl's diary is an extremely significant
bit of evidence bearing on the existence of the Jew World Plot and
authenticity of the Protocols, but any reader of intelligence will
be able; from his own knowledge of recent history and from his own
experience; to confirm the genuineness of every line of them, and
it is in the light of this living comment that all readers are
invited to study Mr. Marsden's translation of this terribly inhuman
document.</p>
<p>And here is another very significant circumstance. The present
successor of Herzl, as leader of the Zionist movement, Dr.
Weizmann, quoted one of these sayings at the send-off banquet given
to Chief Rabbi Hertz on October 6, 1920. The Chief Rabbi was on the
point of leaving for HIS Empire tour with H.R.H., the Prince of
Wales. And this is the "saying" of the Sages which Dr. Weizmann
quoted: "A beneficent protection which God has instituted in the
life of the Jew is that He has dispersed him all over the world."
(JEWISH GUARDIAN, Oct. 8, 1920.)</p>
<p>Now compare this with the last clause of but one of Protocol
XI.</p>
<b><i>"God has granted to us, His Chosen People, the
gift of dispersion, and from this, which appears to all eyes to be
our weakness, has come forth all our strength, which has now
brought us to the threshold of sovereignty over all the
world."</i></b>
The remarkable correspondence between these passages proves several
things. It proves that the Learned Elders exist. It proves that Dr.
Weizmann knows all about them. It proves that the desire for a
"National Home" in Palestine is only camouflage and an
infinitesimal part of the Jew's real object. It proves that the
Jews of the world have no intention of settling in Palestine or any
separate country, and that their annual prayer that they may all
meet "Next Year in Jerusalem" is merely a piece of their
characteristic make-believe. It also demonstrates that the Jews are
now a world menace, and that the Aryan races will have to domicile
them permanently out of Europe.
<p><a name="who"></a></p>
WHO ARE THE ELDERS?
This is a secret which has not been revealed. They are the Hidden
Hand. They are not the "Board of Deputies" (the Jewish Parliament
in England) or the "Universal Israelite Alliance" which sits in
Paris. But the late Walter Rathenau of the Allgemeiner
Electricitaets Gesellschaft has thrown a little light on the
subject and doubtless he was in possession of their names, being,
in all likelihood, one of the chief leaders himself. Writing in the
WIENER FREIE PRESSE, December 24, 1912, he said:
<b><i>"<a href="/node/view/255">Three hundred men</a>, each of
whom knows all the others, govern the fate of the European
continent, and they elect their successors from their
entourage."</i></b>
In the year 1844, on the eve of the Jewish Revolution of 1848,
Benjamin Disraeli, whose real name was Israel, and who was a
"damped," or baptised Jew, published his novel, 'Coningsby', in
which occurs this ominous passage:
<b><i>"The world is governed by very different
personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the
scenes."</i></b>
And he went on to show that these personages were all Jews.
<p>Now that Providence has brought to the light of day these secret
Protocols all men may clearly see the hidden personages specified
by Disraeli at work "behind the scenes" of all the Governments.
This revelation entails on all white peoples the grave
responsibility of examining and revising au fond their attitude
towards the Race and Nation which boasts of its survival over all
Empires.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<b>I &#8211; "Agentur" and "The Political."</b>
<p>There are two words in this translation which are unusual, the
word "agentur" and "political" used as a substantive, agentur
appears to be a word adopted from the original and it means the
whole body of agents and agencies made use of by the Elders,
whether members of the tribe or their Gentile tools.<br/>
By "the Political" Mr. Marsden means, not exactly the "body
politic" but the entire machinery of politics.</p>
<p><b>II &#8211; The Symbolic Snake of Judaism.</b></p>
<p>Protocol 3 opens with a reference to the Symbolic Snake of
Judaism. In his Epilogue to the 1905 Edition of the Protocols,
Nilus gives the following interesting account of this symbol:</p>
"According to the records of secret Jewish Zionism,
Solomon and other Jewish learned men already, in 929 B.C., thought
out a scheme in theory for a peaceful conquest of the whole
universe by Zion. As history developed, this scheme was worked out
in detail and completed by men who were subsequently initiated in
this question. These learned men decided by peaceful means to
conquer the world for Zion with the slyness of the Symbolic Snake*,
whose head was to represent those who have been initiated into the
plans of the Jewish administration, and the body of the Snake to
represent the Jewish people &#8211; the administration was always
kept secret, EVEN FROM THE JEWISH NATION ITSELF. As this Snake
penetrated into the hearts of the nations which it encountered it
undermined and devoured all the non-Jewish power of these States.
It is foretold that the Snake has still to finish its work,
strictly adhering to the designed plan*, until the course which it
has to run is closed by the return of its head to Zion and until,
by this means, the Snake has completed its round of Europe and has
encircled it &#8211; and until, by dint of enchaining Europe, it
has encompassed the whole world. This it is to accomplish by using
every endeavour to subdue the other countries by an ECONOMICAL
CONQUEST. The return of the head of the Snake* to Zion can only be
accomplished after the power of all the Sovereign of Europe has
been laid low, that is to say, when by means of economic crises and
wholesale destruction effected everywhere, there shall have been
brought about a spiritual demoralisation and a moral corruption,
chiefly with the assistance of Jewish women masquerading as French;
Italians; etc.. These are the surest spreaders of licentiousness
into the lives of the leading men at the heads of nations. A map of
the course of the Symbolic Snake is shown as follows: &#8211; Its
first stage in Europe was in 429 B.C. in Greece, where, about the
time of Pericles, the Snake first started eating into the power of
that country. The second stage was in Rome in the time of Augustus,
about 69 B.C.. The third in Madrid in the time of Charles V, in
A.D. 1552. The fourth in Paris about 1790, in the time of Louis
XVI. The fifth in London from 1814 onwards (after the downfall of
Napoleon). The sixth in Berlin in 1871 after the Franco-Prussian
war. The seventh in St. Petersburg, over which is drawn the head of
the Snake under the date of 1881. [This "Snake"* is now being drawn
through the Americas and in the United States of America, it is
been partially identified as the "<a href="/index.php?q=node/view/48#main">Counsel on
Foreign Relations</a>" (C.F.R.) and the "Tri-Lateral Commission"].
All these States which the Snake traversed have had the foundations
of their constitutions shaken, Germany, with its apparent power,
forming no exception to the rule. In economic conditions, England
and Germany are spared, but only till the conquest of Russia is
accomplished by the Snake, on which at present [i.e., 1905] all its
efforts are concentrated. The further course of the Snake is not
shown on this map, but arrows indicate its next movement towards
Moscow, Kiev and Odessa. It is now well known to us to what extent
the latter cities form the centuries of the militant Jewish race.
Constantinople is shown as the last stage of the Snake's course
before it reaches Jerusalem. (This map was drawn years before the
occurrence of the "Young Turk" &#8211; i.e., Jewish &#8211;
Revolution in Turkey).

life:</i> <br/>
<i>3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the <a href="http://jahtruth.net/horse.htm">woman</a>**, and between thy seed and
her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his
heel.</i>
<p><i>** <b>Revelation</b> 12:1 And there appeared a great wonder
in heaven; a woman (Israel) clothed with the "sun", and the "moon"
under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars (the
Crown of Israel - one star per tribe):</i><br/>
<i>12:2 And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and
pained to be delivered (John 16:21).</i><br/>
<i>12:3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a
great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven
crowns upon his heads.</i><br/>
<i>12:4 And his tale (of lies - John 8:35) drew the third part of
the "Stars" (ch. 9:1) of heaven (into his army), and did (cause
them to be) cast to the Earth (for their treason against God): and
the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered,
for to devour her child as soon as it was born (Christ - second
coming).</i><br/>
<i>12:5 And she brought forth a Man child, who was to rule all
nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God,
and [to] His Throne.</i><br/>
<i>12:6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a
place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand
two hundred [and] threescore "days".</i><br/>
<i>12:13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast onto the earth,
he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man
[child].</i><br/>
<i>12:14 And to the woman (Israel) were given two wings of a great
eagle (Ex. 19:4), that she might fly into the wilderness (Britain),
into her place, where she is nourished for a Time, and Times (2),
and half a Time (1260 "days") (Dan. 12:7), from the face of the
serpent.</i><br/>

as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried
away (destroyed) by the flood.</i><br/>
<i>12:16 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her
mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his
mouth.</i><br/>
<i>12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make
war with the remnant of her seed, which KEEP the Commandments of
God, and have the Testimony of Christ Jesus (the Bible).</i></p>

PROTOCOL 1
<h3>THE BASIC DOCTRINE</h3>
<i>Right lies in Might &#8211; Politics versus Morals
&#8211; The End justifies the Means &#8211; "Liberty, Equality,
Fraternity" &#8211; The New Aristocracy.</i>
<p>1. Putting aside fine phrases we shall speak of the significance
of each thought: by comparisons and deductions we shall throw light
upon surrounding facts.</p>
<p>2. What I am about to set forth, then, is our system from the
two points of view, that of ourselves and that of the goyim [i.e.,
non- Jews].</p>
<p>3. It must be noted that men with bad instincts are more in
number than the good, and therefore the best results in governing
them are attained by violence and terrorisation, and not by
academic discussions. Every man aims at power, everyone would like
to become a dictator if only he could, and rare indeed are the men
who would not be willing to sacrifice the welfare of all for the
sake of securing their own welfare.</p>
<p>4. What has restrained the beasts of prey who are called men?
What has served for their guidance hitherto?</p>
<p>5. In the beginnings of the structure of society, they were
subjected to brutal and blind force; after words &#8211; to Law,
which is the same force, only disguised. I draw the conclusion that
by the law of nature right lies in force.</p>
<p>6. Political freedom is an idea but not a fact. This idea one
must know how to apply whenever it appears necessary with this bait
of an idea to attract the masses of the people to one's party for
the purpose of crushing another who is in authority. This task is
rendered easier if the opponent has himself been infected with the
idea of freedom, so-called liberalism, and, for the sake of an
idea, is willing to yield some of his power. It is precisely here
that the triumph of our theory appears; the slackened reins of
government are immediately, by the law of life, caught up and
gathered together by a new hand, because the blind might of the
nation cannot for one single day exist without guidance, and the
new authority merely fits into the place of the old already
weakened by liberalism.</p>
<p>7. In our day the power which has replaced that of the rulers
who were liberal is the power of Gold. Time was when Faith ruled.
The idea of freedom is impossible of realisation because no one
knows how to use it with moderation. It is enough to hand over a
people to self-government for a certain length of time for that
people to be turned into a disorganised mob. From that moment on we
get internecine strife which soon develops into battles between
classes, in the midst of which States burn down and their
importance is reduced to that of a heap of ashes.</p>
<p>8. Whether a State exhausts itself in its own convulsions,
whether its internal discord brings it under the power of external
foes &#8211; in any case it can be accounted irretrievably lost: it
is in our power. The despotism of Capital, which is entirely in our
hands, reaches out to it a straw that the State, willy-nilly, must
take hold of: if not &#8211; it goes to the bottom.</p>
<p>9. Should anyone of a liberal mind say that such reflections as
the above are immoral, I would put the following questions: If
every State has two foes and if in regard to the external foe it is
allowed and not considered immoral to use every manner and art of
conflict, as for example to keep the enemy in ignorance of plans of
attack and defence, to attack him by night or in superior numbers,
then in what way can the same means in regard to a worse foe, the
destroyer of the structure of society and the commonweal, be called
immoral and not permissible?</p>
<p>10. Is it possible for any sound logical mind to hope with any
success to guide crowds by the aid of reasonable counsels and
arguments, when any objection or contradiction, senseless though it
may be, can be made and when such objection may find more favour
with the people, whose powers of reasoning are superficial? Men in
masses and the men of the masses, being guided solely by petty
passions, paltry beliefs, traditions and sentimental theorems, fall
a prey to party dissension, which hinders any kind of agreement
even on the basis of a perfectly reasonable argument. Every
resolution of a crowd depends upon a chance or packed majority,
which, in its ignorance of political secrets, puts forth some
ridiculous resolution that lays in the administration a seed of
anarchy.</p>
<p>11. The political has nothing in common with the moral. The
ruler who is governed by the moral is not a skilled politician, and
is therefore unstable on his throne. He who wishes to rule must
have recourse both to cunning and to make-believe. Great national
qualities, like frankness and honesty, are vices in politics, for
they bring down rulers from their thrones more effectively and more
certainly than the most powerful enemy. Such qualities must be the
attributes of the kingdoms of the goyim, but we must in no wise be
guided by them.</p>
<p>12. Our right lies in force. The word "right" is an abstract
thought and proved by nothing. The word means no more than: Give me
what I want in order that thereby I may have a proof that I am
stronger than you.</p>
<p>13. Where does right begin? Where does it end?</p>
<p>14. In any State in which there is a bad organisation of
authority, an impersonality of laws and of the rulers who have lost
their personality amid the flood of rights ever multiplying out of
liberalism, I find a new right &#8211; to attack by the right of
the strong, and to scatter to the winds all existing forces of
order and regulation, to reconstruct all institutions and to become
the sovereign lord of those who have left to us the rights of their
power by laying them down voluntarily in their liberalism.</p>
<p>15. Our power in the present tottering condition of all forms of
power will be more invincible than any other, because it will
remain invisible until the moment when it has gained such strength
that no cunning can any longer undermine it.</p>
<p>16. Out of the temporary evil we are now compelled to commit
will emerge the good of an unshakeable rule, which will restore the
regular course of the machinery of the national life, brought to
naught by liberalism. The result justifies the means. Let us,
however, in our plans, direct our attention not so much to what is
good and moral as to what is necessary and useful.</p>
<p>17. Before us is a plan in which is laid down strategically the
line from which we cannot deviate without running the risk of
seeing the labour of many centuries brought to naught.</p>
<p>18. In order to elaborate satisfactory forms of action it is
necessary to have regard to the rascality, the slackness, the
instability of the mob, its lack of capacity to understand and
respect the conditions of its own life, or its own welfare. It must
be understood that the might of a mob is blind, senseless and
un-reasoning force ever at the mercy of a suggestion from any side.
The blind cannot lead the blind without bringing them into the
abyss; consequently, members of the mob, upstarts from the people
even though they should be as a genius for wisdom, yet having no
understanding of the political, cannot come forward as leaders of
the mob without bringing the whole nation to ruin.</p>
<p>19. Only one trained from childhood for independent rule can
have understanding of the words that can be made up of the
political alphabet.</p>
<p>20. A people left to itself, i.e., to upstarts from its midst,
brings itself to ruin by party dissensions excited by the pursuit
of power and honours and the disorders arising therefrom. Is it
possible for the masses of the people calmly and without petty
jealousies to form judgement, to deal with the affairs of the
country, which cannot be mixed up with personal interest? Can they
defend themselves from an external foe? It is unthinkable; for a
plan broken up into as many parts as there are heads in the mob,
loses all homogeneity, and thereby becomes unintelligible and
impossible of execution.</p>
<p>21. It is only with a despotic ruler that plans can be
elaborated extensively and clearly in such a way as to distribute
the whole properly among the several parts of the machinery of the
State: from this the conclusion is inevitable that a satisfactory
form of government for any country is one that concentrates in the
hands of one responsible person. Without an absolute despotism
there can be no existence for civilisation which is carried on not
by the masses but by their guide, whosoever that person may be. The
mob is savage, and displays its savagery at every opportunity. The
moment the mob seizes freedom in its hands it quickly turns to
anarchy, which in itself is the highest degree of savagery.</p>
<p>22. Behold the alcoholic animals, bemused with drink, the right
to an immoderate use of which comes along with freedom. It is not
for us and ours to walk that road. The peoples of the goyim are
bemused with alcoholic liquors; their youth has grown stupid on
classicism and from early immorality, into which it has been
inducted by our special agents &#8211; by tutors, lackeys,
governesses in the houses of the wealthy, by clerks and others, by
our women in the places of dissipation frequented by the goyim. In
the number of these last I count also the so-called "society
ladies," voluntary followers of the others in corruption and
luxury.</p>
<p>23. Our countersign is &#8211; Force and Make-believe. Only
force conquers in political affairs, especially if it be concealed
in the talents essential to statesmen. Violence must be the
principle, and cunning and make-believe the rule for governments
which do not want to lay down their crowns at the feet of agents of
some new power. This evil is the one and only means to attain the
end, the good. Therefore we must not stop at bribery, deceit and
treachery when they should serve towards the attainment of our end.
In politics one must know how to seize the property of others
without hesitation if by it we secure submission and
sovereignty.</p>
<p>24. Our State, marching along the path of peaceful conquest, has
the right to replace the horrors of war by less noticeable and more
satisfactory sentences of death, necessary to maintain the terror
which tends to produce blind submission. Just but merciless
severity is the greatest factor of strength in the State: not only
for the sake of gain but also in the name of duty, for the sake of
victory, we must keep to the programme of violence and
make-believe. The doctrine of squaring accounts is precisely as
strong as the means of which it makes use. Therefore it is not so
much by the means themselves as by the doctrine of severity that we
shall triumph and bring all governments into subjection to our
super-government. It is enough for them to know that we are too
merciless for all disobedience to cease.</p>
<p>25. Far back in ancient times we were the first to cry among the
masses of the people the words "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,"
words many times repeated since these days by stupid poll-parrots
who, from all sides around, flew down upon these baits and with
them carried away the well-being of the world, true freedom of the
individual, formerly so well guarded against the pressure of the
mob. The would-be wise men of the goyim, the intellectuals, could
not make anything out of the uttered words in their abstractedness;
did not see that in nature there is no equality, cannot be freedom:
that Nature herself has established inequality of minds, of
characters, and capacities, just as immutably as she has
established subordination to her laws: never stopped to think that
the mob is a blind thing, that upstarts elected from among it to
bear rule are, in regard to the political, the same blind men as
the mob itself, that the adept, though he be a fool, can yet rule,
whereas the non-adept, even if he were a genius, understands
nothing in the political &#8211; to all those things the goyim paid
no regard; yet all the time it was based upon these things that
dynastic rule rested: the father passed on to the son a knowledge
of the course of political affairs in such wise that none should
know it but members of the dynasty and none could betray it to the
governed. As time went on, the meaning of the dynastic transference
of the true position of affairs in the political was lost, and this
aided the success of our cause.</p>
<p>26. In all corners of the earth the words "Liberty, Equality,
Fraternity," brought to our ranks, thanks to our blind agents,
whole legions who bore our banners with enthusiasm. And all the
time these words were canker-worms at work boring into the
well-being of the goyim, putting an end everywhere to peace, quiet,
solidarity and destroying all the foundations of the goya States.
As you will see later, this helped us to our triumph: it gave us
the possibility, among other things, of getting into our hands the
master card &#8211; the destruction of the privileges, or in other
words of the very existence of the aristocracy of the goyim, that
class which was the only defence peoples and countries had against
us. On the ruins of the eternal and genealogical aristocracy of the
goyim we have set up the aristocracy of our educated class headed
by the aristocracy of money. The qualifications for this
aristocracy we have established in wealth, which is dependent upon
us, and in knowledge, for which our learned elders provide the
motive force.</p>
<p>27. Our triumph has been rendered easier by the fact that in our
relations with the men, whom we wanted, we have always worked upon
the most sensitive chords of the human mind, upon the cash account,
upon the cupidity, upon the insatiability for material needs of
man; and each one of these human weaknesses, taken alone, is
sufficient to paralyse initiative, for it hands over the will of
men to the disposition of him who has bought their activities.</p>
<p>28. The abstraction of freedom has enabled us to persuade the
mob in all countries that their government is nothing but the
steward of the people who are the owners of the country, and that
the steward may be replaced like a worn-out glove.</p>
<p>29. It is this possibility of replacing the representatives of
the people which has placed at our disposal, and, as it were, given
us the power of appointment.<br/>

PROTOCOL 2
<h3>ECONOMIC WARS</h3>
<i>Routine scientific government &#8211; Darwinism,
Marxism, Nietzcheism &#8211; Press-inculcated
mentality.</i>
<p>1. It is indispensable for our purpose that wars, so far as
possible, should not result in territorial gains: war will thus be
brought on to the economic ground, where the nations will not fail
to perceive in the assistance we give the strength of our
predominance, and this state of things will put both sides at the
mercy of our international agentur; which possesses millions of
eyes ever on the watch and unhampered by any limitations
whatsoever. Our international rights will then wipe out national
rights, in the proper sense of right, and will rule the nations
precisely as the civil law of States rules the relations of their
subjects among themselves.</p>
<p>2. The administrators, whom we shall choose from among the
public, with strict regard to their capacities for servile
obedience, will not be persons trained in the arts of government,
and will therefore easily become pawns in our game in the hands of
men of learning and genius who will be their advisers, specialists
bred and reared from early childhood to rule the affairs of the
whole world. As is well known to you, these specialists of ours
have been drawing; to fit them for rule; the information they need;
from our political plans; from the lessons of history; from
observations made of the events of every moment as it passes. The
goyim are not guided by practical use of unprejudiced historical
observation, but by theoretical routine, without any critical
regard for consequent results. We need not, therefore, take any
account of them &#8211; let them amuse themselves until the hour
strikes, or live on hopes of new forms of enterprising pastime, or
on the memories of all they have enjoyed. For them let that play
the principal part which we have persuaded them to accept as the
dictates of science (theory). It is with this object in view that
we are constantly, by means of our press, arousing a blind
confidence in these theories. The intellectuals of the goyim will
puff themselves up with their knowledge and; without any logical
verification of them; will put into effect, all the information
available from science, which our agentur specialists have
cunningly pieced together, for the purpose of educating their minds
in the direction we want.</p>
<p>3. Do not suppose for a moment that these statements are empty
words: think carefully of the successes we arranged for Darwinism,
Marxism, Nietzsche-ism. To us Jews, at any rate, it should be plain
to see what a disintegrating importance these directives have had
upon the minds of the goyim.</p>
<p>4. It is indispensable for us to take account of the thoughts;
characters; tendencies of the nations, in order to avoid making
slips in the political and in the direction of administrative
affairs. The triumph of our system, of which the component parts of
the machinery may be variously disposed, according to the
temperament of the peoples met on our way, will fail of success if
the practical application of it be not based upon a summing up of
the lessons of the past in the light of the present.</p>
<p>5. In the hands of the States of to-day there is a great force
that creates the movement of thought in the people, and that is the
Press. The part played by the Press is to keep pointing out
requirements supposed to be indispensable, to give voice to the
complaints of the people, to express and to create discontent. It
is in the Press that the triumph of freedom of speech finds its
incarnation. But the goyim States have not known how to make use of
this force; and it has fallen into our hands. Through the Press we
have gained the power to influence, while remaining ourselves in
the shade; thanks to the Press we have got the GOLD in our hands,
notwithstanding that we have had to gather it out of the oceans of
blood and tears. But it has paid us, though we have sacrificed many
of our people. Each victim on our side is worth, in the sight of
God, a thousand goyim.<br/>

PROTOCOL 3
<h3>METHODS OF CONQUEST</h3>
<i>The Symbolic Snake &#8211; "People's Rights" &#8211;
Liquidation of the Goyim &#8211; "Sovereign Lord of the World"
&#8211; Universal economic crisis &#8211; "Ours they will not
touch&#8230;" &#8211; Secret masonic agents.</i>
<p>1. To-day I may tell you that our goal is now only a few steps
off. There remains a small space to cross and the whole long path
we have trodden is ready now to close its cycle of the Symbolic
Snake, by which we symbolise our people. When this ring closes, all
the States of Europe will be locked in its coil as in a powerful
vice.</p>
<p>2. The constitution scales of these days will shortly break
down, for we have established them with a certain lack of accurate
balance in order that they may oscillate incessantly until they
wear through the pivot on which they turn. The goyim are under the
impression that they have welded them sufficiently strong and they
have all along kept on expecting that the scales would come into
equilibrium. But the pivots &#8211; the kings on their thrones
&#8211; are hemmed in by their representatives, who play the fool,
distraught with their own uncontrolled and irresponsible power.
This power they owe to the terror which has been breathed into the
palaces. As they have no means of getting at their people, into
their very midst, the kings on their thrones are no longer able to
come to terms with them and so strengthen themselves against
seekers after power. We have made a gulf between the far-seeing
Sovereign Power and the blind force of the people so that both have
lost all meaning, for like the blind man and his stick, both are
powerless apart.</p>
<p>3. In order to incite seekers after power to a misuse of power
we have set all forces in opposition one to another, breaking up
their liberal tendencies towards independence. To this end we have
stirred up every form of enterprise, we have armed all parties, we
have set up authority as a target for every ambition. Of States we
have made gladiatorial arenas where a lot of confused issues
contend....A little more, and disorders and bankruptcy will be
universal....</p>
<p>4. Babblers, inexhaustible, have turned into oratorical contests
the sittings of Parliament and Administrative Boards. Bold
journalists and unscrupulous pamphleteers daily fall upon executive
officials. Abuses of power will put the final touch in preparing
all institutions for their overthrow and everything will fly
skyward under the blows of the maddened mob.</p>
<p>5. All people are chained down to heavy toil by poverty more
firmly than ever. They were chained by slavery and serfdom; from
these, one way and another, they might free themselves. These could
be settled with, but from want they will never get away. We have
included in the constitution such rights as to the masses appear
fictitious and not actual rights. All these so-called "Peoples
Rights" can exist only in idea, an idea which can never be realised
in practical life. What is it to the proletariat labourer, bowed
double over his heavy toil, crushed by his lot in life, if talkers
get the right to babble, if journalists get the right to scribble
any nonsense side by side with good stuff, once the proletariat has
no other profit out of the constitution save only those pitiful
crumbs which we fling them from our table in return for their
voting in favour of what we dictate, in favour of the men we place
in power, the servants of our agentur ... Republican rights for a
poor man are no more than a bitter piece of irony, for the
necessity he is under of toiling almost all day gives him no
present use of them, but the other hand robs him of all guarantee
of regular and certain earnings by making him dependent on strikes
by his comrades or lockouts by his masters.</p>
<p>6. The people, under our guidance, have annihilated the
aristocracy, who were their one and only defence* and foster-mother
for the sake of their own advantage which is inseparably bound up
with the well-being of the people. Nowadays, with the destruction
of the aristocracy, the people have fallen into the grips of
merciless money-grinding scoundrels who have laid a pitiless and
cruel yoke upon the necks of the workers.</p>
<p><i>* <b>Not true</b>. The Covenant and God's Laws and Economic
Policy in The Torah are the <b>ONLY</b> defence against all abuse
and oppression.</i></p>
<p>7. We appear on the scene as alleged saviours of the worker from
this oppression when we propose to him to enter the ranks of our
fighting forces &#8211; Socialists, Anarchists, Communists &#8211;
to whom we always give support in accordance with an alleged
brotherly rule (of the solidarity of all humanity) of our social
masonry (Ezekiel 13:10-16; Matthew 7:23-27). The aristocracy, which
enjoyed by law the labour of the workers, was interested in seeing
that the workers (employees/slaves) were well fed, healthy, and
strong. We are interested in just the opposite &#8211; in the
diminution, the killing out of the goyim. Our power is in the
chronic shortness of food and physical weakness of the worker
because by all that this implies he is made the slave of our will,
and he will not find in his own authorities either strength or
energy to set against our will. Hunger creates the right of capital
to rule the worker more surely than it was given to the aristocracy
by the (* ill-) legal authority of kings (* Deuteronomy
17:14-20).</p>
<p>8. By want and the envy and hatred which it engenders we shall
move the mobs and with their hands we shall wipe out all those who
hinder us on our way.</p>
<p>9. When the hour strikes for our sovereign lord of all the world
to be crowned it is these same hands which will sweep away
everything that might be a hindrance thereto.</p>
<p>10. The goyim have lost the habit of thinking, unless prompted
by the suggestions of our specialists. Therefore they do not see
the urgent necessity of what we, when our kingdom comes, shall
adopt at once, namely this, that it is essential to teach in
national schools one simple, true piece of knowledge, the basis of
all knowledge &#8211; the knowledge of the structure of human life,
of social existence, which requires division of labour, and,
consequently, the division of men into classes and conditions. It
is essential for all to know that owing to difference in the
objects of human activity there cannot be any equality, that he,
who by any act of his compromises a whole class, cannot be equally
responsible before the law with him who affects no one but only his
own honour. The true knowledge of the structure of society, into
the secrets of which we do not admit the goyim, would demonstrate
to all men that the positions and work must be kept within a
certain circle, that they may not become a source of human
suffering, arising from an education which does not correspond with
the work which individuals are called upon to do. After a thorough
study of this knowledge, the peoples will voluntarily submit to
authority and accept such position as is appointed them in the
State. In the present state of knowledge and the direction we have
given to its development of the people, blindly believing things in
print &#8211; cherishes &#8211; thanks to promptings intended to
mislead and to its own ignorance &#8211; a blind hatred towards all
conditions which it considers above itself, for it has no
understanding of the meaning of class and condition.</p>
<p>11. This hatred will be still further magnified by the effects
of an economic crisis, which will stop dealing on the exchanges and
bring industry to a standstill. We shall create by all the secret
subterranean methods open to us and with the aid of gold, which is
all in our hands, a universal economic crisis whereby we shall
throw upon the streets whole mobs of workers simultaneously in all
the countries of Europe. These mobs will rush delightedly to shed
the blood of those whom, in the simplicity of their ignorance, they
have envied from their cradles, and whose property they will then
be able to loot.</p>
<p>12 "Ours" they will not touch, because the moment of attack will
be known to us and we shall take measures to protect our own.</p>
<p>13. We have demonstrated that progress will bring all the goyim
to the sovereignty of reason. Our despotism will be precisely that;
for it will know how, by wise severities, to pacify all unrest, to
cauterise liberalism out of all institutions.</p>
<p>14. When the populace has seen that all sorts of concessions and
indulgences are yielded it, in the same name of freedom it has
imagined itself to be sovereign lord and has stormed its way to
power, but, naturally like every other blind man, it has come upon
a host of stumbling blocks. It has rushed to find a guide (Matthew
15:12-14; 23:23-39), it has never had the sense to return to the
former state (of keeping The Covenant) and it has laid down its
plenipotentiary powers at OUR feet. Remember the French Revolution,
to which it was we who gave the name of "Great": the secrets of its
preparations are well known to us, for it was wholly the work of
our hands.</p>
<p>15 Ever since that time we have been leading the peoples from
one disenchantment to another, so that in the end they should turn
also from us in favour of that king-despot of the blood of Zion,
whom we are preparing for the world.</p>
<p>16. At the present day we are, as an international force,
invincible, because if attacked by some we are supported by other
States. It is the bottomless rascality of the goyim peoples, who
crawl on their bellies to force, but are merciless towards
weakness, unsparing to faults and indulgent to crimes, unwilling to
bear the contradictions of a free social system but patient unto
martyrdom under the violence of a bold despotism &#8211; it is
those qualities which are aiding us to independence. From the
premier-dictators of the present day, the goyim peoples suffer
patiently and bear such abuses as for the least of them they would
have beheaded twenty kings.</p>
<p>17. What is the explanation of this phenomenon, this curious
inconsequence of the masses of the peoples in their attitude
towards what would appear to be events of the same order?</p>
<p>18. It is explained by the fact that these dictators whisper to
the peoples through their agents that through these abuses they are
inflicting injury on the States with the highest purpose &#8211; to
secure the welfare of the peoples, the international brotherhood of
them all, their solidarity and equality of rights. Naturally they
do not tell the peoples that this unification must be accomplished
only under our sovereign rule.</p>
<p>19. And thus the people condemn the upright and acquit the
guilty, persuaded ever more and more that it can do whatsoever it
wishes. Thanks to this state of things, the people are destroying
every kind of stability and creating disorders at every step.</p>
<p>20. The word "freedom" brings out the communities of men to
fight against every kind of force, against every kind of authority
even against God and the laws of nature. For this reason we, when
we come into our kingdom, shall have to erase this word from the
lexicon of life as implying a principle of brute force, which turns
mobs into bloodthirsty beasts.</p>
<p>21. These beasts, it is true, fall asleep again every time when
they have drunk their fill of blood, and at such time can easily be
riveted into their chains. But if they be not given blood they will
not sleep and will continue to struggle.<br/>

<h3>MATERIALISM REPLACES RELIGION</h3>
<i>Stages of a Republic &#8211; Gentile masonry a screen
&#8211; International speculation of industry &#8211; Cult of
Gold</i>
<p>1. Every republic passes through several stages. The first of
these is comprised in the early days of mad raging by the blind
mob, tossed hither and thither, right and left (Deuteronomy 5:32):
the second is demagogy from which is born anarchy, and that leads
inevitably to despotism &#8211; not any longer legal and overt, and
therefore responsible despotism, but to unseen and secretly hidden,
yet nevertheless sensibly felt despotism in the hands of some
secret organisation or other, whose acts are the more unscrupulous
inasmuch as it works behind a screen, behind the backs of all sorts
of agents, the changing of whom not only does not injuriously
affect, but actually aids the secret force by saving it, thanks to
continual changes, from the necessity of expanding its resources on
the rewarding of long services.</p>
<p>2. Who and what is in a position to overthrow an invisible
force? And this is precisely what our force is. Gentile masonry
blindly serves as a screen for us and our objects, but the plan of
action of our force, even its very abiding-place, remains for the
whole people an unknown mystery.</p>
<p>3. But even freedom might be harmless and have its place in the
State economy; without injury to the well-being of the peoples; if
it rested upon the foundation of faith in God, upon the brotherhood
of humanity, unconnected with the conception of equality, which is
negatived by the very laws of creation, for they have established
subordination. With such a faith as this a people might be governed
by a wardship of parishes, and would walk contentedly and humbly
under the guiding hand of its spiritual pastor, submitting to the
dispositions of God upon Earth. This is the reason why it is
indispensable for us to undermine all faith, to tear out of the
mind of the goyim the very principle of Godhead and the spirit
(John 3:1-12*), and to put in its place arithmetical calculations
and material needs.</p>
<p><i>* 3:1 There was a man of the politicians, named Nicodemus, a
ruler of the Jews:</i><br/>
<i>3:2 The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi,
we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do
these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</i><br/>
<i>3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, <font color="#000080">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born
from above, he cannot SEE the Kingdom of God.</font></i><br/>
<i>3:4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is
old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be
born?</i><br/>
<i>3:5 Jesus answered, <font color="#000080">Verily, verily, I say
unto thee, Except a man be born of water (human) and then is born
(later) from above as his spirit-"Being" (his REAL self which is
NOT human), he can NOT enter into the Kingdom of God (Who is a
Spirit-"Being").</font></i><br/>
<i>3:6 <font color="#000080">That which is born of the flesh is
human; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit (a
spirit-"Being") - (a human+Being).</font></i><br/>
<i>3:7 <font color="#000080">Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye
must be born again.</font></i><br/>
<i>3:8 <font color="#000080">The wind bloweth where it listeth,
and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it
cometh, and where it goeth: so is every one that is born of the
Spirit.</font></i><br/>
<i>3:9 Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things
be? (How can I not be human?)</i><br/>
<i>3:10 Jesus answered and said unto him, <font color="#000080">Art thou a teacher of Israel, and knowest not these
things?</font></i><br/>
<i>3:11 <font color="#000080">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We
speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye
receive not our witness.</font></i><br/>
<i>3:12 <font color="#000080">If I have told you earthly things,
and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you [of]
heavenly (spirit) things?</font></i></p>
<p>4. In order to give the goyim no time to think and take note,
their minds must be diverted towards industry and trade. Thus, all
the nations will be swallowed up in the pursuit of gain and, in the
race for it, will not take note of their common foe. But again, in
order that freedom may once for all disintegrate and ruin the
communities of the goyim, we must put industry on a speculative
basis: the result of this will be that what is withdrawn from the
land by industry will slip through the hands and pass into
speculation, that is, to our classes.</p>
<p>5. The intensified struggle for superiority and shocks delivered
to economic life will create, nay, have already created,
disenchanted, cold and heartless communities (Matthew 24:12). Such
communities will foster a strong aversion towards the higher
political and towards religion. Their only guide is gain, that is
Gold, which they will erect into a veritable cult, for the sake of
those material delights which it can give. Then will the hour
strike when, not for the sake of attaining the good, not even to
win wealth, but solely out of hatred towards the privileged, the
lower classes of the goyim will follow our lead against our rivals
for power, the intellectuals of the goyim.<br/>

PROTOCOL 5
<h3>DESPOTISM &amp; MODERN PROGRESS</h3>
<i>Centralised Government &#8211; Gulfs separating States
&#8211; Sham eloquence to overcome public opinion &#8211;
Super-Government Administration</i>
<p>1. What form of administrative rule can be given to communities
in which corruption has penetrated everywhere, communities where
riches are attained only by the clever surprise tactics of
semi-swindling tricks; where looseness reigns: where morality is
maintained by penal measures and harsh laws but not by voluntarily
accepted principles (The Commandments): where the feelings towards
faith and country are obligated by cosmopolitan convictions? What
form of rule is to be given to these communities, if not that
despotism which I shall describe to you later? We shall create an
intensified centralisation of government in order to grip in our
hands all the forces of the community. We shall regulate
mechanically all the actions of the political life of our subjects
by new laws. These laws will withdraw one by one all the
indulgences and liberties which have been permitted by the goyim,
and our kingdom will be distinguished by a despotism of such
magnificent proportions as to be at any moment and in every place
in a position to wipe out any goyim who oppose us by deed or
word.</p>
<p>2. We shall be told that such a despotism as I speak of is not
consistent with the progress of these days, but I will prove to you
that it is.</p>
<p>3. In the times when the peoples looked upon kings on their
thrones as on a pure manifestation of the will of God, they
submitted without a murmur to the despotic power of kings: but from
the day when we insinuated into their minds the conception of their
own rights, they began to regard the occupants of thrones as mere
ordinary mortals. The holy unction of the Lord's Anointed has
fallen from the heads of kings, in the eyes of the people, and when
we also robbed them of their faith in God, the might of power was
flung upon the streets, into the place of public proprietorship and
was seized by us.</p>
<p>4. Moreover, the art of directing masses and individuals by
means of cleverly manipulated theory and verbiage, by regulations
of life in common and all sorts of other quirks, in all which the
goyim understand nothing, belongs likewise to the specialists of
our administrative brain. Reared on analysis, observation, on
delicacies of fine calculation, in this species of skill we have no
rivals, any more than we have either in the drawing up of plans of
political actions and solidarity. In this respect the Jesuits alone
might have compared with us, but we have contrived to discredit
them in the eyes of the unthinking mob, as an overt organisation,
while we ourselves all the while have kept our secret organisation
in the shade. However, it is probably all the same to the world who
is its sovereign lord, whether the head of <a href="http://jahtruth.net/darth.htm">Catholicism</a> or our despot of the
blood of Zion! But to us, the Chosen People*, it is very far from
being a matter of indifference.</p>
<p>* <i>Which they are <b>not</b>:- <b>Revelation</b> 2:9</i>
<font color="#000080">I (Christ) know thy works, and tribulation,
and poverty, (but thou art rich) and [I know] the blasphemy of them
which say they are Jews, and are <b>NOT</b>, but [are]
(<b>Idumeans</b>) the Synagogue of Satan.</font><br/>
<font color="#000000"><b>Malachi</b> 1:2 I have loved you, saith
the "I AM". Yet ye say, Wherein hast Thou loved us? [Was] not Esau
Jacob's brother? saith the "I AM": yet I loved Jacob,</font><br/>
<font color="#000000">1:3 And I hated Esau (Edom) , and laid his
mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the
wilderness.</font><br/>
<font color="#000000">1:4 Whereas Edom (<b>Idumeans</b>) saith, We
are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places;
thus saith the "I AM" Lord of hosts, They shall build, but I will
throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness,
and, The people against whom the "I AM" hath indignation <b>for
ever</b>.</font></p>
<p>5. For a time perhaps we may be successfully dealt with by a
coalition of the goyim of all the world: but from this danger we
are secured by the discord existing among them whose roots are so
deeply seated that they can never now be plucked up (Matthew
13:24-3, 36-43). We have set one against another the personal and
national reckonings of the goyim, religious and race hatreds, which
we have fostered into a huge growth in the course of the past
twenty centuries. This is the reason why there is not one State
which would anywhere receive support, if it were to raise its arm,
for every one of them must bear in mind that any agreement against
us would be unprofitable to itself. We are too strong &#8211; there
is no evading our power. The nations cannot come to even an
inconsiderable private agreement without our secretly having a hand
in it.</p>
<p>6. Per me reges regnant. "It is through me that kings reign."
And it was said by the prophets that we were chosen by God Himself
to rule over the whole earth. God has endowed us with genius that
we may be equal to our task. Were genius in the opposite camp it
would still struggle against us, but even so, a newcomer is no
match for the old-established settler: the struggle would be
merciless between us, such a fight as the world has never seen
(Daniel 12:1-3; Matthew 24:21-27). Aye, and the genius on their
side would have arrived too late. All the wheels of the machinery
of all States go by the force of the engine, which is in our hands,
and that engine of the machinery of States is &#8211; Gold. The
science of political economy invented by our learned elders has for
long past been giving royal prestige to capital.</p>
<p>7. Capital, if it is to co-operate untrammelled, must be free to
establish a monopoly of industry and trade: this is already being
put in execution by an unseen hand in all quarters of the world.
This freedom will give political force to those engaged in
industry, and that will help to oppress the people. Nowadays it is
more important to disarm* the peoples than to lead them into war:
more important to use for our advantage the passions which have
burst into flames than to quench their fire: more important to
eradicate them. The principle object of our directorate consists in
this: to debilitate the public mind by criticism; to lead it away
from serious reflections calculated to arouse resistance; to
distract the forces of the mind towards a sham fight of empty
eloquence.</p>
<p>* Luke 11:21 <font color="#000099">When a strong man ARMED
keepeth his castle, his goods are in peace:</font><br/>
11:22 <font color="#000099">But when a stronger than he shall come
upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his weapons
wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.</font><br/>
<font color="#000000">11:23</font> <font color="#000099">He that
is not WITH me is AGAINST me: and he that gathereth not with me
scattereth.</font></p>
<p>8. In all ages the people of the world, equally with
individuals, have accepted words for deeds, for they are content
with a show and rarely pause to note, in the public arena, whether
promises are followed by performance. Therefore we shall establish
show institutions which will give eloquent proof of their benefit
to progress.</p>
<p>9. We shall assume to ourselves the liberal physiognomy of all
parties, of all directions, and we shall give that physiognomy a
voice in orators who will speak so much that they will exhaust the
patience of their hearers and produce an abhorrence of oratory.</p>
<p>10. In order to put public opinion into our hands we must bring
it into a state of bewilderment, by giving expression, from all
sides, to so many contradictory opinions and for such a length of
time as will suffice to make the goyim lose their heads in the
labyrinth and come to see that the best thing is to have no opinion
of any kind in matters political, which it is not given to the
public to understand, because they are understood only by him who
guides the public. This is the first secret.</p>
<p>11. The second secret requisite for the success of our
government is comprised in the following: To multiply to such an
extent; national failings; habits; passions; conditions of civil
life; that it will be impossible for anyone to know where he is in
the resulting chaos, so that the people in consequence will fail to
understand one another. This measure will also serve us in another
way, namely, to sow discord in all parties, to dislocate all
collective forces which are still unwilling to submit to us, and to
discourage any kind of personal initiative which might in any
degree hinder our affair. There is nothing more dangerous than
personal initiative: if it has genius behind it, such initiative
can do more than can be done by millions of people among whom we
have sown discord (Matthew 21:21). We must so direct the education
of the goyim communities that, whenever they come upon a matter
requiring initiative, they may drop their hands in despairing
impotence. The strain, which results from freedom of actions, saps
the forces, when it meets with the freedom of another. From this
collision arise grave moral shocks, disenchantments, failures. By
all these means we shall so wear down the goyim, that they will be
compelled to offer us international power, of a nature that, by its
position, will enable us, without any violence, gradually to absorb
all the state forces of the world and to form a Super-Government.
In place of the rulers of to-day we shall set up a bogey which will
be called the Super-Government Administration. Its hands will reach
out in all directions like nippers and its organisation will be of
such colossal dimensions that it cannot fail to subdue all the
nations of the world.<br/>

<h3>TAKE-OVER TECHNIQUE</h3>
<i>Reservoirs of riches &#8211; Destruction of goy
aristocracy &#8211; Vicious circle of rising prices</i>
<p>1. We shall soon begin to establish huge monopolies, reservoirs
of colossal riches, upon which, even large fortunes of the goyim
will depend to such an extent that they will go to the bottom,
together with the credit of the States, on the day after the
political smash....</p>
<p>2. You gentlemen here present who are economists, just strike an
estimate of the significance of this combination!...</p>
<p>3. In every possible way we must develop the significance of our
Super-Government by representing it as the Protector and Benefactor
of all those who voluntarily submit to us.</p>
<p>4. The aristocracy of the goyim as a political force, is dead
&#8211; We need not take it into account; but as landed proprietors
they can still be harmful to us from the fact that they are
self-sufficing in the resources upon which they live. It is
essential therefore for us, at whatever cost, to deprive them of
their land. This object will be best attained by increasing the
burdens upon landed property &#8211; in loading lands with debts.
These measures will check land-holding and keep it in a state of
humble and unconditional submission.</p>
<p>5. The aristocrats of the goyim, being hereditarily incapable of
contenting themselves with little, will rapidly burn up and fizzle
out.</p>
<p>6. At the same time we must intensively patronise trade and
industry, but, first and foremost, speculation, the part played by
which is to provide a counterpoise to industry: the absence of
speculative industry will multiply capital in private hands and
will serve to restore agriculture by freeing the land from
indebtedness to the land banks. What we want is that industry
should drain off from the land both labour and capital and, by
means of speculation, transfer into our hands all the money of the
world, and thereby throw all the goyim into the ranks of the
proletariat. Then the goyim will bow down before us, if for no
other reason but to get the right to exist.</p>
<p>7. To complete the ruin of the industry of the goyim, we shall
bring; to the assistance of speculation, the luxury which we have
developed among the goyim; that greedy demand for luxury which is
swallowing up everything. We shall raise the rate of wages which,
however, will not bring any advantage to the workers, for, at the
same time, we shall produce a rise in prices of the first
necessaries of life, alleging that it arises from the decline of
agriculture and cattle-breeding: we shall further undermine;
artfully and deeply; sources of production, by accustoming the
workers to anarchy and to drunkenness, and, side by side therewith,
taking all measures to extirpate from the face of the earth all the
educated forces of the goyim.</p>
<p>8. In order that the true meaning of things may not strike the
goyim; before the proper time; we shall mask it under an alleged
ardent desire to serve the working classes and the great principles
of political economy, about which, our economic theories are
carrying on an energetic propaganda.<br/>

<h3>WORLD-WIDE WARS</h3>
<i>Encouraging an arms race &#8211; Universal war to check
goy opposition &#8211; The guns of America, China and
Japan</i>
<p>1. The intensification of armaments, the increase of police
forces &#8211; are all essential for the completion of the
aforementioned plans. What we have to get at, is that there should
be, in all the States of the world; besides ourselves, only the
masses of the proletariat; a few millionaires devoted to our
interests; police and soldiers.</p>
<p>2. Throughout all Europe, and by means of relations with Europe,
in other continents also, we must create ferments; discords and
hostility. Therein we gain a double advantage. In the first place
we keep in check all countries, for they will know that we have the
power, whenever we like, to create disorders or to restore order.
All these countries are accustomed to see in us an indispensable
force of coercion. In the second place, by our intrigues we shall
tangle up all the threads which we have stretched into the cabinets
of all States; by means of the political; by economic treaties, or
loan obligations. In order to succeed in this we must use great
cunning and penetration during negotiations and agreements, but, as
regards what is called the "official language," we shall keep to
the opposite tactics and assume the mask of honesty and
complacency. In this way the peoples and governments of the goyim,
whom we have taught to look only at the outside of whatever we
present to their notice, will still continue to accept us as the
benefactors and saviours of the human race.</p>
<p>3. We must be in a position to respond to every act of
opposition; by war with the neighbours of that country which dares
to oppose us: but if these neighbours should also venture to stand
collectively together against us, then we must offer resistance by
a universal war.</p>
<p>4. The principal factor of success in the political is the
secrecy of its undertakings: the word should not agree with the
deeds of the diplomat.</p>
<p>5. We must compel the governments of the goyim to take action in
the direction favoured by our widely conceived plan, already
approaching the desired consummation, by what we shall represent as
public opinion, secretly promoted by us through the means of that
so-called "Great Power" &#8211; the Press which, with few
exceptions that may be disregarded, is already, entirely in our
hands.<br/>

<h3>PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT</h3>
<i>Legal justification for audacity &#8211;
Super-educational training &#8211; Control of bankers,
industrialists and capitalists</i>
<p>1. We must arm ourselves with all the weapons which our
opponents might employ against us. We must search out; in the very
finest shades of expression and the knotty points of the lexicon of
law; justification for those cases, where we shall have to
pronounce judgements that might appear abnormally audacious and
unjust, for it is important that these resolutions should be set
forth, in expressions that shall seem to be the most exalted moral
principles cast into legal form. Our directorate must surround
itself with all these forces of civilisation, among which it will
have to work. It will surround itself with publicists; practical
jurists; administrators; diplomats and, finally, with persons
prepared by a special super-educational training in our special
schools. These persons will have consonance of all the secrets of
the social structure, they will know all the languages that can be
made up by political alphabets and words; they will be made
acquainted with the whole underside of human nature, with all its
sensitive chords on which they will have to play. These chords are
the cast of mind of the goyim; their tendencies; short-comings;
vices and qualities; the particularities of classes and conditions.
Needless to say that the talented assistants of authority, of whom
I speak, will be taken not from among the goyim, who are accustomed
to perform their administrative work without giving themselves the
trouble to think what its aim is, and never consider what it is
needed for. The administrators of the goyim sign papers without
reading them, and they serve either for mercenary reasons or from
ambition.</p>
<p>2. We shall surround our government with a whole world of
economists. That is the reason why economic sciences form the
principal subject of the teaching given to the Jews. Around us
again will be a whole constellation of bankers; industrialists;
capitalists and &#8211; the main thing &#8211; millionaires;
because in substance, everything will be settled by the question of
figures.</p>
<p>3. For a time, until there will no longer be any risk in
entrusting responsible posts in our State to our brother-Jews, we
shall put them in the hands of persons whose past and reputation
are such that between them and the people lies an abyss, persons
who, in case of disobedience to our instructions, must face
criminal charges or disappear &#8211; this in order to make them
defend our interests to their last gasp.<br/>

<h3>RE-EDUCATION</h3>
<i>Meaning of anti-semitism &#8211; Source of the
all-engulfing terror &#8211; Boosting of false
theories</i>
<p>1. In applying our principles, let attention be paid to the
character of the people in whose country you live and act; a
general, identical application of them, until such time as the
people shall have been re-educated to our pattern, cannot have
success. But, by approaching their application cautiously, you will
see that not a decade will pass before the most stubborn character
will change and we shall add a new people to the ranks of those
already subdued by us.</p>
<p>2. The words of the liberal, which are in effect the words of
our masonic watchword, namely, "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,"
will, when we come into our kingdom, be changed by us into words no
longer of a watchword, but only an expression of idealism, namely,
into "The right of liberty, the duty of equality, the ideal of
brotherhood." That is how we shall put it, &#8211; and so we shall
catch the bull by the horns ... de facto we have already wiped-out
every kind of rule except our own, although de jure there still
remain a good many of them. Nowadays, if any States raise a protest
against us, it is only pro forma at our discretion and by our
direction, for their anti-semitism is indispensable to us for the
management of our lesser brethren. I will not enter into further
explanations, for this matter has formed the subject of repeated
discussions amongst us.</p>
<p>3. For us there are not checks to limit the range of our
activity. Our Super-Government subsists in extra-legal conditions,
which are described, in the accepted terminology, by the energetic
and forcible word &#8211; Dictatorship. I am in a position to tell
you, with a clear conscience, that at the proper time we, the
law-givers, shall execute judgement and sentence, we shall slay and
we shall spare, we, as head of all our troops, are mounted on the
steed of the leader. We rule by force of will, because in our hands
are the fragments of a once powerful party, now vanquished by us.
And the weapons in our hands are limitless ambitions; burning
greediness; merciless vengeance; hatreds and malice.</p>
<p>4. It is from us that the all-engulfing terror proceeds. We have
in our service persons of all opinions, of all doctrines; restoring
monarchists; demagogues; socialists; communists and utopian
dreamers of every kind. We have harnessed them all to the task:
each one of them, on his own account, is boring away at the last
remnants of authority; is striving to overthrow all established
form of order. By these acts all States are in torture; they exhort
to tranquillity; are ready to sacrifice everything for peace: but
we will not give them peace until they openly acknowledge our
international Super-Government, and with submissiveness.</p>
<p>5. The people have raised a howl about the necessity of settling
the question of Socialism by way of an international agreement.
Division into fractional parties has given them into our hands*,
for, in order to carry on a contested struggle one must have money,
and the money is all in our hands.</p>
<p><b><i>* Matthew 12:25 And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said
unto them,</i> <font color="#000080">Every kingdom divided against
itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided
against itself shall not stand:</font></b></p>
<p>6. We might have reason to apprehend a union between the
"clear-sighted" force of the goy kings on their thrones and the
"blind" force of the goy mobs, but we have taken all the needful
measure against any such possibility: between the one and the other
force we have erected a bulwark in the shape of a mutual terror
between them. In this way the blind force of the people remains our
support and we, and we only, shall provide them with a leader and,
of course, direct them along the road that leads to our goal.</p>
<p>7. In order that the hand of the blind mob may not free itself
from our guiding hand, we must every now and then enter into close
communion with it, if not actually in person, at any rate through
some of the most trusty of our brethren. When we are acknowledged
as the only authority we shall discuss with the people personally
on the market-places, and we shall instruct them on questings of
the political in such wise as may turn them in the direction that
suits us.</p>
<p>8. Who is going to verify what is taught in the village schools?
But, what an envoy of the government, or a king on his throne
himself may say, cannot but become immediately known to the whole
State, for it will be spread abroad by the voice of the people.</p>
<p>9. In order to annihilate the institutions of the goyim, before
it is time, we have touched them with craft and delicacy, and have
taken hold of the ends of the springs which move their mechanism.
These springs lay in a strict but just sense of order; we have
replaced them by the chaotic license of liberalism. We have got our
hands into the administration of the law; into the conduct of
elections; into the press; into liberty of the person; but
principally into education and training as being the cornerstones
of a free existence.</p>
<p>10. We have fooled, bemused and corrupted the youth of the
goyim, by rearing them in principles and theories which are known
to us to be false, although it is by us they have been
inculcated.</p>
<p>11. Above the existing laws; without substantially altering
them, and by merely twisting them into contradictions of
interpretations; we have erected something grandiose in the way of
results. These results found expression in the fact that the
INTERPRETATIONS MASKED THE LAW: afterwards they entirely hid them
from the eyes of the governments; owing to the impossibility of
making anything out of the tangled web of legislation.</p>
<p>12. This is the origin of the theory of course of
arbitration.</p>
<p>13. You may say that the goyim will rise upon us, arms in hand,
if they guess what is going on before the time comes; but in the
West we have against this a manoeuvre of such appalling terror that
the very stoutest hearts quail &#8211; the undergrounds,
metropolitans, those subterranean corridors which, before the time
comes, will be driven under all the capitals and from whence those
capitals will be blown into the air with all their organisations
and archives.<br/>

PROTOCOL 10
<h3>PREPARING FOR POWER</h3>
<i>Camouflaged political freedom &#8211; Universal suffrage
&#8211; The rise of republics &#8211; Transition to masonic
despotism &#8211; Proclamation of the "Lord of all the World"
&#8211; Inoculation of diseases</i>
<p>1. To-day I begin with a repetition of what I said before, and I
beg you to bear in mind that governments and people are content, in
the political, with outside appearances. And how, indeed, are the
goyim to perceive the underlying meaning of things, when their
representatives give the best of their energies to enjoying
themselves? For our policy, it is of the greatest importance to
take cognisance of this detail; it will be of assistance to us,
when we come to consider the division of authority of property; of
the dwelling; of taxation (the idea of concealed taxes); of the
reflex force of the laws. All these questions are such as ought not
to be touched upon directly and openly before the people. In cases
where it is indispensable to touch upon them, they must not be
categorically named; it must merely be declared, without detailed
exposition, that the principles of contemporary law are
acknowledged by us. The reason; of keeping silence in this respect;
is that, by not naming a principle, we leave ourselves freedom of
action, to drop this or that out of it, without attracting notice;
if they were all categorically named, they would all appear to have
been already given.</p>
<p>2. The mob cherishes a special affection and respect for the
geniuses of political power and accepts all their deeds of violence
with the admiring response: "rascally, well, yes, it is rascally,
but it's clever!...a trick, if you like, but how craftily played,
how magnificently done, what impudent audacity!".&#8230;</p>
<p>3. We count upon attracting all nations to the task of erecting
the new fundamental structure, the project for which has been drawn
up by us. This is why, before everything, it is indispensable for
us to arm ourselves and to store up, in ourselves, that absolutely
reckless audacity and irresistible might of the spirit which; in
the person of our active workers; will break down all hindrances on
our way.</p>
<p>4. When we have accomplished our coup d'etat we shall say then
to the various peoples: "Everything has gone terribly badly, all
have been worn out with sufferings. We are destroying the causes of
your torment &#8211; nationalities; frontiers; differences of
coinages. You are at liberty, of course, to pronounce sentence upon
us, but can it possibly be a just one, if it is confirmed by you,
before you make any trial of what we are offering you."&#8230;.Then
will the mob exalt us and bear us up in their hands in a unanimous
triumph of hopes and expectations. Voting; which we have made the
instrument which will set us on the throne of the world, by
teaching even the very smallest units of members of the human race
to vote, by means of meetings and agreements by groups; will then
have served its purposes and will play its part then, for the last
time, by a unanimity of desire to make close acquaintances with us
before condemning us.</p>
<p>5. To secure this we must have everybody vote without
distinction of classes and qualifications, in order to establish an
absolute majority, which cannot be got from the educated propertied
classes. In this way, by inculcating in all a sense of
self-importance, we shall destroy among the goyim the importance of
the family and its educational value and remove the possibility of
individual minds splitting off, for the mob, handled by us, will
not let them come to the front, nor even give them a hearing; it is
accustomed to listen only to us who pay it for obedience and
attention. In this way we shall create a blind, mighty force, which
will never be in a position to move in any direction, without the
guidance of our agents, set at its head, by us, as leaders of the
mob. The people will submit to this regime, because it will know,
that upon these leaders will depend its earnings, gratifications
and the receipt of all kinds of benefits.</p>
<p>6. A scheme of government should come ready made from one brain,
because it will never be clinched firmly if it is allowed to be
split into fractional parts in the minds of many. It is allowable,
therefore, for us to have cognisance of the scheme of action but
not to discuss it, lest we disturb its artfulness; the
interdependence of its component parts; the practical force of the
secret meaning of each clause. To discuss and make alterations in a
labour of this kind, by means of numerous votings, is to impress
upon it the stamp of all reasoning and misunderstandings which have
failed to penetrate the depth and extent of its plottings. We want
our schemes to be forcible and suitably concocted. Therefore we
ought not to fling the work of genius of our guide to the fangs of
the mob, or even to a select company.</p>
<p>7. These schemes will not turn existing institutions upside down
just yet. They will only effect changes in their economy and
consequently in the whole combined movement of their progress,
which will thus be directed along the paths laid down in our
schemes.</p>
<p>8. Under various names there exists, in all countries,
approximately one and the same thing: Representation; Ministry;
Senate; State Council; Legislative and Executive Corps. I need not
explain to you the mechanism of the relation of these institutions
to one another, because you are aware of all that; only take note
of the fact that each of the above-named institutions corresponds
to some important function of the State, and I would beg you to
remark that the word "important" I apply not to the institution but
to the function, consequently it is not the institutions which are
important but their functions. These institutions have divided up
among themselves all the functions of government &#8211;
administrative; legislative; executive; wherefore they have come to
operate as do the organs in the human body. If we injure one part
in the machinery of State, the State falls sick, like a human body,
and ...will die.</p>
<p>9. When we introduced into the State organism the poison of
Liberalism its whole political complexion underwent a change.
States have been seized with a mortal illness &#8211; blood
poisoning. All that remains is to await the end of their death
agony.</p>
<p>10. Liberalism produced Constitutional States, which took the
place of what was the only safeguard of the goyim, namely,
Despotism; and a constitution , as you well know, is nothing else
but a school of discords, misunderstandings, quarrels,
disagreements, fruitless party agitations, party whims &#8211; in a
word, a school of everything that serves to destroy the personality
of State activity. The tribune of the "talkeries" has; no less
effectively than the Press; condemned the rulers to inactivity and
impotence, and thereby rendered them useless and superfluous, for
which reason indeed they have been, in many countries, deposed.
Then it was that the era of republics became a possibility that
could be realised, and then it was that we replaced the ruler by a
caricature of a government &#8211; by a president, taken from the
mob, from the midst of our puppet creatures, or slaves. This was
the foundation of the mine which we have laid under the goy people,
I should rather say, under the goy peoples.</p>
<p>11. In the near future we shall establish the responsibility of
presidents.</p>
<p>12. By that time, we shall be in a position to disregard forms,
in carrying through matters for which our impersonal puppet will be
responsible. What do we care if the ranks of those striving for
power should be thinned, if there should arise a deadlock from the
impossibility of finding presidents, a deadlock which will finally
disorganise the country? ....</p>
<p>13. In order that our scheme may produce this result we shall
arrange elections in favour of such presidents as have in their
past some dark, undiscovered stain, some "Panama" or other &#8211;
then they will be trustworthy agents for the accomplishment of our
plans, out of fear of revelations and from the natural desire of
everyone who has attained power, namely, the retention of the
privileges, advantages and honour connected with the office of
president. The chamber of deputies will provide cover for, will
protect, will elect presidents, but we shall take from it the right
to propose new, or make changes in existing laws, for this right
will be given by us to the responsible president, a puppet in our
hands. Naturally, the authority of the presidents will then become
a target for every possible form of attack, but we shall provide
him with a means of self-defence in the right of an appeal to the
people, for the decision of the people over the heads of their
representatives, that is to say, an appeal to that some blind slave
of ours &#8211; the majority of the mob. Independently of this we
shall invest the president with the right of declaring a state of
war. We shall justify this last right on the ground that the
president as chief of the whole army of the country must have it at
his disposal, in case of need for the defence of the new republican
constitution, the right to defend which will belong to him as the
responsible representative of this constitution.</p>
<p>14. It is easy to understand, that; in these conditions; the key
of the shrine will lie in our hands, and no one outside ourselves
will any longer direct the force of legislation.</p>
<p>15. Besides this we shall, with the introduction of the new
republican constitution, take from the Chamber the right of
interpolation on government measures, on the pretext of preserving
political secrecy, and, further, we shall, by the new constitution,
reduce the number of representatives to a minimum, thereby
proportionately reducing political passions and the passion for
politics. If, however, they should, which is hardly to be expected,
burst into flame, even in this minimum, we shall nullify them by a
stirring appeal and a reference to the majority of the whole
people....Upon the president will depend the appointment of
presidents and vice-presidents of the Chamber and the Senate.
Instead of constant sessions of Parliaments we shall reduce their
sittings to a few months. Moreover, the president, as chief of the
executive power, will have the right to summon and dissolve
Parliament, and, in the latter case, to prolong the time for the
appointment of a new parliamentary assembly. But, in order that the
consequences of all these acts; which in substance are illegal;
should not; prematurely for our plans; fall upon the
responsibility, established by us, of the president: we shall
instigate ministers and other officials of the higher
administration about the president to evade his dispositions, by
taking measures of their own, for doing which they will be made the
scapegoats in his place....This part we especially recommend to be
given to be played by the Senate; the Council of State; or the
Council of Ministers; but not to an individual official.</p>
<p>16. The president will, at our discretion, interpret the sense
of such of the existing laws as admit of various interpretation; he
will further annul them when we indicate to him the necessity to do
so, besides this, he will have the right to propose temporary laws,
and even new departures in the government constitutional working,
the pretext, both for the one and the other, being the requirements
for the supreme welfare of the State.</p>
<p>17. By such measure we shall obtain the power of destroying,
little by little, step by step, all; that at the outset, when we
enter on our rights, we are compelled to introduce into the
constitutions of States; to prepare for the transition to an
imperceptible abolition of every kind of constitution, and then the
time is come to turn every form of government into our
despotism.</p>
<p>18. The recognition of our despot may also come before the
destruction of the constitution; the moment for this recognition
will come when the peoples, utterly wearied by the irregularities
and incompetence &#8211; a matter which we shall arrange for
&#8211; of their rulers, will clamour: "Away with them and give us
one king over all the Earth who will unite us and annihilate the
causes of disorders &#8211; frontiers; nationalities; religions;
State debts &#8211; who will give us peace and quiet which we
cannot find under our rulers and representatives."</p>
<p>19. But you yourselves know perfectly well, that to produce the
possibility of the expression of such wishes, by all the nations,
it is indispensable, to trouble, in all countries, the people's
relations with their governments, so as to utterly exhaust humanity
with dissension; hatred; struggle; envy and even by the use of
torture; by starvation; by the inoculation of disease; by want, so
that the goyim see no other course open to them than to take refuge
in our complete sovereignty in money and in all else.</p>
<p>20. But if we give the nations of the world a breathing-space
the moment we long for is hardly likely ever to arrive.<br/>

PROTOCOL 11
<h3>THE TOTALITARIAN STATE</h3>
<i>The new constitution &#8211; Abolition of the rights of
man &#8211; "Show" army of masonic lodges</i>
<p>1. The State Council has been, as it were, the emphatic
expression of the authority of the ruler: it will be, as the "show"
part of the Legislative Corps, what may be called the editorial
committee of the laws and decrees of the ruler.</p>
<p>2. This, then, is the program of the new constitution. We shall
make Law, Right and Justice (1) in the guise of proposals to the
Legislative Corps; (2) by decrees of the president under the guise
of general regulations, of orders of the Senate and of resolutions
of the State Council in the guise of ministerial orders; (3) and in
case a suitable occasion should arise &#8211; in the form of a
revolution in the State.</p>
<p>3. Having established approximately the modus agendi, we will
occupy ourselves with details of those combinations by which we
have still to complete the revolution in the course of the
machinery of State in the direction already indicated. By 'those
combinations', I mean the freedom of the Press; the right of
association; freedom of conscience; the voting principle; and many
another that must disappear for ever from the memory of man, or
undergo a radical alteration the day after the promulgation of the
new constitution. It is only at the moment that we shall be able at
once to announce all our orders, for, afterwards, every noticeable
alteration will be dangerous, for the following reasons: if this
alteration be brought in with harsh severity and in a sense of
severity and limitations, it may lead to a feeling of despair
caused by fear of new alterations in the same direction; if, on the
other hand, it be brought in a sense of further indulgences it will
be said that we have recognised our own wrong-doing and this will
destroy the prestige of the infallibility of our authority, or else
it will be said that we have become alarmed and are compelled to
show a yielding disposition, for which we shall get no thanks
because it will be supposed to be compulsory ... Both the one and
the other are injurious to the prestige of the new constitution.
What we want is that from the first moment of its promulgation,
while the peoples of the world are still stunned by the
accomplished fact of the revolution, still in a condition of terror
and uncertainty, they should recognise once and for all that we are
so strong, so inexpugnable, so super-abundantly filled with power,
that in no case shall we take any account of them, and so far from
paying any attention to their opinions or wishes, we are ready and
able to crush with irresistible power all expression or
manifestation thereof at every moment and in every place, that we
have seized at once everything we wanted and shall in no case
divide our power with them ... Then in fear and trembling they will
close their eyes to everything, and be content to await what will
be the end of it all.</p>
<p>4. The goyim are a flock of sheep, and we are their wolves. And
you know what happens when the wolves get hold of the
flock?....</p>
<p>5. There is another reason also why they will close their eyes:
for we shall keep promising them to give back all the liberties we
have taken away as soon as we have quelled the enemies of peace and
tamed all parties...</p>
<p>6. It is not worth to say anything about how long a time they
will be kept waiting for this return of their liberties...</p>
<p>7. For what purpose then have we invented this whole policy and
insinuated it into the minds of the goy, without giving them any
chance to examine its underlying meaning? For what, indeed, if not
in order to obtain, in a roundabout way, what is, for our scattered
tribe, unattainable by the direct road? It is this which has served
as the basis for our organisation of secret Masonry which is not
known to, and aims which are not even so much as suspected by these
goy cattle, attracted by us to the "show" army of Masonic Lodges,
in order to throw dust in the eyes of their fellows.</p>
<p>8. God has granted to us, His Chosen People*, the gift of the
dispersion, and in this which appears in all eyes to be our
weakness, has come forth all our strength, which has now brought us
to the threshold of sovereignty over all the world.</p>
<p><i>* Which they are <b>NOT</b>, but are in reality the Synagogue
of Satan, as confirmed by Christ:- <b>Revelation</b> 2:9</i>
<font color="#000080">I know thy works, and tribulation, and
poverty, (but thou art rich) and [I know] the blasphemy of them
which say they are Jews, and are <b>NOT</b>, but [are] (Idumeans)
the Synagogue of Satan (the serpent).</font><br/>
<font color="#000000"><b>Malachi</b> 1:2 I have loved you, saith
the "I AM". Yet ye say, Wherein hast Thou loved us? [Was] not Esau
Jacob's brother? saith the "I AM": yet I loved Jacob,</font><br/>
<font color="#000000">1:3 And I hated Esau (Edom) , and laid his
mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the
wilderness.</font><br/>
<font color="#000000">1:4 Whereas Edom (<b>Idumeans</b>) saith, We
are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places;
thus saith the "I AM" Lord of hosts, They shall build, but I will
throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness,
and, The people against whom the "I AM" hath indignation <b>for
ever</b>.</font></p>
<p>9. There now remains not much more for us to build up upon the
foundation we have laid.<br/>

PROTOCOL 12
<h3>CONTROL OF THE PRESS</h3>
<i>Masonic "freedom" &#8211; Control of printing and
publishing &#8211; Vishnu, idol of the Press</i>
<p>1. The word "freedom," which can be interpreted in various ways,
is defined by us as follows -</p>
<p>2. Freedom is the right to do that which the law allows. This
interpretation of the word will at the proper time be of service to
us, because all freedom will thus be in our hands, since the laws
will abolish or create only that which is desirable for us,
according to the aforesaid program.</p>
<p>3. We shall deal with the press in the following way: what is
the part played by the press to-day? It serves to excite and
inflame those passions which are needed for our purpose, or else it
serves selfish ends of parties. It is often vapid; unjust;
mendacious; and the majority of the public have not the slightest
idea what ends the press really serves. We shall saddle and bridle
it with a tight curb: we shall do the same also with all
productions of the printing press, for where would be the sense of
getting rid of the attacks of the press if we remain targets for
pamphlets and books? The produce of publicity, which nowadays is a
source of heavy expense owing to the necessity of censoring it,
will be turned by us into a very lucrative source of income to our
State: we shall law on it a special stamp tax and require deposits
of caution-money before permitting the establishment of any organ
of the press or of printing offices; these will then have to
guarantee our government against any kind of attack on the part of
the press. For any attempt to attack us, if such still be possible,
we shall inflict fines without mercy. Such measures as stamp tax,
deposit of caution-money and fines secured by these deposits, will
bring in a huge income to the government. It is true that party
organs might not spare money for the sake of publicity, but these
we shall shut up at the second attack upon us. No one shall with
impunity lay a finger on the aureole of our government
infallibility. The pretext for stopping any publication will be the
alleged plea that it is agitating the public mind without occasion
or justification. I beg you to note that among those making attacks
upon us will also be organs established by us, but they will attack
exclusively points that we have pre-determined to alter.</p>
<p>4. Not a single announcement will reach the public without our
control. Even now this is already being attained by us inasmuch as
all news items are received by a few agencies, in whose offices
they are focused from all parts of the world. These agencies will
then be already entirely ours and will give publicity only to what
we dictate to them.</p>
<p>5. If already now we have contrived to possess ourselves of the
minds of the goy communities to such an extent that they all come
near, looking upon the events of the world through the coloured
glasses of those spectacles we are setting astride their noses; if
already now there is not a single State where there exist for us
any barriers to admittance into what goy stupidity calls State
secrets: what will our positions be then, when we shall be
acknowledged supreme lords of the world in the person of our king
of all the world...</p>
<p>6. Let us turn again to the future of the printing press. Every
one desirous of being a publisher, librarian, or printer, will be
obliged to provide himself with the diploma instituted therefore,
which, in case of any fault, will be immediately impounded. With
such measures the instrument of thought will become an educative
means in the hands of our government, which will no longer allow
the mass of the nation to be led astray in by-ways and fantasies
about the blessings of progress. Is there any one of us who does
not know that these phantom blessings are the direct roads to
foolish imaginings, which give birth to anarchical relations of men
among themselves and towards authority, because progress, or rather
the idea of progress, has introduced the conception of every kind
of emancipation, but has failed to establish its limits.&#8230;All
the so-called liberals are anarchists, if not in fact, at any rate
in thought. Every one of them is hunting after phantoms of freedom,
and falling exclusively into license, that is, into the anarchy of
protest for the sake of protest.&#8230;</p>
<p>7. We turn to the periodical press. We shall impose on it, as on
all printed matter, stamp taxes per sheet and deposits of
caution-money, and books of less than 30 sheets will pay double. We
shall reckon them as pamphlets in order, on the one hand, to reduce
the number of magazines, which are the worst form of printed
poison, and, on the other, in order that this measure may force
writers into such lengthy productions that they will be little
read, especially as they will be costly. At the same time what we
shall publish ourselves to influence mental development; in the
direction laid down for our profit; will be cheap and will be read
voraciously. The tax will bring vapid literary ambitions within
bounds and the liability to penalties will make literary men
dependent upon us. And if there should be any found who are
desirous of writing against us, they will not find any person eager
to print their productions. Before accepting any production for
publication the publisher or printer will have to apply to the
authorities for permission to do so. Thus we shall know beforehand
of all tricks preparing against us and shall nullify them by
getting ahead with explanations on the subject treated of.</p>
<p>8. Literature and journalism are two of the most important
educative forces, and therefore our government will become
proprietor of the majority of the journals. This will neutralise
the injurious influence of the privately-owned press and will put
us in possession of a tremendous influence upon the public
mind....If we give permits for ten journals, we shall ourselves
found thirty, and so on in the same proportion. This, however, must
in no wise be suspected by the public. For which reason all
journals published by us will be of the most opposite, in
appearance, tendencies and opinions, thereby creating confidence in
us and bringing over to us quite unsuspicious opponents, who will
thus fall into our trap and be rendered harmless.</p>
<p>9. In the front rank will stand organs of an official character.
They will always stand guard over our interests, and therefore
their influence will be comparatively insignificant.</p>
<p>10. In the second rank will be the semi-official organs, whose
part it will be to attack the tepid and indifferent.</p>
<p>11. In the third rank we shall set up our own; to all
appearance, off position; which, in at least one of its organs,
will present what looks like the very antipothesis to us. Our real
opponents at heart will accept this simulated opposition as their
own and will show us their cards.</p>
<p>12. All our newspapers will be of all possible complexions
&#8211; aristocratic, republican, revolutionary, even anarchical
&#8211; for so long, of course, as the constitution exists....Like
the Indian idol "Vishnu" they will have a hundred hands, and every
one of them will have a finger on any one of the public opinions as
required. When a pulse quickens these hands will lead opinion in
the direction of our aims, for an excited patient loses all power
of judgement and easily yields to suggestion. Those fools who will
think they are repeating the opinion of a newspaper of their own
camp will be repeating our opinion or any opinion that seems
desirable for us. In the vain belief that they are following the
organ of their party they will, in fact, follow the flag which we
hang out for them.</p>
<p>13. In order to direct our newspaper militia in this sense we
must take special and minute care in organising this matter. Under
the title of central department of the press we shall institute
literary gatherings at which our agents will, without attracting
attention, issue the orders and watchwords of the day. By
discussing and controverting, but always superficially, without
touching the essence of the matter, our organs will carry on a sham
fight fusillade with the official newspapers solely for the purpose
of giving occasion for us to express ourselves more fully than
could well be done from the outset in official announcements,
whenever, of course, that is to our advantage.</p>
<p>14. These attacks upon us will also serve another purpose,
namely, that our subjects will be convinced of the existence of
full freedom of speech and so give our agents an occasion to affirm
that all organs which oppose us are empty babblers, since they are
incapable of finding any substantial objections to our orders.</p>
<p>15. Methods of organisation like these, imperceptible to the
public eye but absolutely sure, are the best calculated to succeed
in bringing the attention and the confidence of the public to the
side of our government. Thanks to such methods we shall be in a
position, as from time to time may be required, to excite or to
tranquillise the public mind on political questions, to persuade or
to confuse, printing now truth, now lies, facts or their
contradictions, according as they may be well or ill received,
always very cautiously feeling our ground before stepping upon
it....We shall have a sure triumph over our opponents; since they
will not have at their disposition organs of the press in which
they can give full and final expression to their views; owing to
the aforesaid methods of dealing with the press. We shall not even
need to refute them except very superficially.</p>
<p>16. Trial shots like these, fired by us in the third rank of our
press, in case of need, will be energetically refuted by us in our
semi-official organs.</p>
<p>17. Even nowadays, already, to take only the French press, there
are forms which reveal masonic solidarity in acting on the
watchword: all organs of the press are bound together by
professional secrecy; like the augurs of old, not one of their
numbers will give away the secret of his sources of information,
unless it be resolved to make announcement of them. Not one
journalist will venture to betray this secret, for not one of them
is ever admitted to practice literature unless his whole past has
some disgraceful sore or other....These sores would be immediately
revealed. So long as they remain the secret of a few, the prestige
of the journalist attacks the majority of the country &#8211; the
mob follow after him with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>18. Our calculations are especially extended to the provinces.
It is indispensable for us to inflame there those hopes and
impulses with which we could at any moment fall upon the capital,
and we shall represent to the capitals that these expressions are
the independent hopes and impulses of the provinces. Naturally, the
source of them will be always one and the same &#8211; ours. We
require that, until such a time as we are in the plenitude of
power, the capitals should find themselves stifled by the
provincial opinion of the nations, i.e., of a majority arranged by
our agentur. What we need is that; at the psychological moment; the
capitals should not be in a position to discuss an accomplished
fact for the simple reason, if for no other, that it has been
accepted by the public opinion of a majority in the provinces.</p>
<p>19. When we are in the period of the new regime; prior to the
transition to that of the assumption of our full sovereignty; we
must not admit any revelations by the press of any form of public
dishonesty; it is necessary that the new regime should be thought
to have so perfectly contented everybody that even criminality has
disappeared...Cases of the manifestation of criminality should
remain known only to their victims and to chance witnesses &#8211;
no more.<br/>

<h3>DISTRACTIONS</h3>
<i>Daily bread &#8211; Recreation centres &#8211; The
unsuspected plan</i>
<p>1. The need for daily bread forces the goyim to keep silence and
be our humble servants. Agents taken on to our press from among the
goyim will, at our orders, discuss anything which it is
inconvenient for us to issue directly in official documents, and we
meanwhile, quietly amid the din of the discussion so raised, shall
simply take and carry through such measures as we wish and then
offer them to the public as an accomplished fact. No one will dare
to demand the abrogation of a matter once settled, all the more so
as it will be represented as an improvement ... And immediately the
press will distract the current of thought towards, new questions,
(have we not trained people always to be seeking something new?).
Into the discussions of these new questions will throw themselves
those of the brainless dispensers of fortunes who are not able even
now to understand that they have not the remotest conception about
the matters which they undertake to discuss. Questions of the
political are unattainable for any save those who have guided it
already for many ages, the creators.</p>
<p>2. From all this you will see that, in seeming the opinion of
the mob, we are only facilitating the working of our machinery, and
you may remark that it is not for actions, but for words issued by
us on this or that question, that we seem to seek approval. We are
constantly making public declaration, that we are guided in all our
undertakings by the hope, joined to the conviction, that we are
serving the common weal.</p>
<p>3. In order to distract people who may be too troublesome, from
discussions of questions of the political, we are now putting
forward what we allege to be new questions of the political,
namely, questions of industry. In this sphere let them discuss
themselves silly! The masses are agreed to remain inactive, to take
a rest from what they suppose to be political (which we trained
them to, in order to use them as a means of combating the goy
governments) only on condition of being found new employments, in
which we are prescribing them something that looks like the same
political object. In order that the masses themselves may not guess
what they are about, we further distract them with amusements;
games; pastimes; passions; people's palaces&#8230;.Soon we shall
begin through the press to propose competitions in art; in sport of
all kinds: these interests will finally distract their minds from
questions in which we should find ourselves compelled to oppose
them. Growing more and more dis-accustomed to reflect and form any
opinions of their own, people will begin to talk in the same tone
as we, because we alone shall be offering them new directions for
thought...of course through such persons as will not be suspected
of solidarity with us.</p>
<p>4. The part played by the liberals, utopian dreamers, will be
finally played out when our government is acknowledged. Till such
time they will continue to do us good service. Therefore we shall
continue to direct their minds to all sorts of vain conceptions of
fantastic theories, new and apparently progressive: for have we not
with complete success turned the brainless heads of the goyim with
progress, till there is not among the goyim one mind able to
perceive that under this word (progress) lies a departure from
truth; in all cases where it is not a question of material
inventions; like a fallacious idea, serves to obscure truth; so
that none may know it except us, the Chosen of God*, its
guardians.</p>
<p><i>* Which they are <b>NOT</b>, but are in reality the Synagogue
of Satan, as confirmed by Christ:- <b>Revelation</b> 2:9</i>
<font color="#000080">I know thy works, and tribulation, and

<p>5. When we come into our kingdom, our orators will expound great
problems which have turned humanity upside down, in order to bring
it at the end under our beneficent rule.</p>

stage-managed by us according to a political plan which no one has
so much as guessed at in the course of many centuries?&#8230;.<br/>

<h3>ASSAULT ON RELIGION</h3>
<i>Destruction of existing religions and substitution of
the religion of Moses &#8211; A new era of slavery &#8211;
Pornography encouraged in progressive countries</i>
<p>1. When we come into our kingdom it will be undesirable for us
that there should exist any other religion than ours of the One God
with Whom our destiny is bound up by our position as the Chosen
People and through Whom our same destiny is united with the
destinies of the world. We must therefore sweep away all other
forms of belief. If this gives birth to the atheists whom we see
to-day, it will not, being only a transitional stage, interfere
with our views, but will serve as a warning for those generations
which will hearken to our preaching of the religion of Moses, that,
by its stable and thoroughly elaborated system has brought all the
peoples of the world into subjection to us. Therein we shall
emphasise its mystical right, on which, as we shall say, all its
educative power is based....Then at every possible opportunity we
shall publish articles in which we shall make comparisons between
our beneficent rule and those of past ages. The blessing of
tranquillity, though it be a tranquillity forcibly brought about by
centuries of agitation, will throw into higher relief the benefits
to which we shall point. The errors of the goyim governments will
be depicted by us in the most vivid hues. We shall implant such an
abhorrence of them that the peoples will prefer tranquillity, in a
state of serfdom, to those rights of vaunted freedom which have
tortured humanity and exhausted the very sources of human
existence, sources which have been exploited by a mob of rascally
adventurers who know not what they do....Useless changes of forms
of government, to which we instigated the goyim when we were
undermining their state structures, will have so wearied the
peoples by that time that they will prefer to suffer anything,
under us, rather than run the risk of enduring again all the same
agitations and miseries they have gone through.</p>
<p>2. At the same time we shall not omit to emphasise the
historical mistakes of the goy governments, which have tormented
humanity for so many centuries by their lack of understanding of
everything that constitutes the true good of humanity, in their
chase after fantastic schemes of social blessings, and have never
noticed that these schemes kept on producing a worse and never a
better state of the universal relations which are the basis of
human life....</p>
<p>3. The whole force of our principles and methods will lie in the
fact that we shall present them and expound them as a splendid
contrast to the dead and decomposed old order of things in social
life.</p>
<p>4. Our philosophers will discuss all the shortcomings of the
various beliefs of the goyim. But no one will ever bring under
discussion our faith from its true point of view since this will be
fully learned by none save ours, who will never dare to betray its
secrets.</p>
<p>5. In countries known as progressive and enlightened we have
created a senseless, filthy, abominable literature. For some time,
after our entrance to power, we shall continue to encourage its
existence, in order to provide a telling relief; by contrast; to
the speeches, party program, which will be distributed from exalted
quarters of ours....Our wise men, trained to become leaders of the
goyim, will compose speeches; projects; memoirs; articles; which
will be used by us to influence the minds of the goyim; directing
them towards such understanding and forms of knowledge as have been
determined by us.<br/>

<h3>RUTHLESS SUPPRESSION</h3>
<i>Simultaneous world revolution &#8211; Purpose and
direction of masonry &#8211; The Chosen People &#8211; Dogmatic
right of the strong &#8211; The King of Israel</i>
<p>1. When we at last definitely come into our kingdom by the aid
of coups d'etat prepared everywhere for one and the same day, after
being definitely acknowledged (and not a little time will pass
before that comes about, perhaps even a whole century), we shall
make it our task to see that, against us, such things as plots
shall no longer exist. With this purpose we shall slay without
mercy all who take arms (in hand) to oppose our coming into our
kingdom. Every kind of new institution of anything like a secret
society will also be punished with death; those of them which are
now in existence; are known to us; serve us and have served us; we
shall disband and send into exile to continents far removed from
Europe. In this way we shall proceed with those goy masons who know
too much; such of these as we may for some reason spare will be
kept in constant fear of exile. We shall promulgate a law making
all former members of secret societies liable to exile from Europe
as the centre of rule.</p>
<p>2. Resolutions of our government will be final, without
appeal.</p>
<p>3. In the goy societies, in which we have planted and deeply
rooted discord and protestantism, the only possible way of
restoring order is to employ merciless measures that prove the
direct force of authority: no regard must be paid to the victims
who fall, they suffer for the well-being of the future. The
attainment of that well-being, even at the expense of sacrifices,
is the duty of any kind of government that acknowledges, as
justification for its existence, not only its privileges but also
its obligations. The principal guarantee of stability of rule is to
confirm the aureole of power, and this aureole is attained only by
such a majestic inflexibility of might, as shall carry on its face
the emblems of inviolability from mystical causes &#8211; from the
choice of God. Such was, until recent times, the Russian autocracy,
the one and only serious foe we had in the world, without counting
the Papacy. Bear in mind the example when Italy, drenched with
blood, never touched a hair of the head of Sulla who had poured
forth that blood: Sulla enjoyed an apotheosis for his might in him,
but his intrepid return to Italy ringed him round with
inviolability. The people do not lay a finger on him who hypnotises
them by his daring and strength of mind.</p>
<p>4. Meantime, however, until we come into our kingdom, we shall
act in the contrary way: we shall create and multiply free masonic
lodges in all the countries of the world, absorb into them all who
may become or who are prominent in public activity, for these
lodges we shall find our principal intelligence office and means of
influence. All these lodges we shall bring under one central
administration, known to us alone and to all others absolutely
unknown, which will be composed of our learned elders. The lodges
will have their representatives who will serve to screen the
above-mentioned administration of masonry and from whom will issue
the watchword and program. In these lodges we shall tie together
the knot which binds together all revolutionary and liberal
elements. Their composition will be made up of all strata of
society. The most secret political plots will be known to us and
fall under our guiding hands on the very day of their conception.
Among the members of these lodges will be almost all the agents of
international and national police, since their service is, for us,
irreplaceable, in the respect that the police is in a position not
only to use its own particular measures with the insubordinate, but
also to screen our activities and provide pretexts for discontents,
et cetera.</p>
<p>5. The class of people who most willingly enter into secret
societies are those who live by their wits, careerists, and in
general, people; mostly light-minded; with whom we shall have no
difficulty in dealing and in using to wind-up the mechanism of the
machine devised by us. If this world grows agitated, the meaning of
that will be, that which we have had to stir-up in order to break
up its too great solidarity. But if there should arise in its midst
a plot, then at the head of that plot will be no other than one of
our most trusted servants. It is natural that we and no other
should lead masonic activities, for we know whither we are leading;
we know the final goal of every form of activity; whereas the goyim
have knowledge of nothing, not even of the immediate effect of
action they put before themselves; usually, the momentary reckoning
of the satisfaction of their self-opinion, in the accomplishment of
their thought; without even remarking that the very conception
never belonged to their initiative, but to our instigation of their
thought....</p>
<p>6. The goyim enter the lodges out of curiosity, or in the hope
by their means to get a nibble at the public pie, and some of them
in order to obtain a hearing before the public for their
impracticable and groundless fantasies: they thirst for the emotion
of success and applause, of which we are remarkably generous. And
the reason why we give them this success is to make use of the high
conceit of themselves to which it gives birth, for that insensibly
disposes them to assimilate our suggestions; without being on their
guard against them; in the fullness of their confidence that it is
their own infallibility which is giving utterance to their own
thoughts and that it is impossible for them to borrow those of
others....You cannot imagine to what extent the wisest of the goyim
can be brought to a state of unconscious naivete in the presence of
this condition of high conceit of themselves, and at the same time
how easy it is to take the heart out of them by the slightest
ill-success, though it be nothing more than the stoppage of the
applause they had, and to reduce them to a slavish submission for
the sake of winning a renewal of success....By so much as ours
disregard success, if only they can carry through their plans: by
so much the goyim are willing to sacrifice any plans only to have
success. This psychology of theirs materially facilitates for us
the task of setting them in the required direction (Matthew 6:24).
These tigers in appearance have the souls of sheep and the wind
blows freely through their heads. We have set them on the
hobby-horse of an idea about the absorption of individuality by the
symbolic unit of collectivism....They have never yet and they never
will have the sense to reflect that this hobby-horse is a manifest
violation of the most important law of nature, which has
established from the very creation of the world one unit unlike
another and precisely for the purpose of instituting
individuality....</p>
<p>7. If we have been able to bring them to such a pitch of stupid
blindness is it not a proof, and an amazingly clear proof, of the
degree to which the mind of the goyim is undeveloped in comparison
with our mind? This it is, mainly, which guarantees our
success.</p>
<p>8. And how far-seeing were our learned elders in ancient times,
when they said, that to attain a serious end, it behoves not to
stop at any means or to count the victims sacrificed for the sake
of that end....We have not counted the victims of the seed of the
goy cattle, though we have sacrificed many of our own, but for that
we have now already given them such a position on the Earth as they
could not even have dreamed of. The comparatively small numbers of
the victims, from the number of ours, have preserved our
nationality from destruction.</p>
<p>9. Death is the inevitable end for all. It is better to bring
that end nearer to those who hinder our affairs than to ourselves,
to the founders of this affair. We execute masons in such wise that
none save the brotherhood can ever have a suspicion of it, not even
the victims themselves of our death-sentence, they all die when
required, as if from a normal kind of illness.....Knowing this,
even the brotherhood in its turn dare not protest. By such methods
we have plucked out of the midst of masonry the very root of
protest against our disposition. While preaching liberalism to the
goy we at the same time keep our own people and our agents in a
state of unquestioning submission.</p>
<p>10. Under our influence the execution of the laws of the goyim
has been reduced to a minimum. The prestige of the law has been
exploded by the liberal interpretations introduced into this
sphere. In the most important and fundamental affairs and
questions, judges decide as we dictate to them; see matters in the
light wherewith we enfold them for the administration of the goyim,
of course, through persons who are our tools, though we do not
appear to have anything in common with them &#8211; by newspaper
opinion or by other means....Even senators and the higher
administration accept our counsels. The purely brute mind of the
goyim is incapable of use for analysis and observation, and still
more for the foreseeing whither a certain manner of setting a
question may tend.</p>
<p>11. In this difference, in capacity for thought, between the
goyim and ourselves, may be clearly discerned the seal of our
position as the Chosen People and of our higher quality of
humanness, in contradistinction to the brute mind of the goyim.
Their eyes are open, but see nothing before them (Isaiah 42:16-25)
and do not invent (unless perhaps, material things). From this it
is plain that nature herself has destined us to guide and rule the
world (Matthew 23:23-38).</p>
<p>12. When comes the time of our overt rule, the time to manifest
its blessing, we shall remake all legislatures, all our laws will
be brief, plain, stable, without any kind of interpretations, so
that anyone will be in a position to know them perfectly. The main
feature which will run right through them is submission to orders,
and this principle will be carried to a grandiose height. Every
abuse will then disappear in consequence of the responsibility of
all down to the lowest unit before the higher authority of the
representative of power. Abuses of power subordinate to this last
instance will be so mercilessly punished that none will be found
anxious to try experiments with their own powers. We shall follow
up jealously every action of the administration on which depends
the smooth running of the machinery of the State, for slackness in
this produces slackness everywhere; not a single case of illegality
or abuse of power will be left without exemplary punishment.</p>
<p>13. Concealment of guilt, connivance between those in the
service of the administration &#8211; all this kind of evil will
disappear after the very first examples of severe punishment. The
aureole of our power demands suitable, that is, cruel, punishments
for the slightest infringement, for the sake of gain, of its
supreme prestige. The sufferer, though his punishment may exceed
his fault, will count as a soldier falling on the administrative
field of battle, in the interest of authority; principle and law,
which do not permit that any of those who hold the reins of the
public coach should turn aside from the public highway to their own
private paths. For example: our judges will know that whenever they
feel disposed to plume themselves, on foolish clemency, they are
violating the law of justice which is instituted for the exemplary
edification of men by penalties for lapse and not for display of
the spiritual qualities of the judge....Such qualities it is proper
to show in private life, but not in a public square which is the
educational basis of human life.</p>
<p>14. Our legal staff will serve not beyond the age of 55, firstly
because old men more obstinately hold to prejudiced opinions, and
are less capable of submitting to new directions, and secondly
because this will give us the possibility by this measure of
securing elasticity in the changing of staff, which will thus the
more easily bend under our pressure: he who wishes to keep his
place will have to give blind obedience to deserve it. In general,
our judges will be elected by us only from among those who
thoroughly understand that the part they have to play is to punish
and apply laws and not to dream about the manifestations of
liberalism, at the expense of the educational scheme of the State,
as the goyim in these days imagine it to be....This method of
shuffling the staff will serve also to explode any collective
solidarity of those in the same service and will bind all to the
interests of the government upon which their fate will depend. The
young generation of judges will be trained in certain views,
regarding the inadmissibility of any abuses that might disturb the
established order of our subjects among themselves.</p>
<p>15. In these days the judges of the goyim create indulgences to
every kind of crimes: not having a just understanding of their
office, because the rulers of the present age, in appointing judges
to office, take no care to inculcate in them a sense of duty and
consciousness of the matter which is demanded of them. As a brute
beast lets out its young in search of prey, so do the goyim give to
them for what purpose such place was created. This is the reason
why their governments are being ruined, by their own forces,
through the acts of their own administration.</p>
<p>16. Let us borrow from the example of the results of these
actions yet another lesson for our government.</p>
<p>17. We shall root out liberalism from all the important
strategic posts of our government on which depends the training of
subordinates for our State structure. Such posts will fall
exclusively to those who have been trained by us for administrative
rule. To the possible objection that the retirement of old servants
will cost the Treasury heavily, I reply, firstly, they will be
provided with some private service, in place of what they lose,
and, secondly, I have to remark that all the money in the world
will be concentrated in our hands, consequently it is not our
government that has to fear expense.</p>
<p>18. Our absolutism will, in all things, be logically consecutive
and therefore, in each one of its decrees, our supreme will be
respected and unquestionably fulfilled: it will ignore all murmurs,
all discontents of every kind and will destroy, to the root, every
kind of manifestation of them in act, by punishment of an exemplary
character.</p>
<p>19. We shall abolish the right of cessation, which will be
transferred exclusively to our disposal &#8211; to the cognisance
of him who rules, for we must not allow the conception, among the
people, of a thought that there could be such a thing as a
decision, of judges set up by us, that is not right. If, however,
anything like this should occur, we shall ourselves cassate (quash)
the decision, but inflict therewith such exemplary punishment on
the judge; for lack of understanding of his duty and the purpose of
his appointment; as will prevent a repetition of such cases....I
repeat that it must be born in mind that we shall know every step
of our administration, which only needs to be closely watched for
the people to be content with us, for it has the right to demand;
from a good government; a good official.</p>
<p>20. Our government will have the appearance of a patriarchal
paternal guardianship on the part of the ruler. Our own nation and
our subjects will discern in his person a father caring for their
every need; their every act; their every inter-relation as subjects
one with another, as well as their relations to the ruler. They
will then be so thoroughly imbued with the thought that it is
impossible for them to dispense with this wardship and guidance; if
they wish to live in peace and quiet; that they will acknowledge
the autocracy of our ruler, with a devotion bordering on
Apotheosis, especially when they are convinced that those whom we
set up do not put their own in place of authority, but only blindly
execute his dictates. They will be rejoiced that we have regulated
everything in their lives, as is done by wise parents who desire to
train children in the cause of duty and submission. For the peoples
of the world, in regard to the secrets of our polity, are ever,
through the ages, only children under age, precisely as are also
their governments.</p>
<p>21. As you see, I found our despotism on right and duty: the
right to compel the execution of duty is the direct obligation of a
government which is a father for its subjects. It has the right of
the strong that it may use it for the benefit of directing humanity
towards that order which is defined by nature, namely, submission.
Everything in the world is in a state of submission, if not to man,
then to circumstances or its own inner character, in all cases, to
what is stronger. And so shall we be this something stronger for
the sake of good.</p>
<p>22. We are obliged without hesitation to sacrifice individuals,
who commit a breach of established order, for in the exemplary
punishment of evil lies a great educational problem.</p>
<p>23. When the King of Israel sets upon his sacred head the crown
offered him by Europe he will become patriarch of the world. The
indispensable victims offered by him in consequence of their
suitability will never reach the number of victims offered in the
course of centuries by the mania of magnificence, the emulation
between the goy governments.</p>
<p>24. Our King will be in constant communion with the peoples,
making to them, from the tribune, speeches which fame will in that
same hour distribute over all the world.<br/>

PROTOCOL 16
<h3>BRAINWASHING</h3>
<i>Emasculation of the Universities &#8211; Abolition of
freedom of instruction</i>
<p>1. In order to effect the destruction of all collective forces,
except ours, we shall emasculate the first stage of collectivism
&#8211; the universities, by re-educating them in a new direction.
Their officials and professors will be prepared for their business
by detailed secret programmes of action from which they will not
with immunity diverge, not by one iota. They will be appointed with
especial precaution, and will be so placed as to be wholly
dependent on the Government.</p>
<p>2. We shall exclude, from the course of instruction, State Law,
as also all that concerns the political question. These subjects
will be taught to a few dozen of persons chosen for their
pre-eminent capacities from among the number of the initiated. The
universities must no longer send out from their halls, milk sops;
concocting plans for a constitution, like a comedy or a tragedy;
busying themselves with questions of policy, in which even their
own fathers never had any power of thought.</p>
<p>3. The ill-guided acquaintance of a large number of persons with
questions of polity, creates utopian dreamers and bad subjects, as
you can see for yourselves from the example of the universal
education; in this direction; of the goyim. We must introduce into
their education all those principles which have so brilliantly
broken up their order. But when we are in power we shall remove
every kind of disturbing subject from the course of education and
shall make, out of the youth, obedient children of authority,
loving him who rules as the support and hope of peace and
quiet.</p>
<p>4. Classicism, as also any form of study of ancient history, in
which there are more bad than good examples, we shall replace with
the study of the program of the future. We shall erase from the
memory of men all facts of previous centuries which are undesirable
to us, and leave only those which depict all the errors of the
government of the goyim. The study of practical life; of the
obligations of order; of the relations of people one to another; of
avoiding bad and selfish examples, which spread the infection of
evil, and similar questions of an educative nature, will stand in
the forefront of the teaching program; which will be drawn up on a
separate plan for each calling or state of life; in no wise
generalising the teaching. This treatment of the question has
special importance.</p>
<p>5. Each state of life must be trained within strict limits,
corresponding to its destination and work in life. The occasional
genius has always managed and will always manage to slip through
into other states of life, but it is the most perfect folly; for
the sake of this rare occasional genius; to let through, into ranks
foreign to them, the untalented who thus rob of their places those
who belong to those ranks by birth or employment. You know
yourselves in what all this has ended for the goyim who allowed
this crying absurdity.</p>
<p>6. In order that he who rules may be seated firmly in the hearts
and minds of his subjects, it is necessary, for the time of his
activity, to instruct the whole nation, in the schools and on the
market places, about this meaning and his acts and all his
beneficent initiatives.</p>
<p>7. We shall abolish every kind of freedom of instruction.
Learners of all ages have the right to assemble together, with
their parents, in the educational establishments, as it were in a
club: during these assemblies, on holidays, teachers will read what
will pass as free lectures on questions of human relations; of the
laws of examples; of the philosophy of new theories not yet
declared to the world. These theories will be raised by us to the
stage of a dogma of faith, as a traditional stage towards our
faith. On the completion of this exposition of our program of
action, in the present and the future, I will read you the
principles of these theories.</p>
<p>8. In a word, knowing, by the experience of many centuries, that
people live and are guided by ideas; that these ideas are imbibed
by people only by the aid of education, provided with equal success
for all ages of growth; but of course, by varying methods; we shall
swallow up and confiscate to our own use, the last scintilla of
independence of thought, which we have; for long past; been
directing towards subjects and ideas useful for us. The system of
bridling thought is already at work in the so-called system of
teaching by object lessons, the purpose of which is to turn the
goyim into unthinking submissive brutes, waiting for things to be
presented before their eyes in order to form an idea of them....In
France, one of our best agents, Bourgeois, has already made public
a new program of teaching by object lessons.<br/>

<h3>ABUSE OF AUTHORITY</h3>
<i>The demoralisation of Justice &#8211; Wrecking of the
Christian religion &#8211; Jewish Patriarch Pope of the universe
&#8211; Secret police employing public informers</i>
<p>1. The practice of advocacy produces men cold; cruel;
persistent; unprincipled; who in all cases take up an impersonal,
purely legal standpoint. They have the inveterate habit to refer
everything to its value for the defence and not to the public
welfare of its results. They do not usually decline to undertake
any defence whatever, they strive for an acquittal at all costs,
cavilling over every petty crux of jurisprudence and thereby they
demoralise justice. For this reason we shall set this profession
into narrow frames which will keep it inside this sphere of
executive public service. Advocates, equally with judges, will be
deprived of the right of communication with litigant; they will
receive business only from the court and will study it by notes of
report and documents, defending their clients after they have been
interrogated in court on facts that have appeared. They will
receive an honorarium without regard to the quality of the defence.
This will render them mere reporters on law-business in the
interests of justice and as counterpoise to the proctor who will be
the reporter in the interests of prosecution; this will shorten
business before the courts. In this way will be established a
practice of honest unprejudiced defence conducted not from personal
interest but by conviction. This will also, by the way, remove the
present practice of corrupt bargain between advocates to agree only
to let that side win which pays most....</p>
<p>2. We have long past taken care to discredit the priesthood of
goyim, and thereby to ruin their mission on Earth which in these
days might still be a great hindrance to us. Day by day its
influence on the peoples of the world is falling lower. Freedom of
conscience has been declared everywhere, so that now only years
divide us from the moment of the complete wrecking of that
Christian religion: as to other religions we shall have still less
difficulty in dealing with them, but it would be premature to speak
of this now. We shall act clericalism and clericals into such
narrow frames as to make their influence move in retrogressive
proportion to its former progress.</p>
<p>3. When the time comes finally to destroy the papal court the
finger of an invisible hand will point the nations towards this
court. When, however, the nations fling themselves upon it, we
shall come forward in the guise of its defenders as if to save
excessive bloodshed. By this diversion we shall penetrate to its
very bowels and be sure we shall never come out again until we have
gnawed through the entire strength of this place.</p>
<p>4. The King of the Jews will be the real <a href="http://jahtruth.net/darth.htm">Pope</a> of the Universe, the patriarch
of the international Church.</p>
<p>5. But, in the meantime, while we are re-educating youth in new
traditional religions and afterwards in ours, we shall not overtly
lay a finger on existing churches, but we shall fight against them
by criticism calculated to produce schism&#8230;.</p>
<p>6. In general, then, our contemporary press will continue to
criticise State affairs; religions; incapacities of the goyim;
always using the most unprincipled expressions in order, by every
means, to lower their prestige in the manner which can only be
practised by the genius of our gifted tribe....</p>
<p>7. Our kingdom will be an apologia of the divinity Vishnu, in
whom is found its personification &#8211; in our hundred hands will
be, one in each, the springs of the machinery of social life. We
shall see everything without the aid of official police which, in
that scope of its rights which we elaborated for the use of the
goyim, hinders governments from seeing. In our programs one-third
of our subjects will keep the rest under observation from a sense
of duty, on the principle of volunteer service to the State. It
will then be no disgrace to be a spy and informer, but a merit:
unfounded denunciations, however, will be cruelly punished so that
there may be no development of abuses of this right.</p>
<p>8. Our agents will be taken from the higher as well as the lower
ranks of society, from among the administrative class who spend
their time in amusements; editors; printers and publishers;
booksellers; clerks and salesmen; workmen; coachmen; lackeys; et
cetera. This body, having no rights and not being empowered to take
any action on their own account, and consequently a police without
any power, will only witness and report: verification of their
reports and arrests will depend upon a responsible group of
controllers of police affairs, while the actual act of arrest will
be performed by the gendarmerie and the municipal police. Any
person not denouncing anything seen or heard concerning questions
of polity will also be charged with and made responsible for
concealment, if it be proved that he is guilty of this crime.</p>
<p>9. Just as nowadays our brethren are obliged, at their own risk,
to denounce to the kabal; apostates of their own family, or members
who have been noticed doing anything in opposition to the kabal;
so, in our kingdom over all the world, it will be obligatory for
all our subjects to observe the duty of service to the State in
this direction.</p>
<p>10. Such an organisation will extirpate abuses of authority; of
force; of bribery; everything in fact which we, by our counsels; by
our theories of the superhuman rights of man; have introduced into
the customs of the goyim....But how else were we to procure that
increase of causes predisposing to disorders in the midst of their
administration?....Among the number of those methods, one of the
most important is &#8211; agents for the restoration of order, so
placed as to have the opportunity, in their disintegrating
activity, of developing and displaying their evil inclinations
&#8211; obstinate self-conceit, irresponsible exercise of
authority, and, first and foremost, venality.<br/>

<h3>ARREST OF OPPONENTS</h3>
<i>Measures of secret defence &#8211; Undermining
authority</i>
<p>1. When it becomes necessary for us to strengthen the strict
measures of secret defence (the most fatal poison for the prestige
of authority) we shall arrange a simulation of disorders, or some
manifestation of discontents finding expression through the
co-operation of good speakers. Round these speakers will assemble
all who are sympathetic to his utterances. This will give us the
pretext for domiciliary perquisitions (diligent searches) and
surveillance on the part of our servants from among the number of
the goyim police....</p>
<p>2. As the majority of conspirators act of love for the game, for
the sake of talking, so, until they commit some overt act we shall
not lay a finger on them, but only introduce into their midst
observation elements....It must be remembered that the prestige of
authority is lessened if it frequently discovers conspiracies
against itself: this implies a presumption of consciousness of
weakness, or, what is still worse, of injustice. You are aware that
we have broken the prestige of the goy kings by frequent attempts
upon their lives through our agents, blind sheep of our flock, who
are easily moved by a few liberal phrases, to crimes, provided only
they be painted in political colours. We have compelled the rulers
to acknowledge their weakness in advertising overt measures of
secret defence and thereby we shall bring the promise of authority
to destruction.</p>
<p>3. Our ruler will be secretly protected only by the most
insignificant guard, because we shall not admit so much as a
thought that there could exist, against him, any sedition with
which he is not strong enough to contend and is compelled to hide
from it.</p>
<p>4. If we should admit this thought, as the goyim have done and
are doing, we should ipso facto be signing a death-sentence, if not
for our ruler, at any rate for his dynasty, at no distant date.</p>
<p>5. According to strictly enforced outward appearances our ruler
will employ his power only for the advantage of the nation and in
no wise for his own or dynastic profits. Therefore, with the
observance of this decorum, his authority will be respected and
guarded by the subjects themselves, it will receive an apotheosis
in the admission that with it is bound up the well-being of every
citizen of the State, for upon it will depend all order in the
common life of the pack....</p>
<p>6. Overt defence of this kind argues weakness in the
organisation of his strength.</p>
<p>7. Our ruler will always be among the people and be surrounded
by a mob of apparently curious men and women, who will occupy the
front ranks about him, to all appearance by chance, and will
restrain the ranks of the rest, out of respect, as it will appear
for good order. This will sow an example of restraint also in
others. If a petitioner appears among the people trying to hand a
petition and forcing his way through the ranks, the first ranks
must receive the petition and before the eyes of the petitioner
pass it to the ruler, so that all may know that what is handed-in
reaches its destination, that consequently, there exists a control
of the ruler himself. The aureole of power requires for is
existence that the people may be able to say: "If the king knew of
this," or: "the king will hear it."</p>
<p>8. With the establishment of official defence, the mystical
prestige of authority disappears: given a certain audacity, and
everyone counts himself master of it, the sedition-monger is
conscious of his strength, and, when occasion serves, watches for
the moment to make an attempt upon authority....For the goyim we
have been preaching something else, but by that very fact we are
enabled to see what measures of overt defence have brought them
to....</p>
<p>9. Criminals with us will be arrested at the first, more or
less, well-grounded suspicion: it cannot be allowed that, out of
fear of a possible mistake, an opportunity should be given of
escape to persons suspected of a political lapse of crime, for, in
these matters, we shall be literally merciless. If it is still
possible, by stretching a point, to admit a reconsideration of the
motive causes in simple crimes, there is no possibility of excuse
for persons occupying themselves with questions in which nobody,
except the government, can understand anything....And it is not all
governments that understand true policy.<br/>

<h3>RULERS AND PEOPLE</h3>
<i>Making use of public petitions &#8211; debasing heroism
&#8211; Martyrdom of sedition-mongers</i>
<p>1. If we do not permit any independent dabbling in the
political, we shall on the other hand encourage every kind of
report or petition with proposals for the government, to examine
into all kinds of projects for the amelioration of the condition of
the people; this will reveal to us the defects or else the
fantasies of our subjects, to which we shall respond either by
accomplishing them or by wisely rebutting them to prove the
short-sightedness of one who judges wrongly.</p>
<p>2. Sedition-mongering is nothing more than the yapping of a
lap-dog at an elephant. For a government well organised, not from
the police but from the public point of view, the lap-dog yaps at
the elephant in entire unconsciousness of its strength and
importance. It needs no more than to take a good example to show
the relative importance of both and the lap-dogs will cease to yap
and will wag their tails the moment they set eyes on an
elephant.</p>
<p>3. In order to destroy the prestige of heroism, for political
crime, we shall send it for trial in the category of thieving,
murder, and every kind of abominable and filthy crime. Public
opinion will then confuse; in its conception of this category of
crime; with the disgrace attaching to every other and will brand it
with the same contempt.</p>
<p>4. We have done our best, and I hope we have succeeded, to
obtain that the goyim should not arrive at this means of contending
with sedition. It was for this reason that through the Press and in
speeches, indirectly &#8211; in cleverly-compiled school-books on
history, we have advertised the martyrdom alleged to have been
accredited by sedition-mongers for the idea of the commonweal. This
advertisement has increased the contingent of liberals and has
brought thousands of goyim into the ranks of our livestock
cattle.<br/>

<h3>FINANCIAL PROGRAMME</h3>
<i>Progressive taxation &#8211; Stagnant capital &#8211;
the ruinous Gold Standard</i>
<p>1. To-day we shall touch upon the financial program, which I put
off to the end of my report as being the most difficult, the
crowning and the decisive point of our plans. Before entering upon
it I will remind you that I have already spoken before, by way of a
hint, when I said that the sum total of our actions is settled by
the question of figures.</p>
<p>2. When we come into our kingdom our autocratic government will
avoid, from a principle of self-preservation, sensibly burdening
the masses of the people with taxes, remembering that it (the
government) plays the part of father and protector. But as State
organisation costs dear it is necessary nevertheless to obtain the
funds required for it. I will, therefore, elaborate with particular
precaution the question of equilibrium in this matter.</p>
<p>3. Our rule, in which the king will enjoy the legal fiction that
everything in his State belongs to him (which may easily be
translated into fact), will be enabled to resort to the lawful
confiscation of all sums, of every kind, for the regulation of
their circulation in the State. From this follows that taxation
will best be covered by a progressive tax on property. In this
manner the dues will be paid; without straitening or ruining
anybody; in the form of a percentage of the amount of property. The
rich must be aware that it is their duty to place a part of their
superfluities at the disposal of the State, since the State
guarantees them security of possession of the rest of their
property and the right of honest gains, I say honest, for the
control over property will do away with robbery on a legal
basis.</p>
<p>4. This social reform must come from above, for the time is ripe
for it &#8211; it is indispensable as a pledge of peace.</p>
<p>5. The tax upon the poor man is a seed of revolution and works
to the detriment of the State which in hunting after the trifling
is missing the big. Quite apart from this, a tax on capitalists
diminishes the growth of wealth in private hands, in which we have
in these days concentrated it, as a counterpoise to the government
strength of the goyim &#8211; their State finances.</p>
<p>6. A tax increasing in a percentage ratio to capital will give
much larger revenue than the present individual or property tax,
which is useful to us now for the sole reason that it excites
trouble and discontent among the goyim. (Now we know the purpose of
the U.S. 16th Amendment!!).</p>
<p>7. The force, upon which our king will rest, consists in the
equilibrium and the guarantee of peace, for the sake of which
things it is indispensable that the capitalists should yield up a
portion of their incomes, for the sake of the secure working of the
machinery of the State. State needs must be paid by those who will
not feel the burden and have enough to take from.</p>
<p>8. Such a measure will destroy the hatred of the poor man for
the rich, in whom he will see a necessary financial support for the
State; will see in him the organiser of peace and well-being, since
he will see that it is the rich man who is paying the necessary
means to attain these things.</p>
<p>9. In order that payers of the educated classes should not too
much distress themselves over the new payments, they will have full
accounts given them of the destination of those payments, with the
exception of such sums as will be appropriated for the needs of the
throne and the administrative institutions.</p>
<p>10. He who reigns will not have any properties of his own, once
all in the State represents his patrimony, or else the one would be
in contradiction to the other; the fact of holding private means
would destroy the right of property in the common possessions of
all.</p>
<p>11. Relatives of him who reigns, his heirs excepted, who will be
maintained by the resources of the State, must enter the ranks of
servants of the State or must work to obtain the right to property;
the privilege of royal blood must not serve for the spoiling of the
treasury.</p>
<p>12. Purchase, receipt of money or inheritance will be subject to
the payment of a stamp progressive tax. Any transfer of property,
whether money or other, without evidence of payment of this tax,
which will be strictly registered by names, will render the former
holder liable to pay interest on the tax, from the moment of
transfer of these sums, up to the discovery of his evasion of
declaration of the transfer. Transfer documents must be presented
weekly at the local treasury office, with notifications of the
name, surname and permanent place of residence of the former and
the new holder of the property. This transfer with register of
names must begin from a definite sum which exceeds the ordinary
expenses of buying and selling necessaries, and these will be
subject to payment only by a stamp impost of a definite percentage
of the unit.</p>
<p>13. Just strike an estimate of how many times such taxes as
these will cover the revenue of the goyim States.</p>
<p>14. The State exchequer will have to maintain a definite
complement of reserve sums, and all that is collected above that
complement must be returned into circulation. On these sums will be
organised public works. The initiative in works of this kind,
proceeding from State sources, will blind the working class firmly
to the interests of the State and to those who reign. From these
same sums also a part will be set aside as rewards of inventiveness
and productiveness.</p>
<p>15. On no account should so much as a single unit above the
definite and freely estimated sums be retained in the State
Treasuries, for money exists to be circulated and any kind of
stagnation of money acts ruinously on the running of the State
machinery, for which it is the lubricant; a stagnation of the
lubricant may stop the regular working of the mechanism.</p>
<p>16. The substitution of interest-bearing paper for a part of the
token of exchange has produced exactly this stagnation. The
consequences of this circumstance are already sufficiently
noticeable.</p>
<p>17. A court of account will also be instituted by us, and in it
the ruler will find at any moment a full accounting for State
income and expenditure, with the exception of the current monthly
account, not yet made up, and that of the preceding month, which
will not yet have been delivered.</p>
<p>18. The one and only person who will have no interest in robbing
the State is its owner, the ruler. This is why his personal control
will remove the possibility of leakages of extravagances.</p>
<p>19. The representative function of the ruler, at receptions, for
the sake of etiquette, which absorbs so much invaluable time, will
be abolished in order that the ruler may have time for control and
consideration. His power will not then be split up into fractional
parts among time-serving favourites who surround the throne for its
pomp and splendour, and are interested only in their own and not in
the common interests of the State.</p>
<p>20. Economic crises have been produced by us for the goyim by no
other means than the withdrawal of money from circulation. Huge
capitals have stagnated, withdrawing money from States, which were
constantly obliged to apply to those same stagnant capitals for
loans. These loans burdened the finances of the State with the
payment of interest and made them the bond slaves of these
capitals....The concentration of industry in the hands of
capitalists out of the hands of small masters has drained away all
the juices of the peoples and with them also the States.&#8230;</p>
<p>21. The present issue of money in general does not correspond
with the requirements per head, and cannot therefore satisfy all
the needs of the workers. The issue of money ought to correspond
with the growth of population and thereby children also must
absolutely be reckoned as consumers of currency from the day of
their birth. The revision of issue is a material question for the
whole world.</p>
<p>22. You are aware that the gold standard has been the ruin of
the States which adopted it, for it has not been able to satisfy
the demands for money, the more so that we have removed gold from
circulation as possible.</p>
<p>23. With us the standard that must be introduced is the cost of
working-man power, whether it be reckoned in paper or in wood. We
shall make the issue of money in accordance with the normal
requirements of each subject, adding to the quantity with every
birth and subtracting with every death.</p>
<p>24. The accounts will be managed by each department (the French
administrative division), each circle.</p>
<p>25. In order that there may be no delays in the paying out of
money for State needs the sums and terms of such payments will be
fixed by decree of the ruler; this will do away with the protection
by a ministry of one institution to the detriment of others.</p>
<p>26. The budgets of income and expenditure will be carried out
side by side that they may not be obscured by distance one to
another.</p>
<p>27. The reforms projected by us in the financial institutions
and principles of the goyim will be clothed by us in such forms as
will alarm nobody. We shall point out the necessity of reforms in
consequence of the disorderly darkness into which the goyim by
their irregularities have plunged the finances. The first
irregularity, as we shall point out, consists in their beginning
with drawing up a single budget which year after year grows owing
to the following cause: this budget is dragged out to half the
year, then they demand a budget to put things right, and this they
expend in three months, after which they ask for a supplementary
budget, and all this ends with a liquidation budget. But, as the
budget of the following year is drawn up in accordance with the sum
of the total addition, the annual departure from the normal reaches
as much as 50 per cent in a year, and so the annual budget is
trebled in ten years. Thanks to such methods, allowed by the
carelessness of the goy States, their treasuries are empty. The
period of loans supervenes, and that has swallowed up remainders
and brought all the goy States to bankruptcy.</p>
<p>28. You understand perfectly that economic arrangements of this
kind, which have been suggested to the goyim by us, cannot be
carried on by us.</p>
<p>29. Every kind of loan proves infirmity in the State and a want
of understanding of the rights of the State. Loans hang like a
sword of Damocles over the heads of rulers, who, instead of taking
from their subjects by a temporary tax, come begging with
outstretched palm of our bankers. Foreign loans are leeches which
there is no possibility of removing from the body of the State,
until they fall off of themselves, or the State flings them off.
But the goy States do not tear them off; they go on in persisting
in putting more on to themselves so that they must inevitably
perish, drained by voluntary blood-letting.</p>
<p>30. What also indeed is, in substance, a loan, especially a
foreign loan? A loan is &#8211; an issue of government bills of
exchange containing a percentage obligation commensurate to the sum
of the loan capital. If the loan bears a charge of 5 per cent, then
in twenty years the State vainly pays away in interest a sum equal
to the loan borrowed, in forty years it is paying a double sum, in
sixty &#8211; treble, and all the while the debt remains an unpaid
debt.</p>
<p>31. From this calculation it is obvious that, with any form of
taxation per head, the State is baling out the last coppers of the
poor taxpayers in order to settle accounts with wealthy foreigners,
from whom it has borrowed money, instead of collecting these
coppers for its own needs without the additional interest.</p>
<p>32. So long as loans were internal the goyim only shuffled their
money from the pockets of the poor to those of the rich, but when
we bought up the necessary person in order to transfer loans into
the external sphere, all the wealth of States flowed into our
cash-boxes and all the goyim began to pay us the tribute of
subjects.</p>
<p>33. If the superficiality of goy kings on their thrones in
regard to State affairs and the venality of ministers, or the want
of understanding of financial matters on the part of other ruling
persons, have made their countries debtors to our treasuries, to
amounts quite impossible to pay, it has not been accomplished
without, on our part, heavy expenditure of trouble and money.</p>
<p>34. Stagnation of money will not be allowed by us and therefore
there will be no State interest-bearing paper, except a one
per-cent series, so that there will be no payment of interest to
leeches that suck all the strength out of the State. The right to
issue interest-bearing paper will be given exclusively to
industrial companies who will find no difficulty in paying interest
out of profits, whereas the State does not make interest on
borrowed money like these companies, for the State borrows to spend
and not to use in operations.</p>
<p>35. Industrial papers will be bought also by the government,
which from being, as now, a paper of tribute by loan operations,
will be transformed into a lender of money at a profit. This
measure will stop the stagnation of money, parasitic profits and
idleness, all of which were useful for us among the goyim so long
as they were independent but are not desirable under our rule.</p>
<p>36. How clear is the undeveloped power of thought of the purely
brute brains of the goyim, as expressed in the fact that they have
been borrowing from us, with payment of interest, without ever
thinking that all the same these very moneys, plus an addition for
payment of interest, must be got by them from their own State
pockets in order to settle up with us. What could have been simpler
than to take the money they wanted from their own people?</p>
<p>37. But it is a proof of the genius of our chosen mind that we
have contrived to present the matter of loans to them in such a
light that they have even seen in them an advantage for
themselves.</p>
<p>38. Our accounts, which we shall present when the time comes, in
the light of centuries of experience gained by experiments made by
us on the goy States, will be distinguished by clearness and
definiteness and will show at a glance to all men the advantage of
our innovations. They will put an end to those abuses to which we
owe our mastery over the goyim, but which cannot be allowed in our
kingdom.</p>
<p>39. We shall so hedge about our system of accounting that
neither the ruler nor the most insignificant public servant will be
in a position to divert even the smallest sum from its destination
without detection or to direct it in another direction except that
which will be once fixed in a definite plan of action.</p>
<p>40. And without a definite plan it is impossible to rule.
Marching along an undetermined road and with undetermined resources
brings to ruin by the way heroes and demi-gods.</p>
<p>41. The goy rulers, whom we once upon a time advised should be
distracted from State occupations by representative receptions,
observances of etiquette, entertainments, were only screens for our
rule. The accounts of favourite courtiers who replaced them in the
sphere of affairs were drawn up for them by our agents, and every
time gave satisfaction to short-sighted minds by promises that in
the future economics and improvements were foreseen....Economics
from what? From new taxes? &#8211; were questions that might have
been but were not asked by those who read our accounts and
projects.</p>
<p>42. You know to what they have been brought by this
carelessness, to what pitch of financial disorder they have
arrived, notwithstanding the astonishing industry of their
peoples....<br/>

PROTOCOL 21
<h3>LOANS AND CREDIT</h3>
<i>Bankruptcy &#8211; Abolition of money
markets</i>
<p>1. To what I reported to you at the last meeting I shall now add
a detailed explanation of internal loans. Of foreign loans I shall
say nothing more, because they have fed us with national moneys of
the goyim, but for our State there will be no foreigners, that is,
nothing external.</p>
<p>2. We have taken advantage of the venality of administrators and
slackness of rulers to get our moneys twice, thrice and more times
over, by lending to the goy governments moneys which were not at
all needed by the States. Could anyone do the like in regard to
us....Therefore, I shall only deal with the details of internal
loans.</p>
<p>3. States announce that such a loan is to be concluded and open
subscriptions for their own bills of exchange, that is, for their
interest-bearing paper. That they may be within the reach of all
the price is determined at from a hundred to a thousand; and a
discount is made for the earliest subscribers. Next day by
artificial means the price of them goes up, the alleged reason
being that everyone is rushing to buy them. In a few days the
treasury safes are as they say overflowing and there's more money
than they can do with (why then take it?). The subscription, it is
alleged, covers many times over the issue total of the loan; in
this lies the whole stage effect &#8211; look you, they say, what
confidence is shown in the government's bills of exchange.</p>
<p>4. But when the comedy is played out there emerges the fact that
a debit and an exceedingly burdensome debit has been created. For
the payment of interest it becomes necessary to have recourse to
new loans, which do not swallow up but only add to the capital
debt. And when this credit is exhausted it becomes necessary by new
taxes to cover, not the loan, but only the interest on it. These
taxes are a debit employed to cover a debit....</p>
<p>5. Later comes the time for conversions, but they diminish the
payment of interest without covering the debt, and besides they
cannot be made without the consent of the lenders; on announcing a
conversion, a proposal is made to return the money to those who are
not willing to convert their paper. If everybody expressed his
unwillingness and demanded his money back, the government would be
hooked on their own files and would be found insolvent and unable
to pay the proposed sums. By good luck the subjects of the goy
governments, knowing nothing about financial affairs, have always
preferred losses on exchange and diminution of interest to the risk
of new investments of their moneys, and have thereby many a time
enabled these governments to throw off their shoulders a debit of
several millions.</p>
<p>6. Nowadays, with external loans, these tricks cannot be played
by the goyim for they know that we shall demand all our moneys
back.</p>
<p>7. In this way in acknowledged bankruptcy will best prove to the
various countries the absence of any means between the interest of
the peoples and of those who rule them.</p>
<p>8. I beg you to concentrate your particular attention upon this
point and upon the following: nowadays all internal loans are
consolidated by so-called flying loans, that is, such as have terms
of payment more or less near. These debts consist of moneys paid
into the savings banks and reserve funds. If left for long at the
disposition of a government these funds evaporate in the payment of
interest on foreign loans, and are placed by the deposit of
equivalent amount of rents.</p>
<p>9. And these last it is which patch up all the leaks in the
State treasuries of the goyim.</p>
<p>10. When we ascend the throne of the world all these financial
and similar shifts, as being not in accord with our interests, will
be swept away so as not to leave a trace, as also will be destroyed
all money markets, since we shall not allow the prestige of our
power to be shaken by fluctuations of prices set upon our values,
which we shall announce by law at the price which represents their
full worth without any possibility of lowering or raising. (Raising
gives the pretext for lowering, which indeed was where we made a
beginning in relation to the values of the goyim.)</p>
<p>11. We shall replace the money markets by grandiose government
credit institutions, the object of which will be to fix the price
of industrial values in accordance with government views. These
institutions will be in a position to fling upon the market five
hundred millions of industrial paper in one day, or to buy up for
the same amount. In this way all industrial undertakings will come
into dependence upon us. You may imagine for yourselves what
immense power we shall thereby secure for ourselves....<br/>

<h3>POWER OF GOLD</h3>
<i>The secret of what is coming &#8211; Mysticism of the
new authority and the reverent fear of the people</i>
<p>1. In all that has so far been reported by me to you, I have
endeavoured to depict with care the secret of what is coming, of
what is past, and of what is going on now, rushing into the flood
of the great events coming already in the near future, the secret
of our relations to the goyim and of financial operations. On this
subject there remains still a little for me to add.</p>
<p>2. In our hands is the greatest power of our day &#8211; gold*:
in two days we can procure from our storehouses any quantity we may
please.</p>
<p><b><i>* Matthew 6:24</i> <font color="#000080">No man can serve
two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other;
or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot
serve God and materialism.</font></b></p>
<p>3. Surely there is no need to seek further proof that our rule
is predestined by God? Surely we shall not fail with such wealth to
prove that all that evil which for so many centuries we have had to
commit has served at the end of ends the cause of true well-being
&#8211; the bringing of everything into order? (See Matthew 6:24
quoted above) Though it be even by the exercise of some violence,
yet all the same it will be established. We shall contrive to prove
that we are benefactors who have restored to the rent and mangled
earth the true good and also freedom of the person, and therewith
we shall enable it to be enjoyed in peace and quiet, with proper
dignity of relations, on the condition, of course, of strict
observance of the laws established by us. We shall make plain
therewith that freedom does not consist in dissipation and in the
right of unbridled license any more than the dignity and force of a
man do not consist in the right of everyone to promulgate
destructive principles in the nature of freedom of conscience,
equality and a like, that freedom of the person in no wise consists
in the right to agitate oneself and others by abominable speeches
before disorderly mobs, and that true freedom consists in the
inviolability of the person who honourably and strictly observes
all the laws of life in common, that human dignity is wrapped up in
consciousness of the rights and also of the absence of rights of
each, and not wholly and solely in fantastic imaginings about the
subject of one's ego.</p>
<p>4. One authority will be glorious because it will be
all-powerful, will rule and guide, and not muddle along after
leaders and orators shrieking themselves hoarse with senseless
words which they call great principles and which are nothing else,
to speak honestly, but utopian....Our authority will be the crown
of order, and in that is included the whole happiness of man. The
aureole of this authority will inspire a mystical bowing of the
knee before it and a reverent fear before it of all the peoples.
True force makes no terms with any right, not even with that of
God: none dare come near to it so as to take so much as a span from
it away.<br/>

PROTOCOL 23
<h3>INSTILLING OBEDIENCE</h3>
<i>Cutting down of luxury goods &#8211; The supreme lord to
replace all existing rulers</i>
<p>1. That the peoples may become accustomed to obedience it is
necessary to inculcate lessons of humility and therefore to reduce
the production of articles of luxury. By this we shall improve
morals which have been debased by emulation in the sphere of
luxury. We shall re-establish small master production which will
mean laying a mine under the private capital of manufacturers. This
is indispensable also for the reason that manufacturers on the
grand scale often move, though not always consciously, the thoughts
of the masses in directions against the government. A people of
small masters knows nothing of unemployment and this binds him
closely with existing order, and consequently with the firmness of
authority. For us its part will have been played out the moment
authority is transferred into our hands. Drunkenness also will be
prohibited by law and punishable as a crime against humanness of
man who is turned into a brute under the influence of alcohol.</p>
<p>2. Subjects, I repeat once more, give blind obedience only to
the strong hand which is absolutely independent of them, for in it
they feel the sword of defence and support against social
scourges....What do they want with an angelic spirit in a king?
What they have to see in him is the personification of force and
power.</p>
<p>3. The supreme lord who will replace all now existing rulers,
dragging in their existence among societies demoralised by us,
societies that have denied even the authority of God, from whose
midst breaks out on all sides the fire of anarchy, must first of
all proceed to quench this all-devouring flame. Therefore he will
be obliged to kill off those existing societies, though he should
drench them with his own blood, that he may resurrect them again in
the form of regularly organised troops, fighting consciously with
every kind of infection that may cover the body of the State with
sores.</p>
<p>4. This Chosen One of God is chosen from above to demolish the
senseless forces moved by instinct and not reason, by brutishness
and humanness. These forces now triumph in manifestations of
robbery and every kind of violence under the mask of principles of
freedom and rights. They have overthrown all forms of social order
to erect, on the ruins, the throne of the King of the Jews; but
their part will be played out the moment he enters into his
kingdom. Then it will be necessary to sweep them away from his
path, on which must be left no knot, no splinter.</p>
<p>5. Then will it be possible for us to say to the peoples of the
world: Give thanks to God and bow the knee before him who bears on
his front the seal of the predestination of man, to which God
Himself has led His star that none other but Him might free us from
all the before-mentioned forces and evils.<br/>

PROTOCOL 24
<h3>QUALITIES OF THE RULER</h3>
<i>Selecting and training the seed of David</i>
<p>1. I pass now to the method of confirming the dynastic roots of
king David to the last strata of the earth.</p>
<p>2. This confirmation will first and foremost be included in that
which to this day has rested the force of conservatism, by our
learned elders, of the conduct of the affairs of the world, in the
directing of the education of thought of all humanity.</p>
<p>N.B. <a href="http://jahtruth.net/emmau2.htm">http://jahtruth.net/emmau2.htm</a></p>
<p>3. Certain members of the seed of David will prepare the kings
and their heirs, selecting not by right of heritage but by eminent
capacities, inducting them into the most secret mysteries of the
political, into schemes of government, but providing always that
none may come to knowledge of the secrets. The object of this mode
of action is that all may know that government cannot be entrusted
to those who have not been inducted into the secret places of its
art....</p>
<p>4. To these persons only will be taught the practical
application of the aforenamed plans by comparison of the
experiences of many centuries, all the observations on the
politico-economic moves and social sciences &#8211; in a word, all
the spirit of laws which have been unshakeably established by
nature herself for the regulation of the relations of humanity.</p>
<p>5. Direct heirs will often be set aside from ascending the
throne, if, in their time of training, they exhibit frivolity,
softness and other qualities that are the ruin of authority, which
render them incapable of governing and in themselves dangerous for
kingly office.</p>
<p>6. Only those who are unconditionally capable for firm, even if
it be to cruelty, direct rule will receive the reins of rule from
our learned elders.</p>
<p><b><i>John 19:19 And Pilate wrote a title, and put [it] on the
cross. And the writing was, JESUS NAZIR THE KING OF THE
JEWS.</i></b><br/>
<b><i>19:20 This title then read many of the Jews: for the place
where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written
in Hebrew, [and] Greek, [and] Latin.</i></b><br/>
<b><i>19:21 Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate,
Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the
Jews.</i></b><br/>
<b><i>19:22 Pilate answered, What I have written I have
written.</i></b></p>
<p>7. In case of falling sick with weakness of will or other form
of incapacity, kings must, by law, hand over the reins of rule to
new and capable hands&#8230;.</p>
<p>8. The king's plan of action for the current moment, and all the
more so for the future, will be unknown, even to those who are
called his closest counsellors.</p>
<p>9. Only the king and the three who stood sponsor for him will
know what is coming.</p>
<p>10. In the person of the king who with unbending will is master
of himself and of humanity all will discern as it were fate with
its mysterious ways. None will know what the king wishes to attain
by his dispositions, and therefore none will dare to stand across
an unknown path.</p>
<p>11. It is understood that the brain reservoir of the king must
correspond in capacity to the plan of government it has to contain.
It is for this reason that he will ascend the throne not otherwise
than after examination of his mind by the aforesaid learned
elders.</p>
<p><i>Thereby the Elders and Sanhedrin put themselves above their
puppet-king and control him, which is why, once they realised that
they could not control Jesus, who was <b>born</b>* King, they
rejected and crucified him.</i></p>
<p><i>* Matthew 2:2 Saying, Where is he that has been <b>BORN</b>
King of the Jews? for we saw his "Star" in the East, and are come
to worship him.</i></p>
<p>12. That the people may know and love their king, it is
indispensable for him to converse in the market-places with his
people. This ensures the necessary clinching of the two forces
which are now divided one from another by us by the terror.</p>
<p>13. This terror was indispensable for us till the time comes for
both these forces separately to fall under our influence.</p>
<p>14. The king of the Jews must not be at the mercy of his
passions, and especially of sensuality: on no side of his character
must he give brute instincts power over his mind. Sensuality worse
than all else disorganises the capacities of the mind and clearness
of views, distracting the thoughts to the worst and most brutal
side of human activity.</p>
<p>15. The prop of humanity in the person of the supreme lord of
all the world of the holy seed of David must sacrifice to his
people all personal inclinations.</p>
<p>16. Our supreme lord must be of an exemplary irreproachable
mind.<br/>

<p>A one page summary</p>
<p>Goyim are mentally inferior to Jews and can't run their nations properly. For their sake and ours, we need to abolish their governments and replace them with a single government. This will take a long time and involve much bloodshed, but it's for a good cause. Here's what we'll need to do:</p>
<p>* Place our agents and helpers everywhere<br/>
* Take control of the media and use it in propaganda for our plans<br/>
* Start fights between different races, classes and religions<br/>
* Use bribery, threats and blackmail to get our way<br/>
* Use Freemasonic Lodges to attract potential public officials<br/>
* Appeal to successful people's egos<br/>
* Appoint puppet leaders who can be controlled by blackmail<br/>
* Replace royal rule with socialist rule, then communism, then despotism<br/>
* Abolish all rights and freedoms, except the right of force by us<br/>
* Sacrifice people (including Jews sometimes) when necessary<br/>
* Eliminate religion; replace it with science and materialism<br/>
* Control the education system to spread deception and destroy intellect<br/>
* Rewrite history to our benefit<br/>
* Create entertaining distractions<br/>
* Corrupt minds with filth and perversion<br/>
* Encourage people to spy on one another<br/>
* Keep the masses in poverty and perpetual labor<br/>
* Take possession of all wealth, property and (especially) gold<br/>
* Use gold to manipulate the markets, cause depressions etc.<br/>
* Introduce a progressive tax on wealth<br/>
* Replace sound investment with speculation<br/>
* Make long-term interest-bearing loans to governments<br/>
* Give bad advice to governments and everyone else</p>
<p>Eventually the Goyim will be so angry with their governments (because we'll blame them for the resulting mess) that they'll gladly have us take over. We will then appoint a descendant of David to be king of the world, and the remaining Goyim will bow down and sing his praises. Everyone will live in peace and obedient order under his glorious rule. </p>

<p>In regards to the comment " A one page summary of the Protocols":</p>
<p>Thank-you.</p>
<p>It is difficult for the average person, easily fooled, to comprehend the extent of evil by the authors.<br/>
T.H.E.Y. are Goyim and counterfeit-Jews, occupying Israel the nation, enslaving Israel the people.</p>
<p>Satanism is not a religion, in small pockets, scattered across the globe and practiced only by few.<br/>
Begun as a few, has proliferated into the many, by and according to the agenda provided to read.</p>
<p>Lacking a Connection to God, the majority cannot see, hence, are blind to what/how to do good.<br/>
Worse than not doing good, the majority assist evil-doers by falling prey to what appears is right.<br/>
Without that Connection, one will not know, and if they know then they cannot DO, hence will die.</p>
