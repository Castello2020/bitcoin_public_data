            <span id="ctl00_body_ctl00_litDescription" style="font:12px/12px 'Trebuchet MS', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">God has created every person to be a supernatural spiritual being, with the capacity to function not only in a natural world, but also to access the realm of the spirit, access where God is, and to bring heaven to earth. <br><br>God&#39;s desire is that you be a channel for heaven coming to earth, for His presence and goodness and healing and love and peace and prosperity to flow through you, and to manifest in the world around you. <br><br>So in the course we&#39;ll be teaching about that supernatural dimension. We&#39;ll teach about how miracles are activated, what the keys are around that. We&#39;ll teach you what the foundational key is, is out of intimacy with God and hearing the voice of God, and we&#39;ll give you practical steps, practical keys, how to start from wherever you are right now, and step by step grow your faith, so you can be starting to operate successfully, and regularly and confidently in the gifts of the spirit.<br><br>So in the course we&#39;ll teach on the gifts of the spirit, we&#39;ll give you a little bit about each. We&#39;ll also give you some foundational understanding about the spirit man, and how God works in and through us. Also if you&#39;re watching this by DVD you&#39;ll see demonstrations of the power of God touching people, you&#39;ll see demonstrations of how to move in words of knowledge, hearing the voice of God, minister to people. You&#39;ll see all of that in this course, and it will inspire you and help you. God&#39;s given me ability to make it extremely clear, and I know that you&#39;re going to really enjoy this. <br><br>Put in the effort. Invest in yourself. Do the course, and put into practice the things you learn, and you&#39;ll just be overjoyed when you see God is far more willing to work through you, than you really realise. His plan is that the kingdom come into the earth through you. All you&#39;ve got to do is learn how to do it.<br><br>In 1 Corinthians, Chapter 12, Verse 1, Paul says I don&#39;t want you to be ignorant of spiritual gifts, and this course is to help solve that problem. God bless you. Have a great time on the course and may you extend the kingdom of God boldly. <br><br>Contents of Manual include: <br>1. Apostolic Reformation<br>2.

Jesus first sent 12, then 70, and finally all believers. We&#39;re all sent by God, we all have a sphere of influence, and god wants us to be used in this ministry - not only of sharing the gospel, but of healing the sick, and delivering people from evil spirits.<br><br>Evil Spirits and how they Operate (2 of 5) Examples of Jesus&#39; ministry of deliverance, how He worked, how He operated, and then some of Jesus&#39; teaching as to what evil spirits are and how they operate. How spirits get into people&#39;s lives and the ways they operate, leading into a closer examination of the scriptures around deliverance, and what they reveal about demons, and the spirit world. Some basics of the deliverance ministry, leading into a practice exercise (activation).<br><br>Gateways for Demonic Spirits (3 of 5) Demons need a &#39;legal doorway&#39; to enter a persons life. In this session, a check-list of 9 common doorways are explained; and what kinds of things would happen inside a person, as a result of demonic bondage.<br><br>Curses and How to Deal with Them (4 of 5) For people who have a spiritual world view, blessing and cursing are a great reality. Blessing means there&#39;s a flow of spiritual power that brings favour around my life; cursing means there is a flow of spiritual power that obstructs and frustrates and sets me back continually. This session will help you identify when a curse is operating, and how to go about addressing it. This includes a range of heart issues that give legal rights to demons. Jesus came to set us free!<br><br>Casting out of Spirits (5 of 5) Simple dynamics of how to lead someone through deliverance, including dealing with some issues of the heart where demons are attached.

            <span id="ctl00_body_ctl05_litDescription" style="font:12px/12px 'Trebuchet MS', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The original mandate given to man in Genesis 1v28 was to &quot;subdue and have dominion&quot;. Unfortunately when Adam &amp; Eve sinned against god, they lost their connection with God, and lost their spiritual authority. <br><br>Jesus came to give us back our relationship with God,and our assignment of dominion again. Jesus demonstrated the message, He lived out the message of bring heaven to earth where ever he was. He first called 12, then 70, and finally entrusted all believers with the assignment to go, as ambassadors of the Kingdom, to proclaim the gospel, to make disciples, to heal the sick, to cast out demons, raise the dead - to minister in power and signs and wonders.<br><br>Gods purpose in creating man has never changed, He has something for us to accomplish, to bring our lives and community into harmony with heaven. We need to understand our mission in life, and learn how to fulfil it, how to exercise spiritual authority over all spiritual resistance.<br><br>Contents include:<br>1. The Apostolic mandate<br>2.

We are also &#39;apostolic&#39; because we are SENT, as as ambassadors of heaven, to fulfil our task with kingly authority. It is important we discover for ourselves what God has called us to do, and passionately pursue the mission that God has wired into our heart. It requires we take ownership of it; see people as God sees them, and execute on earth the judgements of heaven.<br><br>Identifying Your Spiritual Territory (2 of 6) This session begins with some activations to develop spiritual strength &amp; sensitivity. Every believer has a spiritual territory (or &#39;metron&#39;) entrusted to us, a sphere of influence which is ours to govern - some permanent, some temporary. Adam (in Gen. 2:15) was instructed to &#39;tend&#39;, cultivate, develop his territory and to &#39;keep&#39; or protect it from the enemy. Learn valuable keys to on how to govern, what to govern, and the consequences of failure to govern.<br><br>How to Exercise Spiritual Authority (3 of 6) Further activations to stir and awaken you inner man quickly, give voice to faith decrees, and release a spirit flow. Understand the real meaning of &#39;authority&#39;, &#39;power&#39;, &#39;legal rights&#39;, and what Jesus accomplished at the cross to disarm spiritual powers. Know what we have delegated power to do, and foundations which have to be built in our life to ensure success. Finally, how to forbid troubling spirits and release blessing. Plenty of practical examples in workplace, marriage, family life etc.<br><br>Exercising Authority in your Personal Life (4 of 6) The first place to gain dominion is with yourself. Eph. 4:27 shows us we can give the devil a foothold, or legal doorway to access our life, creating negative energies. This session gives a check-list of common doorways, and practical steps on how we can take responsibility for our life and close down these gateways. There is clear instruction on how to recognise and deal with spiritual attacks - spiritual problems need spiritual solutions. We can identify our own &#39;personal enemies&#39; and deal with them ourselves. &quot;deliver ourself from the had of the hunter&quot;. Many Q&amp;A in this session cover a large range of situations.<br><br>Strengthening Your Spiritual Life (5 of 6) This session starts off with clear instructions on how to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and the Gift of Tongues. Mike then describes the functions of our spirit - our life source, able to energise and illuminate our whole body, illuminate our mind, release creativity, bring insights, commune with God, and flow out to others. Learn how to cultivate and strengthen your spirit dimensions, including meditating on scripture to encounter God.<br><br>House-Cleansing - Ministering to one another (6 of 6) Find out how to go about cleansing a house/building (or object) from demonic manifestation, and shift atmospheres. You&#39;ve only truly learnt when you can do, so be led as a group or individual in exercises showing you how to release the spirit of God within you into another - power, spirit, joy, healing.

She destroyed prophets wherever she could find them; and raised up instead her own prophetic messengers.<br><br>They brought a message which they called Prophecy, but it was actually speaking words that were demonically-empowered, and seduced the nation. The nation came under it, literally fell asleep spiritually.<br><br>In the Old and New Testament, the same spirit power, the same kind of operation, to lead people astray, so they don&#39;t walk in the destiny that God had for them.<br><br>1. Slumber of Jezebel The Bible is very clear: there is an invisible spirit world, in which spiritual powers operate (Eph 6:12).<br><br>The nation of Israel got into an alliance with another nation, the Sidonians, by marriage. He married Jezebel, and immediately opened his life to the influence of the spirit power behind her. Her father was a priest of Baal, and so she introduced the worship of Baal and Ashtaroth.<br><br>2. Spiritual Slumber The church in the West, on the most, is in a state of spiritual slumber - unaware of the powers at work in the nation, to destroy the legacy that&#39;s been built over years. God is speaking to us, to &#39;wake up&#39; out of that spiritual slumber.<br><br>Jezebel was a woman in the Old Testament, and also a woman in the New Testament, but I want to get your eyes off &#39;woman&#39;. I want you to get your eyes on &#39;spiritual power&#39; - entering and oppressing a nation.<br><br>3. Recognising and Withstanding Jezebel&#39;s attack This kind of spiritual attack seeks to shut down the prophetic flow; and remove any Godly authority out of their position. You become fearful, isolate, or lose perspective.<br><br>God just got Elijah to have a good long sleep and rest, gave him a bit of food, took him into a place of relationship and connection - started to put anointing back into him, re-fired him and commissioned him.

            <span id="ctl00_body_ctl09_litDescription" style="font:12px/12px 'Trebuchet MS', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">1.Ten Commandments<br>God wants to marry you - leaven and all. No matter what you&#39;ve done, or where you&#39;ve been, God is determined to make it right for you. <br><br>The OT marriage covenant (and its Hebrew context), are used to understand some things Jesus said about his return, and about the rapture. <br><br>The 10 commandments is considered from the perspective of a long line of slaves. So we get a day off? You can&#39;t kill me, or take my things, just because you&#39;re stronger than me? My human rights and dignity will be respected in our new culture? That is fantastic!<br><br>2. I am the Lord your God <br>The Ten Commandments starts with Grace, with God giving people something that they did not earn or deserve: <br><br>&quot;I am the Lord your God&quot;, who is choosing to bless you with freedom from slavery, not because of anything you&#39;ve done, but because I love you, and want all the people of the world to know that I am a loving God. Welcome to being human again. <br><br>Anokhi: an offer to increase us, inside the &quot;hedge of praise and submission&quot;<br><br>3. Foundations for Your Success<br>We don&#39;t like spirit, because we can&#39;t control it. It doesn&#39;t obey our rules. Where is God? How big is He? <br><br>If you want to live a successful life, you&#39;ve got to organise your life to where God is with you all the time; not a statue/idol that&#39;s with you one minute, but not the next. We can&#39;t make God manageable. <br><br>To have the best relationship with God, don&#39;t make your prayer life about words and needs, He already knows what your needs are. <br><br>The supply of everything I need, which is as close to me as the air that I&#39;m breathing, I stop and become aware of that.<br><br>4. Remember the Sabbath, Keep it Holy<br>Is God still the creator, even when He&#39;s resting? Am I me, regardless of what I&#39;m producing; or is my entire life and worth defined by the number of bricks I can make? <br><br>Anything we do around Sabbath that puts people in bondage, instead of bringing relief to a situation, misses the point. The last thing a group of slaves needs is another piece of bondage - and we&#39;re no different. <br><br>When our worth becomes about bricks, we become machines. Sabbath is a day where you live like your work is done, even if it isn&#39;t - and that is healing. The world goes on, because God is God, and you are not<br><br>5. Honour<br>How do I honour someone who wasn&#39;t honourable? Nobody&#39;s parents are perfect. Honour is not ignoring wrong things, or saying wrong things are right, or having no boundaries. <br><br>Honour has more to do with what we pass on to the next generation; than how we respond to the previous one. It&#39;s maintaining godliness through our generations. It&#39;s choosing to be honest about the ungodliness, and choosing to break the cycle. <br><br>Be thankful you&#39;re alive; realise your parents were a part of fallen humanity; give up the urge to take vengeance, and to judge - realise they were wounded too.<br><br>6. 11th Commandment<br>Taking His name in vain is about: don&#39;t sign cheques I wouldn&#39;t sign, don&#39;t put my name to things that aren&#39;t me. <br><br>As a Christian, you&#39;re actually picking up and carrying (Nasah) the name (Shim) of God around with you. Shawv (in vain) means to live your life in a way that manifests (not disappoints) the hope that rests upon it. <br><br>The name of God rest upon a person (Ex 23:20), its a prophetic utterance of character (Exodus 34:6-7), it sits in a place (Deur 12:11), a force that provides protection (Ps 20:1), that has the ability to move with emotion - to fire a place up (Is 30:27). <br><br>It&#39;s a realm of awareness, that we can live in, or outside of (Micah 4:5). Its a force that brings about the best life (Jn 20). <br><br>The name creates a life so good, it&#39;s worth suffering &amp; dying for (Acts 5:40-41). The demonstration of that life is so powerful, it threatens other people. <br><br>If you are reviled for the name of Christ, then you are blessed (1 Peter 4:14). Jesus: I have manifested Your name (John 17:6). <br><br>God has called Christians to be nice, more than He has called us to be right.<br><br><br>ISBN/EAN13: 1497341183 / 9781497341180<br>Page Count: 196<br>Trim Size: 6&quot; x 9&quot;<br>Language: English</span>

He makes me lie down.&quot; <br><br>Psalms is full of David&#39;s battle to find that resting place. In fact he had many difficulties, pressures setbacks, obstacles - all kinds of challenges, but he said “I&#39;m never lacking, because God is my provider and my source”. <br><br>He came to rest inside, in God. The kingdom of God is about rest, not works. <br><br>“He that has entered into rest has ceased from his own works.”<br><br>The Rest of Faith (2 of 4)<br>Jesus said: If you&#39;re stressed out, come to Me. The answer is a person, your connection with a person, connecting with Him and learning. <br><br>Technology doesn&#39;t solve problems, because the problems we really face, the core of them, are found in the heart; and in our walk with God. <br><br>The reason He can teach you how to do life, is because He has an attitude of meekness, humility; and He gave an example of how to do life.<br><br>The Rest of Faith (3 of 4)<br>Stress and pressure are part of our life, and Jesus has given some clear things about how we can deal with it. <br><br>When you&#39;re stressed out, anxious and uptight you don&#39;t live your best; you struggle in your relationships; there&#39;s overflow in your health. <br><br>God doesn&#39;t intend us to live that way. Let&#39;s have a look what Jesus said…<br><br>The Rest of Faith (4 of 4)<br>&quot;My presence will go with you, and I will give you Rest&quot; <br><br>Rest is a peace in our heart, in spite of the turmoil around us. We&#39;re live in an age which is in turmoil; people are anxious &amp; fearful - stressed out. <br><br>Rest is a gift to us. It&#39;s an experience you can come into, when no matter what&#39;s going on around you, you can still be at peace in your heart. <br><br>This is something God gives to us. It comes out of His presence being with us; and out of learning how to let go issues to Him.

Tefillah, Teshuvah, Tzedakah<br>Pictures from Hebrew hieroglyphics are used like a comic strip, to illuminate the word. <br><br>Tefillah/Prayer: turn the head, in order to face the one, who can bear the burden. Teshuvah/Repentance: change your thinking. Tzedakah: Righteousness revealed; to be generous. The desire of your heart opens the door to humility.<br><br>2. Being a Peacemaker<br>Peacemakers and Escalation…<br><br>Our hero of the faith was a rebellious, spoilt brat, who wanted his own way, in every single way. This was a man that was sleeping with prostitutes on his wedding night, because he got depressed, because his best man stole his wife. <br><br>From what started out as a joke no-one understood, a fascinating cycle of violence ensues, based on: because you did this, I now have a right to do that. I merely did to them, what they did to me. This way of living will always bring death. <br>3. Demonstrating God&#39;s Power<br>Remarkable similarities between the Corinthian Gods of Mithra, Adonis, Addis, Horus, and the Gospel story of Jesus Christ. <br><br>Paul&#39;s strategy changed in Corinth, instead of making fine-sounding arguments that Jesus was the Christ, as he did with the Jews, he demonstrated what Jesus&#39; life looked like, by living it out. That gave him the credibility to announce that the kingdom of God was at hand. <br><br>Cookie-cutter evangelism doesn&#39;t work. Demonstrating the Power of God, within the Disposition of Messiah, gives us the Credibility to speak life into any situation. <br>4. Being a Good Neighbor<br>Luke 12:13 is the only time that Jesus&#39; actually proclaims: God is going to kill you. It&#39;s not any of the sins you would think. It&#39;s not adultery, fornication, burning your children in fire, idolatry. Its greed! <br><br>Jesus is not impressed by what kind of car you drive, house you live in, or anything you possess; but with how much compassionate, gracious, slow to anger, abounding-in-love, character is present in your homes. <br>5. Form versus Function<br>Greek people, people with white skin that come from Europe, and they find their origins in a really big, powerful church in Europe, that has big buildings with apostles names named after them - we see form. <br><br>We always see form. We were trained to see form, we think in form, everything about us is form.Hebrew people see function. To study our Bible more effectively, we should be people who are training ourselves to see function, not form.<br><br>6. The Worries of this Life, &amp; the Deceitfulness of Wealth<br>Jesus says: the worries of this life will keep the word of God from taking root in your life. It&#39;s something that chokes your life out. The other one is the deceitfulness of wealth, which is a lie that says: if I had this I would be happy. <br><br>Do you have one day in seven, that is unlike any other? If you do, how is it different? Who are the most important people to you? What are you called to be? Is that getting your attention first?<br><br><br><br>Publication Date:Mar 06 2014<br>ISBN/EAN13: 1496157818 / 9781496157812<br>Page Count: 204<br>Trim Size: 6&quot; x 9&quot;<br>Language: English<br>Color: Black and White</span>

This doesn&#39;t happen by our will power or hope, but by the power of the Holy Spirit, as we depend on Him and grow in God. To be free we need to remove the armour, or belief system, from our lives that have bound us up, so the demon or strongman can be easily cast out.<br><br>2.Foundations for Freedom<br>Explore the different doors of entry into a person’s life, from generational curses to inner vows. As you open your heart, and take ownership for your sin, rather than blame others, and then repent and release forgiveness, healing and freedom will flow into our lives.<br><br>3.Bondages of the Heart<br>Ungodly soul ties, inner vows and word curses are three entry points into our lives, where we can open ourselves to bitterness, jealousy, anger, complaining, addictions, etc, which then become strongholds in our lives, that the enemy can come in and take hold of. As we recognise these traits in our lives, we can take ownership of them, renouncing and releasing them from our lives in Jesus Name.<br><br>4.Legal Right of Entry<br>Explains three main legal grounds, upon which demons can gain access to your life: generational curses; the occult; and sexual sin.<br><br>5.The Two Kingdoms<br>Humans are very unique - not only living in the natural world, but can also connect to the spiritual world. Jesus came to tell us about the Kingdom of God, which is full of light, peace and joy; but there is another Kingdom which we are all born into - the Kingdom of Darkness - which rules by tormenting people, and using sin to control them.<br><br>6.Traumatic Experiences<br>The effect of traumatic experiences can be overcome and healed through prayer; by exchanging old memory pictures with scripture memorisation; and by inviting the Holy Spirit and the truth into the situation - for total restoration in Jesus name!<br><br>7.Called to be a Minister of the Holy Spirit<br>We are called to pray for people, and to be a minister of the Spirit of God. Come spiritually prepared, and believe that God is with you - guide people’s attention to the Lord, not the prayer! There will be conflict before, during, and after ministry, and the battles will be within you. Believe God is with you, take risks, and reach out in prayer.<br><br>8.Ministry of Jesus<br>Jesus made it clear we would have difficulties and problems, but He has overcome all evil with good - on the Cross, and through His ministry to us. As we face the reality that we are hurting and suffering, and allow the Lord to help us repent and forgive, He will always respond. God is committed to our character and growth, not our comfort.<br><br>ISBN/EAN13: 1496116577 / 9781496116574<br>Page Count:382<br>Trim Size: 6&quot; x 9&quot;<br>Language:English &amp; Chinese (Simp+Trad)<br>Religion / Christianity / General</span>

            <span id="ctl00_body_ctl13_litDescription" style="font:12px/12px 'Trebuchet MS', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Spirit of Mammon - Mike Connell (4 sermons)<br>Finance Seminar - Shane Willard (2 sermons)<br><br>Spirit of Mammon (1 of 4) The number of times Jesus talked about wealth and possessions, stewardship and accountability, far exceeded any discussion on any topic. In fact there&#39;s about 10 times the number of references to finances and stewardship and resources, than there are to faith and salvation, and yet all of these go together. Often the moment we start to talk about money, people freeze - and we will see why...<br><br>Put God First (2 of 4) I&#39;ve seen too many rich people who had miserable lives to believe that money can really make your life happy. It just can&#39;t. God can make you happy, money can&#39;t. Money is just a piece of paper. It&#39;s some numbers in the bank. It cannot make your life happy. What it does instead is it tends to create problems.<br><br>Generosity (3 of 4) We have seen many people that have had much money and yet they didn&#39;t have what money seemed to promise, health and prosperity and every good thing. It seems like it still eludes them, so we looked at that and saw that Jesus taught very specifically about us placing God first. To be generous is to be liberal. It&#39;s an attitude of heart that shows up in every area of your life including finances. Generosity exposes selfishness!<br><br>Generosity (4 of 4) There&#39;s something about generosity that creates a very sweet fragrance. When people give and there&#39;s nothing in it for themselves, they&#39;ve just given unexpectedly to you, then there&#39;s something sweet about it. Generosity usually exposes greed. God is love and you can&#39;t love without giving. You can give without loving, but you can&#39;t love without giving, so the greatest way we express the love of God to people is when we can be generous and kind to them with no agenda. That&#39;s when people see God, because that&#39;s what God is like.<br><br>Shane Willard offers a unique Jewish/Hebraic perspective for Christians on Finance and Giving. Shane is mentored by a pastor with rabbinical training, and teaches the context of the Scriptures from a Hebraic perspective. This perspective helps people to see God&#39;s Word in a completely new way and leads them into a more intimate relationship with the Messiah, Jesus Christ.<br><br>Finance (1 of 2) There’s a great cure for poverty, it’s called get a job, work hard. God never set himself up as the cure for laziness, or the cure for stupid. There is no supernatural, super-spiritual thing that over comes a lack of hard work or laziness. We&#39;ve got to be wise, which means staying out of debt, not putting money in things going down in value, not trusting the government to do it for us, live on a budget, take charge of your finances, show self-control! To know God, is to take care of the poor and the afflicted. Tsedaqah (Hebrew) is introduced, equating Righteousness with Generosity/Charity<br><br>Finance (2 of 2) We&#39;re called to live on a circle in a square. A circle inside of a square is 79%. The math from the commands matches the illustration from agriculture. 2.5% is put in the hands of the Priest; then a tenth is given to the church; and a tenth for yourself, in the form of savings, but one third of that is given to the poor. He doesn&#39;t want you just to go to heaven one day, he wants you to bring heaven to earth now. If your first fruits are in the right hands, your finances can&#39;t die. You sanctify everything else in your life by honouring the lord with your first fruits.<br><br>James 1.26 - &quot;If anyone considers himself religious and does yet not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless. Religion that our God our father accepts as pure and faultless is this; to look after orphans and widows in their distress. The religion our father sees as pure is generosity.&quot;<br><br>Paperback: 258 pages<br>Language: English<br>ISBN-10: 1496080696<br>ISBN-13: 978-1496080691<br>Product Dimensions: 9 x 6 x 0.6 inches</span>

Then he begins to describe the foundations, which are explained in depth through this seven-part teaching.<br><br>Hebrews 6:1-3 “Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection, not laying again the foundation of: repentance from dead works; and of faith toward God; of the doctrine of baptisms; and of laying on of hands; and of resurrection of the dead; and of eternal judgment. And this will we do, if God permit.”<br><br>Hebrews 5:12 “Now by this time you&#39;ve been Christians for many years, you ought to be teachers. You need someone again teaches you the First Principles of the Doctrine of God; you need milk and not solid food. For everyone who takes milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness. He is a babe...<br><br>1.Repentance from Dead Works This is not talking about repentance from sin, but from living a self-centred life at the core of our being, a life lived out of duty, obligation, legalism, my efforts to be loved, needed, valued, feel good. The life of God flows out of a vital love relationship with God. He is the centre, not us. Our identity is with him. His life flows through a life that&#39;s yielded and open, and in love with God as a father.<br><br>2.Faith towards God What is Faith? How would I know if I had it? How do I get it? Can it be grown and developed? How can I grow and develop it? Turn towards God to receive his love, receive identity in Him, receive positioning in Him, so you can bring forth good works, living works.<br><br>3.Baptised into Christ, Baptism in Water A foundation of believing that causes you to step up to the reality of who Jesus says you are. I am immersed into something that I was not in before. I am a totally new person, connected to God vitally, and connected to the body of Christ. Water Baptism is my testimony to the world that to the spiritual powers, that old person died, I&#39;m joined to the living God, the power of sin is broken. I&#39;m a free man, there&#39;s a new person risen up, born again.<br><br>4.Baptism in the Holy Spirit Immersion into the person, and power and presence of the Holy Spirit, so it lives around you, and is on you, and flows freely from within you. The entrance into a supernatural living.<br><br>5.Laying on of Hands In the laying on of hands, in the spirit, there is a flow from one person to another. God has called you not just to experience Him, but to connect to people tangibly, and release what He has given you.<br><br>6.Resurrection of the Dead There is a difference between a person being raised from the dead, to extend his life and then die, and the teaching of resurrection. Jesus was the first-fruits, the first-born to be resurrected from the dead, and appear to many in a resurrection body - immortal, incorruptible, able to vanish in and out, no longer constrained by the physical world. He was a pattern for all that is to follow. This teaching covers the first resurrection, 1000 year reign of Christ on earth, and the second resurrection. Which one will you be in?<br><br>7.Eternal Judgment Sometimes we focus a lot on the grace of God, the goodness of God, the mercy of God we forget or overlook that there is another side, that God is also holy and He&#39;s just. His justice requires that He deal with how we&#39;ve governed our life and what we&#39;ve done in our life. All of you have an appointment to keep with this. There is no exception.

            <span id="ctl00_body_ctl15_litDescription" style="font:12px/12px 'Trebuchet MS', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Authored by Mike Connell, Shane Willard <br><br>Five Seconds After You Die - Mike Connell <br>We read in the paper of accidents, car accidents and young people dying, and there are questions, many questions people have in their hearts, about the reality of what happens after death, and what happens to a person when they die, what will happen in those first five seconds after you die. These are questions people often don&#39;t speak out but they wonder about them. There&#39;s a tremendous amount of nonsense in the movies to try and explain some of these things. If we want to find out about what happens in eternity, if we want to find out about life after death or what happens at death, the best place we can go is to the one who made it known.<br><br>Live with Purpose (Men&#39;s Breakfast) - Shane Willard<br>Ghenna was the town rubbish dump (a present reality), and Hades is an afterlife (a future reality), in English its Hell. When we think of Hell, we tend to think about: them (in the future); but in the vast majority of Jesus&#39; teachings, Hell was: us (in the present). Heaven &amp; Hell are both true, and both occupied, in the here/now. They are also both true of another place in the future, which is also occupied, by real people. Jesus&#39; emphasis was far, far, far more on one, instead of the other. When you take care of the poor and the afflicted, that is what it means to know God.<br><br>Are You Worthy? - Shane Willard<br>There are 4 verses in the Bible that say homosexuality&#39;s wrong, and 2000 verses in the Bible that tell us to love each other, have we got our emphasis wrong? Who is worthy to break the seals, and open the scrolls? No one in heaven, or earth, or under the earth, could open the scroll, or even look inside of it. There are people, already in heaven, who aren&#39;t worthy? The &quot;Flames of Heaven&quot; is God&#39;s relentless pursuit, to make you the best you can be in His kingdom, without taking your free will away. Hell will let you stay greedy, or a racist, heaven won&#39;t.<br><br>Be the Salt and Light - Shane Willard<br>There are 6 mentions of fire in hell, but 229 mentions of fire in heaven! If you walked into heaven tomorrow, what parts of you would be burned up? 15 of 18 of Jesus mentions of hell, was about us, here, now. It&#39;s about: what are you bringing to the earth? How&#39;s your lust problem? How&#39;s your anger problem? Do you call people fools? How is fear of man instead of fear of God? What are you bringing to the earth?<br><br>Resurrection of the Dead - Mike Connell <br>Jesus was the first-fruits, the first-born to be resurrected from the dead, and appear to many in a resurrection body - immortal, incorruptible, able to vanish in and out, no longer constrained by the physical world.

Our hero of the faith was a rebellious, spoilt brat, who wanted his own way, in every single way. This was a man that was sleeping with prostitutes on his wedding night, because he got depressed, because his best man stole his wife. From what started out as a joke no-one understood, a fascinating cycle of violence ensues, based on: because you did this, I now have a right to do that. I merely did to them, what they did to me.

When sin is in your life, it&#39;s not just something that sits there - it is alive, operative, active, wanting to increase its hold over your life, and produces death. The Holy Spirit works to energise us. What does He energise us to do, and how do I get that happening in my life?<br><br>God’s Word Works in You <br>The Bible says if I don&#39;t do the word of God, if I don&#39;t apply into my life what God&#39;s saying to me, actually I end up quite deceived. I think I&#39;m doing real well, because I measure doing real well by the information I know - but none of this, until it&#39;s applied, changes my life. The Hebrew way of thinking is: what you are doing, is what you know.<br><br>Speaking In Tongues <br>The gift of tongues is one of the most wonderful gifts that God has given you and me, and it is vital for building a spirit dimensional life around you. Without the flow of the spirit&#39;s life within you, you&#39;re left to live out of your own efforts and willpower, and without the intuitive flow, direction and guidance of the Holy Spirit. Jesus said: I&#39;ll not leave you alone. I&#39;ll give you another comforter. He&#39;s been with you, now He&#39;ll be in you. You&#39;ve got some fire inside you, and he said: as they were filled with the Holy Ghost, they began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.<br><br>Tongues and Interpretation, Word of Knowledge<br>How we can be immersed into the spiritual dimension, and be &quot;clothed with power from on high&quot;. This is a gift, available to all who desire it. Receiving the Holy Spirit (Born Again) versus receiving the total immersion (Baptism of the Holy Spirit). To express ourselves in this new culture we need a language which bubbles up from within - energising our inner life, speaking out &#39;mysteries&#39; and more. Finally, learn how to operate the Word of Knowledge - a powerful revelation gift to open up a person&#39;s life<br><br>The Truth about Tattoos<br>The book of Leviticus includes a prohibition against Tattoos (&amp; cutting, mutilation), which is often not well-understood or observed. There&#39;s a natural/historical context, such as its association with Slavery and Baal worship; but also a spiritual context, involving blood covenants and supernatural laws. That side is related to the Deliverance ministry (commonly known as Exorcism) - one of the 3 parts of the Great Commission, which all believers are entrusted with.<br><br>Speak the Word of God<br>Things from the unseen realm of the spirit, make their way into the physical world, by speaking words. Your words have power to shape your world, they have already shaped your world, and shape it today. With a heart man believes, with the mouth man confesses to salvation. Death and life are imparted to people through words, because there&#39;s a spirit content to it. The word of God has power to change your life. The mixture of meditating and speaking is what causes the word to become alive, and energised in your life.<br><br>http://mikeconnellministries.com<br>https://vimeo.com/channels/forces<br><br>Publication Date:Nov 03 2013<br>ISBN/EAN13:1493658158 / 9781493658152<br>Page Count:216<br>Binding Type:US Trade Paper<br>Trim Size:6&quot; x 9&quot; x 0.3&quot;<br>Weight: 13.6oz (386g)<br>Language:English<br>Color:Black and White</span>

Jesus has given some clear things about how we can deal with it. When you&#39;re stressed out, anxious and uptight you don&#39;t live your best and not only that, you find that you struggle in your relationships. There&#39;s overflow in your health. Things are not good when you&#39;re living like that. God doesn&#39;t intend us to live that way. Let&#39;s have a look what Jesus said.<br><br>Comfort in Times of Trouble: Everyone experiences times of pressure, difficult, distress. When we&#39;re in pain, out thinking is affected, we tend to lose perspective, then isolate, &amp; turn to false comforts. The enemy of our soul likes to torment us, but God is a God of Comfort. We can position ourselves to experience great comfort in times of distress. Learn how to experience the comfort of God, &amp; the reality of His presence.<br><br>Authority in the Family: We can go to Marriage Seminars, but if we don&#39;t deal with spiritual powers which may have already encroached into your marriage or personal lives, the other stuff won&#39;t work properly! This series clearly describes God&#39;s design for our marriage and how we can position ourselves for blessing and empowerment.<br><br>Finance (1 of 2) There&#39;s a great cure for poverty, it&#39;s called get a job, work hard. God never set himself up as the cure for laziness, or the cure for stupid. There is no supernatural, super-spiritual thing that over comes a lack of hard work or laziness. We&#39;ve got to be wise, which means staying out of debt, not putting money in things going down in value, not trusting the government to do it for us, live on a budget, take charge of your finances, show self-control! To know God, is to take care of the poor and the afflicted. Tsedaqah (Hebrew) is introduced, equating Righteousness with Generosity/Charity<br><br>Finance (2 of 2) We&#39;re called to live on a circle in a square. A circle inside of a square is 79%. The math from the commands matches the illustration from agriculture. 2.5% is put in the hands of the Priest; then a tenth is given to the church; and a tenth for yourself, in the form of savings, but one third of that is given to the poor. He doesn&#39;t want you just to go to heaven one day, he wants you to bring heaven to earth now. If your first fruits are in the right hands, your finances can&#39;t die. You sanctify everything else in your life by honouring the lord with your first fruits.<br><br>Ten Commandments - Foundations for Success:<br>Am I me, regardless of what I&#39;m producing; or is my entire life and worth defined by the number of bricks I can make? Is God still the creator, even when He&#39;s resting? The Sabbath is a day where you live like your work is done, even if it isn&#39;t - and that is healing. The world goes on, because God is God, and you are not. The supply of everything I need, is as close to me as the air that I&#39;m breathing, I just need to stop and become aware of that. God wants to marry you, leaven &amp; all. No matter what you&#39;ve done, He is determined to make it right for you - that is what the 10 Commandments are all about. Its Grace, its God giving people something that they did not earn or deserve, its welcome to being human again. <br><br>Leadership Seminar:<br>Tefillah, Teshuvah, Tzedakah (1 of 6)  Pictures from Hebrew hieroglyphics are used, like a comic strip, to illuminate the word. Tefillah (Prayer) is to turn the head, in order to face the one, who can bear the burden. Teshuvah (Repentance) is to change your thinking. Tzedakah is that Faith leads to Righteousness revealed - to be generous. The desire of your heart opens the door to humility.<br><br>Being a Peacemaker (2 of 6)  Peacemakers and Escalation. Our hero of the faith was a rebellious, spoilt brat, who wanted his own way, in every single way. This was a man that was sleeping with prostitutes on his wedding night, because he got depressed, because his best man stole his wife. From what started out as a joke no-one understood, a fascinating cycle of violence ensues, based on: because you did this, I now have a right to do that. I merely did to them, what they did to me. This way of living will always bring death.<br><br>Demonstrating God&#39;s Power (3 of 6)  Remarkable similarities are found between the Corinthian Gods of Mithra, Adonis, Addis, Horus, and the Gospel story of Jesus Christ. Paul&#39;s strategy changed in Corinth, instead of making fine-sounding arguments that Jesus was the Christ, as he did with the Jews, he demonstrated what Jesus&#39; life looked like, by living it out. That gave him the credibility to announce that the kingdom of God was at hand. Cookie-cutter evangelism doesn&#39;t work. Demonstrating the Power of God, within the Disposition of Messiah, gives us the Credibility to speak life into any situation.<br><br>Being a Good Neighbor (4 of 6)  Luke 12:13 is the only time that Jesus&#39; actually proclaims: God is going to kill you. It&#39;s not any of the sins you would think. It&#39;s not adultery, fornication, burning your children in fire, idolatry. Its greed! Jesus is not impressed by what kind of car you drive, house you live in, or anything you possess; but with how much compassionate, gracious, slow to anger, abounding-in-love, character is present in your homes.<br><br>Form versus Function (5 of 6)  Greek people, people with white skin that come from Europe, and they find their origins in a really big, powerful church in Europe, that has big buildings with apostles names named after them - we see form. We always see form. We were trained to see form, we think in form, everything about us is form. Hebrew people see function. To study our Bible more effectively, we should be people who are training ourself to see function, not form.<br><br>Worries of this Life, Deceitfulness of Wealth (6 of 6)  Jesus says: the worries of this life will keep the word of God from taking root in your life. It&#39;s something that chokes your life out. The other one is the deceitfulness of wealth, which is a lie that says: if I had this I would be happy. Do you have one day in seven, that is unlike any other? If you do, how is it different? Who are the most important people to you? What are you called to be? Is that getting your attention first?<br><br>Publication Date: Oct 07 2013<br>ISBN/EAN13: 1492921246 / 9781492921240<br>Page Count: 324<br>Weight: 2.0 pounds (907g)<br>Binding Type: US Trade Paper (B&amp;W)<br>Trim Size: 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; (21.59 x 27.94 cm) <br>Language: English</span>

Get to understand what Justice and Judgment really mean.<br><br>Wilderness Wisdom (4 sermons)<br>The Bible tells us, that of the people of Israel, the majority of them, God was not really pleased with. He loved them. He saved them. He got the Holy Ghost on them. He did miracles for them. But He was not well pleased with them, it says in 1 Corinthians 10. It takes faith to please God. Why was God not so pleased with them? They were overthrown in the wilderness. When a period, which God designed for their benefit, came into their life, instead of responding in a godly way and understanding what God wanted to do, they fought, wrestled, and eventually fell and failed in that wilderness experience. Jesus had a wilderness experience, it must be important. It can&#39;t be just an Old Testament thing. 1 Corinthians 10 says: it&#39;s a warning, a learning exercise, it&#39;s something for us to learn from, and it says: make sure you don&#39;t make the same mess ups that they made.<br><br>The Slumber of Jezebel (3 sermons)<br>Jezebel set out to destroy all messengers of the Lord, she destroyed prophets wherever she could find them, and raised up instead her own prophetic messengers. They brought a message which they called prophecy, but it was actually speaking words that were demonically empowered and seduced the nation. The nation came under it, literally fell asleep spiritually. In the Old and New Testament, the same spirit power, the same kind of operation, to lead people astray, so they don&#39;t walk in the destiny that God had for them.<br><br>Extravagant Love (6 sermons)<br>Teacher, what&#39;s the great commandment in the law? What&#39;s the most important thing in the Bible? And Jesus said to him - here it is - You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your mind and all your soul. He said: this is the first and great commandment. The second is like it: love your neighbor as yourself. So love God passionately, and love people fervently, including yourself.<br><br>Fig Leaves and Other Coverings (4 sermons)<br>The church of Jesus&#39; day had the Bible, had the promises, had all kinds of things; but they did not have the heart of God for broken, damaged people. Jesus told the story of the Good Samaritan to actually confront what the church of His day was like. It was not connecting to those who were wounded, and desperately in need of healing. <br><br>Unashamed (5 sermons)<br>Sin disconnects us from God, and puts shame around our life; but God wants us to be connected, so I can be myself, I don&#39;t have to wear a mask. I can actually just be true, authentic, genuine, but I have to learn the skills of building good relationships. Shame is an Identity Thief. It steals who we are.<br><br>ISBN/EAN13: 1490941444 / 9781490941448<br>Page Count: 350<br>Binding Type: US Trade Paper (B&amp;W)<br>Trim Size: 8.5&quot; x 11&quot;<br>2.2 pounds (998g)<br>Language: English</span>

            <span id="ctl00_body_ctl22_litDescription" style="font:12px/12px 'Trebuchet MS', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">23 Sermons Transcripts<br><br>The Blood of Jesus (4 sermons)<br>The seven different ways that Jesus bled on the cross represent seven different things that Jesus came to redeem us from, seven things that the blood of Jesus Christ addresses. This series discusses the first use of blood during the passover in Egypt, and then onto the Day of Atonement, where the blood was applied to the mercy seat seven times, and the symbolism of the scapegoat. Sins, Transgressions, and Inequity are compared, and related to exactly how and why Jesus blood was shed for us.<br><br>First Principles (7 sermons)<br>The Foundational Principles of Christianity, according to Hebrews 6:1-3. Jesus is saying we need to get off foundations and move into maturity, not laying again the foundation. Then he begins to describe the foundations, which are explained in depth through this seven-part teaching. <br><br>“Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection, not laying again the foundation of: repentance from dead works; and of faith toward God; of the doctrine of baptisms; and of laying on of hands; and of resurrection of the dead; and of eternal judgment. And this will we do, if God permit.”<br><br>Freedom Conference (4 sermons)<br>Powerful demonstration of the Deliverance Ministry at a 4-day conference in San Diego, based around a detailed explanation the Biblical foundations. This is an important commission for all believers to understand and experience. Mike Connell has a wealth of experience and understanding in this area, and provides exciting teaching and demonstrations.<br><br>Let the Kings Arise (4 sermons)<br>Kings dream. Kings declare. Kings prepare and then kings are generous. You&#39;re called to be a King! Will you live like a servant who&#39;s not enough and always complains and has no dream? Or will you live as a king, begin to dream, begin to declare, begin to prepare and begin to generously give? You have to choose.<br><br>Breaking Free from Victim Mentality (2 sermons)<br>Victim Mentality is a mentality where the person will not take responsibility. They choose rather to make excuses for why life is like it is, and to find someone or something to blame. When you blame someone, you put responsibility on them, you remove it from yourself, and leave yourself powerless and resentful at how life sucks. This is a way of thinking, it&#39;s an internal choice in your heart.<br><br>The Prayer of Kings (2 sermons)<br>How many know you&#39;re royalty, you&#39;re born into a royal family? When you and I give our lives to Jesus Christ, God puts His own spirit and DNA into us. We become changed on the inside through experiencing Christ. We become royalty, part of a kingly family, and of course we need to keep remembering who we are. That&#39;s why he keeps saying: here you are, you are chosen, you&#39;re a generation chosen by God. You&#39;re not a nobody - a nothing. No matter what happened last year, no matter what struggles you had, what pressures, what difficulties, what challenges, today is a new day for God&#39;s chosen people. God has great things ahead for you. He has great things ahead for us. Whether they come about, of course, relies on us making good decisions, and connecting with Him.<br><br>Publication Date:Dec 13 2012<br>ISBN/EAN13: 1481244892 / 9781481244893<br>Page Count: 286<br>1.6 pounds (726g)<br>Binding Type: US Trade Paper (B&amp;W)<br>Trim Size: 8.5&quot; x 11&quot;<br>Language: English</span>
