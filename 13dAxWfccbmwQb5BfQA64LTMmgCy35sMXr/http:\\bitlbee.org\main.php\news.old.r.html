				<h1>Finally, a ui-fix dev snapshot</h1>
				<div class="date">2010-08-06 21:19 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
The ui-fix branch was mentioned here a few times already, now here's the
promised development snapshot. This code's quite stable already (possibly
just as stable as 1.2.8), but needs a just little bit more polishing
before it can be declared a new major release.
</p>

<p>
People who don't care about the last pieces but don't really like running
code from version control can now download BitlBee 1.3dev as a proper tarball.
</p>

<p>
See the changelog and the <a href="http://wiki.bitlbee.org/UiFix">Wiki page</a>
for a full list of changes. And if anything does seem broken, don't forget to
file a bug!
</p>

<p>
If you use Debian or Ubuntu, remember that you can also just use the
<a href="http://code.bitlbee.org/debian/">nightly builds</a>. No need to
pull stuff from version control or to compile anything. Just run apt-get and
you're up to date.

				<hr/>

<p>
All the stuff described in the earlier article about ui-fix (see also the
<a href="http://wiki.bitlbee.org/UiFix">wiki page</a>) is now available
in mainline, and running on <tt>testing.bitlbee.org</tt>. Expect a 1.3
development release soon, while the last remaining features/fixes for
the next major release are done!

				<h1>BitlBee 1.2.8</h1>
				<div class="date">2010-07-04 17:35 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
BitlBee 1.2.8 is ready! Most likely this release is the last one in the 1.2.x
series. A lot of work has happened in other branches (killerbee, ui-fix, etc.)
recently, in preparation for the next major release. Since that code diverted
so much from the current stable release branch, it's about time to focus on
that.
</p>

<p>
For now, enjoy extra bits of Twitter functionality, and some more bugfixes
and minor feature enhancements. If you want more new stuff, feel free to try
out the <a href="http://code.bitlbee.org/wilmer/ui-fix/">ui-fix branch</a>
now already (also running on <tt>testing.bitlbee.org</tt>) or wait for a 
development snapshot that will hopefully come out in the near future.

				<h1>The IRC core rewrite, almost done.</h1>
				<div class="date">2010-06-07 23:58 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
Over the last month I've rewritten most of the IRC core of BitlBee.
This was on the roadmap for a long time, but more a long term plan.
Many feature requests (the most important ones being separate control
channels per account or per contact group) were postponed "until the IRC core rewrite is
done", etc. Now, this work is finally done (or at least nearing completion).
</p>

<p>
The branch can be found at
<a href="http://code.bitlbee.org/wilmer/ui-fix/">http://code.bitlbee.org/wilmer/ui-fix/</a>.
<a href="http://code.bitlbee.org/debian/wilmer-ui-fix/">Debian packages</a>
are also available, as usual. The branch is based on the killerbee branch,
so it also has the file transfer/libpurple functionality.
</p>

<p>

<i>Update (2010-06-08 21:31 (UTC)): testing.bitlbee.org is now running
this code on port 6669. Feel free to give it a try!</i>

				<h1>File transfers and libpurple support</h1>
				<div class="date">2010-06-06 20:17 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
Today I merged libpurple support into the killerbee branch. The killerbee
branch is the slightly more bleeding edge branch of BitlBee. It has things
that are fairly usable but need a little bit more polishing before making
it into a release. See the branch at
<a href="http://code.bitlbee.org/killerbee/">http://code.bitlbee.org/killerbee/</a>,
browse it via Loggerhead or download it using Bazaar.
</p>

<p>
Debian packages are available, as always, via
<a href="http://code.bitlbee.org/debian/">http://code.bitlbee.org/debian/</a>.
Install the plain <tt>bitlbee</tt> package if you want the regular code with
file transfer support for currently just Jabber and the <tt>bitlbee-libpurple</tt>
branch to use any libpurple protocol module you want.
</p>

<p>
For those who don't
know, libpurple is the library used by <a href="http://www.pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a>
(and Adium, Finch, etc.), allowing BitlBee to connect to several
instant messaging networks not currently supported by BitlBee (like Gadu Gadu
and QQ), and adding features to current protocols that are currently not supported
(like MSN status messages and file transfer support for most protocols).
</p>

<p>
Note that libpurple is much heavier on resource usage, and may also be less
stable. The native BitlBee IM protocol modules will always continue to exist.
</p>

<p>
Bug reports for this code are welcome on our bug tracker, and if you have
problems getting this to work, feel free to come to <tt>#bitlbee</tt> on
<tt>irc.oftc.net</tt>.

				<h1>BitlBee Wiki</h1>
				<div class="date">2010-05-22 11:16 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
Several years ago already, we ran a poll on if BitlBee should have a Wiki or not.
Over the last few months, it appeared that many people think there's not enough
clear documentation on-line on how to do stuff with BitlBee. Although BitlBee has
fairly comprehensive help built-in, it's more a reference than anything else.
Docs are available on-line but mostly in the form of some fragmented HOWTOs and
blog posts, often with information that has become obsolete.
</p>

<p>
Having one <a href="http://wiki.bitlbee.org/">BitlBee Wiki</a> will hopefully
fix that problem. I seeded the Wiki with two common FAQs, but there are more.
Please, anyone with some time, please add stuff to it. It's open for anyone to
edit as long as you can solve the (hopefully) simple textchas.

				<h1>BitlBee 1.2.7</h1>
				<div class="date">2010-05-15 15:05 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
BitlBee 1.2.7 was just released with the fix for the MSN Messenger login
issues.
</p>

<p>
It includes some other changes (mostly IM module fixes and a <tt>show_offline</tt>
setting that lets you have your offline contacts in the control channel as well.

				<h1>MSN Messenger login problems: fixed.</h1>
				<div class="date">2010-05-15 00:33 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
If you're getting the following error message while trying to use your MSN
account:
</p>

<p>
Error during Passport authentication: Could not parse Passport server response
</p>

<p>
This is caused by BitlBee being a little bit too restrictive in the responses
it gets from the authentication server. This bug is fixed in
<a href="http://bugs.bitlbee.org/bitlbee/changeset/devel%2C578">bzr</a>
and this code is live on <tt>im.bitlbee.org</tt> and <tt>testing.bitlbee.org</tt>.
A fix will most likely come out as a version 1.2.7 very soon.

				<h1>BitlBee 1.2.6, with Twitter support.</h1>
				<div class="date">2010-04-19 11:11 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
The code's fairly stable now, so ready for a release: Here is BitlBee 1.2.6!
</p>

<p>
The most important new feature must be support for Twitter. Although not all
Twitter features are supported yet, you can already use it now to see Tweets
of people you follow, and post Tweets and direct messages.
</p>

<p>
One note for people who were using the testing version already: The
"use_groupchat" setting was replaced with the "mode" setting, and another
mode was added where all Tweets come from one virtual user. Also, you should
post Tweets via this user. Messages to other Twitter contacts become
direct messages.
</p>

<p>
Apart from Twitter support, this release adds a few other features and bug
fixes. If you want to know it all, just read
<a href="http://bugs.bitlbee.org/bitlbee/browser/devel/doc/CHANGES">the changelog</a>.

				<h1>Twitter support getting ready!</h1>
				<div class="date">2010-04-07 01:00 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
Thanks to hard work done by Geert Mulders, BitlBee now has native support for
Twitter! Stuff will be merged into mainline soon and available on
<tt>testing.bitlbee.org</tt>. If you'd like to test it now already, please do!
</p>

<p>
<tt>bzr branch <a href="http://code.bitlbee.org/contrib/geert-twitter/">http://code.bitlbee.org/contrib/geert-twitter/</a></tt>
and compile.
</p>

<p>
Quick howto: Add the account (<tt>account add twitter &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt;</tt>),
turn it on and see how your contacts appear. By default they will appear in
the control channel and Tweets will be normal messages. You can post Tweets
by sending them to any of your Twitter contacts.
</p>

<p>
If you prefer to keep these things in a separate channel, try <tt>account
set twitter/use_groupchat on</tt>. Anything you write in that channel will
also be converted to Tweets.
</p>

<p>
St. Patrick's Day has already started in Dublin and instead of getting wasted
in the pub, I give you a new release of BitlBee today!
</p>

<p>
What's new? Nothing huge, but a few nice enhancements and fixes for many bugs
that I finally closed over the last few weeks. The ability to see and set status
messages on protocols that support them, improved compatibility with Facebook
XMPP servers, etc.

				<h1>im.bitlbee.org is having issues</h1>
				<div class="date">2009-11-01 23:23 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
im.bitlbee.org is currently down for what was supposed to be a quick reboot
to switch power supplies. Sadly things don't seem to go that well, and five
hours later the machine is still down.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately there's not much else I can tell since I don't own the machine.
It's after midnight local time by now so possibly it's going to be down at
least until local morning.
</p>

<p>
Of course there are still many more <a href="servers.html">public servers</a>
available. Unfortunately BitlBee accounts are not yet universal though, so
you will have to recreate it if you switch. (Fixing this is on our TODO for
a long time and some code already exists.)
</p>

<p>
<i>Update (2009-11-02 08:55 (UTC)): Something went <b>very</b> wrong apparently.

machine somewhere and get things back working in the next few hours.</i>

<p>
I just released BitlBee 1.2.4. It's been more than a year since the last
release and sadly not that much changed. But Yahoo! support is back, 
the program is more stable than ever (running in daemon mode on the testing
server for more than a year already with little problems), and there are
some other nice changes like a better UI for managing chatrooms and support for
automatically joining rooms when you connect.

<p>
The question "is BitlBee dead?" has come up a few times recently, and I kept
denying it, but it's true that it's been a long while since I worked on it.
Until today! I took the time to fix the Yahoo! module, based on work from Siddhesh
Poyarekar on the libyahoo2 mailing list and an anonymous submitter on
<a href="http://bugs.bitlbee.org/bitlbee/ticket/505">ticket about this
issue</a>.</p>

It's now running on <tt>testing.bitlbee.org</tt> (non-SSL only) and if it
keeps working well, I'll hopefully be able to release it soon. If you run
your own server, just get the code from bzr.

				<h1>The bugs we've been hunting</h1>
				<div class="date">2008-09-16 08:04 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
With all the noise around "the bug" behind us a little bit, I guess it's
now time to stop being so vague about the "account hijacking" bugs we've
fixed. I didn't want to give all details right away, to give public
server maintainers some time to upgrade. Only a few maintainers picked
up the fixes, and I don't want to wait any longer.
</p>

<p>
A few weeks ago, while redoing the "set" command a little bit, I discovered
something I didn't really like. When you connect to a BitlBee server and
immediately use "set password" to change your password, even though you
haven't used identify/register yet to get yourself authenticated, BitlBee
just said "Password changed successfully". Although it didn't actually
create an account file yet, one could then use "save" to then get this done.
While the "register" command checks if an account exists before writing to
disk, the "save" command doesn't (and shouldn't). Quickly, 1.2.2 was released.
Why did this happen? It turns out that this problem was with us for some time
already. Previously, the "password" setting was disabled until the user
registers/identifies. This was changed in
<a href="http://bugs.bitlbee.org/bitlbee/changeset/devel%2C71">this bzr revision</a>.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, this wasn't the only problem. It turned out the "register"
command was also not working very well. Although it checked for the
existence of an account before creating it, it did leave a password set
in the BitlBee state structure. This allowed for a very similar exploit,
where after failing to register an account, one could use the "save" command
to get his account saved anyway. This problem was introduced somewhere in
the migration to the storage abstraction layer.
</p>

<p>
All these issues should be gone now, and I'm working on a blackbox testing
system that will continuously check for bugs like this (and also test other
various pieces of BitlBee functionality) to (hopefully) prevent nasty bugs
in the future.
</p>

<p>
Also, I see security advisories about this issue are often wrong about the
"hijacking" part, so I have to repeat this once more: Although this exploit
indeed allows one to create an account on a BitlBee, bypassing all safety
checks (including AuthMode=Registered), it is <i>not</i> possible to use
this bug to gain access to other people's accounts! When someone performs
this attack, he will simply get the victim's account deleted. IM passwords
in BitlBee configuration files are encrypted using the user's password.
There is absolutely no way to figure out these passwords without cracking
the person's BitlBee password.

				<h1>BitlBee 1.2.3, unfortunately another important bugfix</h1>
				<div class="date">2008-09-07 14:24 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
Unfortunately 1.2.2 did not fix all possible account hijacking loopholes.
Another very similar flaw was found by Tero Marttila. In the migration to
the user configuration storage abstraction layer, a few safeguards that
prevent overwriting existing accounts disappeared. Over the week I went over all
the related code to make sure that everything's done in a sane, safe and
consistent way.
</p>

<p>
It looks like not all public servers are up to date yet. If you own one,
please update it as soon as you can to save your users any inconvenience
from losing their account.

				<h1>BitlBee 1.2.2 fixes security bug</h1>
				<div class="date">2008-08-26 22:50 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
I just released BitlBee 1.2.2, and I advice public server maintainers
to upgrade their BitlBee daemons as soon as possible, since this release
fixes a security bug that was probably there for a long time already.
</p>

<p>
It's not a serious bug, it doesn't allow anyone to compromise your server.
It does allow people to hijack accounts, though. Not with gaining access to
the IM accounts or settings of the existing user, it only allows people to
recreate an existing account.
</p>

<p>
Again, your machine (and for the users, your privacy) is not in danger.
But please upgrade anyway to make sure this gap is closed.
</p>

<p>
<i>Update (2008-08-30 14:23 (UTC)): Some testing showed that the bug does
not exist in any 1.0.x release or older. BitlBee 1.1dev/1.2 were the first
releases with this vulnerability.</i>

<p>
Both <tt>testing.bitlbee.org</tt> and <tt>im.bitlbee.org</tt> are now
running a bzr snapshot version of BitlBee that does MSN Passport
authentication the old way. This should resolve the login problems.
A 1.2.2 release will probably come soon, I want this to be stable on
the public servers for a few days first.
</p>

<p>

<p>
This is known for a few days already, but a post on the webpage still
can't hurt, I think. Apparently BitlBee has issues logging into the
MSN Messenger network these days, if your password contains
non-alphanumeric characters or even capitals. It affects some people,
others can still log in. The problem is discussed
<a href="http://bugs.bitlbee.org/bitlbee/ticket/439">in the bug tracker</a>.
</p>

<p>
This seems to affect other clients too. There's one easy fix, which is
reverting to the old non-SOAP authentication method. I'm trying to avoid
doing that since that code was messy. If I can't find any better solution
soon, I'll probably do that and roll it out to the public servers.
</p>

<p>
If you absolutely need MSN to work, you can change your password or switch
back to BitlBeee 1.1.1dev for a while.

				<h1>Happy birthday, BitlBee 1.2.1!</h1>
				<div class="date">2008-06-24 22:54 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
Today (on my watch this day is going to end in five minutes already,
actually..) BitlBee reached the age of six years! Since it's been a while
since the 1.2 release and since there are fixes for a lot of bugs in bzr
by now, I decided to make this a release.
</p>

<p>
This code is running on testing for a while already, with not too many
changes, and it's extremely stable. For the first time, we're actually
running BitlBee in daemon mode for all SSL connections. It's serving
thirty users from just one process, running without any issues for weeks
in a row. This is quite an improvement over the unstable unreliable
program the Bee once used to be!
</p>

<p>
Of course I'm not saying that the program is perfect now, please keep
sending those bug reports. :-) But first, enjoy BitlBee 1.2.1!

				<h1>im.bitlbee.org stability issues</h1>
				<div class="date">2008-05-06 04:47 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
Over the last month, we had some problems with the machine that hosts
<tt>im.bitlbee.org</tt>. It looks like the machine doesn't have enough RAM
to be a mail- and webserver and also have hundreds of BitlBee processes
running. From time to time, it was necessary to kill some BitlBee processes
to free some RAM.
</p>

<p>
In the next few days the machine will get a memory upgrade, we're quite sure
that this will solve this problem. This means that the server is going to be
down for about an hour this week, but after that, it will hopefully run
perfectly again without any interruptions.
</p>

<p>
<i>Update (2008-05-06 15:41 (UTC)): The memory was upgraded successfully
with only around twenty minutes downtime. We're quite confident that all
stability issues are over now.</i>

				<h1>Account cleanup on im.bitlbee.org</h1>
				<div class="date">2008-03-21 00:08 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
Now that the main public server is running BitlBee version 1.2, I had to do a
little cleanup there. One of the changes between 1.2 and older versions is that
BitlBee is no longer case sensitive about your username. In other words,
previously there could be two accounts, "Peter" and "peter". From version 1.2,
this isn't possible anymore, it doesn't matter if you log in as "Peter" or
"peter", it will always be the same account.
</p>

<p>
There is one problem in this transition: There were many "double" accounts on
the server. Sometimes more than just doubles ("Peter", "peter" and "PETER").
Only one of those accounts could stay. I tried to keep the accounts that were
used the most recently and remove the other versions. So if you can't log in
on im.bitlbee.org anymore and your nickname may not be unique, this could be
the reason.
</p>

<p>
Our apologies for this inconvenience, there's no good way to solve this
without some damage. However, there are backups, so just join #bitlbee or send
a mail, and your account can be restored with a different name. Nothing should
be lost permanently.

<p>
For the first time in almost five years, there's a new protocol supported
by BitlBee! If you want to talk to people on Skype, that's now possible.
See the <a href="http://bugs.bitlbee.org/bitlbee/ticket/82">Skype ticket</a>
in the bug tracker. Thanks a lot to vmiklos for all the work! Note that
this isn't integrated in BitlBee and probably won't ever be integrated
because it depends on an external Skype instance and a proxy daemon. However,
the plugin should work just as well as any built-in protocol, and no patching
is required!

<p>
There was a call to <tt>sethostent()</tt> in BitlBee that caused many people
on *BSD some headaches. It was removed the day after 1.0.3 was released (yes,
just one day late :-(), and there were no plans to ever release a 1.0.4
because by now the development tree diverged too much from 1.0.x which makes
backporting changes very hard. But since <tt>sethostent()</tt> is still
a common cause of problems, here's a release to fix this (and not much
more than this).

				<h1>Five years of BitlBee and a new site!</h1>
				<div class="date">2007-06-24 18:48 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
From the README file: "So when Wilmer got the ingenious thought in his mind
while farming, to create an IRC to other chatnetworks gateway ..."
</p>

<p>
That's exactly five years ago now. The first code was written that very same
evening. It was just an IRC framework, but five days later it could actually
talk to people on MSN, and the more complex Gaim modules were added pretty
soon after that. About two months later the first public release was there.
With a lot more work to do, but even back then the Bee gained in popularity
very quickly, more than we expected.
</p>

<p>
It took a few more years to reach the 1.0 version number. Things may have
seemed pretty quiet after that, there weren't too many stable releases. But
the Bee is certainly not dead! Lots of cool things are happening in the
development tree, including a Jabber module rewrite, finally adding the most
important missing feature in BitlBee: Support for Jabber chatrooms. It will
take a little while before this code will be ready for a stable release, but
impatient people can soon download a new 1.1dev snapshot to try it out!
</p>

<p>
Anyway, to celebrate the fifth birthday of BitlBee, here's a shiny new website
designed by Erik Bosman. Thanks a lot for all your time, Erik! Most pages should
work properly now, some might still look a bit funny. If you see anything
strange, please report it by IRC/mail.

				<h1>BitlBee 1.1dev</h1>
				<div class="date">2007-02-19 00:06 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
It's a long time ago since the last BitlBee release. Lots of things happened,
but just in the development branch, which diverted too much from the 1.0.x
branch by now. To encourage people to try out this new code, we decided to
release BitlBee 1.1dev. The 1.1.x branch will be a bit like what odd-versioned
Linux kernels used to be (except that with BitlBee they should be pretty safe
and stable, just with some rough edges).
</p>

<p>
This code is running on <tt>testing.bitlbee.org</tt> and some other servers
for some time already and seems to be pretty good. Two major improvements
are a better (and more secure) file format used to store your accounts and
buddy information, and a rewrite of the Jabber module. Also, for people who
don't like inetd, there's a ForkDaemon mode now. It's like daemon mode, but
every client gets its own process, to prevent blocking/crashing problems
from affecting other users.
</p>

<p>
Please try it out and report any problem you find!

Okay, things are a bit messy. <tt>testing.bitlbee.org</tt> is down for a
couple of days already, and for now we can't tell when it'll be back. The
machine was going down in the beginning of 2007 anyway, but just a few days
too early the hardware died. Currently we can't access the files on the
server, but most likely the datacenter operator will give access to these
files soon, so then people can hopefully transfer their accounts.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately we don't have another machine available to host this service.
So unfortunately it's impossible to give an ETA. My apologies for posting

<p>
The public testing server now runs a bzr snapshot of the new Jabber module,
which also includes the XML storage backend. This means there can be
problems. Possibly you're using a Jabber server BitlBee can't deal with yet.
Also there can be problems in the XML backend. Both the new Jabber module
and the XML storage backend seem to be stable and reliable, but they both
certainly do need testing.
</p>

<p>
If you find any problem, please do report it! Also, if you have problems
logging into the server your account might have been removed. Because the new
XML backend is case <i>insensitive</i> when it comes to nicknames and the
old one wasn't, we had to remove some dupes. See the MOTD for more
information.

				<hr/>

<p>
Today I finally merged the storage-xml branch into the main development
version of BitlBee. There weren't any changes for a long time and the code
seems to be pretty reliable. Hopefully this way more people will test it,
so that it'll soon be good enough for a release.
</p>

<p>
It's not clear yet what the next release will be. Possibly there are still
some more improvements that can be backported to the 1.0.x branch, but it's
getting harder and harder because of many code changes. Maybe there will
soon be a 1.1 pre-release for the impatient and curious people.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the Jabber module is also being rewritten completely. Things look
good. The rewrite fixes many problems we had with the old module and will
eventually also support Jabber groupchats. The improvements right now are:
Real XMPP 1.0 support (including SASL authentication and TLS instead of SSL),
better handling of buddies using multiple clients at once, proper handling
of SRV records (so connecting to Google Talk is just a matter of
<tt>account add jabber account@gmail.com password</tt>), typing notifications
(using XEP85, which isn't supported by all Jabber clients yet) and probably
more.
</p>

<p>
One last improvement in the new module I'm very happy about: Way more
compact code. The old Jabber module imported a huge XML parser from Mozilla,
consisting of at least 9000 lines of code. The new module implements its own
very compact XML tree handler (and uses the SAX XML parser from GLib), and
as a result the new module consists of only 3019 lines of code at the moment
(compare this to the 13926 lines in the old module!). A bzr branch with this
new Jabber module can be found
<a href="http://code.bitlbee.org/wilmer/new-jabber/">here</a> (or via
<a href="http://code.bitlbee.org/hgweb/wilmer.jabber">hgweb</a>).

It must pretty cold in hell, now that there's a bzr branch of
<a href="http://code.bitlbee.org/contrib/mek-ft/">BitlBee with file transfer

a news posting is necessary to draw some more attention. It only works for MSN

				<div class="date">2006-07-01 10:17 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
Sometimes it happens that some user accounts gets damaged when the
<tt>im.bitlbee.org</tt> server is shutting down. We don't know why this happens
exactly, but most likely it's because all (over 400) BitlBee processes
receive a SIGTERM at once and there's not enough time for all of them to
save their accounts and settings.
</p>

<p>
So if, after downtime, your accounts seems to be unusable, please report
the problem to us by e-mail or on IRC (see the <a href="contact.html">contact
page</a>) so we can fix it for you and to all the other accounts that got
damaged.
</p>

<p>
But of course, we'll do our best to make sure it won't be necessary. Hopefully
giving the BitlBee processes some more time to clean up will be enough.

				<h1>Happy birthday BitlBee! Here's your 24th release!</h1>
				<div class="date">2006-06-24 14:22 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
Happy birthday BitlBee! Your first line of code was written four years ago
today! And to celebrate it, today BitlBee 1.0.3 came out. With lots of
small changes and bugfixes, including more stability improvements. People
who are getting sick of ICQ authorization requests from spammers will also
<a href="http://bugs.bitlbee.org/bitlbee/ticket/128">like this release</a>.
Just read the changelog for more information.
</p>

<p>
Oh well, I admit, actually this release on this day is a pure coincidence,
I only noticed the date when writing the changelog entry. ;-)

				<h1>im.bitlbee.org down</h1>
				<div class="date">2006-05-10 22:13 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
Just a quick note, because probably many people will check this news page
and expect to see an item about it: im.bitlbee.org went down again about
an hour ago. It's not completely down, most people who are still connected
can still use it. However, it doesn't accept new connections anymore, and
we can't SSH into the box either ATM.
</p>

<p>
The owner of the box will take a look at it in the morning/afternoon (CEST,
it's midnight here now), and he'll hopefully be able to bring the box back
up pretty quickly. Our apologies for the inconvenience, and we hope everything
will be back to normal ASAP!

				<h1>BitlBee 1.0.2</h1>
				<div class="date">2006-04-01 19:17 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
Even though today might be a bad day to release anything, we're doing it
anyway. :-) See the <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a> if you want to
know what's new. Probably not much, it's another maintenance release.
If you're really interested in new stuff, try our development version! It
has a lot of nice things, especially for public servers.

				<h1>At last, webcam support!</h1>
				<div class="date">2006-04-01 08:29 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
All the complaints and all the begging didn't help, but now that Wilmer's
girlfriend bought a webcam, he finally realized that having webcam support
is indeed <i>essential</i> for the average IRC geek (or at least, for him).
So we've been thinking, and thought of the following possibilities.
</p>

<p>
First of all, we've found a patched version of
<a href="http://www.chat.org.uk/downloads/mschat.htm">MS Comic Chat</a> with
webcam extensions! With webcam DCC channels between your IRC client and
BitlBee, BitlBee can send and receive complete webcam streams from and to
your computer!
</p>

<p>
For the unfortunate people who can't run Comic Chat (those poor people still
waiting for Comic Chat .NET), there's also hope. Obviously we don't want
to leave them behind. Hey, we don't even run Windows ourselves! So we found
some <a href="http://aa-project.sourceforge.net/aalib/">great software</a>
to <a href="/img/webcam2.png">display webcam pictures in usual DCC chats</a>.
As you see you can't see everything very well, but of course we're working on
it!
</p>

<p>
If you want to beta-test this code, get it
<a href="http://code.bitlbee.org/webcam/">from BZR</a> and have fun!
Unfortunately the Comic Chat extensions are a bit hard-to-find because of
legal reasons, but you should be able to find it using your favourite P2P
file swapping program.
</p>

				<h1>BitlBee and PSP</h1>
				<div class="date">2006-03-22 11:52 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
As seen on some PlayStation Portable sites, there's now a PSP instant messaging
applet called <a href="http://localhost.geek.nz/afkim/">AFKIM</a>. Cool thing
is, the program relies on BitlBee public servers for the IM-protocol part. So
although this isn't a port of BitlBee to the PSP, it'll be a nice one for the
screenshots page (which certainly needs some updates soon). :-)
</p>

<p>
Not too much activity in BitlBee development lately, but this might change soon. Also,
a 1.0.2 release might come soon, since there are quite a few bugfixes again.
And maybe some new features...
</p>

				<h1>"BitlBack": No ICQ problems, BTS a success!</h1>
				<div class="date">2006-02-14 17:23 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
Just some quick notes. First of all, as far as we know right now, BitlBee is
<i>not</i> affected by the ICQ/OSCAR protocol change. Many people asked about
it by now, but nobody reported problems yet. We talked to the people of
<a href="http://gaim.sf.net/">Gaim</a> and they said something similar. A
project as big as Gaim should've had reports by now. Since BitlBee and Gaim
both use the same OSCAR protocol code, most likely BitlBee also won't need
fixing.
</p>

<p>
Also, it's maybe nice to mention that there are already over 100 bugs (or
feature requests, mainly) in the <a href="http://bugs.bitlbee.org/">bug
tracking system</a>! Some of them are a bit
<a href="http://bugs.bitlbee.org/bitlbee/ticket/91">useless</a>, but still,
it seems the BTS was a good idea!
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, BitlBee development is a bit slower these days. It'll surely come
back, actually there is some code for LDAP support already, but it will need
a lot of testing. Stay tuned! :-)
</p>

				<h1>Testing server now running in daemon mode</h1>
				<div class="date">2006-01-19 23:36 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
Tonight we upgraded BitlBee on the testing server to the IPC branch. It's now
running in ForkDaemon mode, which might soon replace inetd mode. The traditional
BitlBee daemon mode is still not very reliable. The risk of all connections
going down because of a problem with only one of them is still too big. So now,
in the development branch, there's a ForkDaemon mode, which is basically
daemon mode with a call to <tt>fork()</tt> before creating the client structures,
to make sure every client gets its own process.
</p>

<p>
So it's pretty much the same as inetd/bitlbeed, but it might decrease the
memory footprint, and it's easier to set up. Also, in this IPC branch there
is code that allows the BitlBee processes to talk to each other. This is
mainly interesting for people who maintain public servers because they can
now announce downtime, upgrades etc to their users.
</p>

<p>
If you maintain a public server, feel free to try this out!

				<h1>Google Talk opens up for the Jabber world</h1>
				<div class="date">2006-01-17 18:10 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
Ever since the introduction of Google Talk people complained that, although it
uses the open Jabber protocol, it was a very limited implementation, with no
support for server-to-server connections. In other words, Google Talk users
could only talk to other Google Talk users so far. It seemed Google did this
to control who can get on the network, and who can't. Spam prevention.
Probably because Google accounts can't be created automatically, while most
other Jabber servers don't, and in fact it should be easy to write a program
that pretends to be a Jabber server and you can send IM-spam as easily as it
is for e-mail.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, it seems like Google changed their mind, since this evening someone
with a GMail.com address added me (JID wilmer@gaast.net) to his contact list.
We had a conversation without any problems. Way to go, Google!
</p>

<p>
Just to be sure, I tested this myself. I added a Google Talk user to my
Jabber.Com test account contact list, and it also works! :-)
</p>

groupchat support for AIM). Meanwhile there's a lot of work going on in the

				<h1>Problems with im.bitlbee.org solved?</h1>
				<div class="date">2005-12-09 11:40 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
As you might have noticed, the server is back for a while already. You might have
noticed too, that it was running on a different host for a while. Arnie, from
#bitlbee, was kind enough to donate some of his server resources to BitlBee and
host the server for a while. At the time I write this, around 150 people are
still connected to it.
</p>

<p>
However, the original server is back now. There's a new hard-drive installed,
hopefully this will solve most of the problems. It will be down for a short while
again in a week or two, when they will move the servers to a new rack. But after
then, hopefully everything will work as normal again for a long time.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, we started working on some storage abstraction layer, the first step
to full LDAP support. When we finish this, server downtime shouldn't be a big
issue anymore, since accounts will be stored on an LDAP-server, so your account
should be usable on multiple servers. Until then, we hope there won't be too
many problems anymore. Thanks for all your patience, and have a buzzing time! :-)
</p>

<p>
Note: It's possible that your account might be missing or corrupted. There was
some pretty serious filesystem corruption on the machine. Also, settings you
save on Arnie's server will stick there, so if you're currently connected to
that machine, you might notice some lost settings when you reconnect. Of course
you can choose to stay connected to Arnie's server. Just set your IRC client
to connect to <tt>im.okkernoot.net</tt> instead. Lots of thanks to Arnie for
his help!

				<h1>Problems with im.bitlbee.org</h1>
				<div class="date">2005-12-07 15:00 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
The maintainer of the <tt>im.bitlbee.org</tt> mailed me that there are hardware
problems with the server. The hard drive is getting too hot. In one or two weeks,
there will probably be a new rack available for the server, with better cooling.
Until then, im.bitlbee.org will be down (or at least not running on this machine).
</p>

<p>
You can use one of the other <a href="servers.html">servers</a> instead.
Unfortunately, your account will probably not exist there yet. We'll try to
make this possible too. We apologize for the inconvenience.
</p>

<p>
<b>Update:</b> From time to time you might be able to connect to the server
now. However, the server is still having serious stability issues, with
reboots from time to time. It seems that the HDD is dying. We're trying to
get a new box up to run <tt>im.bitlbee.org</tt> (with the right account
files) for a couple of weeks while waiting for the current box to get fixed.
This will take a day or two, until then the stability of the
<tt>im.bitlbee.org</tt> won't be fantastic. There's nothing we can do about
this, unfortunately.

Yeah, we did it! We managed to release BitlBee 1.0 before Duke Nukem Forever!
We hope this will be a worthy 1.0 release. We did our best for it, and we
tried to get rid of all serious bugs we could find before this release.
Considering the stability of BitlBee on the public servers, it seems we
succeeded, so this will hopefully not be the typical 1.0-beta release.

				<h1>0.93 stability issues</h1>
				<div class="date">2005-11-01 22:05 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
On our testing server we noticed quite a lot of crashes with the new version.
Turns out that there's a small memory initialization problem in the OSCAR
module. Fortunately this only seems to cause problems when closing BitlBee
(or possibly the OSCAR connection), so most people won't even notice.
</p>

<p>
We're planning another release pretty soon, so we won't do a release now to
fix just this problem. However, for the people who have problems, we got a

<p>
Version 1.0 and file transfer support are becoming the "Duke Nukem Forever"
in #bitlbee. This is fine, but this doesn't mean we can at least release
0.93. Basically this release is because we had too much in -devel to keep it
unreleased for so long. I took this evening to take a closer look at the
one bug that is stopping us from releasing 1.0. Maybe it'll come before
the end of the year. :-)
</p>

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> Forgot to change the version string in 0.93. Don't want to
replace the 0.93 tarball anymore since people already downloaded it, so
instead, here we got 0.93a. :-)

				<h1>BitlBee and Google Talk</h1>
				<div class="date">2005-08-24 08:01 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
Many people already asked if BitlBee can connect to Google Talk. To answer
this question correctly: Now it can. You have to keep two things in mind
to make it work. First of all, the Google server <i>requires</i>
SSL-connections. Without SSL it won't do any authentication. Also, BitlBee
didn't handle situations where the part after the @ in the Jabber handle
is <i>not</i> the Jabber server very well. There's a
<a href="http://get.bitlbee.org/patches/bitlbee-jabberserver.patch">patch</a>
available for this. If you're in a rush, you can also make a small change to
your <tt>hosts</tt> file. Just add gmail.com and make it resolve to the IP of
<tt>talk.google.com</tt>.
</p>

<p>
If you decided to use the patch, you can specify an alternate server as an extra
argument to <tt>account add</tt>. For example, to add your Google Talk account
you can type:
</p>

<pre>account add jabber myaccount@gmail.com mypass talk.google.com:5222:ssl</pre>

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> (Update, added 12:20 UTC) For some people the line also works
without the <tt>5222</tt> part, but for many it doesn't. Google says on their
site they only accept Jabber connections via port 5222, while BitlBee uses
port 5223 by default for SSL-connections. If BitlBee hangs for you when trying
to connect, you probably forgot to specify this port number.
<b>Update:</b> (added 2005-09-04 13:56 UTC) Apparently for some other people
only port 5223 works, not 5222. It's probably best to just try out what works
best for you. Hopefully this will get better later.

				<h1>im.bitlbee.org in trouble</h1>
				<div class="date">2005-07-02 14:41 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
Many people noticed already that our main public server, <tt>im.bitlbee.org</tt>,
is down. By now it's down for almost 48 hours already, and unfortunately we
can't tell exactly when it'll come back. The owner told us the hard drive died
and will be replaced, but we don't have an ETA. Also, we don't know what's left
of the user accounts.
</p>

<p>
We apologize for the inconvenience, but we'd also like to point out that there
are <a href="http://www.bitlbee.org/main.php/servers.html">many more public
servers</a> available. It can't hurt to spread the load a bit, so if you want
your buddies back, you can switch.
</p>

<p>
(Unfortunately public servers don't share user accounts yet, but that's also a
thing on our long-term TODO.)

				<h1>Still no 1.0. What about 0.92?</h1>
				<div class="date">2005-02-23 23:17 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
Although most voters <a href="http://www.bitlbee.org/main.php/news.html?pq_id=7&action=Results">seemed
to prefer a late 1.0 release</a>, we decided to release 0.92 now. Because it
fixes lots of bugs, including some that were bothering many people
already. Also, there are some security fixes (although none of the security
problems is really serious). Getting this code out gives us more time to
fix the last problem left that keeps us from finally releasing version 1.0.
</p>

<p>
So in this 0.92 version, we work around this problem. It might be a dirty
work-around, but in the end it's not any different from 0.91 or any other
previous version. It's a long story, if you really want to know what this
problem is about exactly, just ask.
</p>

<p>
Oh well, what else to say? Have fun with probably the longest-awaited
BitlBee release ever! :-)

				<div class="date">2005-02-03 15:16 UTC</div>

<p>
Although we'd love to release 1.0, it's still not possible. There are some
stability issues, we see them happen every day on the testing server (even
though most other people don't seem to have these problems), and obviously
we don't want those bugs in a release, certainly not a 1.0 release.
</p>

<p>
Fixing this problem will probably be pretty hard, so 1.0 is not getting
close. Working around the problem is possible though, so maybe we'll release
BitlBee 0.92 soon. Stay tuned! :-)

<p>
Although we sometimes promised to release BitlBee 1.0 before the end of
the year, we're probably not going to make it. Mainly because the lead
developer is busy with work and will be on vacation for about a month.
There are quite a lot of changes in -devel already, waiting to be
released, but unfortunately there are too many nasty bugs in it to
release it right now.
</p>

<p>
We hope everyone can wait for just a short while longer for BitlBee 1.0
to come out. It'll come out eventually, we just don't want to hurry it
and release something that isn't worth releasing (especially as 1.0) yet.

<p>
We moved to a new server again. After two days of downtime,
<tt>im.bitlbee.org</tt> should be back up now. We're sorry for the troubles
caused during the last two days (sorry for everyone who accidentally joined
the real IRC server also running on that machine, possibly sharing their
passwords with everyone else) and hope things will be stable for the next
few months now.
</p>

<p>
Again, to all the people who switched to the testing server, please go

really capable of hosting 200 users.

Lately, the server hosting im.bitlbee.org seems to reboot quite often for
an unknown reason. Because BitlBee doesn't run as a system service on that
machine, it isn't restarted automatically after a reboot, so the server has
been unusuable for quite long periods a couple of times by now.
</p>

<p>
We're sorry for the inconvenience, and we'll try to make BitlBee start
automatically from now on and/or find a better place for im.bitlbee.org.

<p>
And in other news, we moved <tt>im.bitlbee.org</tt> to a new server. Most
users won't really notice a difference, but we expect this server to be
more capable of handling the large amount of users (over 200) we have
lately.
</p>

<p>
Users of the server might notice that they lost some settings they saved on
the old server, because they won't be copied to the new server after now.
</p>

<p>
<b>Update:</b> If you're having trouble connecting to the new server, try
to connect via port number 6666 instead of 6667. This should fix the problem.

BitlBee 0.91 is finally ready! With support for server-side buddy lists on

this release is hopefully a big improvement over 0.90(a) for most users.

The server-side buddy list support seems to be stable. Also, there is better

can think of in your ICQ conversations - as long as the client on the other
side also has Unicode support.
</p>

<p>
The new code is running on <tt>testing.bitlbee.org</tt>, please try it out if
you used to experience problems with non-ASCII characters in ICQ conversations!

With a rewrite of the MSN module, support for ICQ server-side buddy lists
(not yet perfect in -devel right now, but we'll sort that out before the

probably be one of the coolest BitlBee releases ever.

				<hr/>

<p>
Now that the April Fool's fun is over (we hope you didn't get too fond of
Clippy ;-), there's some, possibly, more interesting news. It appears that
stunnel can be used to provide SSL-protected access to BitlBee servers to
IRC clients (as long as they support SSL, of course...). People who want to
try out can connect to <tt>testing.bitlbee.org:6668</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, this doesn't mean ultimate security. At least parts of the traffic
between the BitlBee server and the IM-services are still unencrypted, and so
is the traffic between the IM-services and the person you're talking to. But
it's a nice start, and this way people won't be able to sniff your passwords
from your BitlBee connection anymore.
</p>

<p>
By the way, as some people might've found out, <tt>im.bitlbee.org</tt> and
<tt>testing.bitlbee.org</tt> currently point at one and the same host, because
there were still some problems with the new server. We hope to have this fixed
soon.

				<hr/>

<p>
Because the old server didn't seem to handle the large number of users on the
server very well anymore, we moved the official stable public BitlBee server
to a new home. Niacin offered us to use his server with too many spare CPU
cycles.
</p>

<p>
The development BitlBee server still runs on the old machine for now.
Obviously, this one is not reachable at <tt>im.bitlbee.org:6668</tt> anymore,
so you'll have to change your configuration a bit. For the development version,
you now have to connect to <tt>testing.bitlbee.org:6667</tt>.
</p>

<p>
So for <tt>im.bitlbee.org:6667</tt> users, nothing really changed. Obviously,
all the configuration files have been copied from the old server to the new
one, but some changes might've gotten lost. We hope this is not too much of
a problem for you all.

<a href="http://cgi.bitlbee.org/">cgi.bitlbee.org</a> was taken offline some
time ago because of bandwidth overuse. Now it's running on a server with less
restrictive bandwidth limitations. All the accounts from the old server have
been moved to this server, so former cgi.bitlbee.org users can just use this
server now.

				<h1>0.85a released</h1>
				<div class="date">2004-03-23 23:00 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
0.85a is just a little bugfix release, with some bugfixes from the current
-devel backported to 0.85. We just thought there were too many small bugs
in 0.85.
</p>

<p>
We'll hopefully not have to release anything else before 0.90.

				<h1>MSN login problem fixed</h1>
				<div class="date">2004-03-15 23:00 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
Some people reported problems when trying to log into MSN with BitlBee
&ge;0.84. This problem is fixed now, and we recommend people experiencing
this kind of problems to try a recent development version or apply
<a href="http://get.bitlbee.org/patches/bitlbee-0.84-passport.diff">this
patch</a>.
</p>

<p>
Although we're working on 0.90, we might release a 0.85a soon, to fix all
the little problems 0.85 has.

<p>
One of the BitlBee team members resigned from the project: Sjoerd Hemminga,
also known as <tt>lucumo</tt>. We want to thank him for everything he's done
for the project, and we're glad that he's still willing to write the
<a href="speech_0.80.html">release speeches</a>. However, since 0.90 is far
from being released right now, you'll have to live with just a
<a href="goodbee.html">goodbee speech</a>. ;-)

				<h1>Some 0.85 release notes</h1>
				<div class="date">2004-03-14 23:00 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
There are some small problems again when compiling on some non-Linux
systems (*BSD). BitlBee uses <tt>strndup()</tt> at some places, but that call
is GNU libc specific. If you experience problems when trying to compile
BitlBee on non-Linux systems, replace every call to <tt>strndup()</tt> to
<tt>g_strndup()</tt>. Or just use this
<a href="http://get.bitlbee.org/patches/bitlbee-0.85-strndup.diff">patch</a>.

				<h1>0.85 released</h1>
				<div class="date">2004-03-12 23:00 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
Probably the last release in the 0.8x series, with quite a nice list of new
features and bugfixes. We'll be preparing for 0.90 now, see you in a couple of
months, hopefully!
</p>

<p>
Additionally, there's a brand new MSN module in the current -devel tree. (20040314
and newer) It is supposed to be more stable than the old one, and it will have
some cool features the previous version didn't have. It wasn't ready to be
released with 0.85 yet, but it's running on <tt>im.bitlbee.org<b>:6668</b></tt>
now. Everyone is more than welcome to test this version, because we want to be
sure that it does everything the old module did, and more, and we can't do that
without help. Especially people who experienced stability problems when using
the old MSN module are "wanted".

				<h1>Native Win32 port and new server</h1>
				<div class="date">2004-03-10 23:00 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
After running this site on a cable box for half a year, we have moved it to a
heavier server now. The people at
<a href="http://www.mediadesign.nl/">MediaDesign</a> offered us free hosting
for the project, which we really appreciate. The site used to have a slow
link to the other continents, we hope to have this problem fixed now.
Thanks to MediaDesign, and of course Martin, who used to host this site.
</p>

<p>
And in other news today, there is a native Win32 port of BitlBee now. See
the <a href="http://jelmer.vernstok.nl/oss/bitlbee-win/">BitlBee-win</a>
site for some nifty screenshots and the port. It's still experimental, but
it certainly looks promising!

				<h1>Support for Yahoo! groupchats</h1>
				<div class="date">2004-02-25 23:00 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
Yahoo! groupchats work with BitlBee now. If you want to try them, get the
latest version or connect to <tt>im.bitlbee.org<b>:6668</b></tt>. Obviously,
since this functionality is quite experimental, it requires lots of testing,
and please report any bug/problem you find.
</p>

<p>
Actually, there are many more changes in -devel, so if you feel like experimenting
and testing things a bit, please help.

				<div class="date">2004-02-12 23:00 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
Now again with Yahoo! support, and finally without libsoup annoyances. Of course
MSN will still work, but it uses libgnutls directly now. This also means we can
upload a BitlBee with MSN support to Debian and other systems. Have fun!
</p>

<p>
(Fink package will come later, I'll have to find out how it works exactly first...
GnuTLS is still uninstallable, it seems.)

				<h1>Yahoo!</h1>
				<div class="date">2004-02-07 23:00 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
We got Yahoo! support again. We'll keep it in -devel for a couple of days to
see how it works. 0.84 will probably come out in (less than) a week. If you can't
wait, just go for the development version.
</p>

<p>
Also, now that we don't use the Gaim code for Yahoo! anymore (we use
<a href="http://libyahoo2.sourceforge.net/">libyahoo2</a> now), we're sure
BitlBee is not affected by any of the Gaim security bugs mentioned before.
Except for the bug with proxy server handling, but BitlBee doesn't use this
code at the moment. We fixed this bug anyway.

Welcome to the new BitlBee site. The content isn't any different, most parts
of the layout are still the same too, but the navigation is improved, and we
got a separate news page now. We hope you like it.

				<h1>Sick of patching libsoup?</h1>

<p>
See the <a href="http://get.bitlbee.org/patches/">patch repository</a> (or pick
a recent development version) for a patch which removes the libsoup dependency
from BitlBee. Seems to work well, BitlBee 0.84 will probably have this patch.

				<h1>Gaim Security Announcement</h1>
				<div class="date">2004-01-25 23:00 UTC</div>
				<hr/>

<p>
According to <a href="http://lists.netsys.com/pipermail/full-disclosure/2004-January/016138.html">this mailinglist post</a>,
there are some security issues with the current version of Gaim. We haven't yet
thoroughly checked which of these also apply to BitlBee, but we're quite sure
that only the first six items affect BitlBee. And since the Yahoo! module still
doesn't work completely, there is no hurry in fixing this. Just FYI.
</p>

<p>
We're making a bit progress on getting Yahoo! back to work. You can find a patch
in <a href="http://get.bitlbee.org/patches/">the patch repository</a>, although
it doesn't seem to work for everyone yet.
