	About irb
    </span>
    <p />
    Hello, I'm irb. You might be wondering what "irb" means; well, some say it
    stands for "Industrial Radiation Burns". Others say "It Really Boots!" or "I
    Remember Blackadder". I've even heard people talk about Irksome Random Bits
    (especially because I Read Books). If you want to know the truth though, it's
    really bloated, at least according to the implacable recidivist bourgeosie.

    <p />
    This is a personal site and hardly ever gets updated. What you're looking at
    now will be remarkably similar to what you'll be looking at if you check
    back in <strike>2009</strike> 2015 (that is, of course, if we haven't suffered
    total annihilation at the hands of our triggerhappy overlords by then). As
    such, it will probably be of little use to people who either don't know me or
    don't want <a href="keys/">my PGP keys</a>. (see below); it is <b>not</b> under
    any sort of "construction", uses no &lt;blink&gt; tags, and is so standards
    compliant it is being reccomended as an RFC.

    <p />
    <i>Note: This site, this page really, was written in ... oh, must be 2002 or
    something, in HTML4 strict. I've "upgraded" it to XHTML and, in the process,
    nearly hurt myself looking at the source. Tables? Width specs? My word.  Most
    of that is gone now and you can safely return to your lives unassaulted by
    hypertext markup nightmares.</i>

    Okay, fine. Maybe I will update this silly thing from now on. No promises though.

   For many years I have been looking for a simple way to keep config files in
   a repository (so you can roll back changes, deploy them on new machines,
   etc). I hacked together a clever GNU Make / CVS monstrosity back in 2000 or
   so, and made a half-hearted stab at recreating it with Subversion. It looks
   like git may be what I'm looking for though, because I can commit to a
   local repository and make further changes there without mucking up the
   central server with a bunch of garbage other clients don't need, want, or
   care about (and I don't want to set up puppet just so I can sync changes to
   ~user/.vimrc). (Also, cfengine is evil; and not in a fun way.)

   <p />
   Also, you can find me on the air at KF7SJD.
