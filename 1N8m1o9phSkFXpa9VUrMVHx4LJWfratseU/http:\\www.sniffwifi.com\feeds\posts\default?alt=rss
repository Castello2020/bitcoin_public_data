style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;I recently got into a little tiff on Twitter. &amp;nbsp;In part it was an argument about blogging and reaching a broad audience, but mostly it was about site surveys. &amp;nbsp;Site surveys are hot right now, but I find that surveyors often overlook an important aspect of WiFi: different devices act differently.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Conventional wisdom for WiFi site surveys is to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flukenetworks.com/products/airmagnet-survey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ekahau.com/wifidesign&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tamos.com/products/wifi-site-survey/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wolfwifi.com/index-2.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;software&lt;/a&gt;, upload a floorplan and start a-surveyin&#39;. &amp;nbsp;First predictive (letting the software estimate where coverage will go), then active (temporarily mounting access points in the locations chosen in the predictive survey and testing connectivity) and finally verification (walking the site after APs have been installed). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with all three types of surveys (predictive, active and verification) is that they are done with site survey software. &amp;nbsp;Site survey software is great for selling APs or pacifying execs, but it usually requires using a specific adapter. &amp;nbsp;So every time you verify connectivity or see a certain received signal strength (RSSI), you&#39;re not testing the network for users. &amp;nbsp;You&#39;re testing the network for your survey adapter. &amp;nbsp;Usually, that means that your site survey software is giving you deceptive information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a little test to illustrate the problem of different adapters acting differently. &amp;nbsp;I went out on my back patio and brought several WiFi devices to see RSSI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I used AirMagnet WiFi Analyzer to view the RSSI of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NUW5NA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B002NUW5NA&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=snwi0f-20&amp;amp;linkId=4NWMYBQCT7A43U2N&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Proxim 8494&lt;/a&gt; (which is the same thing as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ekahau.com/userData/ekahau/wifi-design/documents/NIC-300-USB-datasheet_letter.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NIC-300&lt;/a&gt; if you use Ekahau Site Survey).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SB3IEpVSr58/U7XXqUIyzeI/AAAAAAAAAZg/AHfPRSMHqbs/s1600/AirMagnetRSSI.png&quot;

style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The screenshot above shows an RSSI (circled in red) of -66 dBm, which is solid. &amp;nbsp;The graph above the RSSI shows that it fluctuated, but always stayed above -70 dBm.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;I then viewed the RSSI of three devices.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;My MacBook Air (802.11n - 2 streams) showed -71 dBm in the screen shot below, for the most part stayed BELOW -70 dBm with some moments above.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;

text-align: left;&quot;&gt;My iPhone 5 (not 5s or 5c), which has supports single stream 802.11n, was recorded at -72 dBm (seen below) and went as low as -79 dBm. &amp;nbsp;The iPhone did have moments above -70 dBm, but was consistently lower than the MacBook Air&#39;s RSSI.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6lbLPtUhLpM/U7XZOkJNvRI/AAAAAAAAAZ4/sk8fyTksKWE/s1600/iPhoneRSSI.PNG&quot;

style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;That makes things tough. &amp;nbsp;Most WiFi networks are going to support a heck of a lot more iPhones and MacBook Airs than USB adapters. &amp;nbsp;If I were to rely on that Proxim 8494/Ekahau NIC-300 adapter while surveying, I would be off by a few decibels. &amp;nbsp;In some cases a three to five dB difference may not matter, but in some cases it could create what I call &quot;Dead Zones&quot;, where the survey shows coverage but users get unacceptable WiFi access.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;(There was some good news. &amp;nbsp;My Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (below) showed a signal strength more of less on par with the RSSI of the USB adapter. &amp;nbsp;I took a screenshot at -67 dBm using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer&amp;amp;hl=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WiFi Analyzer app from farproc&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6DTV2WdcYUY/U7XbW9V33UI/AAAAAAAAAaM/YhqDRU0VTaE/s1600/signal.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em;

text-align: left;&quot;&gt;So, reading RSSI in site survey software is a problem. &amp;nbsp;Great. &amp;nbsp;Now what do we do about it?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;One direction I&#39;ve been taking is to focus more on using actual devices and less on site survey software. &amp;nbsp;That means more focus on the &quot;active&quot; survey and less on the &quot;verification&quot;. &amp;nbsp;The verification survey is necessary if you have a manager or executive who likes looking at colors over a floorplan, but I&#39;ve found myself avoiding that whenever possible. &amp;nbsp;I think it&#39;s better to spend more time testing service to temporarily mounted APs using real devices and less time selling the traditional walk-around survey.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt;***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you like my blog, you can support it by shopping through my&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;tag=snwi0a-20&quot;

To Make Things Better?</title><description>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;I defend Apple a lot. &amp;nbsp;When &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/071607-duke-iphone.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Network World wrongly accused&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;original iPhone of flooding Duke University&#39;s network, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/071607-duke-iphone.html#comment-289358326&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I defended Apple&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;(It was later found to be a Cisco problem.) &amp;nbsp;When a health care provider I was doing some work for blamed SIP-enabled iPhones for a VoIP problem, I eventually &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sniffwifi.com/2013/11/sometimes-two-plus-two-aint-four.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;found out that&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;APs were to blame&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;(The&amp;nbsp;APs were failing to respond to WiFi frames tagged as &quot;Background&quot; QoS.) &amp;nbsp;Time and time again networking folks blame device makers like Apple, and time and time again&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;problem ends up being&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;network.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are times, however, when it really is Apple&#39;s fault. &amp;nbsp;When&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;network is operating just fine. &amp;nbsp;This is one of those times. &amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;problem is that I just don&#39;t know why.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;802.11n (HT) and 802.11ac (VHT) networks operate in co-existence with first generation (802.11a/b/g, that is) WiFi a lot. &amp;nbsp;When that happens, the HT or VHT access point operates in mixed mode. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are all sorts of ramifications when a WiFi network operates in mixed mode, but one of the bigger ones (a ramification that usually results in a throughput loss between 25% and 40%) is the protection mechanism. &amp;nbsp;When the the AP operates in mixed mode, it transmits data using the protection mechanism and it uses Beacon and Probe Response frames to tell WiFi devices to use the protection mechanism. &amp;nbsp;An AP or device using the protection mechanism will precede its data frame transmissions with the transmission of a non-data carrying frame called a request to send (RTS) or a clear to send (CTS). &amp;nbsp;The RTS and CTS frames are always sent at a data rate that the legacy devices can understand. &amp;nbsp;For example, a WiFi network with a mix of 802.11a and 802.11ac devices would see 802.11a (24 Mbps, typically) RTS and/or CTS frames sent in advance of data that would be sent using VHT rates (up to 1,300 Mbps with today&#39;s gear).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An important note in all of this is that if there is no mixed mode, then there doesn&#39;t need to be any protection mechanism. &amp;nbsp;If you&#39;ve got a bunch of HT devices all associated to an HT AP, then there shouldn&#39;t be any RTS or CTS frames slowing down the data.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rough &amp;amp; Tumble Films (a movie production company whose owners I&#39;m friends with and who have a little country noir called &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/us/texas-noir-by-directors-who-arent-from-texas.html&quot;

height=&quot;250&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The R&amp;amp;T WiFi network should see HT data frames going across the WiFi channel without any RTS and/or CTS frames slowing it down. &amp;nbsp;That is not, however, what shows up in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildpackets.com/products/omnipeek_network_analyzer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WildPackets OmniPeek&lt;/a&gt; capture. &amp;nbsp;(See that the highlighted data frames below are sent at HT rates of 243 Mbps and 300 Mbps, but they are surrounded by RTS and CTS frames sent at 24 Mbps.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;

height=&quot;190&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a trend when investigating all of this protection mechanism traffic on my friends&#39; non-mixed mode WiFi. &amp;nbsp;I noticed that the RTS frames were only being sent by my devices. &amp;nbsp;The APs were never sending an RTS frame. &amp;nbsp;Beyond that, I noticed that when the AP was the transmitter of a data frame, neither an RTS or a CTS preceded that data frame. &amp;nbsp;In short, I noticed that the AP was not using the protection mechanism, which my laptop and phone were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, then, that Apple devices (both iOS and OS X) slow down the channels they are using by acting like it&#39;s mixed mode even when it&#39;s not. &amp;nbsp;What I don&#39;t know is, Why? &amp;nbsp;Did Apple make a mistake? &amp;nbsp;Is there some HT or VHT protocol that I am unaware of that causes devices to use the protection mechanism even when APs don&#39;t? &amp;nbsp;Or is Apple doing this on purpose because someone at Apple thinks that their devices function better when the protection mechanism is always on?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing Apple devices voluntarily engage in the protection mechanism, it made me think back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oguh2/im_a_wifi_expert_ask_me_anything/ccs12u9&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a question that I received while doing a Reddit AMA&lt;/a&gt; last year. &amp;nbsp;A person asked about RTS/CTS being used to manage network traffic and getting devices to cooperate. &amp;nbsp;The person from Reddit mentioned that he (sorry ladies, but when his Reddit handle is &quot;ShadowHawk109&quot; and he posts about beer, WiFi and William Shatner, it&#39;s got to be a guy) did work in academia, so I just assumed that he &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303987004579479501134392562&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;didn&#39;t know what he was talking about&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Maybe he was on to something. &amp;nbsp;Maybe Apple believes that their devices will have a more consistent data connection over WiFi if RTS/CTS frames are being used all the time, and so they&#39;ve enabled it in their devices. &amp;nbsp;Maybe Apple doesn&#39;t care that much if their devices cause the maximum available throughput to be lower on the channel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the reason may be that Apple devices have been programmed to use RTS/CTS frames, WiFi professionals are going to have to deal with the impact. &amp;nbsp;It could mean that our throughput tests mean even less and that our ability to support high density deployments has been expanded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;

style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yours Truly has been worried about&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;future of WiFi sniffing. &amp;nbsp;Yours Truly worries about&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;people (they seem to prefer site surveyors)&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;software (AirMagnet has yet to support 802.11ac adapters) and&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;methods (WildPackets has been pushing AP-based capture). &amp;nbsp;To a person who believes that portable WiFi sniffing is essential for optimizing WiFi performance, it is all very disconcerting. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;And yet, there is hope. &amp;nbsp;WiFi sniffing is ready to step into&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;802.11ac/Internet of Everything era, and here is how it can be done.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildpackets.com/products/omnipeek_network_analyzer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WildPackets OmniPeek&lt;/a&gt; has long been the author&#39;s favorite WiFi sniffer, but it only runs on Windows. &amp;nbsp;For years and years and years that was fine. &amp;nbsp;There were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sniffwifi.com/2009/12/airmagnet-wifi-with-usb-adapter-finally.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;always a few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sniffwifi.com/2011/12/one-card-to-rule-them-all.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Windows-compatible&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sniffwifi.com/2013/07/omniwifi-usb-adapter-and-omnipeek-75.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WiFi adapters&lt;/a&gt; that worked great with OmniPeek. &amp;nbsp;Now, however, WildPackets has gone in a different direction. &amp;nbsp;They are promoting WiFi sniffing via an AP (which often results in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sniffwifi.com/2012/04/worthless-capture.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;worthless capture&lt;/a&gt;) and saying that they &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/wildpackets/capturing-80211ac-data&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;don&#39;t expect USB-based capture to be viable&lt;/a&gt; for 802.11ac. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what to do? &amp;nbsp;OmniPeek only runs on Windows, but they&#39;re not planning to support capture via Windows-compatible USB adapters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer is to switch to a Mac and use virtualization software. &amp;nbsp;Here is what I did:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Buy a Mac&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.apple.com/us/buy-mac/macbook-air&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MacBook Air &lt;/a&gt;because it is cheap, light and cool. &amp;nbsp;(Literally cool. &amp;nbsp;Meaning temperature. &amp;nbsp;The darned &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs-retina/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; gets too hot to place comfortably on your lap.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Buy Parallels&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parallels is virtualization software and it runs seamlessly on a Mac. &amp;nbsp;Check out OmniPeek:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;

style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;You can see the little Apple logo in the upper left, showing that I&#39;m running Mac OS X as I run OmniPeek.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;

style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;In case the video is unclear, you hold down the alt/option before clicking the WiFi icon on the top menu bar. &amp;nbsp;Then you select &quot;Wireless Diagnostics&quot;, go to the &quot;Window&quot; menu, choose &quot;Utilities&quot;, click on &quot;Frame Capture&quot; and select your capture channel &amp;amp; bandwidth before clicking &quot;Start&quot;. &amp;nbsp;YOu click &quot;Stop&quot; when you&#39;re done capturing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;4) Open the capture file into OmniPeek&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;

style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;In case the picture above is unclear, you go to the Desktop, right-click on your *.wcap capture file, select &quot;Open With&quot; and select OmniPeek.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;

style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The limitation of this method is that you&#39;re unable to see live frames as they are captured. &amp;nbsp;Boo hoo. &amp;nbsp;(Actually, it&#39;s more than boo hoo. &amp;nbsp;For certain tasks (like analyzing Probing behavior), not having access to a live capture is a real problem. &amp;nbsp;But for most tasks, analyzing a capture file after the actual WiFi sniffing is done is just fine.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;On a MacBook Air, the capture I open in OmniPeek is a two-stream, 802.11ac capture. &amp;nbsp;On a MacBook Pro, it would be a three-stream 802.11ac capture. &amp;nbsp;That means capturing on an Air will result in me missing data sent and received by a Pro. &amp;nbsp;Most 802.11a/b/g/n/ac devices will have all of their WiFi traffic captured just fine by an Air, however.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;I am still hoping that someone creates a three-stream 802.11ac USB adapter that I can use for OmniPeek (or Fluke AirMagnet WiFi Analyzer, for that matter) capture, but in the meantime these steps will allow you to do useful, portable captures now and in the future.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;

target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote a blog post recently&lt;/a&gt; extolling the virtues of WiFi protocol analysis, I expected some blowback. &amp;nbsp;Not because WiFi protocol analysis won&#39;t help performance (only a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siQPuK3rszo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Garo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-pat-garofalo-nba-20140310,0,2576680.story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;falo&lt;/a&gt;-ian fool would assert that it won&#39;t), but because I touted protocol analysis at the expense of spectrum analysis. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Well, it&#39;s time to make amends. &amp;nbsp;Spectrum analysis is pretty darned useful, too. &amp;nbsp;And the spectrum analyzer that I use (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sniffwifi.com/2011/07/time-to-talk-chanalyzer.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Metageek&#39;s WiSpy DBx with Chanalyzer&lt;/a&gt;) underwent a notable update in recent months. &amp;nbsp;Here, then, is an update on Chanalyzer and a reminder of what spectrum analyzers can be useful for.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;For quite some time Metageek&#39;s spectrum analysis suite (consisting of the WiSpy USB adapter and the Chanalyzer software application) has been the thrifty man(and woman)&#39;s tool of choice for analyzing WiFi frequencies. &amp;nbsp;The original Metageek WiSpy (a 2.4 GHz-only device without an external antenna interface) was a $100 (all prices in USD) USB adapter and the original Chanalyzer software was free. &amp;nbsp;Things evolved and it started to become necessary to use the dual-band (2.4 GHz/5 GHz) WiSpy DBx, which is a $600 USB adapter. &amp;nbsp;The software remained free and Metageek&#39;s $600 hardware/software package became my choice of spectrum analyzer for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, Metageek decided to change the spirit of their company. &amp;nbsp;Instead of keeping their most popular software products like Chanalyzer and inSSIDer free, they decided to charge for them. &amp;nbsp;Chanalyzer 5 (the current software attaché to WiSpy DBx) is $350 and previous Chanalyzer versions are no longer available via download through Metageek&#39;s website. &amp;nbsp;inSSIDer became $20, with an optional WiSpy Mini USB adapter that bumps the package to $200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My natural instinct was to chafe at the prospect of having to pay for software that used to be free, but a broad look at the facts cooled me down. &amp;nbsp;WiFi folks still often need a spectrum analyzer. &amp;nbsp;Metageek&#39;s spectrum analyzer package is still the least expensive (at least as professional-grade analyzers go). &amp;nbsp;And after using Chanalyzer 5 it&#39;s clear that the product is an upgrade compared to the old free version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two notable improvements that Chanalyzer 5 gave me over the old, free version: a better layout and better device identification. &amp;nbsp;The layout is a matter of taste, I suppose, but I really like the move to have the waterfall view go vertically instead of horizontally. &amp;nbsp;Check out the old look:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xwWPb42V0jI/Ux5ZS8PePqI/AAAAAAAAAWs/Oua_dHahqys/s1600/Chanalyzer_Utilization.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;

height=&quot;297&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waterfall view is in the vertical middle of the screen and it&#39;s all scrunched up. &amp;nbsp;Compare that to Chanalyzer 5:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wKOAE0Uv8NQ/Ux5ZjnU1SwI/AAAAAAAAAW0/-OBce8udkFc/s1600/Chan_Ch11interference.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;

height=&quot;212&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waterfall view has been moved to the second pane from the left and has been elongated vertically. &amp;nbsp;Notice how I circled the frequencies of channel 11 in that waterfall pane. &amp;nbsp;Since the pane is taller it makes it much easier to tell how long an interference source was running for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second big improvement with Chanalyzer 5 is in device identification. &amp;nbsp;Several years ago when I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sniffwifi.com/2010/07/channelyzer-pro-this-could-be-big.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first used Chanalyzer Pro&lt;/a&gt; (an old licensed alternative to free Chanalyzer versions), I was disappointed in the device identification features. &amp;nbsp;I would turn on interfering devices like Bluetooth keyboards and get no notification. &amp;nbsp;I would then turn on the same interfering device near the old Cognio Spectrum Expert (bought out by Cisco years ago) and I would get an interference notification. &amp;nbsp;It soured me to the point that I stuck with the free version of Chanalyzer in spite of its limitations. &amp;nbsp;Now, things have changed. &amp;nbsp;Chanalyzer 5 allows the user to adjust the certainty of device identification, and it really helps. &amp;nbsp;In the office park where I tested Chanalyzer 5 today, it identified a Motorola Canopy system running outside the building and a wireless video monitoring system running inside. &amp;nbsp;I had to allow Chanalyzer to notify me with less certainty in order to get the flashy pop-up, but it worked. &amp;nbsp;I was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Chanalyzer 5 is a good product, you say, but what about yours truly&#39;s previous blog? &amp;nbsp;What about the argument that WiFi protocol analyzers are more important and that 90% of WiFi problems can be identified without having to use a spectrum analyzer? &amp;nbsp;Well, I stand by those statements. &amp;nbsp;But that doesn&#39;t mean that spectrum analyzers are worthless (the way that most frame captures from distributed sensors are [you didn&#39;t think I could write an entire blog without at least one potshot, did you?]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A spectrum analysis package like Metageek&#39;s WiSpy/Chanalyzer 5 combo is good in a few situations. It&#39;s good for skilled WiFi folks because it helps in those 10% of situations where a protocol analyzer fails to reveal the source of the problem and it is easier to communicate with. &amp;nbsp;When I show a WiFi novice a Retry percentage, it sometimes fails to resonate. &amp;nbsp;When I show a WiFi novice that last screenshot I posted above, it always resonates. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s red, and red is bad. &amp;nbsp;That is also why spectrum analyzers are great for the middle class of WiFi workers. &amp;nbsp;If you know WiFi pretty well but have too many other duties to be able to dedicate yourself to learning every nook and cranny, then spectrum analyzers are great for pointing you in the first direction. &amp;nbsp;If my smartphone were on Channel 11 and Chanalyzer 5 started looking like that last screenshot, I would know that something rocked the channel for about 30 seconds or so. &amp;nbsp;That&#39;s useful information. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last note about Chanalyzer is to folks who already have distributed spectrum analysis systems. &amp;nbsp;It could be Cisco Clean Air or Aruba&#39;s RF Protect module or maybe even Fluke&#39;s AirMagnet Enterprise system with spectrum sensors. &amp;nbsp;Even if you have your enterprise covered for spectrum analysis using sensors, it still helps to have a portable tool. &amp;nbsp;Radio frequency properties can be very different and different locations, so having a tool that runs on a laptop and that can be moved to the exact location of the problem is often very revealing. &amp;nbsp;Chanalyzer isn&#39;t the only option for portable spectrum analysis (there&#39;s still &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flukenetworks.com/enterprise-network/wireless-network/airmagnet-spectrum-xt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AirMagnet Spectrum XT&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and, if you can tolerate a PC Card-capable laptop, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/wireless/spectrum-expert/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cisco Spectrum Expert&lt;/a&gt;), but it&#39;s a great tool at a decent price and it&#39;s the tool that I use on the rare occasions that I am unable to identify the source of the problem using a WiFi frame capture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you like my blog, you can support it by shopping through my&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;tag=snwi0a-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;link or donating Bitcoin to&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;1N8m1o9phSkFXpa9VUrMVHx4LJWfratseU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thank you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.sniffwifi.com/2014/03/spectrum-it-damn-near-killed-em.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Ben Miller)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xwWPb42V0jI/Ux5ZS8PePqI/AAAAAAAAAWs/Oua_dHahqys/s72-c/Chanalyzer_Utilization.JPG" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>2</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3048007334745225882.post-6983595525530504894</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2014 01:01:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2014-02-27T15:38:38.266-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Directional antennas</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Site survey software</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Spectrum analysis</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">WiFi sniffing</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">WiFi USB adapters</category><title>Three Simple Ways to Boost Your WiFi</title><description>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some days you wake up and say to yourself, &quot;how can I be more like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buzzfeed.com/lowes/punderful-wi-fi-names-that-will-make-you-smile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Buzzfeed&lt;/a&gt;?&quot; &amp;nbsp;Buzzfeed is popular and beloved and has an office across&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;street from a great Mexican restaurant. &amp;nbsp;I have a few friends and wonderful parents, but I can barely cook a taco. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is it that I&#39;m missing (besides venture money, a flock of ambitious MBAs and universal scorn from&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;intelligentsia)? &amp;nbsp;Lists! &amp;nbsp;That&#39;s what I&#39;m missing. &amp;nbsp;Hit-trawling, crowd-pleasing lists!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;So here it is:&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;first in what hopefully will be a series of one. &amp;nbsp;A list of Three Simple Ways to Boost Your WiFi. &amp;nbsp;#LOL #cute #OMG #trashy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Add an 802.11n/ac USB adapter to old 802.11a/b/g laptops and desktops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some folks in the WLAN business like to use the term &quot;5G&quot; to refer to 802.11ac, but I refer to 802.11a/b/g as 1st generation WiFi and 802.11n/ac as 2nd generation WiFi. &amp;nbsp;The reason I do that is because big improvements to power consumption, receive sensitivity and channel bonding are available in almost all 802.11n and 802.11ac radios.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smartphones, tablets and single-function terminals may be unable to support external WiFi adapters, but laptops and desktops have USB ports. &amp;nbsp;A small, low-cost, dual-band 2nd gen WiFi USB adapter like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BWT1IFE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00BWT1IFE&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=snwi0a-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Linksys AE6000&lt;/a&gt; has worked well for me. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;ve used it to give devices 5 GHz support (when the internal WiFi is 802.11b/g/n only) and to eliminate 802.11a/b/g associations that can slow down 2.4 GHz channels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Use an external directional antenna on some APs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Maybe you have an area where you can&#39;t drop a Cat6 cable. &amp;nbsp;Maybe you want to make it so your client/stations don&#39;t have to roam so often. &amp;nbsp;Maybe you want to divide up a high-density area. &amp;nbsp;Whether it&#39;s one of those reasons or something else, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.l-com.com/wireless-antenna-24-ghz-57-59-ghz-8-dbi-multi-band-dual-element-indoor-panel-antennas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;external directional antennas&lt;/a&gt; can solve certain radio frequency problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Access points with internal antennas are simpler to install. &amp;nbsp;They also are often easier to use when planning and surveying, because experienced WiFi folks tend to be more familiar with them. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;m not advocating that every AP for every installation use an external directional antenna, but if the coverage you need needs to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.l-com.com/multimedia/diagrams/D_HG2458-10DP_1.GIF&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spread out in one direction&lt;/a&gt;, then give external antennas a look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;3) Use a protocol analyzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alert the press! &amp;nbsp;&quot;WiFi Sniffing Blogger Advocates WiFi Sniffing&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s tighten up this third rule, then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Use a protocol analyzer &lt;u&gt;instead of a spectrum analyzer or site survey utility&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protocol analyzers tend to be the least popular troubleshooting tool. &amp;nbsp;They are more difficult to understand than spectrum analyzers, more expensive than discovery software and look less flashy than site survey utilities. &amp;nbsp;But they are better! (at least in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protocol analyzers are better than discovery software because they tell you more. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inssider.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inSSIDer&lt;/a&gt; will allow you to see APs, channels and standards, but sniffers like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildpackets.com/products/omnipeek_network_analyzer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WildPackets OmniPeek&lt;/a&gt; show client/stations and frames (packets) as well. &amp;nbsp;Discovery software can&#39;t do that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spectrum analyzers like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metageek.net/products/wi-spy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Metageek WiSpy/Chanalyzer&lt;/a&gt; are attractive because they show you all RF activity over a range of frequencies. &amp;nbsp;They are great tools. &amp;nbsp;But I believe that they are best as a backup to a protocol analyzer rather than a primary troubleshooting tool. &amp;nbsp;Protocol analyzers like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flukenetworks.com/enterprise-network/wireless-network/AirMagnet-WiFi-Analyzer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fluke AirMagnet WiFi Analyzer&lt;/a&gt; offer more detail about which specific WiFi devices are generating activity on the channel and how much harm that activity might be causing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Site survey tools like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tamos.com/products/wifi-site-survey/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tamograph&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TamoSoft/status/428992156246634496&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a wider audience&lt;/a&gt; than protocol analyzers and it&#39;s understandable why. &amp;nbsp;Reading a floorplan with color coded signal areas is a lot easier than reading a bunch of arcane statistics like data rates and Retry percentages. &amp;nbsp;But it&#39;s also less specific. &amp;nbsp;Seeing that signal is strong/weak or noise is high/low or APs are sparse/saturated is nice, but it may fail to allow you to burrow down to the essential issue that is causing a WiFi problem. &amp;nbsp;Viewing device-by-device information in a protocol analyzer may be tedious at times, but it offers more salient information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it. &amp;nbsp;Three things to try some time on your WiFi. &amp;nbsp;They might help you turn a frustrating deployment into something that runs smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you like my blog, you can support it by shopping through

dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;People who do WLAN analysis agree that filtering is a part of sniffing WiFi frames/packets. &amp;nbsp;More information can be extracted from captures when&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;focus is on one AP or station or protocol (or a combination of same). &amp;nbsp;Where people disagree is on which type of filtering is best: capture filters or display filters? &amp;nbsp;Yours truly is a capture filter man, and some iPhone analysis was a reminder why.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Filtering 802.11 captures is &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=0GwFrd90G3kC&amp;amp;pg=PT715&amp;amp;lpg=PT715&amp;amp;dq=cwap+capture+filters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;covered pretty well&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470769033/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0470769033&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=snwi0a-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CWAP Study Guide&lt;/a&gt; (of which I am a co-author). &amp;nbsp;A capture filter extracts frames &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;they are captured. &amp;nbsp;The only frames captured are the ones that match the filter. &amp;nbsp;A display filter extracts frames &lt;i&gt;after&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;they are captured. &amp;nbsp;Every frame is captured. &amp;nbsp;Then the filter is applied so that only frames matching the filter are shown in the protocol analyzer. &amp;nbsp;To use the example of a filter on my iPhone, if a capture filter were used then all of the frames from all of the other stations on my iPhone&#39;s channel would be lost. &amp;nbsp;Using a display filter, on the other hand, would mean that everything is captured. &amp;nbsp;Nothing is lost. &amp;nbsp;The filter for my iPhone would be applied after the capture has been done, thus allowing frames from other stations to be analyzed later.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The CWAP Study Guide takes a neutral position on WiFi capture filters, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cwnp.com/training/instructorled/cwap_course_outline/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CWAP course&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/marcusburton&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Marcus Burton&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is friendlier to display filters. &amp;nbsp;The rationale make sense on the surface: with a display filter nothing is lost. &amp;nbsp;If an iPhone is being analyzed and the iPhone&#39;s frames appear to betray a congestion problem, the display filter can be removed and frames from other stations or APs can be examined. &amp;nbsp;If a capture filter is used, then that moment of congestion may have been lost. &amp;nbsp;Those uncaptured frames can never be examined.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There is a down side to using display filters, especially in a congested area: the lack of real-time analysis. &amp;nbsp;It can be tremendously valuable to be able to watching frames as they are being captured. &amp;nbsp;If you know what WiFi should look like, then you may be able to identify cases where the WiFi is having problems. &amp;nbsp;(That&#39;s how I fingered the APs as the culprit when investigating that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sniffwifi.com/2013/11/sometimes-two-plus-two-aint-four.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iPhone VoIP problem that I blogged about&lt;/a&gt; a while back. &amp;nbsp;I watched the frames show up in OmniPeek in real time and saw a stream of Retrys.) &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In general, the best way to filter will depend on your level of expertise. &amp;nbsp;If you are relative new to sniffing WiFi, then it&#39;s probably best to use display filters. &amp;nbsp;You probably won&#39;t know what to look for in real time, so it will be best to keep all captured frames. &amp;nbsp;Once you become an expert, then switching to capture filters is usually better. &amp;nbsp;The ability to correlate real world, real time behavior (What app is running now? &amp;nbsp;Is the tablet moving now? &amp;nbsp;Is the user actively using her device now?) with that scrolling trace of captured frames/packets is often valuable in identifying what is really going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you like my blog, you can support it by shopping through my&amp;nbsp;&lt;a

iPads)</title><description>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;About a year and a half ago, yours truly wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sniffwifi.com/2012/06/mighty-station-power-ranges.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WiFi&amp;nbsp;transmit power levels in iPhones&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Things have changed since then. &amp;nbsp;And possibly&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;biggest change (to iPhones, at least) is how aggressive iPhones are in modifying transmit power levels. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;In the &quot;Mighty iPhone Power Ranges&quot; blog post, I wrote about the value of setting AP transmit power levels to approximately the same level as client/station device power levels. &amp;nbsp;Over the past year or so, more and more client/station devices have started using adaptive power levels. &amp;nbsp;A typical implementation would force a device to lower its transmit power when receiving a strong signal from the AP and raise its transmit power when the AP&#39;s signal is weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unanswered question is, &quot;just how vast are these ranges of transmit power levels?&quot; &amp;nbsp;Can a smartphone or tablet go as low as half power? &amp;nbsp;10% power? &amp;nbsp;0.0001% power? &amp;nbsp;Those differences could have a major effect on a WLAN infrastructure&#39;s ability to handle a variety of devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to do a quick, unscientific test of device transmit power levels while on a non WiFi-equipped plane. &amp;nbsp;I sat the device directly adjacent to my 2012 MacBook Air (which has a 2-stream 802.11a/b/g/n WiFi radio) running in monitor mode. &amp;nbsp;Then I let the device send Probe Request frames looking for nearby WiFi networks. &amp;nbsp;I used the received signal strength in those Probe Request messages to see if my WiFi devices were changing power levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first device I checked was a 3rd generation iPad, which has 1 stream 802.11a/b/g/n radio. &amp;nbsp;I let my iPad send Probe Requests for while. &amp;nbsp;Initially I saw this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a

class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The screenshot above shows that my MacBook Air&#39;s WiFi adapter was receiving Probe Request frames at a signal strength just below -20 dBm. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;After a while, my capture started to look like this:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oyVwOTtCbJs/Us9A_USdt2I/AAAAAAAAAUs/lp167pZYP0w/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-12-31+at+1.36.17+PM.png&quot;

both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Notice how the received signal strength is now about 10 dBm higher, hovering around -10 dBm. &amp;nbsp;That means that my iPad sort of got frustrated with having no AP to associate with, and decided to start using a higher transmit power in the hopes of reaching an AP that is further away. &amp;nbsp;This behavior is bad for battery life, but would seem to indicate that a 3rd generation iPad can handle connecting to an AP that uses a very high transmit power.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;After looking at the iPad, I moved on to my iPhone 5. &amp;nbsp;My iPhone 5 has a 1 stream 802.11a/b/g/n radio, just like the 3rd gen iPad does.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;My initial capture started out looking very similar to the initial iPad capture:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both;

both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The received signal strength from the iPhone 5 is maybe a few dB lower than the received signal from the iPad, but it&#39;s close.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div

class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The iPhone started using a LOWER transmit power when sending Probe Request frames.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div

/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the way down until the capture laptop sitting right next to the iPhone was receiving a signal strength below -70 dBm:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a

class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Could this be? &amp;nbsp;Is it possible that iPhones actually lower their transmit power when probing? &amp;nbsp;In some ways that would be good. &amp;nbsp;It would mean less interference in large venues like hockey arenas when users fail to connect to guest WiFi. &amp;nbsp;But in the enterprise it could be bad. &amp;nbsp;It could result in frustrated users. &amp;nbsp;A user might be told by support personnel that the WiFi is up and running, but the extremely low transmit power used when doing active scanning (that&#39;s the 802.11 term to sending Probe Request frames in hopes of receiving a Probe Response) could cause the iPhone to think that no APs are nearby.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;This was an unscientific test, so there could be other reason for these odd results. &amp;nbsp;Maybe the iPhone 5 was probing on channel 4 while my laptop was capturing on channel 1. &amp;nbsp;Maybe the signal strength just appeared to be lower because the channels were off. &amp;nbsp;Maybe iPhones have different transmit power levels for data and management (which includes Probe Requests/Responses) frames. &amp;nbsp;Maybe it&#39;s a temporary bug in Apple&#39;s iPhone code that will eventually be changed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Whatever the reason for the odd changing of transmit power, it is something to take note of if you support iPhones. &amp;nbsp;And it&#39;s yet another reason that sniffing WiFi often reveals information that is unavailable from vendor documentation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both;

left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;I’ve seen a lot of 802.11 amendments in my day. &amp;nbsp;From speed (ac) to security (i) to voice (e), a lot of those amendments have done great things. &amp;nbsp;But 802.11v isn’t going to be one of them. &amp;nbsp;One look at an iPhone’s (iOS 7 iPhone, that is) 802.11v capabilities shows that the dream of Wireless Network Management delivering client control is still just that: a dream.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has long (well, for a dozen years or so) been a desire of WiFi admins to have more control of client/stations. &amp;nbsp;Control over which AP the client will connect to. &amp;nbsp;Control over what signal strength (or signal-to-noise ratio [SNR] or error % or BSS density) will trigger client roaming. &amp;nbsp;Control over which Final Fantasy character they will assume at that weekend’s LAN party. &amp;nbsp;(I know virtually nothing about video games, so feel free to make dumb jock jokes at yours truly’s expense.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For about half as long, WiFi admins have had hope for client control on the horizon: 802.11v. &amp;nbsp;The wireless network management (WNM) amendment was created to (quoting from the 802.11v Abstract), “provide WNM enhancements [blah, blah, blah] to effect a complete and coherent upper layer interface for MANAGING 802.11 DEVICES in wireless networks.” &amp;nbsp;“Managing 802.11 devices” is the key part there. &amp;nbsp;The hope was that with 802.11v, a WiFi admin would be able to pause &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/aug/29/world-of-warcraft-video-game-addict&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;his (or her) game of WoW&lt;/a&gt;, slowly turn 15 degrees to the right (so as to avoid rupturing a clavicle from sudden movement) and use his (or her) wireless network management system (WNMS) to manipulate smartphone/tablet/laptop/etc. associations to the various BSSs in his (or h... oh, you get the point) enterprise. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve often been asked the question, “why weren’t 802.11 WLANs designed to allow centralized client control in the first place?” just before a snack sized bag of Doritos gets emptied ass-over-tea-kettle into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chud.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/nedry-jurassic-park.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a network admin’s&lt;/a&gt; mouth. &amp;nbsp;Well, the answer is, “because the AP doesn’t know sh*t.” &amp;nbsp;APs are mounted above your ceiling (or below your ceiling or, if you’re really doing it right, on your walls). &amp;nbsp;There ain’t no clients above your ceiling (or below your ceiling or on your walls). &amp;nbsp;So having an AP that’s above the ceiling (meaning an AP that only really knows RF information about the area above the ceiling) make decisions for a client that’s on a desk or walking down a hallway is poor form. &amp;nbsp;You want the right RF information so that you (hopefully) get the right decision. &amp;nbsp;Only the client knows the RF information about its current location.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;802.11v was supposed to be special because it (optionally) allows APs (or controllers or WNMS) to make decisions about client associations. &amp;nbsp;802.11v took RF information that the client sends to the AP as part of 802.11k radio resource measurement (RRM) and WiFi information that the client sends as (another optional) part of 802.11v and gives the WLAN infrastructure (APs, controller and WNMS) the ability to paint a picture of the client’s RF environment. &amp;nbsp;If the AP thinks that the client would be better off on another BSS (which likely would mean another channel), then the AP could use WNM to force the client/station to make that move.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with all of this is that is was never going to happen. &amp;nbsp;(I use “was” instead of “is” to convey the notion that, not only is it unlikely that infrastructure-based association management will be adopted any time soon, but that it was never prudent to assume that makers of smartphones/tablets/laptops would ever cede control over associations to WLAN infrastructure vendors.) &amp;nbsp;The authors of 802.11v even ended up making infrastructure control over associations optional because they knew that device vendors wouldn’t adopt WNM otherwise.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings us back to the iOS 7 iPhone. &amp;nbsp;iOS 7 iPhones do support 802.11v WNM. &amp;nbsp;You can see it in the Probe Request frames that iPhones send whenever they are unassociated to WiFi. &amp;nbsp;If you look in the frame body of a Probe Request and scroll down to the Extended Capabilities, you will see WNM information. &amp;nbsp;It’s tricky, because the WNM information is mixed in with information from other 802.11 amendments. &amp;nbsp;But if you look at this frame decode (from Wireshark, because I’m lazy and didn’t feel like booting into Windows), you’ll see it:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both;

style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;You see in octet 3 where it shows “Multiple BSSID”? &amp;nbsp;That’s WNM. &amp;nbsp;So is “SSID List” in octet 4 and “Geospatial Location” (should’ve been soldered as “America!” in the standard) in octet 2. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;And you know what you see for every single WNM capability seen in that iOS 7 iPhone decode, save one? &amp;nbsp;0. &amp;nbsp;“Not supported”. &amp;nbsp;Apple is giving WiFi admins The Heisman. &amp;nbsp;They are not allowing your WLAN infrastructure to have any sort of association control. &amp;nbsp;And what’s more, Apple is not even allowing its precious iOS 7 iPhone to even give the APs/controllers/WNMS any additional information. &amp;nbsp;(My guess on the reason is battery life, but with Apple who knows? &amp;nbsp;They’re the kind of company that will foster a &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304527504579172302377638002&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pro-gay rights environment&lt;/a&gt; for years, &lt;a href=&quot;http://allthingsd.com/20130626/domas-demise-celebrated-by-apple-other-top-tech-firms/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;champion the cause of gay marriage&lt;/a&gt; publicly, and then seemingly go out of their way to keep the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;http://valleywag.gawker.com/tim-cook-speaks-about-his-own-discrimination-as-a-gay-m-1484918694&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;their CEO is gay&lt;/a&gt; under wraps. &amp;nbsp;They’re an odd bunch up there in Cupertino.) &amp;nbsp;In fact, the only part of 802.11v WNM that an iOS 7 iPhone does support is a part that could potentially harm the WLAN infrastructure: directed multicast service (DMS). &amp;nbsp;(DMS allows client/stations to request than an AP sends multicast traffic as a directed [unicast] frame. &amp;nbsp;This is probably supported because captive portals featuring web authentication are especially annoying when using Apple devices. &amp;nbsp;Apparently some guest WiFi services use multicast frames to check whether authenticated clients are still present. &amp;nbsp;Since many [most? all?] Apple devices sleep through multicast frames if no multicast-based app is running, the end result can be an iPhone/iPad/MacBook user having to re-authenticate to the stinky captive portal dozens of times per day.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, at least for now, the dream of centralized management of WiFi clients is dead. &amp;nbsp;802.11v WNM is approved. &amp;nbsp;It’s supported. &amp;nbsp;And all of the parts that would allow network admins to stay at their desks monitoring the fantasy football waiver wire while controlling client associations have been stripped out. &amp;nbsp;Client/stations continue to control associations and designing the RF environment for your clients’ behavior continues to be the way to get iPhones associated to the right BSS.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you like my

of person who wants the world to know that I used my phone at the MGM Signature in Las Vegas? &amp;nbsp;(Well, maybe. &amp;nbsp;I could&#39;ve prevented the phone from probing by just tapping on the SSID instead of typing it in. &amp;nbsp;But typing in SSIDs on iPhones/iPads is a neat trick for keeping stinky captive portal splash pages from coming up over and over again on guest WLANs.) &amp;nbsp;Or on the VerizonWiFi network at Staples Center? &amp;nbsp;(Which added a captive portal and lost A TON of guest connections, thus harming overall channel performance for all WiFi users in

trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449343147/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1449343147&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=snwi0a-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;802.11ac: A Survival Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a recently published handbook about 802.11ac. &amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;author is Matthew Gast, a very knowledgeable WiFi guy who follows&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/11/Reports/802.11_Timelines.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IEEE 802.11 Working Group&lt;/a&gt; closely. &amp;nbsp;I recommend&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;book if you work in WiFi. &amp;nbsp;It is informative. &amp;nbsp;There is great attention to detail. &amp;nbsp;All areas of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;subject are covered. &amp;nbsp;But&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;I was left uninspired. &amp;nbsp;And my uninspiration (is that a word?) was&amp;nbsp;the result of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;book being short on something that I always hope to find in any technical writing:&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Why.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;In some ways yours truly is the target audience for the book and in some ways I&#39;m not. &amp;nbsp;I need to know the intricate details of how WiFi works. &amp;nbsp;(Point) &amp;nbsp;I already knew most of the tweaks that 802.11ac is making to 802.11n. &amp;nbsp;(Counterpoint) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The physical layer is the most important part of 802.11ac, and that is where this book wins. &amp;nbsp;For example, before I read the book I was unaware that 802.11ac allows devices with different channel bonding capabilities can access a wider channel at the same time. &amp;nbsp;That&#39;s a big deal. &amp;nbsp;One of my criticisms of 40 MHz channels in 802.11n is that channel space is wasted. &amp;nbsp;If a device that is only capable of using a 20 MHz channel wins arbitration, then the unused 20 MHz stays vacant. &amp;nbsp;That&#39;s a waste. &amp;nbsp;If you use an 80 MHz channel in 802.11ac, two 40 MHz-capable devices can use the channel simultaneously (with a small amount of dead time on one of the 40 MHz spaces), thus keeping the available RF efficient. &amp;nbsp;Matthew Gast not only explains that concept clearly, but he has great graphics to aid learning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the book itself struggles in keeping things efficient. &amp;nbsp;For example, during the MAC layer chapter the explanation of QoS rambles. &amp;nbsp;If you understand 802.11e QoS and you understand MU-MIMO, then there&#39;s a 99% chance that you understand MU-MIMO QoS without it being explained to you. &amp;nbsp;If an AP has frames with varying WMM priority levels ready to send to multiple devices using MU-MIMO, then the lower priority frames are allowed to piggyback on the higher priority frame&#39;s channel time. &amp;nbsp;That makes sense. &amp;nbsp;And it makes sense that lower priority frames that would take more channel time than the higher priority MU-MIMO frame are not allowed to piggyback. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s a concept that takes a couple of sentences to understand. &amp;nbsp;In the book it takes two and half pages. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fundamental reason why the book gets flabby at times is because it could use a little more focus on the Why. &amp;nbsp;For example, it&#39;s great to list all of the different PHY header fields and options. &amp;nbsp;But tell me Why first. &amp;nbsp;I want to know the spirit and the concept of why the architects of 802.11ac designed things the way they did. &amp;nbsp;Time after time I found myself reading a concept, and then stopping for several minutes to think. &amp;nbsp;I would try to envision why things are the way they are in the standard. &amp;nbsp;The book would have been richer if the author would have had that higher level view in the text.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#39;m asking for too much from &lt;i&gt;802.11ac: A Survival Guide&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Maybe this book is such a technical book with such a specific audience that it should be dry and focused on the facts of the standard. &amp;nbsp;Maybe it is unnecessary for the Why to be explained. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I was expecting more Why is that I believe that a broad spectrum of people care about the technical details of 802.11ac. &amp;nbsp;I believe that this book could have been made accessible to a less technical audience without turning off the hardcores. &amp;nbsp;And I believe that a lot of technical writing -- including training courses, study guides and white papers -- could be improved by a little more time being spent thinking about the Why.&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.sniffwifi.com/2013/12/why-i-ask-why-and-some-words-about.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Ben

QoS</title><description>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;In my last (real) post, I detailed how I used WildPackets OmniPeek to solve an iPhone 5 QoS problem. &amp;nbsp;But what about AirMagnet WiFi Analyzer? &amp;nbsp;I am a fan of both of those fine WiFi sniffers, so I figure it&#39;s a good idea to show you how QoS can be analyzed with Fluke Networks&#39; signature WiFi protocol analyzer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;WildPackets OmniPeek is more of a hardcore protocol analyzer than AirMagnet WiFi Analyzer is. &amp;nbsp;If you&#39;re going to be doing the type of sniffing I detailed in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sniffwifi.com/2013/11/sometimes-two-plus-two-aint-four.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;last blog post&lt;/a&gt;, you will have an easier go of it with WildPackets&#39; product. &amp;nbsp;But AirMagnet is popular and both tools are expensive. &amp;nbsp;So if you happen to be a gal (or guy) who needs to troubleshoot WiFi voice or video and you have AirMagnet, this brief tutorial should help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin analyzing QoS, one must first capture on the VoFi devices channel. &amp;nbsp;In my case I associated my iPhone 5 to a network with the SSID of &quot;R&amp;amp;T&quot;. &amp;nbsp;Then I looked at the Start screen in AirMagnet:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UcmuzSENHFc/Uo027hsRV_I/AAAAAAAAASE/7sAlnFQwME8/s1600/AM_RnT-Start.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UcmuzSENHFc/Uo027hsRV_I/AAAAAAAAASE/7sAlnFQwME8/s400/AM_RnT-Start.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &quot;R&amp;amp;T&quot; access point was on channel 44.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you know the channel that your VoFi device is on, then next step is to start capturing and viewing frames in the Decodes screen of AirMagnet. &amp;nbsp;It is at this point that I should note that the wise &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/keithrparsons&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Keith Parsons&lt;/a&gt; once told me, &quot;If you&#39;re looking at the decodes in AirMagnet, then you&#39;re in the wrong place.&quot; &amp;nbsp;And that is true, usually. &amp;nbsp;But in the specific case of needing to find out which WMM QoS categories are being used by your VoIP app, then the Decodes screen is the right place to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I navigated to the Decodes screen in order to view captured frames. &amp;nbsp;I selected channel 44 as my capture channel and then I applied a capture filter for my iPhone, as shown here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ArXc_IFxgDE/Uo04U62ihMI/AAAAAAAAASQ/8L4_4Uv0rd0/s1600/AM_RnT-DecodesFiltered.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ArXc_IFxgDE/Uo04U62ihMI/AAAAAAAAASQ/8L4_4Uv0rd0/s400/AM_RnT-DecodesFiltered.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I had my filtered capture running, my step was to generate some voice traffic so that I could test QoS. &amp;nbsp;I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.truphone.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Truphone&lt;/a&gt;, which is a WiFi-based calling app. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After capturing VoFi frames, WMM QoS categories can be seen by opening a data frame and viewing the 802.11 header. &amp;nbsp;The 802.11 header has a field called &quot;QoS Control&quot;, and inside that field the TID (traffic identifier) will indicate which WMM access category is being used. &amp;nbsp;For Truphone, the category was Best Effort:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3OKIfXA6sto/Uo1UWZh64BI/AAAAAAAAASg/7OPxGWMBVMU/s1600/AM_RnT-DecodeFirstDataAP-BestEffort.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;246&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3OKIfXA6sto/Uo1UWZh64BI/AAAAAAAAASg/7OPxGWMBVMU/s400/AM_RnT-DecodeFirstDataAP-BestEffort.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AirMagnet makes it a little bit more difficult to see the WWM QoS Category than other WiFi sniffers do. &amp;nbsp;For one thing in AirMagnet a capture must be stopped before frame decodes may be viewed. &amp;nbsp;For another the TID subfield is not summarized. &amp;nbsp;When the TID value is zero that means Best Effort, which is simple to remember. &amp;nbsp;The other categories are a bit more odd. &amp;nbsp;Voice is 5 or 6. &amp;nbsp;Video is 3 or 4. &amp;nbsp;Background is 1 or 2. &amp;nbsp;Seeing the raw bits of the TID field like in the AirMagnet capture above is fine for people who have memorized those numbers. &amp;nbsp;WildPackets OmniPeek and Wireshark decipher the number and tell you the category, which makes things easier for people who spend less time focusing on WiFi. &amp;nbsp;Like in this example below, it would&#39;ve been nice if AirMagnet made it clearer that the frame I was looking at it Voice instead of forcing me to remember that 0110 in binary is 6:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a

style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;In summation, the process for figuring out whether WiFi-based QoS will help your applications is rather straightforward. &amp;nbsp;Capture on the channel. &amp;nbsp;Run the app. &amp;nbsp;View the headers. &amp;nbsp;And if you do that it can really help you predict whether your VoFi apps will work well on a crowded channel.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br

dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;My love for WildPackets OmniPeek may be one of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;few things in technology that exceeds my love for&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;iPhone...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now that I&#39;ve run off 20% of my audience, let&#39;s talk about how&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;former can be used to figure out if&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;latter is causing a problem.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I have a lot of enemies in life, and I&#39;m proud of that. &amp;nbsp;In my opinion, part of being an adult is recognizing who your enemies are. &amp;nbsp;UCLA football players are my enemy when they play college football. &amp;nbsp;Drivers who text while stopped at green lights are my enemy when I am running late. &amp;nbsp;(No comments from the peanut gallery on that one, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gthill.wordpress.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GT Hill&lt;/a&gt;.) &amp;nbsp;And deductive reasoning is often my enemy when troubleshooting.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Deductive reasoning is oh so tantalizing. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s simple math; A&amp;nbsp;+ B = C. &amp;nbsp;The WLAN works (C) when VoFi handsets (B) connect to my APs (A). &amp;nbsp;If I switch out the VoFi handsets for SIP-based iPhones (thus changing the value of B) and the WLAN stops working, then the iPhones must be at fault. &amp;nbsp;Right? &amp;nbsp;Wrong.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Deductive reasoning only works if you eliminate all variables but one. &amp;nbsp;A switch from a VoFi handset to an iPhone is not the changing of one variable. &amp;nbsp;It is the changing of numerous variables. &amp;nbsp;The chipset changes. &amp;nbsp;The client utility changes. &amp;nbsp;The apps that run in the background change. &amp;nbsp;The SIP app changes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Another problem I have with deductive reasoning is that sometimes a device that we think is working really isn&#39;t working. &amp;nbsp;That&#39;s what was happening recently when I was doing some work on site at a health care provider.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Problem&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The health care provider had been using dedicated VoFi handsets for years. &amp;nbsp;Like many organizations, they decided to move away from dedicated voice devices and use a smartphone app instead. &amp;nbsp;In this case, it was an Avaya smartphone app running primarily on iPhone 5s. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Once the iPhones started getting used, the WiFi folks at the health care provider immediately starting noticing problems. &amp;nbsp;Users were saying that the phones kept beeping. &amp;nbsp;Avaya said that the app will cause the phones to beep if the app gets disconnected. &amp;nbsp;It is a way to protect phone from being stolen or taken to locations where they&#39;re not supposed to go.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The problem for the WiFi admins is that the phones were still connected when the beeping was happening. &amp;nbsp;Something was causing the iPhone to think it was disconnected when it really wasn&#39;t.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Faulty Deductive Reasoning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The natural reaction of the WiFi admins was to blame the iPhones and/or Avaya. &amp;nbsp;The health care provider had a working VoFi solution. &amp;nbsp;They changed to iPhones and Avaya. &amp;nbsp;The solution stopped working. &amp;nbsp;The rest of the WiFi continued to work well, so the problem was thought to be the phones.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I was skeptical that the iPhones and the Avaya app were the problem right from the beginning. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/072007-cisco-iphone-duke-network-problem.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iPhones have been blamed&lt;/a&gt; innumerable times over the years for problems that were actually the infrastructure&#39;s fault. &amp;nbsp;What&#39;s more, I tend to almost always blame the network. &amp;nbsp;My attitude is that networking (both wired and WiFi) is the business of support. &amp;nbsp;We don&#39;t make money for the company. &amp;nbsp;We create infrastructure that allows saleswomen and craftsmen (see what I did there, ladies?) and executives to make money for the company. &amp;nbsp;If a user wants to use a certain device, we should try to make our infrastructure support that device. &amp;nbsp;(That is, assuming we want the company we work for to grow and be successful.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;OmniPeek to&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Rescue&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Armed with my natural skepticism of iPhone blame syndrome, I had the lead WiFi guy do an WildPackets OmniPeek capture with me. &amp;nbsp;(OmniPeek is the WiFi sniffer that he was already using.) &amp;nbsp;We set the capture to the channel of the nearest AP. &amp;nbsp;We associated the iPhone. &amp;nbsp;He made an received a call.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We then looked at the OmniPeek WiFi statistics (Summary -&amp;gt; 802.11 Analysis, for those of you OmniPeek users). &amp;nbsp;I noticed that the Retry percentages were astronomical. &amp;nbsp;Getting as high as 60% at their worst. &amp;nbsp;That told me that something was wrong. &amp;nbsp;During normal operation the WiFi channel was seeing Retry percentages well below 10%.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;From the Summary screen of OmniPeek, we switched to the Packets screen to get more detail. &amp;nbsp;I turned on Auto Scroll (a little icon above the packets list that looks like a little padlock) and watched the packets come in while we repeated our iPhone test. &amp;nbsp;I kept my eye on the Flags column in my Packets window because I knew that Retry frames always caused a red colored &quot;+&quot; to show up in that column.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sure enough, the next time the iPhone connected a whole slew of frames with a red &quot;+&quot; showed up in the Flags column. &amp;nbsp;I saw more than 5 consecutive HTTPS frames in a row all with the Retry flag and none of them were followed by acknowledgment (802.11 Ack) frames. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We Found a Problem, but Whose Fault is It?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Once we saw a flood of unacknowledged frames, we had to determine what the cause might be. &amp;nbsp;Was it the iPhone misbehaving? &amp;nbsp;A bad Avaya app? &amp;nbsp;Or the AP being unresponsive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the Retry frames had the iPhone 5&#39;s MAC address as the second address in the 802.11 header. &amp;nbsp;The second address is always the transmitter&#39;s MAC address. &amp;nbsp;That meant that the iPhone was sending all of the frames that were failing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing that the iPhone was the device that was sending the failed data, I immediately began to suspect that the APs were the problem. &amp;nbsp;It is quite rare that a device will disconnect itself while sending a bunch of data at the same. &amp;nbsp;Remember, our initial problem was that we were getting a beeping sound that indicated a network disconnection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Let&#39;s Get Specific&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Blaming the WiFi infrastructure for an iPhone problem is always satisfying (at least, if you&#39;re an Apple loyalist like yours truly), but in order to get people to believe you it&#39;s best to pile on the evidence. &amp;nbsp;My usual method is to try to find something logical. &amp;nbsp;Why would an AP just stop acknowledging iPhone data? &amp;nbsp;Why might I be using the same WiFi APs and controllers that have always worked fine with VoFi handsets and never see a problem that is the fault of the infrastructure?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used OmniPeek to look inside the frame decodes for any unique properties of the unacknowledged frames. &amp;nbsp;I noticed that some of the problem data had the same WMM/QoS category in the QoS Control field: Background. &amp;nbsp;I immediately added the Decode column to the OmniPeek Packets screen, then selected the Traffic Identifier (TID) subfield within the QoS Control field of the 802.11 header. &amp;nbsp;In the Decode column of the OmniPeek Packets screen, whichever field or subfield selected in the frame decode below will be displayed. &amp;nbsp;So in my case, that meant that the Decode column displayed the TID for every frame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I was able to easily see the TID for each captured data frame, I started quickly scrolling up and down through the capture. &amp;nbsp;Sure enough, I saw a consistent pattern. &amp;nbsp;Every time the iPhone sent a frame tagged with the Background TID to the access point, the access point would fail to send an acknowledgment in return. &amp;nbsp;We didn&#39;t have time to identify which specific app within the phone was sending data tagged as &quot;Background&quot;, but at that point it was peripheral to the issue. &amp;nbsp;If an AP can&#39;t handle Background traffic, then that AP is a potential problem that could spread beyond just iPhones and Avaya apps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The lead WiFi administrator was in the room with me looking at OmniPeek as we were investigating this iPhone disconnection problem (and, unfortunately, this is why I am unable to show screenshots of our OmniPeek captures). &amp;nbsp;He came into the day looking for an iPhone problem. &amp;nbsp;After an hour or so of using OmniPeek, he realized that the problem was his APs. &amp;nbsp;The fact that he was using 802.11a/b/g APs made things all the logical. &amp;nbsp;The AP vendor had mentioned to the lead WiFi admin that those old APs were no longer receiving firmware updates and that it could lead to problems. &amp;nbsp;Our little OmniPeek exercise convinced him that it was either time to upgrade or to look for a new vendor (and his current AP vendor shall go nameless in this blog post, because I like to avoid trashing vendors for hardware or software that is no longer kept up to date). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am aware that I sometimes come across as too sniffer-centric. &amp;nbsp;I realize that some people find management software easier to access or spectrum analyzers easier to understand or discovery software easier to afford. &amp;nbsp;But there is a reason that I am such a zealot for WiFi sniffers. &amp;nbsp;They help me identify causes of the really difficult problems that plague so many high level wireless networks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.sniffwifi.com/2013/11/sometimes-two-plus-two-aint-four.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Ben

trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;It&#39;s Columbus Day! &amp;nbsp;A holiday that many of us heard of, a few of us object to and some of us don&#39;t get the day off for. &amp;nbsp;Let&#39;s call it a half-holiday.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yours truly is going to celebrate the day by celebrating one of my favorite sniffers, Fluke AirMagnet WiFi Analyzer. &amp;nbsp;Due to it being half-holiday, this will be a half-efforted blog post. &amp;nbsp;So no links and no graphics. &amp;nbsp;Just a little talk about my favorite part of that fine sniffer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;AirMagnet WiFi Analyzer from Fluke Networks has been around for a long, long time (at least in WiFi years) and it continues to be one of the top WiFi sniffing options available. &amp;nbsp;I probably like WildPackets OmniPeek a little bit more because of its ease in manipulating frame traces, but AirMagnet (as I&#39;ll call Fluke AirMagnet WiFi Analyzer from here on out) has long been the best option for solving the vast majority of in-the-field WiFi problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week I got to introduce AirMagnet to a few folks and it struck me that even though it is more intuitive than the average WiFi sniffer, it is still challenging to a new user. &amp;nbsp;So I figured I&#39;d go through a quick overview of what I like best about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part of AirMagnet is that it allows you to quickly drill down from Channel to AP to Station when viewing those most important of WiFi statistics: the data rates and the Retry percentages. &amp;nbsp;(Low data rates and high Retry percentages are two big wastes of channel time, which is what makes those statistics important.) &amp;nbsp;The person doing the sniffing can take his (or her, but for simplicity&#39;s sake I&#39;ll honor the Y chromosome in this blog post) AirMagnet laptop or tablet to the location of the problem and quickly gauge whether channel time is being wasted. &amp;nbsp;Are the channel statistics bad? &amp;nbsp;If yes, then is one AP or another especially bad? &amp;nbsp;Once a bad AP is identified, then are there specific stations that seem to be dragging things down for everyone else?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What sets AirMagnet apart is the automatic filtering of captured frames when a Channel, AP or Station is selected. &amp;nbsp;If someone navigates to the Channel screen and clicks &quot;6&quot;, then only channel 6 frames are captured. &amp;nbsp;If someone then navigates to the Infrastructure screen and clicks on an AP that is using channel 6, the only statistics displayed are from frames that were going to or from that AP. &amp;nbsp;Single station statistics are also filtered if one station is clicked on in the Infrastructure screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this may sound like mumbo-jumbo if you are unfamiliar with AirMagnet. &amp;nbsp;And in the near future yours truly will do a non-holiday blog post that includes all of the links and graphics that may help this come to life. &amp;nbsp;But if you are already an AirMagnet user on this fine Columbus Day, then maybe you can use my favorite part of AirMagnet.&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.sniffwifi.com/2013/10/my-favorite-part-of-airmagnet.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Ben

trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;It&#39;s a rough world out there, folks. &amp;nbsp;The economy stinks (or, is great if you live in western North Dakota), finding love is harder than ever (or, easier than ever if you use online dating) and WiFi bandwidth is scarce (or, plentiful if you use the 5 GHz band). &amp;nbsp;Into this quagmire wades the Google Chromecast. &amp;nbsp;A cheap ($35 USD), little (about the size of an e-cigarette case) gadget that allows you to mirror your smartphone/tablet/computer screen to your television. &amp;nbsp;If you want to feel like a member of the 1% (at least, the top 1% of WiFi spectrum consumers), this is the gadget for you.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Reviews, tutorials and takes on Google&#39;s Chromecast are plentiful, so let&#39;s skip that. &amp;nbsp;On this blog we don&#39;t care whether people like the gadget. &amp;nbsp;We care about what the gadget does to the WiFi. &amp;nbsp;Does it suck up bandwidth? &amp;nbsp;Is it chatty during down times? &amp;nbsp;Does it interfere with existing networks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s take the first question last (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110932/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Charles Van Doren&lt;/a&gt; voice). &amp;nbsp;The Chromecast will interfere with existing networks, whether in a pre-working or working state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When in a pre-working state, the Chromecast acts as an AP. &amp;nbsp;Initially the Chromecast will have a default name that it will use as an SSID. &amp;nbsp;(Though when I did my test I had already given it a name of &quot;BenChromecast&quot;.) &amp;nbsp;Being an AP may not be a problem in some cases, but in this case it may be. &amp;nbsp;The Chromecast is 2.4 GHz only, and it supports a maximum rate of 72.2 Mbps. &amp;nbsp;Not only is it taking up one of the three (or, four, if you are in the parts of the world that allow for 2.4 GHz channels 1-13) available channels, but it is doing so at a non-MIMO (and, thus, relatively low) rate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XHNf2te_bFM/UkNw_m2rWHI/AAAAAAAAAQ4/5GFx2xHpNEg/s1600/OP_ChromeCast-Beacon.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;213&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XHNf2te_bFM/UkNw_m2rWHI/AAAAAAAAAQ4/5GFx2xHpNEg/s400/OP_ChromeCast-Beacon.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The good news is that most Chromecast usage will not occur with the Chromecast in master mode (which just means &quot;acting like an AP&quot;). &amp;nbsp;Most of the time it will be in managed mode (which means &quot;acting like a staiton&quot;).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;First about the transition from AP to station: in the frame capture it looked buggy. &amp;nbsp;The Chromecast is using two different MAC addresses; one when acting like an AP and another when acting as a client/station. &amp;nbsp;That is pretty normal. &amp;nbsp;When Windows devices use the hostednetwork function, their WiFi radios use separate MAC addresses for AP and client/station activity. &amp;nbsp;The problem with the Chromecast is that it appeared to be unable to stop acting as an AP as long as a client/station remained associated to it. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Over and over in my captures, I saw the Chromecast trying to deauthenticate my iPad (3rd gen):&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p5KH1-sboEY/UkSQFMc3DkI/AAAAAAAAARI/cagJVe5m8lY/s1600/OP_ChromeCast-ChanSwitchDeauth.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;212&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p5KH1-sboEY/UkSQFMc3DkI/AAAAAAAAARI/cagJVe5m8lY/s400/OP_ChromeCast-ChanSwitchDeauth.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;By this point my Chromecast was already acting as a client/station (using a different MAC address) to my home wireless router. &amp;nbsp;What seemed to be happening (and when I say, &quot;seemed to be,&quot; that&#39;s carny for &quot;I saw this, but I need to investigate further before I make a conclusion) was that my iPad was stubbornly trying to stay associated to the Chromecast&#39;s BSS, and the Chromecast wouldn&#39;t shut down the BSS until the iPad got off. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;m guessing that it has something to do with running the Chromecast app on the iPad.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The long and the short of the Chromecast stubbornly acting like an AP is that it could lead to congestion of the airspace. &amp;nbsp;If someone plugs in a Chromecast, that Chromecast is just going to keep acting like an AP all day, at least until the Chromecast user disassociates from the SSID that Chromecast creates.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;A bigger problem with the Chromecast acting like a client/station is that it is chatty. &amp;nbsp;While idle, I saw Chromecast using between 200 kbps (on about 2,000 frames) and 400 kbps (on about 4,500 frames). &amp;nbsp;That may not seem like much, but it&#39;s still 40 microseconds of channel time for each frame&#39;s physical header on top of the channel time being take up by actual data. &amp;nbsp;Trust me. &amp;nbsp;That&#39;s a lot of wasted channel time for a WiFi-based app.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Once mirroring began, the Chromecast got really active on the channel. &amp;nbsp;The Chromecast is designed to mirror a high quality video stream, so I was prepared to see lots of data. &amp;nbsp;(And the fact that my Chromecast mirror was from my WiFi laptop to my WiFi Chromecast meant that double the number of frames would be needed for a wireless-to-wireless transmission.) &amp;nbsp;Still, what I saw surprised me:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a

style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Look at that! &amp;nbsp;71,452,996 bytes of data in one minute. &amp;nbsp;That&#39;s 571,623,968 bits of data. &amp;nbsp;Even if you figure an average data rate of 30 Mbps (which may be high for a non-MIMO, 2.4 GHz only device) and then add 2.62 seconds for the physical layer headers (which is40 microseconds for each of the 65,497 frames), that means that almost 23 seconds of the 61 seconds of total available channel time was used by this one Chromecast stream.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;I guess for a home user, having over 37% of your WiFi bandwidth taken up by a Chromecast is fine. &amp;nbsp;If you don&#39;t have neighbors that are close enough to interfere with your WiFi, then your other devices will probably be able to survive just fine on the other 63% of channel time that the Chromecast isn&#39;t using. &amp;nbsp;But gosh darn, if the Chromecast ever gets really, really popular in dense apartment complexes or office spaces, it&#39;s hard to see where the channel space will come from.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Given how much WiFi channel time the Chromecast needs, the fact that it is a 2.4 GHz device makes me wonder. &amp;nbsp;It makes me wonder if there are larger problems afoot. &amp;nbsp;I have a Cisco-Linksys WUSB600Nv2 802.11a/b/g/n USB adapter (Ralink chipset) that absolutely stinks when connected to a 5 GHz WiFi network. &amp;nbsp;Maybe Google either is unable to find good 5 GHz silicon or is too cheap to do it for a $35 USD device.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Whatever the reason for Chromecast&#39;s restriction to the 2.4 GHz band, the bottom line is that it is a bandwidth hog in a land of scarce bandwidth. &amp;nbsp;A fish in the desert, so to speak. &amp;nbsp;And if your WiFi isn&#39;t an oasis where 2.4 GHz channels are plentiful and untouched by neighbors, then you might want to think twice before embracing Chromecast. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.sniffwifi.com/2013/09/a-fish-in-desert-chomecast-sniffed.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Ben

is a chatty device. &amp;nbsp;How chatty? &amp;nbsp;I checked, and it is chattier than I thought.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Yours truly has done more WiFi sniffing of iPhones than yours truly cares to recount. &amp;nbsp;What has always stood out about these captures is the amount of chatter than an iPhone seems to engage in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a little test of my unlocked iPhone 5 to see exactly how chatty it was. &amp;nbsp;The test involved me turning on the phone&#39;s screen, spending a second looking at iMessage (which happened to be the last app I was on when the screen was turned off), pressing the Home button, opening the Twitter app (because, after all, if you&#39;re not &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/ben_sniffwifi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; these days then you&#39;re not wasting your time properly) and refreshing my Twitter feed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The test took about fifteen seconds. &amp;nbsp;My capture saw WiFi frames going to or from my phone for about 17.64 seconds (rounded up to 18 for the purposes of a catchier blog post title). &amp;nbsp;Here is what it looked like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VSjFBSFqDFE/UiEff2udSuI/AAAAAAAAAQM/3GZ39pMbV7w/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-08-30+at+2.42.59+PM.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em;

good news is that my phone was using high rates for data. &amp;nbsp;The highlighted frame above traveled through the air at 121.5 Mbps. &amp;nbsp;Some of the data frames even went all the way to the iPhone 5&#39;s maximum data rate, which is 150 Mbps. &amp;nbsp;(And pay no attention to the 6 Mbps or 24 Mbps frames. &amp;nbsp;That&#39;s control traffic. &amp;nbsp;Nothing you can do to escape that.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news is that my phone was very active on the channel despite the fact that all I really did was turn the thing on and refresh my Twitter feed. &amp;nbsp;Check out the stats from my capture:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zVCGY9u4iCQ/UiEgKNYpiKI/AAAAAAAAAQU/ddQQ0GeAooA/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-08-30+at+2.43.58+PM.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em;

&quot;Displayed&quot; statistics are representing my phone&#39;s traffic only. &amp;nbsp;And what happened in that 17.6 seconds? &amp;nbsp;268 kB (or, 0.268 MB if you want to look at it that way) was send across the wireless channel. &amp;nbsp;That is a pretty large amount of stuff for a simple Twitter feed refresh. &amp;nbsp;Imagine if I tried to look at a photo or browse the web.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the iPhone is a chatty Cathy. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s not very chatty when the screen is off (unseen above is the fact that the first frame with my phone&#39;s address was sent a full 10 seconds after I started capturing, which coincides with the time I turned on the phone&#39;s screen), but once people start using their iPhones those babies get active even when the user isn&#39;t very active.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does all of this mean to us? &amp;nbsp;One thing it means is that conserving battery life ain&#39;t just for the Sierra Club. &amp;nbsp;Users who keep their screens off are also keeping our WiFi networks clear. &amp;nbsp;The other big takeaway is that app developers don&#39;t care about us. &amp;nbsp;They&#39;re gonna make their apps the way they want to make their apps. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;d bet dollars to donuts (a cliché that no longer makes sense, but still) that developers from Twitter and Apple could have made the iPhone 5 a lot less active on the WiFi channel if they&#39;d have wanted to. &amp;nbsp;Typically it takes a crisis for app developers to reel in their network consumption. &amp;nbsp;Who knows if that will happen any time soon.&lt;br

trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fear not your sniffers, dear WiFi folk. &amp;nbsp;For they are your path to the truth.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I had a conference call today and the topic of carrier devices (smartphones, 3G/4G enabled tablets, etc.) on Wi-Fi networks came up. &amp;nbsp;The person on the other end needed to make sure that his WiFi devices were optimized for a variety of different WLAN infrastructures.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My first reaction (as is my first reaction to most WiFi related topics) was to sniff. &amp;nbsp;First set up the infrastructure. &amp;nbsp;Then use the device (which could mean connecting, roaming or running an app). &amp;nbsp;Then sniff what&#39;s happening. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;His reaction to my sniffing idea was pretty negative. &amp;nbsp;Their testing procedures are basically trial &amp;amp; error. &amp;nbsp;Set up the WLAN, then connect the device and then document what the user experience is. &amp;nbsp;If the user experience stinks, then make a change. &amp;nbsp;He was a sniffophobe.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I get why people are sniffophobes. &amp;nbsp;WiFi sniffers can be expensive and difficult to learn. &amp;nbsp;The idea that you&#39;re going to have to train a large group of people to understand sniffing software before you even run your first test may seem daunting.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sniffers are worth it because actions speak louder than words. &amp;nbsp;The &quot;words&quot; of a device are its GUI. &amp;nbsp;The &quot;actions&quot; of a device are its WiFi frames. &amp;nbsp;Sniffing frames reveals the truth. &amp;nbsp;If you device is too sticky or too slow or too jumpy or too whatever, then those WiFi frames will usually reveal it. &amp;nbsp;If you don&#39;t have those frames, then you might be seeing a problem that is caused by something that you are unaware of.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;WiFi sniffing is a specialized skill. &amp;nbsp;But for the people who really need to know details on how a device works or why a connection is unstable or if performance will hold up under stress, sniffing is worth it. &amp;nbsp;Try to avoid letting sniffophobia keep you from getting the information you need.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.sniffwifi.com/2013/08/sniffophobia-is-alive-and-well.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Ben

Work?</title><description>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A bunch of WiFi vendors made presentations at the Wireless Field Day events a couple of weeks ago, and the one that piqued my interest the most (at least in a positive way) was WildPackets&#39;. &amp;nbsp;The WildPackets OmniPeek software can now sniff 802.11ac traffic, with a catch. &amp;nbsp;The catch? &amp;nbsp;It only sniffs single streams 802.11ac traffic. &amp;nbsp;Is that a useful thing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;First things, first: In order to sniff 802.11ac traffic, you need a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BWT1IFE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00BWT1IFE&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=snwi-20&quot;&gt;AE6000 (Linksys Wireless Mini USB Adapter AC 580 Dual Band)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=snwi-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B00BWT1IFE&quot; style=&quot;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;adapter. &amp;nbsp;(And if you decide to buy one and want to support this blog, you can use that link to Amazon.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AE6000 adapter is a single stream 802.11ac adapter with a Ralink chipset. &amp;nbsp;WildPackets is developing a driver for the Ralink chipset and demonstrated the AE6000 in action. &amp;nbsp;The expectation is that it will be a month or two before the OmniPeek drivers for the AE6000 actually get released, but I bought one so that I&#39;m ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being able to sniff 802.11ac traffic may be great, but the even greater question is, &quot;how useful is single stream sniffing?&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, it was less than six months ago that yours truly was writing that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sniffwifi.com/2013/04/worthless-capture-part-ii-or-why-i-need.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;three stream capture is necessary&lt;/a&gt; for the modern enterprise. &amp;nbsp;Without three stream capture, the data going to and from a lot of laptops and media centers is going to be missed. &amp;nbsp;If you work in an area that needs to support those types of devices, that makes three streams a requirement for in-depth troubleshooting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some use cases for single stream capture. &amp;nbsp;Smartphones, tablets, bar code scanners, point of sale terminals and a number of other smaller devices all use single stream WiFi, and are expected to for the foreseeable future. &amp;nbsp;All data going to and from those devices can be captured with a well-placed AE6000. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the future we may see even more devices embrace single stream WiFi. &amp;nbsp;Remember, single stream WiFi saves battery life. &amp;nbsp;We all know how frustrated users get with laptops that can&#39;t hold a charge. &amp;nbsp;Just from my personal experience, I can tell you that I would gladly trade my MacBook Air&#39;s two stream WiFi interface for my iPad&#39;s single stream interface. &amp;nbsp;My iPad has slower networking than my MacBook Air, but not slow enough that it bugs me. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;ll gladly take a little bit of delay in my web surfing, emailing and perusing of Twitter in order to extend my laptop&#39;s battery life. &amp;nbsp;I have to imagine that there are a lot more people out there like me, and so I expect that laptop makers will start to embrace single stream WiFi radios at some point in an effort to serve us battery life fiends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For today, though, just make sure you know what you&#39;re trying to sniff. &amp;nbsp;If you have a bunch of tablets and smartphones that need attention, then the AE6000 works. &amp;nbsp;If the environment includes some multi-stream devices, then stick to sniffing from an adapter that supports multiple streams. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.sniffwifi.com/2013/08/can-single-stream-sniffing-work.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Ben

trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;WildPackets has a&amp;nbsp;sizable&amp;nbsp;discount for OmniPeek Professional right now if you bundle it with three OmniWiFi 802.11a/b/g/n 3-stream USB adapters. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;WildPackets OmniPeek has long been my favorite WiFi sniffer, and the OmniWiFi USB adapter is currently my favorite capture device. &amp;nbsp;So getting a package of OmniPeek Pro with three OmniWiFi adapters &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.wildpackets.com/solution_suites.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;at a $900 discount&lt;/a&gt; would seem to be an awesome deal, right? &amp;nbsp;Sort of. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.wildpackets.com/software.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;versions of WildPackets OmniPeek&lt;/a&gt;, and for the most part the more expensive versions add features that are far more useful for wired sniffing than for wireless sniffing. &amp;nbsp;One look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildpackets.com/products/omnipeek_network_analyzer#chart&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OmniPeek comparison chart&lt;/a&gt; reveals that the Compass screen and roaming testing are the only features that could possibly maybe justify a WiFi person spending $3,000 (discounted to $2,400 as part of the deal referenced above) on OmniPeek Pro rather than $1,200 on OmniPeek Basic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sniffwifi.com/2013/07/omniwifi-usb-adapter-and-omnipeek-75.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Compass is nice&lt;/a&gt;, and if you have a relatively large budget for WiFi sniffing software, then the deal referenced above may be a good deal. &amp;nbsp;Budget-conscious folks might have a tougher choice. &amp;nbsp;Do you want OmniPeek for general monitoring, troubleshooting and analysis? &amp;nbsp;If so, then maybe Pro is the move. &amp;nbsp;If you&#39;re more of a hardcore capture person who uses OmniPeek for filtering, statistics gathering and deep analysis, then Basic may be better.&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.sniffwifi.com/2013/08/an-omnipeek-deal.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Ben Miller)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid

trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The 802.11v amendment has been voted, stamped and added. &amp;nbsp;It is part of the 802.11 standard. &amp;nbsp;We still are unsure if we&#39;ll ever see it, but if we do it could ease some concerns about high-density WiFi.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Wireless Network Management is its name, and not being adopted is 802.11v&#39;s game. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wireless network management (WNM) is an addition to the 802.11 standard that puts more control in the hands of admins. &amp;nbsp;Today, the client/station controls everything: roaming, load balancing and congestion avoidance included. &amp;nbsp;WNM is designed to put that stuff in the hands of the infrastructure (APs, controllers and management software).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Companies that sell client/stations have (predictably?) declined to adopt WNM thus far. &amp;nbsp;That means that admins will continue to have to wait for the ultimate careful-what-you-wish for WiFi technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is, however, one part of WNM that is separate from the move to infrastructure control: Multiple BSSID Beacons. &amp;nbsp;APs have supported multiple BSSIDs for a long time (and Beacons for even longer), but until 802.11v/WNM, the two were never put together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Multiple BSSID Beacons are important because they could cause a reduction in channel overhead. &amp;nbsp;Many WiFi networks that support an array of users are hamstrung by the fact that each BSSID takes up about 2.5% of available 2.4 GHz channel time. &amp;nbsp;(I wish I could take credit for that calculation, but it was an engineer from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascom.us/us-en/index-us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ascom&lt;/a&gt; who did the math and relayed it to me.) &amp;nbsp;That means that a hockey arena deployment that supports separate SSIDs for Team, media, concessions, ticket scanning, audio/visual and guests would lose 15% (6 x 2.5%) of available channel time from each AP. &amp;nbsp;If the big open spaces like the arena bowl have areas where APs on channels 1, 3, 5 and 7 (a bad channel design, but it happens) are covering the same space, then each of those APs would be losing somewhere between 45% and 60% of available channel time before the first data frame is sent. &amp;nbsp;If all six of those SSIDs could be contained in one Beacon, the Beacon overhead could be reduced to 10% or less on each channel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knows if 802.11v/WNM Multiple BSSID Beacons will ever be adopted. &amp;nbsp;Hockey fans already saw the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WZ0uRJOatQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flying V&lt;/a&gt; cut through the neutral zone trap to perfection, only to have it go unadopted by those stodgy NHL coaches. &amp;nbsp;Let&#39;s hope that WiFi vendors treat our V differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br

Signal</title><description>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Today it was announced that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.7signal.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;7 Signal&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;would be a first time presenter at Wireless Field Day in August. &amp;nbsp;7 Signal offers a product that uses distributed sensors that analyze a WLAN.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wait a moment. &amp;nbsp;This sounds familiar...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;It was a mere fifteen months ago that yours truly spouted a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sniffwifi.com/2012/04/worthless-capture.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;negative opinion of distributed sensors&lt;/a&gt; for WLAN analysis and troubleshooting. &amp;nbsp;To be precise, distributed sensors were accused to producing a worthless capture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A company like 7 Signal, then, offers both good news and bad news. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good: People are starting to care more about WiFi sniffing and analysis. &amp;nbsp;A company like 7 Signal can only exist if networking folks appreciate the value of seeing what it happening in the air. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: Distributed sensors produce worthless captures. &amp;nbsp;Does it matter if a 7 Signal sensor can connect if an iPad cannot? &amp;nbsp;Does it matter if good channel quality is seen at the ceiling (where the Sapphire Eye sensors are supposed to be mounted) if channel quality is bad at a user&#39;s desk? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distributed sensors have a place in WLAN analysis. &amp;nbsp;It allows for general information to be gathered from a single console. &amp;nbsp;My problem is that in some cases companies eschew portable WiFi sniffers and spectrum analyzers or rely to heavily on information from the distributed system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br

King</title><description>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;As long time readers of this blog might know, WildPackets OmniPeek has been my favorite WiFi sniffer for nearly a decade. &amp;nbsp;Then I found out about WildPackets&#39; OmniWiFi 3-stream 802.11n USB adapter and I fell even more in love. &amp;nbsp;Now I learn that OmniPeek 7.5 has added wireless features to the Compass screen. &amp;nbsp;A good product has been made better (though time will tell if it lasts).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;First, OmniWiFi:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that different 802.11n devices have different capabilities is one of those things that sometimes flies under the radar. &amp;nbsp;The standard may say 600 Mbps, but just on the Apple website one can buy 802.11n devices with maximum rates of 65 Mbps (iPhone 4S), 150 Mbps (iPad Mini), 300 Mbps (Macbook Air 2012) and 450 Mbps (Macbook Pro 2012). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;450 Mbps WiFi devices are the ones that give WiFi pros trouble because so many sniffing tools fail to capture 450 Mbps traffic. &amp;nbsp;The popular (at least with Wireshark devotees) AirPcap NX from Riverbed, the beloved (at least by yours truly) D-Link DWA-160 and the hacker-ish SR71-USB from Memphis Grizzlies owner Robert Cera&#39;s Ubiquiti Networks all are dual-band 802.11a/b/g/n USB adapters that can be used with WiFi sniffing software, but none of them can capture 450 Mbps data frames. &amp;nbsp;Those adapters all have two radio chains (and thus, can capture two-stream 802.11n) and 450 Mbps traffic uses three-stream 802.11n.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OmniWiFi is a USB adapter that gives WildPackets OmniPeek users the ability to capture three-stream 802.11n traffic. &amp;nbsp;It also dynamically adjusts its capture settings when 802.11n traffic is in the air. &amp;nbsp;When my iPhone was sending and receiving data frames over a 40 MHz channel, OmniWiFi captured all 40 MHz. &amp;nbsp;When my acknowledgment, request to send or clear to send frames went out on a 20 MHz channel, OmniWiFi caught that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The limitation of OmniWiFi is that it is 802.11n, and the consumer side of WiFi is moving towards 802.11ac. &amp;nbsp;Management frames and most control frames will still be captured with OmniWiFi. &amp;nbsp;Data frames over WLANs that have yet to upgrade of 802.11ac access points, as well. &amp;nbsp;The problem is that if a coffee shop on the ground floor of an office building decides to buy a new Apple Airport Extreme, you won&#39;t be able to tell exactly how the data traffic going to and from a new Macbook Air is affecting your WLAN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I spoke to a representative from WildPackets, I was told that an 802.11ac version of OmniWiFi might be in the works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To repeat: &amp;nbsp;When I spoke to a representative (someone whose job description presumably includes promoting the company) from WildPackets (the company who makes the best enterprise-grade 802.11n WiFi sniffing solution), I (a WiFi sniffing blogger) was told that an 802.11ac (the hot new standard) version of OmniWiFi (the best wireless hardware ever created by the company) might (as in, might-or-might-not) be in the works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the heck?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was told that an 802.11ac version of OmniWiFi was not a certainty, I sort of couldn&#39;t believe it. The WildPackets rep (a technical guy who knows 802.11 quite well) shoveled over some mumbo-jumbo about OmniPeek capture support in 802.11ac access points (from Ruckus Wireless) and the speed limitations of the USB 3.0 interface (and I was proud that I avoided giving my stump speech on the lack of value in throughput tests in response). &amp;nbsp;He said that USB-based wireless capture was limiting, and that most WildPackets customers prefer to capture from APs, anyway. &amp;nbsp;Great. &amp;nbsp;Fantastic. &amp;nbsp;But how about using a WiFi sniffer to solve the tough problems? &amp;nbsp;That requires field work. &amp;nbsp;That requires a portable device from which to capture. &amp;nbsp;That is not the type of thing you do from an AP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to enjoy OmniWiFi while 802.11n continues to be relevant, but I really, really, really hope that WildPackets pushes Ralink (makers of the current 802.11n OmniWiFi chipset) to make a USB adapter that does 802.11ac capture. &amp;nbsp;I don&#39;t want to have to write a blog post titled, &quot;Worthless Capture, Part III&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Then, OmniPeek 7.5:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conversation with the WildPackets rep also covered OmniPeek 7.5. &amp;nbsp;If you are a user of OmniPeek Basic ($1,200 USD), then you can skip the rest of this blog. &amp;nbsp;OmniPeek 7.5 doesn&#39;t add anything all that new. &amp;nbsp;The Packets screen has a new MCS (modulation and coding scheme) column and a new Spatial Streams column (see below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PQbkoYTpNs4/UdIKEmXaunI/AAAAAAAAAPY/KsSNBogSRWE/s1366/OP_Packets.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;213&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PQbkoYTpNs4/UdIKEmXaunI/AAAAAAAAAPY/KsSNBogSRWE/s400/OP_Packets.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Neither the MCS column nor the Spatial Streams column works, so forget it. &amp;nbsp;Maybe OmniPeek will get things going in a future update, but that picture above clearly shows 54 Mbps (which could be single stream 802.11a/g or dual stream, MCS 3 802.11n) data and it clearly shows no indication of which type of 54 Mbps data it is (answer: 802.11n. &amp;nbsp;Now can you tell me in the Comments how I know that from looking at JUST THE PACKETS in this capture...?). &amp;nbsp;(To be fair, the WildPackets rep used Go To Meeting to show me a capture that had information in the MCS and Spatial Streams columns. &amp;nbsp;It did not work for me, however.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;For those of you that use OmniPeek Pro ($3,000 USD) or OmniPeek Enterprise ($6,000 USD), there is something new in version 7.5, and it involves the Compass.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The OmniPeek Compass is something that has been present in OmniPeek, but I never used to use it because it didn&#39;t give me relevant WiFi information. &amp;nbsp;I want to know Data Rates. &amp;nbsp;I want to know Retry percentages. &amp;nbsp;I don&#39;t care about Mbps averages or conversations. &amp;nbsp;Save that for wired sniffing. &amp;nbsp;Wireless sniffing should be all about wireless (connection, performance, security, etc.) analysis.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;OmniPeek Compass now shows data rate and retry information, and it is great. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Let&#39;s take an example. &amp;nbsp;Say I have a smartphone that is having WiFi problems. &amp;nbsp;I can create a couple of smartphone filters (one for data coming to my smartphone and one for data coming from my smartphone) and then go to Compass. &amp;nbsp;First I apply one filter (To the phone) and then the other (From the phone). &amp;nbsp;I can then track what rates are typically being used in both directions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--FazRVZ3e1U/UdIRxyA8C9I/AAAAAAAAAPo/fA32RWYa7CM/s1366/OP_CompassDataRates.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;212&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--FazRVZ3e1U/UdIRxyA8C9I/AAAAAAAAAPo/fA32RWYa7CM/s400/OP_CompassDataRates.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The screenshot above shows that my smartphone is using higher rates than my AP. &amp;nbsp;On the left hand side (in the area where I was applying the To Phone filter) the maximum rate fluctuated between 54 and 81 Mbps (MCS 3 and 4). &amp;nbsp;Once I switched to the From Phone filter, the maximum rate immediately spiked to being between 81 and 108 Mbps (MCS 4 and 5). &amp;nbsp;That tells me that my phone is very aggressive in trying to send data at high rates.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;A quick flip of the Compass screen from Rates to Retries allows me to see if my smartphone&#39;s use of high rates has consequences.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DzlhABTeg2M/UdITO5W0TFI/AAAAAAAAAP4/YBa7bjSDBh4/s1366/OP_CompassRetries.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;212&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DzlhABTeg2M/UdITO5W0TFI/AAAAAAAAAP4/YBa7bjSDBh4/s400/OP_CompassRetries.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Again, the To Phone filter was applied first (on the left of the graph) and the From Phone filter was applied after (on the right). &amp;nbsp;Data going to my smartphone was almost never retried (which made sense, since the office uses a 5 GHz channel that is unoccupied by any other WiFi networks). &amp;nbsp;Once the filter switched to data being sent by my phone, Retries started to show. &amp;nbsp;The percentages were still below 8% (which is the rule-of-thumb number I use to determine if Retries are a problem), but they were still there. &amp;nbsp;It means that, at least for the application I was running for the test, the iPhone 5 might be a little bit better off using lower rates so that Retries can be almost entirely eliminated.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;That is just one example. &amp;nbsp;One of the best things about OmniPeek is the myriad ways that filters can be configured and applied, and Compass is a perfect place to see what those filtered devices and protocols are doing in real time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;OmniPeek 7.5 is worth having, but it could still be improved. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;d still like to see WildPackets copy off of the superb work that Metageek did with Eye P.A. and add a Time metric in addition to Packets and Bytes. &amp;nbsp;OmniPeek also needs to give better breakdowns of exactly how many packets or bytes are using which data rates. &amp;nbsp;Still, it remains a great tool and the additions to Compass in version 7.5 make it even more useful.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.sniffwifi.com/2013/07/omniwifi-usb-adapter-and-omnipeek-75.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Ben Miller)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PQbkoYTpNs4/UdIKEmXaunI/AAAAAAAAAPY/KsSNBogSRWE/s72-c/OP_Packets.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>1</thr:total></item></channel></rss>
