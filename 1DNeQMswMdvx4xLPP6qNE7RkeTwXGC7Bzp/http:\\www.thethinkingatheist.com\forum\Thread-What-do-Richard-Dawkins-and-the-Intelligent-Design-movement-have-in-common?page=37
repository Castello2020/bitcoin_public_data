The cheat is that the program has a goal. It collects changes that get closer to the goal, unlike natural selection which has no goals.
The example illustrates the power of cumulative change in contrast to all-at-once change.
I see you found the portion of vid where Dawkins claims his computer program looks into the future.

I don't forgive you for being one. There is no excuse for being as stupid as you have proven to be. You said you came here to challenge us, yet have never once even begun to. I realize you religious types feel the need to tell yourselves you are morally superior, (thus this "forgiveness" crap) but actually your self-righteousness is very tiresome, and quite meaningless. It's an attempted deflection from the fact that you have never addressed the points aimed in your direction. There is no forgiveness for that, or the fact that with no expertise in the field, you are so arrogant as to think you were up to challenging an expert in the field in which you have no knowledge, or thinking you had some special insight with which to challenge the way people thought. There is no excuse or forgiveness for being an arrogant fool.

It's a genetic algorithm. A computer program with a goal in mind, that is what he means by looking into the future, that the genetic algorithm has to match the sentence.
In the wild organisms simply reproduce, and die. What ever the environment happens to be or change into forces the organisms to change with the environment. Provided that change is slow enough for the organisms to change with it.
The second video shows how manipulating the environment changes a creature in a computer program. I wish the site was still up so you could play with it. That program makes evolution a lot easier to understand.
I did find a new simulator to play with

I believe Fullcircle provided this link in another thread. I am posting it here because it seems relavent to this conversation.

I believe that the article backs up my view that evolution isn't blind to the future. That it is predictable and takes certain trajectories. That God would need not to micromanage mutations as suggested by ID'st but rather He would just have to "aim the gun" and evolution would hit a desired target.

No, it does not back up your view.
It is a very narrow experiment involving a tiny subset of proteins, and an invented definition of fitness.
Skepticism is not a position; it is an approach to claims.
Science is not a subject, but a method.

All evolutionary experiments involve a small subset and defined fitness.
Maybe you can produce something like an experiment that substantiates your view....Dawkins tried in the blind watch maker but admitted he had to cheat. Therefore his argument amounted to an unsubstantiated opinion. If he is right, he should be able to demonstrate it....but he admits he can't....so why should I favor his opinion over experiments like the one in the article?
