If you do not believe in God, start listing the things you believe in.
Are you saying that the fact we are alive means "God" exists?
Following your "logic", If that were true, the very same existence of god would mean he also has a god.
if your faith can move mountains it should be able to withstand criticism

So if someone showed up at your door, and was able to create life from nothing you'd believe he was a god?
I will have to file this one away for later.

Re: What evidence would convince you of the existence of god? Id say multiple confirmable instances of showing itself or making physics bend in ways the demonstrate a God multiple times.
Not just once or I may think i'm crazy or it was a freak of the normal nature.

If you do not believe in God, start listing the things you believe in.
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.
Life is not evidence, but we'll save that for your other thread.
Love is great emotion, but can be destructive when used improperly. IE: Muslims protecting men from women by forcing them to wear a burqa.
Prophecies are merely psychobabble.
Speaking in tounges was already proven to also be babble.

RE: What evidence would convince you of the existence of god? Thanks for this, Phaedrus. You've got me to thinking.
My mind kept refuting answers until it backed itself into a corner. I have but one simple answer:
If God were to make me also God, then....I *might* believe. I can't say for certain, but if I were made omniscient as well, then at least I would know for certain whether the being that just bestowed me with this gift were also the genuine God, what he intends, why, etc. I would also need to be made omnipotent or the deal's off.

RE: What evidence would convince you of the existence of god? Shit, I ain't even sure what evidence could convince me of the existence of me.
Breathing - it's more art than science.

RE: What evidence would convince you of the existence of god? The same evidence of things we already know to exist. God would have to exist then the evidence of that existence could be clearly obtained.
There is no evidence that can be shown for a non existent being
That being would first need to exist then evidence can be presented.
It's like asking what evidence would need to be given for you to believe that you have six arms or that the moon is really made of cheese
Insanity - doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results

RE: What evidence would convince you of the existence of god? God exists because my arm is just long enough to wipe my ass!
That is unquestionable proof right there!

I believe that the ineffable is ineffable.
I believe that in an ever changing cosmos an absolute is an oxymoron.
I believe that our knowing is contingent upon circumstance, time, and space.
I believe that simplistic dogmas can be very dangerous.
I believe that no one will ever know it all.
