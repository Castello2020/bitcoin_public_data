The bible is a man made book.
Member of the Cult of Reason
The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

RE: Proof of Jesus? Christian do have proof, the bible and faith in a God that does exist. You still show no proof. You go off the words you say from your mouth.
The bible is the voice of Jesus - God himself. He inspired men to write it so people like me and you can know what is right.
2 Tim 3:16
All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives. It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right.
Bible is my proof alone with faith. They work together.
Amen. Jesus still love us even if we don't understand.

Well, it's not that they need evidence to prove a Jesus existed. They just need to prove that THE Jesus existed. I am sure that you will find that there were many people named Mohammed back in the day. The only trouble is finding out which Mohammed shitted the Qu'ran out.
That's true. Although it shouldn't be too hard to find proof of a magical man who turns water into wine, normally. (But sadly that seems to be the case) I usually tell theists two things if they want to prove their case to me:
1. Prove that there can be a deity
2. Prove your deity

You've given no proof. You've babbled boring scripture that isn't really related, and we've told you why the bible isn't good evidence, you've acknowledged our position on the bible, and you still babble on. Maybe instead of wasting our time you be more useful, like find historical proof?

Is my little pony evidence of talking ponies?
Didn't think so.
Is the Bible, which makes a claim of God Evidencd for the God in which the Bible is claiming?
Nope, not unless the Bible is proven to be true. The Bible has not been "Proven" to be true.
You don't show evidence of God, you are the ones relying on words from the bible.
The book makes the claim of infallibility, which isn't evidence of infallibility.

Before you ask those questions, you should establish what a deity is. Poonjab

For some, yes. But for others, it is more complicated than that.
