P.S.
I've seen it, but can't find it, so if you can help me... Textile and pharmaceutical industry? Thank you.

Not all, but most. That is why I want it. DuPont owns a huge portion of pharmacies, as well as textile industry. You can guess 3 times why I am interested in that particular area..

Also, the second picture about cars is older, from the time when Ford still owned Jaguar, it is owned by Tata now, so the first picture is more accurate.

RE: Who owns what? Fox news and National Geographic being owned by the same company makes sense now.
Member of the Cult of Reason
The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.
