So far I see two votes for me?
But I'd give it up to science, critical thinking and the silly strange believers here. They provide to many ideas and have been the source of great deabtes and fun.

TTA Awards. I'd like to nominate Shannow (where the fuck did he go) for his video breaking down HoC in the Forum Visualization Thread. It had the dual result of helping us understand HoC while making him feel like a Specimen at the same time!

RE: TTA Awards. I nominate Erx for the like-giving award.
Fuck dude. You've liked over 10,000 posts!
Erx is also runner up in the stoner category. First place has gotta be either me or my buddy Filox.
