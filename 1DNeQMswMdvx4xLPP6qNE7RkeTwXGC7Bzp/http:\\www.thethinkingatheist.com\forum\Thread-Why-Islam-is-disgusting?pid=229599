RE: Why Islam is disgusting Ghost is a crusader for cultural relativism.
To explain his position.
You see that because it is a part of their culture or tradition, they are as right as you are, and you can not say they are morally wrong or you are morally right.

Do you even have the capacity to grasp just how astonishingly ignorant that statement is?
If you are insinuating that Africans can afford life-long heavy medication to avoid dying from HIV/AIDS then you are the pathetically ignorant one here, spooky.

RE: Why Islam is disgusting It's not the religion it's the people FFS. It wasn't the religion or its beliefs that caused this, it was the people who believe in the religion that caused it.

Excuse me, but how does that absolve religion, the church, from the responsibility for the genocides, massacres, and misery that's its 'rule' caused?
And FYI it was the pope* who forbade the simplest of preventions of HIV/AIDS as an 'article of faith' in extremely public statements, 'papal letters' publicly read in all Roman Catholic churches from the pulpit, etc., to the African peoples. NOT the people!
*the current one and the previous one

RE: Why Islam is disgusting Hey, fst.
Don't speak about me in the fucking third person.
Two, don't try to dismiss what I have to say with cheap BS.
Three, you are entirely incorrect about my position in this matter.
While all of that upsets me, nothing you could possibly say could ever hope to come remotely close to the fucking rancid feces that just projectile vomited out of Janus' mouth.

WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST CALL ME?!?!??!?!?!
You make fucking ignorant fucking statements about black people and then you call me a fucking spook? Fuck you!
You do realise that there are fucking cities across Africa, you fucking racist! They have drinking water and flush toilets and, gasp, some of them can even read!
I know you probably like to call us spear-chuckers, you dirty piece of shit, but we're actually just a little more advanced than that.
And no, it's not the easiest thing to ignore ignorant racists, but aside from telling you to go fuck yourself, there's absolutely nothing constructive I can say that would have any effect on you. Like Marilyn Manson said, "I wasn't born with enough middle fingers."

RE: Why Islam is disgusting I actually lived in Africa for years, my friend.
Did you?
But I must say you know how to choose your role models.
Oh, and FYI, straight from Merriam-Webster's thesaurus:
ghost = shadow, specter (or spectre), spirit, spook... and probably 36 other synonyms in the English language alone.
And it so happens 'ghost' is the moniker you chose for this forum...! Now if I had called you Tokelosh it would have been different, of course. But I didn't.
So don't get your knickers in a twist.

That's a given. Which only supports the argument for how 'equally bad' both religious organizations are.
You know what's hot news in Middle Eastern news right now? It's Erika Menendez, the American Xtian who – by her own statements – hates muslims and hindus so much that she pushed a hindu under a New York subway train...
And don't forget Waco, Jim Jones, or the Pilgrim Fathers, etc. etc. etc. All of them religious fundamentalist idiots. All of them Xtians. All of them Americans.
Xtians can be just as religion-crazy as muslims can be.
