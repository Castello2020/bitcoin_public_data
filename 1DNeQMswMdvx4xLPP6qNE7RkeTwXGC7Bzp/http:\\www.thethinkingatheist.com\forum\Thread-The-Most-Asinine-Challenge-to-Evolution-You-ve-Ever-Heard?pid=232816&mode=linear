The question is poorly stated. Evolution does not make things 'better'. Evolution, through the process of Natural Selection, makes organisms that are more likely to out-survive other organisms and reproduce. There is no evolutionary reason for humans to live hundreds of years, we only need two dozen or so to reproduce and raise our offspring.
So things get better at passing on their genes and traits, but not better in the sense this question is refferring to.

Well, arguably, living longer allows us to reproduce more often. Just ask these people: http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/70...e-1.346386
OK, that was invitro, which makes it weird as hell if you ask me, but still.
So maybe longer lives means more offspring and more odds of species survival. In that case, a longer lifespan would actually be "better" for a species.
On the other hand, maybe longer lives means more competition for limited resources, and worse, more feeble elderly (specifically, the extremely old) that the tribe must care for, so maybe longer lifespan is a burden on a species. Maybe a longer lifespan actually isn't "better".
I dunno, it could go either way on that one. Heck, those long-lived trees and tortoises reproduce more often AND compete for more resources, so maybe neither factor is truly relevant and maybe a species isn't "better" either way. Have to ask a biologist. Which is why I said that the OP's question was actually an interesting one, at least to me.

What more do you expect?
Evolution does not have goals or direction.
FIXT. It does not have any effect on our reproduction, so our natural tendency to kill one another is currently unimportant to highlight in the explanation. Poonjab

RE: The Most Asinine Challenge to Evolution You've Ever Heard That is not the most asinine attempt to challenge evolution.
This is:
"What if you are wrong?"

RE: The Most Asinine Challenge to Evolution You've Ever Heard Ok this has to be the most asinine objection ever. Which also has nothing to do with evolution but the theist thinks it does?

At least the kid tried to use science.

Occam's Razor. Which is more likely: 1. this genius figured all this out on his own (and got it all wrong)
2. this kid got the idea from some lame apologist, or apologist website, and made a video out of it
I dunno, but I think if he tried to use science, he would have at least concluded that evolution has nothing to do with the origin of the universe. The fact that he started from this immensely flawed supposition that I have, so far, only found rampant in Christian apology, leads me to the conclusion that he's either an apologist's puppet or an apologist's parrot, not sure which.

RE: The Most Asinine Challenge to Evolution You've Ever Heard Quote:"If evolution makes things better, then why don't humans live as long as trees?"
Organisms that are preyed upon heavily need to be able to reproduce quickly in order to insure the survival of their species.
For example, the Galapagos Tortoise has a lifespan of over one-hundred years due to few predators.
On the other hand, rats can reproduce months after they're born because they have to live in hostile environments.
Simple enough?
Cool story, bro. Pages (3):
