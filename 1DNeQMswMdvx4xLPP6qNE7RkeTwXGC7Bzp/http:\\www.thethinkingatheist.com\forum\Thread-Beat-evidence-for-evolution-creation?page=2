I am an evolutionist and believe that the best line of evidence comes from the genome and atavisms/vestige. I've yet to see a shread of evidence for creation.

Yes, the grooves in the banana presents undeniable proof that God exists! I just can't understand why the whole world isn't a Christian now. Those darn atheists really must worship Satan!

RE: Beat evidence for evolution/creation? Best evidence for evolution... for me it would be fossils, dna, retroviruses and speciation of salamanders.
For the creatard they'll deny fossils and dna. So showing them bad design, and vestigial organs is where they have to admit that god is either inept, or that evolution is the only way to account for it.
