RE: Proof of Jesus? You gave us shit, over and over.
We've crushed your proof, over and over. And in ways, (evidence of absence = absence of evidence) we have given you proof. Now, when I say, give us proof, I mean, stop googling bible verses you like and do some research for once.
Bury me with my guns on, so when I reach the other side - I can show him what it feels like to die.
Bury me with my guns on, so when I'm cast out of the sky, I can shoot the devil right between the eyes.

Study the bible for yourself so you can understand more. Knowledge is power.
2 Tim 2:15
Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
Jesus still love us all even if we have not read the bible.
Amen
You do realize 2nd Timothy is really just a letter from Paul to Timothy, and doesn't apply to anybody else. Again out of context.
Do you know anything about the bible, have you actually read it and learned about it's origins?

RE: Proof of Jesus? You have to read to believe... how would you not know if you don't read. We are so busy trying to put the Word of God down as if it does not exist. Jesus did exist, Jesus is God, and Jesus is the Word. Just except it.
Read John 1:1-5 and 14
1In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2He was with God in the beginning.
3Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. 4In him was life, and that life was the light of men. 5The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it. 14The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only,d who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. Until you show me proof, like I just did.. than you stand defeated.
You know what the bible is.. you just don't want to know. Because the bible expose who we are. Yes, sometime it is hard to take, but when you Jesus teach you what is right...it is sweet.
Jesus still love you.

RE: Proof of Jesus? Hello fstratzero,
Yes, Paul wrote the book of Timothy... but like I said earlier... God inspired him and gave him the words to write:
2 Tim 3:16 All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness
Jesus still love us.

Genesis
GENESIS 34:13 Shechem had premarital sex with Jacob’s daughter Dinah, which angered Jacob’s sons. Shechem and his father, Hamor, agreed to circumcision for the men in the city in order for Shechem to marry Dinah and make Jacob’s other daughters eligible for the men of the city. Three days later, while the men were still enduring the pain of circumcision, Jacob’s sons attacked the unsuspecting city, killing Shechem and Hamor with swords, looting the city, seizing the flocks, herds, possessions and wealth, plundering the houses and carrying off their women and children.
GENESIS 6 & 7 Unhappy with the wickedness of man, God killed every living thing on the planet except Noah’s family. Men, women, infants and animals drowned in unimaginable terror and agony.
GENESIS 19:6- In Sodom, Lot’s home was assaulted by a homosexual mob seeking to have relations with two angels. Lot volunteered his virgin daughters to the crowd, saying "you can do what you like with them" as long as the guests are left alone. After offering his children to be raped, Lot was then appointed by God as worthy of rescue from Sodom’s destruction.
GENESIS 19:26: God, still unfazed by the proposed rape of Lot’s virgin daughters, turned Lot’s wife into a pillar of salt for the heinous crime of looking over her shoulder.
GENESIS 38: 8-10 – Onan was instructed by Judah to lay with his brother’s wife to produce offspring for his brother (who was put to death by God for wickedness). Onan slept with his brother’s wife but "spilled his semen on the ground to keep from producing offspring for his brother" (NIV). God found this wicked, so God killed him.

Matthew
MATTHEW 5:17 "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them." Jesus endorses the mass murder, rape, slavery, torture and incest written about in the Old Testament.

MATTHEW 8:21 A man sought to follow Jesus, but he wanted to bury his recently deceased father before he went. Jesus replied, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus ignored the man’s grief.
