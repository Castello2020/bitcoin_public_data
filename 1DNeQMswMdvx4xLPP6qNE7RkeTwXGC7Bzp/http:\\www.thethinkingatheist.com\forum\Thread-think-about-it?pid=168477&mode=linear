RE: think about it (11-09-2012 07:48 PM)Sinners Prayer Wrote: do you really think your life has the same value of a fish out of water ,you and all you are made up of is maget food or just waiting around for worms to eat the left overs..oh mabe your only here to find a job and work till your dead and the boss just love you so much..or who really understands when no one else will..what is that feeling in your heart that makes you cry ..if there is no God than we should kill or rap who ever we please...see we are like God we want peace and love just as God want from us....its ok im the sinners prayer..why should you ask for someone to forgive you of what you did...hmmm
This morning I dropped my daughter off at school and she was going to be slightly late. I spent half the drive to work feeling guilty that I caused her to be late. Why? Because I love her with all my heart and I know she hates to walk into class late so I was angry with myself for failing to get her there on time. If I, with my "imperfect human love" can be bothered by something so small because of that love, how is it that your god could create hell to throw some of his children into so they will suffer unimaginable pain for all eternity? I have heard some people say that concept of hell is wrong - that hell is really just a separation from God which itself causes huge suffering and sinners, not God, put themselves there. Ok, then so how is it that God wouldn't at the very least remove those people from existence so they wouldn't have to suffer for all eternity? Where is his love and compassion for his children?
You have things backwards. If it's love you want us to find, your god is not the place to find it at all. Of all beings, he is the worst at it! For example, see the above paragraph. Supposedly, he is in the position to love best, but then he fails miserably! If you think your god is the reason we should not kill or rape, I really am scratching my head at how you came to that conclusion. Read the Bible. God teaches that we should kill, that women are to be treated as sex slaves, and that incest is acceptable. THIS is who you want us to learn from?
How do you justify following such an angry, jealous, viscous being and encouraging others to do so? How do you justify completely ignoring all the evidence of your god's own violations of his commandments and insisting blindly instead that he is "wonderful", "loving", and "good"?
You started this thread. How about taking responsibility for it? If you have nothing of real substance to say in reply to anyone in this thread, I will take it as an admission that you recognize the fallacy that your god is and have no real arguments to defend him with. I wonder how that will sit with your god...
I'm waiting.
So is your god (at least in your mind).

RE: think about it So, as some of you may have guessed, when it comes to posting, I may as well be a newbie. Perhaps someone here might explain to me the actual purpose of this particular section of the forum? I had thought I could witness some fine mental gymnastics here, but so far all I've seen is preaching and ignoring from some of the theist posters.
Has the forum changed over time? Did it once serve a purpose which has faded? Perhaps my sample has been too small?
Would someone like to recommend some threads for me to see? If so, thanks in advance.
Also, if the state of the forum has turned into a place for posts like the OPs, I assume someone has suggested doing something about it? Or do you guys like it this way?

So this god character is the ultimate vigilante? I hate to break this to you, well actually I don't, if somebody commits a crime or harms somebody, the only punishment or restitution is in this life. You may want to believe this god thingy will punish those who do wrong but isn't that just a little too anthropomorphic? Can't this little celestial mafia boss figure out that eternal punishment for finite crimes isn't very moral or loving?
I know people like you come in here and think you'll enlighten us but that isn't the case, every interaction with Christians like you makes me even more sure we are correct.

Oh come now, me and Satin go way back he's really not a bad guy when you get to know him. The sort of guy you'd have a Friday night drink with after work.
Perhaps you are just too quick to judge people before you truly get to know them.

RE: think about it God loves me eh? Good. That just makes it easier for me to get close and end him before he can mercilessly kill anybody else that he "loves".
Don't preach to me about a psychotic god that kills without pity or remorse. Loving god my ass. I'm far more loving than him and I'm fucking insane.

Child molesters, murderers, and rapists often convert in prison. Think of how many awesome people you'll be hanging out with.
You must be quite young to be posting here, and a few years later you'll probably be hanging out with us, as an atheist.
Consider this, if god is inside everybody, and a rapist rapes, and a molest molests, then god is right there inside them committed great evil. Then when the person's life end's he sends the person to hell for a crime he co-committed.
By sending a person to hell, to suffer forever god commits an act of evil. Since it will last an eternity then god causes an eternity of evil. Therefore god is eternally evil.

It's funny how that works.
God doesn't reveal himself when these people are out committing there crimes but as soon as these people are in a position to get a reduced sentence because God reveals himself to them God seems very keen to reduce their sentence and reveal himself to them.
This God fellow sounds like a bit of cunt if you ask me.
