They are about half or more of the population.
We should be able to have equality with out blaming one another.

RE: Angry bitch feminist and the AmazingAtheist video Everyone keeps defending these moderate feminists, but no one has yet to present any examples for analysis. I know of a few groups (mostly Canadian) that promote equality between the sexes, and none of them associate themselves with feminism. I once popped into a class on women's rights at Ohio State University (I had 3 hours to kill before my next class) and not only was I the only male there and constantly stared at, the whole class lecture seemed to be more anti-man than pro-woman. It was like I wandered into a clan meeting for women. Feminism has not been relevant since we entered the 21st century. I ask you honestly to find an example of a woman being treated in a sexist manner without social backlash. Bosses who cross the line are routinely fired now. Any injustice done specifically because of a gender is made into a national crisis and dealt with. Feminists are no longer concerned with how women are treated (blanket statement!), rather they seem more concerned with rewiring human nature. They want men to stop staring at breasts and making dick jokes around females. To stop acting so "manly" and seeking to protect women by rescuing them in movies and video games. Good luck with that.

Here are some not anti-men feminists. Their ideas are against heteronormativity, which means they're against the laws that determine a preference of men over women or any kind of sexual preference over other. Their ideas stem from the original feminism (and that's why they study society from that perspective) but they're closer to humanism than to any of those extreme feminist wackos http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Rubin
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Wee...ciologist)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler
If you can find something about Elsa Dorlin (a french sociologist) it would be great, she's very good at explaining modern feminist and gender equality theories.
Examples of sexism today you ask: only 14 countries in the world have legalized same-sex marriage, in almost every country in the world women get paid less for the same task than men, forced prostitution, "innocent" sexual abuse (men touching women in the bus), tv shows objectifying women bodies. Those are all symptoms and causes of sexisms.
Oh and I almost forget: Ridicule of men taking care of domestic work, enforcing the idea that men must be emotionless family sustainging drones, repeating the idea that men should have sex with as many women as possible to prove their masculinity, the barely complete lack of paternity leave laws everywhere are also examples of sexism. Yeah, the 21st century feminism realized that men are victims of sexism too, so they did contribute something.

RE: Angry bitch feminist and the AmazingAtheist video Isn't one of the atheism's most effective jab at the moral "superiority" of religion is its mistreatment of women, even within western countries? Nach_in, thanks for the links by the way.

If we are talking about feminism and you say something like that.(See below) It seems like you are implying that women are a minority.

rights for minorities "

Nobody has an obligation to say anything. In fact, we have the right to not say anything. That's something very important that has been forgotten and there are very serious consequences in the forgetting.
Neither does anyone have to justify themselves to someone else. To ask someone to is an attempt at domination.
Nor are they colleagues. No one can be found guilty by association. So why would we find someone guilty by affiliation? I have never demanded an apology from an American for the LITANY of atrocities and war crimes Americans have committed nor should any American feel obligated to offer one.
If someone wants to decry violence, more power to them. But it's separate from who they are. They do it because that's what they think and they choose to share their thought.
What's nefarious is when people who don't condemn violence in the strongest language possible, because they see complexity in the issue, are denounced as supporting the violence. It's an appalling way to stifle discourse.
Anyhoo, that's my quick "I'm on the metro" response. Hope it answers your question adequately. Gotta run.
Peace and Love and Empathy,
Matt
I decry you for being a moderate-apologist!
Just kidding, thanks for your metro-response.
Would you agree or disagree that there is a difference between individual rights and responsibilities and group rights / responsibilities?
