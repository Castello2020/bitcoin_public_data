See no faith causes you to not believe. So don't get upset because we have faith in Jesus who we see and believe.
Cheapthrillseeker I see you know a little bit about the bible. You mention Peter which was a disciple in the bible. Great so you been reading. Also you mention the "house". Yes Jesus did die for your sin and went to prepare a place for you. He will come back and receive you if you believe in him: John 14:13
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.
Jesus love you even you don't love him. He created you and gave you life.
Amen

RE: Proof of Jesus? Please tell us what your proof is that make the Jesus to never had exist? Does your proof come from a man made book?

I believe there was a man Jesus, a fairly intelligent con man, but there hasn't been any evidence to indicate that he was magical, so my conclusion is he was not in possession of any holy powers.
The con man bit is mealy a uneducated assumption, however I'm pretty confident that he was one. He mislead people, he preached in a way to grab the weaker minds, and so on.
And what proof do you have, outside of a idiotic book, and biased sources, that he is a magical jew?

I never claimed Jesus "Did not exist" I believe there was a man begind the myth.
I can't show you evidence that Jesus doesn't exist, but since I no longer have faith in the Bible, I disbelieve in the mythical Yeshua.
Seriously, that is on par to me asking you " What resourses do you have to prove Harry Potter did not exist." There aren't any, but since we don't believe in the book that makes the claim, you don't need to find sources that disprove "him."

RE: Proof of Jesus? Also, the burden of proof really isn't on us, it's on the people making a claim that a magical Jew sacrificed himself, to himself, for us.

Well, it's not that they need evidence to prove a Jesus existed. They just need to prove that THE Jesus existed. I am sure that you will find that there were many people named Mohammed back in the day. The only trouble is finding out which Mohammed shitted the Qu'ran out. Same concept applies to finding a Jesus.
A wild jesus appears!
Use vinewhip! It's super effective.
Jesus uses shroud of mystery.
Bulbasaur can't seem to find evidence that the Jesus it encountered existed. Fuck!
