So out there that none of you can take him seriously, yet plays to the intellect just enough to keep you playing. Nice work. It is fun to play along when there's nothing else going on, though. Hat's off to ya, nappy. Troll on.
You only wish I was trolling.

Member of the Cult of Reason
The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

what position need I defend? From atop the hill afar? or from the rivers and forests of our ancestors? Clearly you sir think I must defend my beliefs, clearly I sir do not believe I have such a responsibility if I sir am not trying to prove them to you.
Recorded encounters since time unknown, has shown me that a solid wall of ignorance can only make sounds when you bounce an idea to them. There's no logical reason for me to bounce an idea towards you and your ilk. But there is a cause for me to bounce it to you, so it can be bounced back to me and I may contemplate it as though the thought were not my own.
Of course I am doing no bouncing of thoughts with you right now, and yet you intrude that I must prove my thoughts to you? Such discourtesy, what makes you feel so important that I must explain myself for that which I hold to myself and not to you?
I merely stated that freemasons have had a profound effect on our society and yet you like a religious zealot automatically assume a aggressive stance and behavior. As if I put it there for arguments sake you thought to yourselves! Perhaps I just put it there for the sole reason of it being put somewhere if not inside my head!
Now if you'll excuse me I have a meeting, a job, and a duty that I must attend.
And now sir, I shall bounce the codswallop back at you along with a dash of flapdoodle!
`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe. "Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!" He took his vorpal sword in hand:
Long time the manxome foe he sought -- So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood awhile in thought. And, as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came! One, two! One, two! And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back. "And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy! O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
He chortled in his joy. `Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe. Think on that, sir, while you attend to your duties and let this be a lesson to you! Next time you see fit to bounce unto our ilk any thoughts that aren't your own, by way of a wall, listen closely to the sound it makes inside your head. And now sir, if you'll excuse me, another Jabberwocky requires my attention so I must go. Throughout history conversions happen at the point of a sword, deconversions at the point of a pen - FC I am quite sure now that often, very often, in matters concerning religion and politics a man's reasoning powers are not above the monkey's. - Mark Twain in Eruption
