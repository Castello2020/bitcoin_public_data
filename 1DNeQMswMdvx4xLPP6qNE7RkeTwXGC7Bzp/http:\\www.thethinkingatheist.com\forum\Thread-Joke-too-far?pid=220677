I dislike that because it's similar to saying "most people do/like/make/find/etc. X" even though there is usually no way of having even nearly enough data to make such a claim. Sure, there are many people who fit your description, I'll give you that, but can you really say that about humans in general? I suppose my point is that I don't like (unsupported) generalizations.

http://www.thethinkingatheist.com/forum/...#pid215840 Naughty, naughty! Tinkering with the quotes! Tsk, tsk, tsk! And I thought Germans were sticklers for the rules While you are right about generalisations, it is also true that such sensationalistic programmes are really popular, which means a great number of us (as in, people) watch and enjoy them. Obviously not all, but more than enough to ensure their popularity and the propagation of such voyeurism and the enjoyment derived at the expense of others and through their humiliation.

RE: Joke too far?? Hmm...last time I pointed out Humanity's flaws I was looked down upon. Weird place; this forum. Through profound pain comes profound knowledge.

RE: Joke too far?? I saw the clip a few weeks ago. I am not even sure if I find it funny.
On one hand, I do not believe in ghosts so that kid would have probably made me ask "hey, where did you just come from?"
On the other hand, I am a little very scared of elevators, and if the light goes off in the elevator I am in, I have a serious problem. And I think they counted on that for this "joke". Everyone is scared when something is out of the line in an elevator, and while the brain turns off because you get scared, they send something in, you didn't expect. So in general I do dislike all tricks played on elevators. But they had a similar ghost girls clip once, that was just a girl standing in a hallway of a hotel. She didn't move or scream or anything. And people were freaking out on that. That is what I found funny.

Sensationalism is a disease infecting television around the world. It saddens me that the public actually pay for this kind of entertainment.

RE: Joke too far?? I would stop the murder. Funny thing about a garrotte, it doesn't leave your hands free to protect yourself. Other funny thing about it is that it takes a while to get the job done - a little yanking on one of the murderer's arms and the job won't get done. Or better yet, a few kicks to the murderer's head should put him out of commission. I wouldn't hesitate, other than whatever time it takes to get over the surprise and incredulity, then I'd jump in and stop it, then let the cops sort it out.

I wondered that as well. I also wonder how it worked out with the people who rang the police, they could of potentially have been done for wasting police time (the people doing the experiment, not the people who rang the police)
