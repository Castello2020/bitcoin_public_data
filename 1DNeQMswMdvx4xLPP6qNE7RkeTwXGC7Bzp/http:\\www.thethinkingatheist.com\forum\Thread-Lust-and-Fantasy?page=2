Again, natural selection does not have purpose. Natural selection is a mechanism.
Animals do not evolve, gene lines do. Animals live to reproduce or not. Which ones reproduce changes the frequency and combinations of genes in the population. This has effects on the phenotypes produced in subsequent generations.
There is no 'animals evolve to'.
I think we all agree on that point.

Purpose is a poor word choice, yes. Pressure is better.
But, I find it amusing how you are arguing semantics that do not pertain to the point.

Chas would have made a great theologian.

Ah yes, but short time pleasure has a nasty habit of turning into long term pain,at least for a good many people, by virtue of our erratic emotional systems.....

RE: Lust and Fantasy. (03-08-2012 03:49 AM)Logica Humano Wrote: I would argue that the negative effects of restraining your "lust", even if it be masturbation, is not only unhealthy physically, but unhealthy mentally. We need to come to accept that lust is part of our biological instinct and composition, and it won't go away simply because we attempt to will it to. I recognize lust as a healthy feeling, since it is in essence your sexual drive. Let us not forget that the simple goal evolution has is for a species to reproduce.
Can you categorically prove that evolution is the sole creative force, rather than choose to believe that?
O..P. makes no reference to masturbation,my general thrust being concerned with issues that can quite possibly help destroy relationships that have been inadequately worked upon.

Not to mention our reproductive systems.
Skepticism is not a position; it is an approach to claims.
Science is not a subject, but a method.
