RE: What's your Dunbar number ? Somewhere between eleven and Graham's Number.
E 2 = (mc 2)2 + (pc )2
614C → 714N + e– + ̅νe
2 K(s) + 2 H2O(l) → 2 KOH(aq) + H2 (g) + 196 kJ/mol
It works, bitches.

So, in orders of magnitude, how much larger than a googleplex, is Grahman's number ? We actually calculated some numbers here yesterday, which were higher for sure, than a google. I didn't carry them far enough to see if they exceeded a googleplex. We could have fixed it, so it would.

RE: What's your Dunbar number ? It's bigger than a googolplex, by many orders of magnitude.
If you tried to contain all the information of every digit of Graham's number in your brain, your brain would collapse to form a black hole.

RE: What's your Dunbar number ? My number should be ghrams number to the power of a googloplex.

Yeah, fuck that, I don't admit me let alone you. Zero, feels right.

RE: What's your Dunbar number ? My number is 4 extremely close friends (Dunbar number.) Once you add reasonably close acquaintances, I have 9 "friends." I have 150 "friends" on Facebook, and I have no idea who 60% of them really are, nor have probably ever seen them in real life.

RE: What's your Dunbar number ? I'm not clear from the link as to how to calculate it.
I think I need a definition of "friend" and then some friend-categories and whether they count within the Danbar number or not.
