Yup. If you hope to have any sort of meaningful debate with anyone then it is quite useful to employ civility and diplomacy. If you cannot be bothered to exercise either than all we'd have is anarchy. We live in a civilized world, not out in some uncultivated veldt.
Who says it's wrong to beat up a child?
Asking who says it's wrong is to imply a moral law giver.
Rather the question is too simple. It what context are we talking about. What is the child doing?
Acting in such a way as to endanger another's life, or simply throwing a tantrum. When determining the morally correct thing to do you need more context. After you establish a context we can determine the best out come.

The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.
