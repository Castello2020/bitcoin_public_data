Understanding Why Bad Things Happen to Good People This article, in response to the Batman shootings, has people asking "How can God let this happen? How can God let such horrible things be done to His children? "
http://www.ldsmag.com/article/1/11162
These people just don't get it. God doesn't LET it happen. God MAKES it happen. God PLANS it to happen. And he's getting pissed that more people, unlike me, aren't giving thanks when he executes his plan. He has neither the time nor the inclination to explain himself to those who rise and sleep under the blanket of goodness that he provides, and then question the manner in which he provides it. He would rather you just said thank you, and went on your way. Let's get it together people - thank God!

RE: Understanding Why Bad Things Happen to Good People Bad things happening to good people depends in the interpretation of the individual.
In general Christian's think it's God's plan, the devil testing your will, god testing your will, and every bodies favorite, he's working in mysterious ways. Many other people call it karma, or bad luck.
Personally I don't see things like that. Why? because it is so vague it describes nothing. It requires a bit of investigation to figure out what is actually happening and why. Once you do that, you really discover the cause and effects.

RE: Understanding Why Bad Things Happen to Good People People don't want to know cause and effect. They want to pity the ones stricken by harm and file it all away asap, before they have too many serious thoughts about it.
They thank the lord that it wasn't them and are done with it.
Science is the process we've designed to be responsible for generating our best guess as to what the fuck is going on. Girly Man

Shit happens. Shit happens to all people.
Skepticism is not a position; it is an approach to claims.
Science is not a subject, but a method.

Stop it! I can't handle the truth!!!
My girlfriend is mad at me. Perhaps I shouldn't have tried cooking a stick in her non-stick pan.

RE: Understanding Why Bad Things Happen to Good People The world really looks like there is no ultimate justice in this, or any "Life". Complete and utter shit why innocents need to die if there is a God.
A truly just God would never let anything happen to innocents.

RE: Understanding Why Bad Things Happen to Good People I've posted this video before but to believe that God (I will use the Christian version since that is what I believe most American's will be referring too.) cares about the lives of any is a fallacy. It is blatantly clear the God enjoys murdering plenty of humans whether it be for his own amusement or lack of actual care. This reveals that God shouldn't be anything of worship but a dictator who expects his slaves to do horrid things for him as he simply watches. For God to have done dozens of miracles in the past and a currently ridiculous lack of miracles in the present. Its a sick way of thinking that some God who knows everything would just watch idly as any person was brutally raped or murdered and one day torture someone for eternity knowing he could have saved both. It shows laziness.

It has been a long time. How have you been?

God doesn't sit idly by and watch someone get raped/murdered - God planned for it to happen, and chose both the rapist and the rapee. God works in mysterious ways. Praise God!
