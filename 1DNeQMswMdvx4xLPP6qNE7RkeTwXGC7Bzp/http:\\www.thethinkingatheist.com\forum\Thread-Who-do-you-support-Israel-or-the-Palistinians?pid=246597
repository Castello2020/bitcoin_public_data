Who do you support, Israel or the Palistinians? I can get the israelies protecting themselves and everything, but ya gotta see West Banks side of the argument too. The western countries created a country for foreign people on the lamd the palistinians had been living on for generations and they were just kicked out.

RE: Who do you support, Israel or the Palistinians? Israel, because I'd rather a Jewish state then another Islamic state.
Also your history on the matter is shit.
I don't talk gay, I don't walk gay, it's like people don't even know I'm gay unless I'm blowing them.

RE: Who do you support, Israel or the Palistinians? The whole thing is one big, asymmetric clusterfuck where people are senselessly being killed on both sides. Do I really have to support either one? I support whatever option will lead to peace for both sides, but finding that option is the hard part.

RE: Who do you support, Israel or the Palistinians? The palistinians are fighting for a free palestine, which would include west bank and gaza. If they were given that, i think they would let up their attacks. Or at least lessen them anyway.

RE: Who do you support, Israel or the Palistinians? I just don't care about the situation anymore. I've given humanity enough chances. If I had a button to wipe us out I would probably press it.
But until then, I'll just sit locked away from humans with my whisky, weed, blues and anime. The following 1 user Likes frankiej's post:1 user Likes frankiej's post

Gonna have to agree with Richard on this one. Which is kinda scary all in itself. But I struggle with this whole conflict. Religion....man. *shakes head* This is the best example of some of the worst religion can do.
