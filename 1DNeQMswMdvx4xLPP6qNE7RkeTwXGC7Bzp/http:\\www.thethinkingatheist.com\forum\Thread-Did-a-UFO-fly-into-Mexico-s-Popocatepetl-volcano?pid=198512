RE: Did a UFO fly into Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano? Lots of woo woo over there. I was in Sedona once, and my brother took us to see the famous "vortex". This lady next to us said
"Ooooh, can't you just feel it". We said "nah, not really". We got the evil eye. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFyi8U9pIyQ

RE: Did a UFO fly into Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano? Logically speaking wouldn't this be the worlds most inept UFO? Choosing a volcano to fly into?

RE: Did a UFO fly into Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano? Well, several days before, a Strange cigar-shaped UFOs appear over southern U.S. (Kentucky):
Some US experiment? a new weapon being tested? who knows.

Identified.

RE: Did a UFO fly into Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano? Boo Chas! The article you linked to didn't even positively identify it. They listed a few possibilities, with a focus on one that didn't seem to match. You didn't read it did you? Lazy old son of a gun! It is still a UFO! I am lamenting not having a good way to express an insane laugh via simulated written characters right now.

Fuck you, of course I read it. It provides a rational explanation of the sighting. The volcano story is still bullshit.

RE: Did a UFO fly into Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano? Folks, the answer is staring you dead in the face and you're all too stupid to realize it.
The Legion Of Doom has its headquarters inside the volcano. Recently, they completed a death-ray device and decided to test it by shooting it at a passing airplane. However, the Legion Of Doom is affiliated with the Illuminati, which controls the media, so when this footage was captured, it was doctored so that it plays in reverse - making it look like just another crazy UFO sighting instead of what it ACTUALLY is.
There's treachery afoot, and you all bought in to the coverup. Well done.
Through profound pain comes profound knowledge.

It certainly doesn't positively identify though, which is what you claimed when you named the link "Identified". That has two implications: A) It is still a UFO, UNidentified flying object (though it is most likely of terrestrial origin) and B) You are a son of a gun! Volcano? I didn't even mention it that post. Take your pills, Chas. Also, did you read my last sentence? Pages (5):
