RE: Pet peeves and gear grinders? People who say "....years young." I can't fucking stand that.
You grow up, which mean you grow older.
It is my personal opinion that growing old is a good process... I can't wait to troll my grandkids..... If I have grandkids.... Credit goes to UndercoverAtheist.

Yeah. Only... with fire. Silly. Ah, crap! I even looked it up because it looked wrong. You can't trust the internet these days, kids! Pet peeve: People who trust the internet.
Although, the idea of a torcher chamber while eating off of forks and chewing tin foil gum is something to think about... hmmm....

RE: Pet peeves and gear grinders? I'm sure we can all agree on this.
Apologists
Presuppositional apologists
Misrepresentation of science
Lies about Science
Member of the Cult of Reason
The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

RE: Pet peeves and gear grinders? --Constant, repetitive noise, especially when it's loud and/or high pitched.
--People who use text speak in real life, writing, or for anything other than an actual text message.
--Using the bible to prove the bible. I'm sure there's a technical term for it, but it goes something like this: "The bible is the word of god, so it must be true!" "but how do you know it's the word of god?" "because the bible told me so!" Yeah, that. I hate that.

Are you talking about your sex life? Skepticism is not a position; it is an approach to claims.
Science is not a subject, but a method.

RE: Pet peeves and gear grinders? People who leave their carts in the middle of the aisle, then glance at you and continue staring at the tomato soup, after you've politely said, "excuse me."
The worst ones are the ones that think it is somehow inappropriate for the person waiting to get by to suddenly grab the offending cart, and dump it, half full, on it's side. Then they get all in a snit, the cops show up, the words "violent temper" get tossed around, then bang!
Back to anger management.
Ok. Fine. My peeve is people. All of them. That includes you.

This is why I take my bigass bodybuilding brother on Costco trips with me. I say "excuse me", when they don't respond he Hulk roars "MOVE!". They glance at us and then fucking move.
Breathing - it's more art than science.
