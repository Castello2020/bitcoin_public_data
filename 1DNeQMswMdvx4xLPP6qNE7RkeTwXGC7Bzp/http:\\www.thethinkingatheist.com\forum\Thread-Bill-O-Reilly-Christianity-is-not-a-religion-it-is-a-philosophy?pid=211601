Bill O'Reilly: Christianity is not a religion, it is a philosophy "It is a fact. Christianity is not a religion, it is a philosophy." If the government said that it wanted to establish Methodism, it would violate the Establishment Clause. However, governmental support for Christianity is only furthering a philosophy. Seriously!!???
Another great quote: "[Atheists are] a merry band of fascists."

RE: Bill O'Reilly: Christianity is not a religion, it is a philosophy That clip was all kinds of fun. Too bad it wasn't longer, I just got my popcorn popped and it ended.

RE: Bill O'Reilly: Christianity is not a religion, it is a philosophy When opening presents, does he say grace first?
Leviticus does not justify stupidity, but it is more than enough to define corruption of the human mind.

RE: Bill O'Reilly: Christianity is not a religion, it is a philosophy I'm certain Bill just pissed off christians everywhere in the states.

The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

RE: Bill O'Reilly: Christianity is not a religion, it is a philosophy Excuse me? "If you want to be an atheist, that's why we have America." Since I'm not in America, does this mean I cannot be an atheist? Man, why not just kill me right now "E se non passa la tristezza con altri occhi la guarderò."

It's not always easy, is it?
The truth is absolute. Life forms are specks of specks (...) of specks of dust in the universe.
Why settle for normal, when you can be so much more? Why settle for something, when you can have everything?
