Salvation from what?
Skepticism is not a position; it is an approach to claims.

RE: Salvation comes from Jesus and no one else. I'm starting to think Erxy has turned back to the darkside. Say it isn't so buddy. Have some baby flesh before you go. Just one bite. Oh and salvation, comes from my balls.

RE: Salvation comes from Jesus and no one else. Salvation is only needed for those who have done things that cause them extreme guilt. Who also do not want to take responsibility for their actions.
Member of the Cult of Reason
The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.
