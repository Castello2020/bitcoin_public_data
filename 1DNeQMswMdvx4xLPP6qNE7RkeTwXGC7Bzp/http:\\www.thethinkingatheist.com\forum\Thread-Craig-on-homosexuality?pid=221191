So I didn't miss anything.
At least Rowan Atkinson is brilliant and not full of hate.
Hate is not only a trait held by gay detractors, it is pretty universal.

The point is that we need to look to our allegiances out of the tribal square.

RE: Craig on homosexuality That is my point, albeit perhaps put obliquely.
Must rush to a concert.

RE: Craig on homosexuality And it wasn't put obliquely. It had absolutely nothing to do with my post.

Yes, hate is also held by disgusting old Australian men with ill-informed bigoted opinions.

I don't talk gay, I don't walk gay, it's like people don't even know I'm gay unless I'm blowing them.

I couldn't agree more.

The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

Well, let's see. I'm 68. My partner and spouse is 74. Our friends B. and J., also long-term partners, are 68 and 72 respectively. Our friend E. is 72. D. is 75. G. is 90; his partner B. died last year at 94. Homosexual American males all.
Man, have we beaten the odds! My Christian father quoted this bullshit, and I asked him for a source -- he said it was from his favorite radio show with Chuck Missler (which is a finely flowing fountain of unsourced bullshit). But then I asked him how one would even go about finding this statistic. We know that married men live (on average) 6 years longer than unmarried men, but anyone could research that from obituaries because a statistic like marital status is regularly found in obituaries. Those don't list sexual preference. Nor can anyone be sure of a dead friend/relative's sexual preference for certain, even if the method of researching the lifespan of a homosexual was conducted through funeral polling. It's impossible to know the average lifespan of a gay person because there's nowhere to gather such data.
But... you know, if someone does attempt to collate that data through forum trolling... thanks, cufflink, for tilting the odds in favor of long-lifed gays.
My girlfriend is mad at me. Perhaps I shouldn't have tried cooking a stick in her non-stick pan.
