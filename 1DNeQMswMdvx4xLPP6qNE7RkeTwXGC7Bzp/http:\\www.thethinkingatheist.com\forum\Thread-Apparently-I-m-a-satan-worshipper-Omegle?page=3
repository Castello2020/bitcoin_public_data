RE: Apparently I'm a satan worshipper (Omegle) It's annoys me when people think they know what is in your mind, that they know what you believe in. I wish there was a different word for atheist.

RE: Apparently I'm a satan worshipper (Omegle) Since it appears she is catholic, it might have been nice to read to her her own church's teachings on evolution: http://www.catholic.com/tracts/adam-eve-and-evolution
Give me your argument in the form of a published paper, and then we can start to talk.

RE: Apparently I'm a satan worshipper (Omegle) That was amazing thank you!

The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

RE: Apparently I'm a satan worshipper (Omegle) Well, she was desperately trying to talk to a like minded person about the demon. And kept running into you, lol. She'll go talk to her priest about it. I'd like to be a fly on the wall for that conversation.
Science is the process we've designed to be responsible for generating our best guess as to what the fuck is going on. Girly Man
