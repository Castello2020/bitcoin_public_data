Third declension, neuter.
Recte, sed declinatio illa secunda est, non tertia.

Yes, thanks. The confusing thing is that there are 3rd declension nouns ending -um.
And are neuter nouns of first declension adjectives declined 2nd or 3rd?
e.g. maximus/maximum.
It's been a lot of years since I took Latin.
And, no, it was not widely spoken at the time. Skepticism is not a position; it is an approach to claims.
Science is not a subject, but a method.

E 2 = (mc 2)2 + (pc )2
614C → 714N + e– + ̅νe
2 K(s) + 2 H2O(l) → 2 KOH(aq) + H2 (g) + 196 kJ/mol
It works, bitches.

Hmm. I'm not familiar with any 3rd declension nouns that end in -um. Doesn't seem to be the case according to my dusty Latin grammar text. I have a buddy who's the former chair of the Classics dept. of a major university, whom I turn to whenever I have a question about Latin or Ancient Greek, so I can check with him.
I wonder, though, if you're thinking of the 3rd declension nouns in -us, like corpus, corporis . . . ? I believe those are all neuter. So it's Hoc est enim corpus meum, not *corpus meus.
In -us/-a/-um adjectives, the neuter one is declined 2nd.

Same here.

RE: Creation Science Hall of Fame Member of the Cult of Reason
The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

This “doctor” was babbling on about how after the flood there was less O2 and all the dinosaurs died when their noses combusted…
I can’t search you tube at work but if some one wants to have a hunt? I’ll have a look when I’m home if I remember after my shift.
I remember that one, and found it for you! This is the same guy that does the 'Golden Crocoduck Awards' for creationist stupidity, of which Eric Hovind (Kent Hovind's son) is the most recent recipient. In this video, a Dr. Richard Kent claims that small nostrils combined with a change in oxygen levels led to dinosaur's nostrils catching on fire and becoming the basis for dragon myths.. I wish I was making this up...
