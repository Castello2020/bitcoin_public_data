Imperialist corporate media coverage of todays shooting. The idea or any implication of the idea that americans are exceptional human beings is a fucking joke, the U.S. supports and has supported mass murdering dictators who oppress, torture and brutally kill their own people and the U.S. has been involved in many active campaigns to actively bomb the fuck out of a country, like bombing villages in Vietnam for example. Now the corporate press (sheep call it free press) is displaying the full violin orchestra complete with the a chorus of crying crocodiles, full with crocodile tears for human beings. U.S. media truly is a fucking joke. While the U.S. media is actively campaigning to get the citizens to support a military intervention in Syria with more WMD bullshit, they also pretend to be against killing of kids? Oh yeah that's right, kids in Syria or Libya or Iraq or Afganistan don't count.....yeah fuck this joke of a media.

“In reading The History of Nations, we find that, like individuals, they have their whims and their peculiarities, their seasons of excitement and recklessness, when they care not what they do.
We find that whole communities suddenly fix their minds upon one object
and go mad in its pursuit; that millions of people become simultaneously impressed with one delusion, and run after it, till their
attention is caught by some new folly more captivating than the first.”

RE: Imperialist corporate media coverage of todays shooting. Is this really the slant you want to take on the day that 27+ people have died, mostly children?

Kind of twisted, even for you. Today I would like to take the slant that americans are not exceptional human beings and the total disregard for non american children as is the case with american media in reporting on foreign policy is a fucking joke.

You think everybody in the UK is responsible enough to own a gun?
You're never going to say the things you want to say. The things you want to change will usually stay that way

You will find that nations who have banned private gun ownership have a far smaller amount of violent crime.

Don't go full potato on me you two.
It's really simple.
We all find this behaviour disgusting. Yet realistically as much as we may want to do something, the reality is that we can do very little. Maybe offer money to the affected family's', and tell them you care.
Until we have more information from the investigators I personally can't offer an opinion.
