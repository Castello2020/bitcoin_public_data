What is the ultimate Philosophy question? By ultimate, what I mean is the most perplexing, the most important, or the the most difficult to answer. A question that we will not likely ever know the answer to.
For me, it is "Why is there something, instead of nothing?"
What is yours?

RE: What is the ultimate Philosophy question? This article sparked my curiosity in parallel universes, or planets, inside black holes
http://news.discovery.com/space/black-ho...10413.html
all just theory though, sadly.
Think about it though, how crazy would that be?
What would their quality of life be like? How would it feel being stuck in time forever and staring at the same glimpse of time in space you have been for the rest of what you know as eternity?
(Guess that's not really a philosophical question)
"I don't believe in an afterlife, so I don't have to spend my whole life fearing hell, or fearing heaven even more. For whatever the tortures of hell, I think the boredom of heaven would be even worse."

RE: What is the ultimate Philosophy question? en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction
The problem of induction is the most annoying thing religious people use to bastardize science.
They use it to show circularity.
Member of the Cult of Reason
The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

(Since we know "nothing" is a cognitive construct, which does not exist in this universe), mine is : Why do humans persist in thinking in those terms ? ie : the question is not "why is there "something", the question is "why is there a perceptual structure of something vs nothing in our brains", and does that perception reflect Reality ?

What is yours?
Around 4 billion years from now, the Sun will expand to fry the Earth... possibly sometime before that, the Andromeda galaxy will collide with our Milky Way. I'd love to be around for that collision, so my allotted 80 to 100 years is a bummer of a joy ride. But in regard to the species Human itself: Why bother? Why continue when it's all just going to end anyway? Any answer is going to be subjective. I suppose questions about life would bother you if you were to confuse subjective things with objective things the way I've noticed many Theists do.
Meh, fuck it. I think in the end, I just feel like I'm a secular person who has a skeptical eye toward any extraordinary claim, carefully examining any extraordinary evidence before jumping to conclusions. ~ Eric ~ My friend ... who figured it out.
