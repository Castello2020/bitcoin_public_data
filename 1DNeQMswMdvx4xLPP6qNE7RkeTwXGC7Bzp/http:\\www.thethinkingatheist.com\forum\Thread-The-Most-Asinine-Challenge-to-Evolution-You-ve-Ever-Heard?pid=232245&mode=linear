The Most Asinine Challenge to Evolution You've Ever Heard I just had someone say, "If evolution makes things better, why don't humans live as long as trees and tortoises?" "To hate man and worship God seems to be the sum of all creeds." — Robert Ingersoll

RE: The Most Asinine Challenge to Evolution You've Ever Heard I should have put the word "challenge" in quotes.

RE: The Most Asinine Challenge to Evolution You've Ever Heard Actually, that might be a decent question. Why don't we?
Lifespans have been getting longer with recent advances in diet and healthcare. That's not evolution, it's science. Our evolution seems to put us at a lifespan of around 40-50 years, more or less. Yet we share DNA with tortoises and even with trees. Why didn't we inherit some of their longevity as the species diverged.
I can work out a couple quick answers in my mind, which might not be entirely correct, but I find this to be an interesting question and, to me, much better than some other theist stupidity like the whole "Why don't we ever see a crocaduck?" question. At least this question is based on actual science rather than ignoring actual science.
"Whores perform the same function as priests, but far more thoroughly." - Robert A. Heinlein

RE: The Most Asinine Challenge to Evolution You've Ever Heard We live long enough to reproduce and rear the young.
What more do you expect?
Evolution does not have goals or direction.
Skepticism is not a position; it is an approach to claims.
Science is not a subject, but a method.

FIXT. I think in the end, I just feel like I'm a secular person who has a skeptical eye toward any extraordinary claim, carefully examining any extraordinary evidence before jumping to conclusions. ~ Eric ~ My friend ... who figured it out.

RE: The Most Asinine Challenge to Evolution You've Ever Heard Evolution works great. Dump the notion that it's all about "me" (individuals), and it works well.

RE: The Most Asinine Challenge to Evolution You've Ever Heard Wow, and I thought these kinds of people couldn't reach a new level of stupid.
Bury me with my guns on, so when I reach the other side - I can show him what it feels like to die.
