U.S. marines used as guinea pigs on Okinawa. http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/12/19/w...n-okinawa/
As I am reading this I can't help but laugh at the 9-11 peeps who like to say "the U.S. would never harm it's own citizens"
Apparently the U.S. used marines to test chemical weapons during the 60's on the island of Okinawa.
This was of course when the U.S. was fighting "the bad side" in communism. 19-12-2012, 08:59 PM #2

RE: U.S. marines used as guinea pigs on Okinawa. yeah they even make people wear pants. When you are courting a nice girl an hour seems like a second. When you sit on a red-hot cinder a second seems like an hour. That's relativity. You cannot successfully determine beforehand which side of the bread to butter.
