RE: Weirdest movies you have seen Is this about weird or worst movies? I have a feeling most of you have put the trash, bad movies, not the weird movies.
I have a theory that the truth is never told during the nine-to-five hours.

RE: Weirdest movies you have seen It is about the weird movies and at least the ones I posted are indeed weird.

RE: Weirdest movies you have seen Eraserhead is extremely weird. I don't know if anyone actually likes it. Filox, "weird" is a pretty subjective term and might mean something different from the speaker to the hearer. To me a "weird" movie is one that you wonder why you are watching it. It's so bad, but you can't stop watching it, making you wonder what is holding your interest? To me, the movies you mentioned are great movies and no question why you're watching Fight Club because it's well made and acted, but what makes it memorable is the weird twist you wouldn't expect. Probably none of the above makes sense. I'm good with that.

RE: Weirdest movies you have seen The all time wierdest movie I have ever seen is also probably the dumbest movies I have ever seen as well. It had Leslie Neilson in it, so I rented it thinking it would be funny. The movie is called "Naked Space". It was also known by "The Creature Wasn't Nice". Here is an imbd link to it. I recommend not seeing this one. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082213/

This actually looks like something I'd enjoy. "All that is necessary for the triumph of Calvinism is that good Atheists do nothing." ~Eric Oh My

The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

This actually looks like something I'd enjoy. If it turns out that you actually like this movie, let me know. I have an odd sense of humor, but come on! It could have been funny and it just plain sucked from the beginning.
