Taxes an interesting question If you could choose what way your tax dollars were being spent, what would you have the government spend it on?

The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

Fund NASA and Scientific Research on alternative energy sources such as advances in Solar, Geo-thermal and wind energy which would reduce our dependance on foreign oil.

RE: Taxes an interesting question Science, infrastructure, education, and wellfare of citizens--oh and solar, alternative fuels, etc but I put that in science as well as NASA and sea exploration. Not in that order perhaps but that being the main categories.

RE: Taxes an interesting question Education and health.
If you have good health and the provisions to cater for when you don't... and you are well-educated... everything else that is desired becomes achievable.

What elemts said. (including the comment on touch screens. They are good for some things but not typing)
Science is the process we've designed to be responsible for generating our best guess as to what the fuck is going on. Girly Man

RE: Taxes an interesting question Everything necessary and some good stuff, too.
Taxes are the price for living in a civilized society. What we spend the money on helps define and is defined by our social contract.
We come to some agreement about what kind of society we want and then we purchase it.
At least, that's how it's supposed to be.
Necessary:
Defense
Public Safety
Infrastructure
Health
Food safety
Drug safety
Workplace safety
and other stuff like that
Good stuff:
Arts
Science
Fireworks
Skepticism is not a position; it is an approach to claims.
Science is not a subject, but a method.

Wisely.
