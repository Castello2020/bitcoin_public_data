Nice logical fallacy
Tu quoque: L. "You also"
Def- defending yourself by attacking the opponent
Ex- "Who are you to condemn anyone? Do you claim to be perfect?"
Member of the Cult of Reason
The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.
