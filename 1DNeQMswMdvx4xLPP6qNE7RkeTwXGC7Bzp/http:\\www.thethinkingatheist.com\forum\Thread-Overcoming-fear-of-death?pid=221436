RE: Overcoming fear of death Hi omegamoo
First of all, I see that this is your first post here, therfore
WELCOME to the forum!!
Now, yes I understand your feeling very much. I had it myself, when I was little. I did not buy into religion, and after noone could give me a satisfying answer about death, I ended up believing in reincarnation. (Reincarnation is BS)
Death is final and it is not really easy to imagine to not be conscious, but you are wasting so much of your time and energy on concentrating on the fact that you are scared of that. It just takes away from your quality of living. Knowing that you have only this one life should make it much more valuable to you, you should try and enjoy it as much as you can. You have only one chance, don't waste that chance by being scared of something that you can't avoid anyway.
You will keep thinking about it from time to time. And everytime you do,
you will obsess less about it because you will come to realize that death, no matter how scared, is unavoidable. And with years to come, you will become pretty relaxed about this topic, I promise that to you. Just right now, use the emergency stop, if you keep obsessing about this, you will end up with a serious mental problem, and you don't want that for sure.
And I am not telling you to not talk about it, of course do that. But while talking about it, also find, as kim mentioned, things that you enjoy and work on those, fill your mind with stuff that pleasures you. Pottery, writing, collecting stamps, watching soccer, origami, and physical love ... or whatever else you might prefer cheers

RE: Overcoming fear of death This.
“I would request that my body in death be buried not cremated, so that the energy content contained within it gets returned to the earth, so that flora and fauna can dine upon it, just as
I have dined upon flora and fauna during my lifetime”
Neil deGrasse Tyson
When you realize you were once many other things, that you simply have to return to that state.

RE: Overcoming fear of death Unfortunately, you don't want a psychiatrist, but your fear takes place in....the mind. Fear of death is very normal and very common, so you're not alone. However, to the point of almost paralysis is doing you no good. I see my thoughts and behaviors this way, if it helps me function and be effective within my life and add meaning to mine or another's; then it's a good thing. If not, it's wasting my time. Your fear means that you don't understand the object of your fear. It's not a THING, it's the label that describes the result of every living thing's term of existence. If you accept that your body is comprised of a collection of cells and they die all the time; then it's merely the final logical step. And to help my daughters, I explained it this way; our body at it's tiniest is merely a collection of atoms. The same as even the stars. And even when any other living thing dies, it's not that they disappear from existence, that would violate Lavoisier's principle. Instead, our universe is merely changing your constituents from the present form (you) to another. To cap this, I'll quote Neil Degrasse Tyson "We are all connected, to each other; the biological; to the earth, the chemical; to the universe, the atomic." When you look at our own star the sun, realize that you and I wouldn't be here with out it anyway....

I don't like this one statement. Rest of your post, fine, but this statement bothers me a lot. Every fear takes place in the mind. Do you think that everyone with a fear should go see a doctor? Psychiatrist and Therapists are probably helpful when your fear is unreasonable, but his is not.

RE: Overcoming fear of death You are young, so as long as you try to stay safe you will probably live a long life. When death does finally get close enough to be a concern, you most likely won't care. I watched my grandfather die very slowly over a period of years. Believe me, he was ready for it long before it happened. It was his children and his wife that were not ready for it to happen.
