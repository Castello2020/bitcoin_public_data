Not by a long shot. Not nearly shitty enough. I must try harder.

That's cute, but it looks like a blood bath waiting to happen. Your average cat is not going to sit their peacefully and allow you to glue these things to their claws. I would have to sedate my cat if I ever tried anything like that.

Even funnier thing is, the first time I saw it, I thought it was nail polish. It was on the Daily Kitten site and people there are crazy enough to actually do it. But yeah, can't see it being too easy to put them on.

RE: What Did You Learn Today? I learned that different fish have very different levels of intelligence.
At the low end, they just eat and sleep. A bit higher up, they interact with each other and explore for exploration's sake.
The smarter ones learn how to utilize every type of territory in their tank, watch what is going on outside the tank, become responsive to their care taker and can be tamed to touch and learn tricks.
Surprised me, I always thought a fish is a fish is a fish.... not so. Some are quite cognizant.
Science is the process we've designed to be responsible for generating our best guess as to what the fuck is going on. Girly Man

My mom is a pond-buff. She's got one big pond that she's filled with Koi fish; they swarm to where you are every time you walk near the edge of the water because they know you'll be bringing food.
I knew they remembered things like that, but I never actually gave any thought to what such memory said about their intelligence.

RE: What Did You Learn Today? Today I learned that as atoms get bigger, they get smaller....
I'm still trying to wrap my head around how that works exactly.

RE: What Did You Learn Today? I learned that rationality is something that needs to be learned and practiced daily.

The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

RE: What Did You Learn Today? I just learned I have a new neighbor somewhere close ... who's wifi is waaaay better than mine. I think in the end, I just feel like I'm a secular person who has a skeptical eye toward any extraordinary claim, carefully examining any extraordinary evidence before jumping to conclusions. ~ Eric ~ My friend ... who figured it out.
