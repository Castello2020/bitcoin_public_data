Major threat to religion I think atheism is not a major threat to religions. People want/like/need to believe in spirits, UFO's,
supernatural things, mysticism, auras, morphic fields, the after life, etc. etc.
No, atheism is not the threat. The threat is The New Age Movement. You can see it everywhere: from
music to "yoga relaxation techniques". It's slowly invading our world and those beliefs contradict what
formal religions say or preach. Instead, is more like a mix: some things from christianism, many from buddhism, other from pseudo-scientific "discoveries", etc.
Instead of stop believing in god(s), people who have lost their faith prefer to believe in something rather than nothing. Most people cannot accept the idea of being death forever and while people "deconvert" they just change their beliefs system. They don't become "thinking atheists".
That's why I can see how the number of new age followers will increase in the next years. It's just a change
from a non-sense doctrine to non-sense ideology.

RE: Major threat to religion Hottest thing in real estate is houses with a "Zen room". Out with the family room, in with the Zen room. Apparently sells like hot cakes.

Also, unfortunately I agree with this. I would like for people to become free thinkers and become allies of logic and reason, but that might take a long, long time...

Yes... that and these stuff you can find everywhere: The worst thing is people do believe in pseudoscience and justify wearing those artifacts.
They even talk about quantum physics, atoms, magnetism and cosmological frequencies (whatever that is) without understanding a word of what they're saying.

Or in this case, any sufficiently advanced scientific sounding stuff is sufficient for fueling your belief in woo-woo. I don't understand it, therefore magic! The following 1 user Likes EvolutionKills's post:1 user Likes EvolutionKills's post

Re: Major threat to religion Just look at the Pacific Northwest... The least religious region in the U.S. But it's a hotbed of new age beliefs.

RE: Major threat to religion It's questions, and scientific knowledge that threatens religion.
If the ignorance of nature gave birth to such a variety of gods, the knowledge of this nature is calculated to destroy them. - Dholbach
Member of the Cult of Reason
The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

So, we're swapping crazy for crazy?
Shit.

That's the point we don't need to blindly follow anything.
I think higher order thinking skills/critical thinking skills are important. People need to understand their cultures, emotions, biases(or brain shortcuts), fallacies, all work together to drive you further from the truth.
When engaging a truth claim, you have to learn how to spot fallacies, biases, appeals to cultural norms, and appeals to emotions. To be able to see clearly what is truth and what is a falsehood predicated on intuition, or psychological tricks, made to help you accept nonsense.
Also it's very important to investigate, get down to the bottom of a news/science/documentary story, check sources, and read counter sources, to evaluate it.
With out learning those things, it's easy to be the victim of our own brains, and accept falsehoods with out knowing it.
