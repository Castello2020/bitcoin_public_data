RE: I miss theists. Only an actual Resurrection can get THAT sort of religious devotion.

Member of the Cult of Reason
The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

RE: I miss theists. Wait!.
Before we start, would it be fair to say that ordinary (non-divine) beings cant rise from the dead...that you would need to be in the category of a God in order to achieve a feat like that?

nope, you do not need to be God to be risen from the dead. I believe Lazarus was risen from the dead( according to the Bible), but he wasn't God... or was he?
Also, are all of those people who resurrected at Jesus's death in the Gospel of Matthew God?
Disclaimer: I do not believe Lazarus or anybody rose from the dead with divine inspiration

You are the one who offered a Christian Mega Church as your citation - we are talking about Christianity right?

Yes, I should have clarified...ordinary beings cant raise from the dead without divine involvement.
Glad we both believe Lazarus was raised from the dead.

Depends, people come back from the "dead" with medical and doctoral help. Are you saying that Doctors are God? Credit goes to UndercoverAtheist.
