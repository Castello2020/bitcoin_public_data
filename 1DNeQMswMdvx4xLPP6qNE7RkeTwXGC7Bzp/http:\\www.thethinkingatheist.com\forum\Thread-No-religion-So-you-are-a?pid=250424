Well, not quite. If they are deists their god could be named any of the above or any name at all...like Fred. Maybe they pray to Fred?
Throughout history conversions happen at the point of a sword, deconversions at the point of a pen - FC I am quite sure now that often, very often, in matters concerning religion and politics a man's reasoning powers are not above the monkey's. - Mark Twain in Eruption

That could be the case. Only Fred I've ever known that was (essentially) prayed to was some dipshit on YouTube.
But hell, we're still one god ahead of them.
A single action is worth more than the words it takes to describe it.

RE: No religion? So you are a _______? Hm, funny... I was saying to someone just yesterday that a non-existant god is more real than a fictitious god. I think in the end, I just feel like I'm a secular person who has a skeptical eye toward any extraordinary claim, carefully examining any extraordinary evidence before jumping to conclusions. ~ Eric ~ My friend ... who figured it out.

I sort of see 'non existence' as relevant to our accrued degree of learning and understanding. Beyond that, who knows? W aka Old Froggy

Which means I claim to know that god doesn't exist, in the sense that it is the perfect, maximally supreme being. Even a deist god who seeks to create something is by definition imperfect and therefor not god under that definition.
I am a gnostic atheist when it comes to all man made religions. I am agnostic when it comes to the existence of any higher power, including a perfect one, although I do feel that the chances one exists is extremely small.
The idea of a perfect higher power would essentially not need to do anything other than exist, to be consistent with the idea of perfection.

The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

Do you mean the best possible ethical ideas as thought by the human mind?

Google and Wikipedia are your friends. Freemasonry.
Skepticism is not a position; it is an approach to claims.
Science is not a subject, but a method.
