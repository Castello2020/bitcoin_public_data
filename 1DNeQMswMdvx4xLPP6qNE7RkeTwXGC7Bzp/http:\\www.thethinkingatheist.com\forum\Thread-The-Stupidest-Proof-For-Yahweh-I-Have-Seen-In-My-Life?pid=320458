RE: The Stupidest Proof For Yahweh I Have Seen In My Life Just now saw this post. . . . . watched the video, and burst out laughing at the "YAH face". Awesome!! Definitely has to be a Poe.

RE: The Stupidest Proof For Yahweh I Have Seen In My Life Quote:What makes you think we haven't considered the various arguments (from myriad sources) to support the existence of god or the validity of a given religion? You forget that this is an audience consisting of many former believers who devoted years of study and contemplation to their faith. The fact that there are those who disagree with your position doesn't mean that your position has not been given careful consideration.
Many of us have read scriptures, studied them intently, taken instruction, listened to preachers, prayed, etc. and have come to the carefully considered conclusion that there just isn't any "there" there.
1) I'm not being a "victim". I'm not "hurt" or "upset" by your nonsense as a group on this forum. I am pointing out that y'all are doing EXACTLY what and how the Bible says you would do and then your defense is to say I'm being a victim or martyr. One has neither to do with the other--although the Bible also foretells martyrdom for some Christians. 2) I think you have heard a ton of analogies, Bible verses, philosophical arguments, etc. Good news! I'm here on this forum to help. I've had many novel ideas I'm delighted to share with you! Consider me Jesus's gift to you good people on the forum.

I apologize. I didn't mean to misrepresent your intentions.
Perhaps we can get back on topic?

The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.
