Where do you come up with these ideas exactly?
Bury me with my guns on, so when I reach the other side - I can show him what it feels like to die.

No. White people do not have secret Hitler shrines. Nor did they profit from him.
After all Europe was bombed into the stone age, and then rebuilt.

Is that information available under the Freedom of Information Act,
or is protected by the Official Secrets Act?
Skepticism is not a position; it is an approach to claims.
Science is not a subject, but a method.

RE: Heil Hitler So your logic is white people in the US get it easy so therefore all white people must like hitler?
That's just as ignorant as your original post.
Hitler only made life better for a small group of white people that supported him in the 30's/40's.
The only way he made life better for anyone else was by pointing his own gun at his head and pulling the trigger.
So I don't know where you get the "white people must secretly love him" shit from. Infact I don't even know how you can link you not likeing being black to white people must love a man who is lower than shit.

Heil Hitler I'm not sure how Hitler has had anything to do with American politics and culture. I seem to remember watching a movie that showed white Americans killing Hilter's armies in an effort to stop his madness.
