Oh yeah. That's one fucked up flick. I think the most fucked up movies I've seen, are Visitor Q and the remakes of Marquis De-Sade stories.
There was another film with a women who has sex with a corpse, commits suicide, gives birth, and her child gets persecuted by some people. When he dies the film is over. It was in black and white. If I remember correctly it inspired a music video. Now I have to find out what that film was . I'm a strange person....

RE: Weirdest movies you have seen Enter the Void... geez, that is a fuuuuucked up film.
The Room... possibly the worst film of all time... so bad that it actually makes me angry.

RE: Weirdest movies you have seen The Tree of Life. More awful than weird... but still very weird.
And it's highly-rated, with awards from Cannes and everything...

Skepticism is not a position; it is an approach to claims.
Science is not a subject, but a method.

The Room! Yes! Wasn't that awful? And yet you watched it all the way to the end, didn't you? What a wonderfully bad film!

RE: Weirdest movies you have seen Blood for Dracula
Dracula is old and blood isn't too easily acquired in the 20th century.
So he moves to the italian country and tries to wed one of the daughters of a wealthy landowner.
But before he can get to any of the girls, the gardener makes it so that he cannot feed on them by making sure they aren't virgins anymore.
Very graphical movie for the 60's.
Also there is Gay Niggers From Outerspace but that one is just too weird to describe.
All I can say is that they make a genre pic with a Star Trek like basis.

RE: Weirdest movies you have seen Gayniggers From Outer space
Oh my GOD! This was one of the best movies I have ever had the chance to see. Better even than Plan 9 From Outer space...
A brilliant concept.
"Die, female creaturen!!"
German gay niggeres come to free mankind on planet Earth from tyranny of evil female creatures. Then, planet Earth can join their Gay Federation of Planets. Or it is called something like that... Quote:Capt. B. Dick: I know you're afraid ArmInAss, but my son- this is just step on the long road to becoming a GayNigger.
Capt. B. Dick: It started when you're father gave birth to you... and who knows, maybe after this mission, you'll get the sign of the brown ring- and can truly call yourself a GayNigger. A jewel among jewels.
I have a theory that the truth is never told during the nine-to-five hours.
-Hunter S. Thompson

RE: Weirdest movies you have seen Weird is definitely subjective... Some of the films here listed as weird don't ring up that way to me, although, plenty I get as weird.. basically all the David Lynch films.
The weirdest film I think I ever saw was Pocket Ninjas... The greatest thing about the film was the Australian martial arts instructor in the American Flag shirt.. I definitely think it inspired Napoleon Dynamite.

It makes a good drinking game. Everytime he says, oh, haai Mark you drink. Everytime a new plot twist that has nothing to do with anything that proceeds it or follows it you drink. Good times!
