fuck these cunts crack me up every fucking year they put up some "controversial" billboard.
The most famous being that one with the virgin Marry looking at a pregnancy test in shock.
Well, without fail this years will no doubt cause yet another controversy.
Fitting with gay marriage going through parliament at the moment actually.

I don't talk gay, I don't walk gay, it's like people don't even know I'm gay unless I'm blowing them.

Didn't you know god is an atheist.
Member of the Cult of Reason
The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

That's awesome. Jesus did hang out exclusively with 12 men and seemed to be rather close to his mother but distant from his father...
Is this place still a shithole run by a dumbass calvinist?

Hey, then what's the deal with that ho Mary Magdalene and them escaping to Cataluña and siring a whole dynasty that is still with us today? What about all that shit? Not that she would be short of semen sponsors.
