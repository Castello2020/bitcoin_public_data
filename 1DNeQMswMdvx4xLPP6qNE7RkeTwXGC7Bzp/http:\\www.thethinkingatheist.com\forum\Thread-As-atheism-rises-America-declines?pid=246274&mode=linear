Would you mind expanding on that, Mister Terse?
The U.S. has been steadily dropping in the world rankings in infant mortality, science and math proficiency, literacy, wealth and income equality, health care, murder rates, incarceration rates, national debt, and so on for many years.
Skepticism is not a position; it is an approach to claims.
Science is not a subject, but a method.

Yes. Because so many Christians are so self-reliant. Atheists are just unemployed, uneducated, dependent jerks.
Tell me why is it that one Christian family I know, the son, has 3 kids, a wife and lives with his Christian parents? And he's almost 30? And he's been doing that since day one? And a neighbor of mine, who is Christian, can't get off her ass to get a job to move her and her two kids out of her parent's house? And the Christian partiers in my neighborhood who seem to party non-stop 24/7. And me, being an Atheist, raising a kid by herself with no government assistance, working full time AND has a college education?
So to your comment I say a big FUCK YOU to your generalizations because it's an insult to my values, my morals and everything I've worked damn hard for and believe in.
Lazy people come from all types of belief systems just like crime happens by people from all types of belief systems. Doesn't matter the label. America's decline has many factors. That's what makes the author's article...and your generalization...such a fallacy.

Religions don't exactly have the best track record of dealing with threats, instead of adapting, they have instead eradicated those threats to their best ability. Now, they don't have the power to do so, our threat is prevalent and they, being rigid for millennia, and relatively unchallenged for centuries, cannot adapt to us, they feel threatened, I'd say, they are frightened of us, because they know they cannot stop us with another Inquisition, any time soon! It is a good age to be alive.
A single action is worth more than the words it takes to describe it.

And still, the best fucking students on the whole goddam fucking planet would sell their souls to come to our Graduate Schools. The fuck's up with that?

Because we've got some great fucking universities. The public schools are not so great - some are, most aren't.

RE: As atheism rises, America declines i dont have a problem with the faithful usually but when they start blaming misfortune on magic i tend to get very annoyed. what kind of childlike mind actually thinks like this? sometimes i think it must be a joke of some sort. are these people real? do they really believe this crap? how does an idiot get a job writting articles? perhaps he was hired by an idiot?

Ruin, desolation and despair will walk the Earth, driving the masses insane. And we, poor souls, having lost our newfangled saviour, will be cast into the outer darkness, where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

9/10 Trolling.

The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

The Universities they are coming to are by and large Public Universities.
