RE: Dawkins vs Creationists As always Dawkins displays remarkable restraint and patience with some of the callers. The final female caller literally had me facepalming. Seriously can someone not work out the potential issue for their misinformation when they keep repeating that they have looked at the evidence from a Creation organisation. I was less than patient. Do these people understand the concept of getting objective evidence by researching numerous sources whose authors have scientific pedigree. There appears to be no limit to the worship of ignorance.

I also try to have the same patience. To try and educate first, then if they refuse the information I move on. To me religion is just a bad idea that knowledge can purge.

Actually, no, they don't. Why should they? After all, they've spent their whole lives getting ALL their faith information from one source, why should this be any different?

RE: Dawkins vs Creationists Thank you for that video, fstratzero. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. When the caller remarked "my soul is made of Skittles" I just about lost it. How do these guys take the caller so seriously???
I also wonder how it was done. I would think it was a soundboard except that it's so fluent, and Dawkins probably never even said many of those words publicly.
My girlfriend is mad at me. Perhaps I shouldn't have tried cooking a stick in her non-stick pan.

RE: Dawkins vs Creationists Dawkins has an insane amount of restraint. So much facepalm. Apparently the one caller didn't understand what ignorant means. "you're not a nutcase... you're ignorant." "OH I'M IGNORANT NOW?" haha
Ugh YECs....

I would like to believe that religion can be purged with information.. But when people don't value the information you have just because of their beliefs... Well.. Refer to my signature 2.5 billion seconds total
