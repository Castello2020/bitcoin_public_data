Oh Snap! Seth's book is available on Kindle already! Purchased! Haven't started reading it yet, I will probably start while at work tomorrow, but I may just start reading tonight.
Thought you all might want to know, if you haven't already purchased a paperback version. Contribute to the Community Resource!

RE: Oh Snap! Seth's book is available on Kindle already! I could have sworn that he said it would release in January, but since I searched for it on a whim on the Kindle store, and it was there, I snatched it up. */fanboi alert!*

God, you noob. If the savior, Seth, told you it was going to be released in January, it's January. Who are you to question and challenge my God? Credit goes to UndercoverAtheist.

RE: Oh Snap! Seth's book is available on Kindle already! Anyone delved into it yet? I have an amazon giftcard I am contemplating using for his book and part of a Hitchens book.
Is this place still a shithole run by a dumbass calvinist?

RE: Oh Snap! Seth's book is available on Kindle already! Sweet! Can't wait for the audio book version! I know they usually get others to read but it would be very cool for Seth to do his own read for the audio book... he has a great voice. I think in the end, I just feel like I'm a secular person who has a skeptical eye toward any extraordinary claim, carefully examining any extraordinary evidence before jumping to conclusions. ~ Eric ~ My friend ... who figured it out.

I didn't realize you could buy just part of a book. "All that is necessary for the triumph of Calvinism is that good Atheists do nothing." ~Eric Oh My

RE: Oh Snap! Seth's book is available on Kindle already! I finished it.
My thoughts are a bit mixed. Most of it is autobiographical, and sets up the big picture for how Seth got to where he is today. There's a bit of Biblical criticism, a small section on accusations that are thrown at us by the religious, a few links that might be useful.
If you are short on cash, I would say; A lot of it you will have heard from his podcasts, but there are still a few things that I didn't know before, and I did enjoy the read.
I learned about Ambulocetus, the walking whale, so that was totally worth the purchase. (Ambulocetus is just mentioned as a transitional fossil, but I hadn't heard of it before, so I looked it up on my own.)

RE: Oh Snap! Seth's book is available on Kindle already! Well, I have a few other books to finish at the moment, so maybe I'll hold off for now on the purchase and pick it up when it hits the $5 mark on Kindle.
