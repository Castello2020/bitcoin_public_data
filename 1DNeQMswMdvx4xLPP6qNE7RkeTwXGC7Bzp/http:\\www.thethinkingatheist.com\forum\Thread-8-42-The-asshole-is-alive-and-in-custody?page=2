RE: 8:42 - The asshole is alive and in custody. I hope he gets brought to a court to stand trial before his peers.
Because he is a suspect, I'll have to reserve my judgements.
However if he is also found guilty of the bombings I think he should be forced to witness the pain and suffering he has caused to the people and families.

RE: 8:42 - The asshole is alive and in custody. So how sure are they that these guys are the culprits? What evidence do they have on them?

Well from what we know they have video evidence of them planting the bags that contained the bombs at the scene. There is probably more evidence but most of that wont be released until he comes to trial.

Let's see.
They have video.
They have more video.
They have them killing a cop.
They have them shooting and bombing cops.
They have them carjacking - the owner as a witness.
Need more?

RE: 8:42 - The asshole is alive and in custody. I still think Boston failed to provide a secure environment. No one should have been allowed to bring in backpacks and leave them sitting where they were put. Boston officials have some responsibilityn here. Not very PC to say, but it's my opinion. Didn't the 9/11 highjackers get on their planes at Logan airport ? What's wrong with Boston ? Why don't they take security seriously ? The US fails to take security seriously. Everyone can walk around with a gun. Even the nuts. Security in the US is nothing what it needs to be, obviously.

A decision from the court. Even though it's pretty apparent. We as a society need to remember what a angry mob of villagers can do, and what mistakes they make.
I don't want to be an irrational villager.

I'm neither convicting or lynching him - just answering the question.

No, think I'm good here. Personally, I've always been keen to the idea of letting people like that go some where up north. Like way way way up north. Where ones compass doesn't know the difference between north and south kind of up north. Give them some proper materials of course but make no plans for future pickups. That's my view anyway.

I'm not sure that such a thing as covering a marathon, especially with such a open outdoor environment, is an easy thing to do. Lots of people in a sports environment are going to have backpacks, bags, and different assortment of gear. It would be hard ( to say the least) to keep track of who left what where and why.
