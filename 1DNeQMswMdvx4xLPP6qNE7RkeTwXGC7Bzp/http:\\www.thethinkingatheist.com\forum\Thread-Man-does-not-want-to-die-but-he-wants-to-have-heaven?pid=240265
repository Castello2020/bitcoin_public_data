I disagree that heaven comes after death.

RE: Man does not want to die, but he wants to have heaven Everything that survives does so out of a desire to survive, which includes the desire to continue to feel the pleasure of living. When living becomes painful and we are sick, the desire to end the pain, to end the sickness becomes greater. It's at this point where we have to fight to keep living and get better or we give in and let the life we have drift away until we are unconscious of it all. And even then, the body may still fight to survive when we have given up hope for survival.
I think I would exchange the words "die" and "heaven" in your post to "pain" and "pleasure".
We don't want to feel pain. We desire pleasure. Lucky for us, we don't have to go through pain to get pleasure, but there are times when we do. Childbirth is the main example that comes to mind.
But if you take a step backwards, you see that the root of survival is in pleasure.
The pleasure of sexual intimacy can lead to pregnancy. Lastly, only saving oneself cannot be called good, but it can be called self-preservation.
Many of us also use a different word - cowardly
Insanity - doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results

It is religiously true that heaven comes after death.

It is philosophically true that socks go on hands.
See? I can strings words together so they sound meaningful too. That doesn't make it so. Come up with something better than this vague half-mystic crap. We get a dozen of you a week and your philosophy is about as robust as watered-down Top Ramen. Have something to say? Put in the effort to represent it thoroughly. If your viewpoint is so anemic that you can only disclose it through vague statements then you, sir, have the philosophical stature of a ten year old couch potato.
Put up or shut up.

It works, bitches.

I believe this is why religion has such a vice like grip on humans today. It is the fact we fear death. We fear our total nonexistence and we want to live forever. It is why religions fabricated heaven. Follow me and you will live forever, be happy and see lost ones again. It is an obvious lure for those who fear death which is the majority and it has gripped humans so strongly that extremists will actually give up their lives for this dream. No facts, no evidence but a wish they want to be true.
Humans are a peculiar animal but they share that one thing you state. Animals avoid death and try their hardest to survive just like humans. Even as some animals go extinct others have adapted to live and thrive. Humans are not different in that fact but we are unique in which we believe that we are destined to some afterlife. I just say enjoy your time now as you have it. We will all die someday and I believe it would be beneficial to any human who could say I enjoyed life. Not say they have a long one or an active one but one they could say they simply enjoyed.

You don't have to die, just take MDMA. Extacy feels just like heaven, complete, whole, wonderful and full of empathy. Member of the Cult of Reason
The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

It is religiously true that heaven comes after death.
What does that even mean? "It is religiously true". Oh, I have one for you.
It is realistically true that nothing comes after death.
How does that sound?
A single action is worth more than the words it takes to describe it.

Well, we have the Internet, it's more or less comprised of porn anyway. We just need an almost dead guy.
