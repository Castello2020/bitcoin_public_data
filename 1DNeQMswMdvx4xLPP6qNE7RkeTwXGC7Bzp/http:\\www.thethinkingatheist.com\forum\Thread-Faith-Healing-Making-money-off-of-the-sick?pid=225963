Faith Healing. Making money off of the sick. Member of the Cult of Reason
The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

RE: Faith Healing. Making money off of the sick. That was painful and uncomfortable to watch. Seeing broken people, not only put their energy into believing it could happen, but giving everything they have in the real world to help them to encourage their delusion and continue their suffering is not a positive outlook.

RE: Faith Healing. Making money off of the sick. Well there is a reason that when part of a church you are considered a part of a flock of sheep. You are turning yourself and your well being over to a bunch of wolves.
