You know what? Everyone from this forum who is going to join my forum has already done so. No one else is going to from here. I am killing time here. So, in answering your question: Yes, I am leaving soon, and I won't be back.
If you are leaving I'd like to say I never hated you, but your arguments were frustrating. You have been a fun person on these forums. With that said I hope that what ever version of the bible you wrote is compatible with science, and allows for scientific inquires to be made in every field of the world.

The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

RE: Evolution with God? I think you are hoping for too much.
A single action is worth more than the words it takes to describe it.

Science, huh? What's that? Do you mean the scientific method? Do you mean current theories in the various -ology fields? Do you mean in agreement with people who work as researchers and publish papers? What? You don't know, do you?
Science is for classifying and describing the physical world. The scientific method is a form of philosophy and a way of thinking and verifying. I use science every day. I use philosophy every day. And I talk to God and He talks to me every day. And at times I look at my astrological chart, even today, I am trying to decode the symbolism of a dream I had last night. At other times I might read what some Indian guru has said, or some Sufi mystic. I don't close my mind. Atheists close their minds. In fact you can't be an atheist, a real atheist, unless you close your mind to almost everything.
Most of the universe is made of dark matter and energy. The sciences of astrophysics and astronomy as well as mathematics has taught us that. But we don't have a clue what it is, where it came from, how it works, how to experiment on it--nothing. This world is stranger than anything religion ever dreamed of.
You put your faith in science and I'll watch you roast in hell from a box seat in heaven. You put your faith in God and He'll show you everything.
Science, huh?

Figures you'd reply like that. Perhaps if you need a religion you should join the Cult of reason?

Re: Evolution with God? Just let him ride off into the sunset and become another forgotten looney to pass through the forum. Except he won't stay away because his forum will fall flat in 2 maybe 3 months?
Is this place still a shithole run by a dumbass calvinist?

Science, huh?
When you're done using your mystic friends to decode your dream from God and come up with a working mathematical model to explain Dark Matter and/or Dark Energy, then you can go collect your Nobel Prize.
Until then, your mind will be closed off because you fill it with presuppositions that prevent you from following all lines of inquiry. While godless atheistic researchers and scientist continue to soldier on in their attempt to understand the universe. Take a guess who will come up with a working model for Dark Energy/Dark Matter first?
The fact that you don't already see Astrology for the massive pile of bullshit that it is speaks volumes. I can debunk astrology with a single argument. Identical twins don't have the same fate, simple as that. The stars don't give a flying fuck when you, or anyone else, were born.
