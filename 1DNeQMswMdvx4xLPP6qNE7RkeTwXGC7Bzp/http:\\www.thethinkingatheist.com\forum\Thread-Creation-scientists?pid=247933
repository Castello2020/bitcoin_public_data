RE: Creation scientists Argument from authority (argumentum ad verecundiam), also authoritative argument and appeal to authority, is an inductive-reasoning argument that often takes the form of a statistical syllogism. The appeal to authority is often applied fallaciously: either the authority is not a subject-matter expert, or there is no consensus among experts in the subject matter, or both.

The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

Agree. None of them have a shred of evidence for any god(s) or creation, as an historical fact, nor do they offer any proof. If they did, they would have Nobel prizes. They actually are appealing to a Biblical text, (for their dating) in which none of them have any training, either in Ancient Near East culture and it's writings, or how that would relate to their field. So, it's a perfect example of the Argument from Authority fallacy, since none of them have any authority, OR, more importantly, none rest in the MAJORITY position of the field in question, which is the requirement for a correct use of the Argumentum ad Vericundiam. They are essentially freaks in their fields, and are considered "kooks", by their peers.

What a waste of typing. I think in the end, I just feel like I'm a secular person who has a skeptical eye toward any extraordinary claim, carefully examining any extraordinary evidence before jumping to conclusions. ~ Eric ~ My friend ... who figured it out.

RE: Creation scientists It'd be quite convenient to have a nice list like that. Well we do now. But now if I was reading stuff I could just use the list to handily check if the scientist in question's a weirdo.

What a waste of typing. And I've seen scientists on TV complaining they were sent emails, which they just deleted without reading, (and who wouldn't from a crazy place), but in fact the emails somewhere said, that unless they replied, and requested removal, their names would be added, whether they agreed with the site or not. Then, after discovering their names on the lists, they had to fight, (some in court) to have them removed. So, unless I know for a fact they actually DO agree with the nut jobs, I assume their names were added fraudulently.

RE: Creation scientists Here is a list of scientists with the first name of Steve who subscribe to the statement:
"Evolution is a vital, well-supported, unifying principle of the biological sciences, and the scientific evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of the idea that all living things share a common ancestry. Although there are legitimate debates about the patterns and processes of evolution, there is no serious scientific doubt that evolution occurred or that natural selection is a major mechanism in its occurrence. It is scientifically inappropriate and pedagogically irresponsible for creationist pseudoscience, including but not limited to "intelligent design," to be introduced into the science curricula of our nation's public schools. "
http://ncse.com/taking-action/list-steves
1238 scientists with the first name of Steve have signed this statement as of January 16, 2013. Kind of puts your list into perspective, doesn't it?

RE: Creation scientists And what exactly is this supposed to prove?
The scientists who believe then biblical account of creation, huh?
I'll just leave this here. It's a shot in the dark, but I think it's valid here.
Well, looks like Bryan beat me.
A single action is worth more than the words it takes to describe it.

Nice geologists. Which is what he asked you to find, not every creationist with a degree.
E 2 = (mc 2)2 + (pc )2
614C → 714N + e– + ̅νe
2 K(s) + 2 H2O(l) → 2 KOH(aq) + H2 (g) + 196 kJ/mol
It works, bitches.
