RE: So long, then He expected us to do things we never do. Deleting other peoples posts or moving them elsewhere.
When we refused he spat the dummy and vandalised the thread putting [deleted] in place of his posts and editing the thread name.
I revoked his post editing privilege during which he started being increasingly abusive. He posted threats to one of the moderators which finally got him banned.
In his mind perhaps he sees it as a bunch of people ganging up on him which may be understandable. Despite acting like an ass-hat he would have been fine had he not sent threatening messages to a moderator.
Apart from his editing privilege of course!
You should read the thread... There are plenty of reasons for people to flip out. Why should it mostly be a good reason?

[deleted] wasn't very effective when people had already quoted him.

RE: So long, then Nah, cbf, that about satisfies me.
In other news, I'm cooking stir fry, anyone hungry?
I don't talk gay, I don't walk gay, it's like people don't even know I'm gay unless I'm blowing them.

Oh wait, Filox is still around. All good, crisis averted. Carry on.
I haven't read the shit that went down (because if you haven't noticed, I've been away for the last 4 or 5 days, long story we'll work out the "alibies" later) but I think people are probable overreacting a tad.
I mean sure the guy was pretty stubborn, and sure he had incorrect views about how the economy should be run, and sure he was a bit of an 'asshat' at times, but still. Perhaps the mods were being a little 'bulling'? Usually these things have a grain of truth, I mean people don't flip shit like this unless they feel they have a good reason.
Everything I said to RC was public and is still in the original thread that he vandalized. If you find anything bullying in what I've said, feel free to bring it to the forefront. Otherwise, you may want to re-think your position on "bullying." Not that I'm forcing you to do so, because that would be bullying.

Oh my god, this is the worst possible punishment he could get. I feel kinda sorry for him now, because of this. Frenkiej, you are such an asshole. Major asshole. No wait, that's me. I have a theory that the truth is never told during the nine-to-five hours.

I'll just take DT's word for it.
I was merely offering a bit of an observation.
Also, the stir fry was good. None left however.
