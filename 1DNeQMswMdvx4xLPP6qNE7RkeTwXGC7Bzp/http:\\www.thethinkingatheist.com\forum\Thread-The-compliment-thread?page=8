RE: The compliment thread (20-05-2012 06:28 AM)houseofcantor Wrote: Erx and Girly and I are the unholy trine. If we ever got together in a bar one night, and a Westboro protest the next morning... that would be that. This gives me an idea for a deconversion strategy. Hellbound chats 'em up with religious mumbo jumbo and invites them into a bar for further discourse. They plop down between HoC and Girly at the bar. HoC starts going on about the Gwynnies. The soon to be deconverted asks Erx, "What's he talking about?" Hellbound says, "Let me buy you a drink." HoC moves onto the "Love is Void" sermon. The soon to be deconverted turns to Girly, "What's he talking about now." Girly responds "Let me buy you a bottle." Dude wakes up looking like this. Dude: "What happened to my pants?" Erx: "God took them." Dude: "WTF?!? Don't remembering that being part of my tithe." Girly: "Don't trust that fucker, you'll not only lose your shirt, you'll lose your pants too."
HoC: "Oh my dear Gwynnies, where are your pants?"

RE: The compliment thread Mr. Woof is calm and clear in his posts.
I find that what he says is worth reading.

Thanks Anjele.
I used to be rather the opposite so a few things must be working for me. You too seem to be reasonably keeping on top of things.

Been pondering for a while what to put under my name instead of 'member' which is kinda rude in an 80's "letter to the Playboy editor" type of rude and makes me feel immature for finding it rude. Thanks HoC...another crisis solved.

RE: The compliment thread Shannow. Wow - his work!! - his videos!!
Shannow gives the forum and all of us such dimension! I don't mean to sound creepy here or freak anyone out but he might be God. Ok, maybe not the God, but he's certainly a God... when he's doing his thing.

RE: The compliment thread Kim a cool forum poster who always has a light hearted thing to say, that seems to brighten my day!

The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

RE: The compliment thread Hmmmm, time to revive this thread I think. Just had a good time reading through it all.
Anyway, I'm gonna mention two more people.
Firstly, LadyJane. There's just something sweet and likeable about you and you always post interesting things.
Secondly, Ferdinand. Ferdinand is hands down one of my favourite forum members. Sometimes I even read threads I have no interest in just because she's posted in them. Her use of vocabulary and infinite maturity never cease to amaze and inspire me.
Best and worst of Ferdinand .....
Best
Ferdinand: We don't really say 'theist' in Alabama. Here, you're either a Christian, or you're from Afghanistan and we fucking hate you.
Worst
Ferdinand: Everyone from British is so, like, fucking retarded.
