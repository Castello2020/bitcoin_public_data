Re: Why is it "unPC" to say some races are inferior? con Black people are better at: dancing, pimping bitches, singing, soul and blues, a lot of sports, building muscle mass fast etc etc.
Not so good at: credit, investing, politics, not using the race card, marriage, etc etc.

Why not simply threaten African countries with a resumption of slavery, unless they get their acts together?

The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

RE: Why is it "unPC" to say some races are inferior? con They are not inferior. They have just been born in another country under different rules and regulations, they know no different much like you know no different from the place you were brought up in.
There is nothing PC about that.
You're never going to say the things you want to say. The things you want to change will usually stay that way
The promises you break outweigh the ones you keep.

Bury me with my guns on, so when I reach the other side - I can show him what it feels like to die.
