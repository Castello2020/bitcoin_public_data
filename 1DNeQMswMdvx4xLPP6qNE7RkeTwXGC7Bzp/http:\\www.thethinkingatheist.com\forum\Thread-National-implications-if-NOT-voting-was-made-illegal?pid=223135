RE: National implications if NOT voting was made illegal? I helped a friend with his citizenship test a couple years ago. They had to know a LOT. I think before anyone votes, a one-time test should be passed, especially since Americans are so badly educated. Then voting should be done on Saturdays, and if the IRS can have us file online, voting should be registerd and done online. All this antiquated crap. That way the tallyimg would be instantaneous. Time for the election people to join the 21st Century.

I think we're a long way from any form of online voting. If they let us vote online, someone might figure out that we could actually have a functioning democracy.

The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

It would also enable hackers to modify the ballots far more easily than it is now.
