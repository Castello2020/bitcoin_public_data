You misread it, my hyper-rational Brother, it's not about that at all. "Hallelujah"
I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Baby I have been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you.
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
There was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Maybe there’s a God above
But all I’ve ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
It’s not a cry you can hear at night
It’s not somebody who has seen the light
It’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well, really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah I don't think so.
Original lyrics:
"Now I've heard there was a secret chord

She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Skepticism is not a position; it is an approach to claims.

You're wrong. It's about faith, fidelity, forgiveness, and surrender. Sex and lust are incidental and ancillary at best. Love is not a victory march, it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah.
Breathing - it's more art than science.

RE: Pick your funeral song. Hallelujah, seriously?
You left yourselves wide open for this one:
I'd give you the lyrics but I don't speak foreign.
I don't talk gay, I don't walk gay, it's like people don't even know I'm gay unless I'm blowing them.

RE: Pick your funeral song. History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government. This marks the lowest grade of ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own purpose. ~ Thomas Jefferson

RE: Pick your funeral song. Freude, schoner gotterfunken,
Tochter aus Elysium,
Wir betreten feuertrunken,
Himmlische, dein Heiligtum.
Deine Zauber binden wieder,
Was die Mode streng geteilt,
Alle Menschen werden Bruder,
Wo dein sanfter Flugel weilt.
Seid umschlungen, Millionen!
Diesen KuB der ganzen Welt!
Bruder - uberm Sternenzelt
MuB ein lieber vater wohnen.
Wem der groBe wurf gelungen,
Eines Freundes Freund zu sein,
Wer ein holdes Weib errungen,
Mische seinen Jubel ein!
Ja - wer auch nur eine Seele
Sein nennt auf dem Erdenrund!
Und wers nie gekonnt, der stehle
Weinend sich aus diesem Bund.
Was den groBen Ring bewohnet,
Huldige der Sympathie!
Zu den Sternen leitet sie,
Wo der Unbekannte thronet.
Freude trinken alle Wesen
An den Brusten der Natur,
Alle Guten, alle Bosen
Folgen ihrer Rosenspur.
Kusse gab sie uns und Reben,
Einen Freund, gepruft im Tod,
Wollust ward dem Wurm gegeben,
Und der Cherub steht vor gott.
Ihr sturzt nieder, Millionen?
Ahnest du den Schopfer, Welt?
Such ihn uberm Sternenzelt!
Uber Sternen muB er wohnen.
Freude heiBt die starke Feder
In der ewigen Natur.
Freude, Freude treibt die Rader
In der groBen Weltenuhr.
Blumen lockt sie aus den Keimen,
Sonnen aus dem Firmament,
Spharen rollt sie in den Raumen,
Die des Sehers Rohr nicht kennt.
Froh, wie seine Sonnen fliegen
Durch des Himmels prachtgen Plan,
Wandelt, Bruder, eure Bahn,
Freudig wie ein Held zum Siegen.
Aus der Wahrheit Feuerspiegel
Lachelt sie den Forscher an.
Zu der Tugend steilem Hugel
Leitet sie des Dulders Bahn.
Auf des Glaubens Sonnenberge
Sieht man ihre Fahnen wehn,
Durch den RiB gesprengter Sarge
Sie im Chor der Engel stehn.
Duldet mutig, Millionen!
Duldet fur die beBre Welt!
Droben uberm Sternenzelt
Wird ein groBer Gott belohnen.
Gottern kann man nicht vergelten,
Schon ists, ihnen gleich zu sein.
Gram und Armut soll sich melden,
Mit den Frohen sich erfreun.
Groll und Rache sei vergessen,
Unserm Todfeind sei verziehn,
Keine Trane soll ihn pressen,
Keine Reue nage ihn.
Unser Schuldbuch sei vernichtet!
Ausgesohnt die ganze Welt!
Bruder - uberm Sternenzelt
Richtet Gott, wie wir gerichtet.
Freude sprudelt in Pokalen,
In der Traube goldnem Blut
Trinken Sanftmut Kannibalen,
Die Verzweiflung Heldenmut.
Bruder, fliegt von euren Sitzen,
Wenn der volle Romer kreist,
LaBt den Schaum zum Himmel spritzen:
Dieses Glas dem guten Geist!
Den der Sterne Wirbel loben,
Den des Seraphs Hymne preist,
Dieses Glas dem guten Geist
Uberm Sternenzelt dort oben!
Festen Mut in schweren Leiden,
Hilfe, wo die Unschuld weint,
Ewigkeit geschwornen Eiden,
Wahrheit gegen Freund und Feind,
Mannerstolz vor Konigsthronen -
Bruder, galt es Gut und Blut:
Dem Verdienste seine Kronen,
Untergang der Lugenbrut!
SchlieBt den heilgen Zirkel dichter,
Schwort bei diesem goldnen Wein,
Dem Gelubde treu zu sein,
Schwort es bei dem Sternenrichter! Insufferable know-it-all. Certified Ancient Astronaut Theorist The noblest of the dogs is the hot dog. It feeds the hand that bites it.

RE: Pick your funeral song. I don't know if I even want any music at my funeral. I don't want people to connect music with my death because music is such a beautiful thing! ... and about the Hallelujah song... omg??? I have never ever paid attention to the lyrics, i always thought it is a deeply religious song... it's not, I guess

No, it's not. It is philosophical.
