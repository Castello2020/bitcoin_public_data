He wouldn't have to advertise his new found Atheism but even if he did, I'm pretty sure he wouldn't lose his job and certainly wouldn't behave differently than he does now. If he did lose his job over it... no doubt he's aware he lives in the Land of Lawsuit. So, outside his family, I don't see much of a change other than he probably will be sleeping in on Sunday mornings more.

People here have overturned their lives, picked up and moved, found new friends, new jobs, and why?

It can present complete upheaval... but I don't think that all bridges must be burnt, rather redesigned. And Kingsy does present a particularly different case.
Kingsy knows and operates well within reality - as well, he knows that his belief is entirely irrational. I think because he understands this more fully than many people and because of this, he'll fair quite well. He'd probably go into a closet for quite some time to people outside his immediately family. This way he can concentrate on his internal life and pull his marriage in parallel with his newly realized existence. His relationship with his wife might take some doing - but hey, he bagged a hottie like her -obviously, the guy's already a scam artist. Seriously, his biggest job with in the relationship will be to drag her(possibly kicking & screaming) out of the same delusion he pulled himself from. Tough job, but sometimes - that's love.
He'd probably also concentrate his efforts in the redirection of his children's education - neither has entered school, so not much to change there... just more emphasis on the explanation between what's fantasy and what's not. When do most people tell their child that there is no Santa?

Hey, I'm not saying I want him to more firmly grasp reality, that shit's up to him. I'm just saying it's possible and I'm saying he would probably fair pretty well getting there. S'all. No biggie. Now, fuck off, I'm having a coffee.

If he did lose his job over it... no doubt he's aware he lives in the Land of Lawsuit. So, outside his family, I don't see much of a change other than he probably will be sleeping in on Sunday mornings more. So in squaring the circle, you've given a positive aspects to the approach. Should not the negative aspects of the approach also be considered? Loss of friends
Loss of job
Loss of family & wife (I doubt Kingsy would blame his wife for keeping to her beliefs) Loss of sense of self would change the way he would behave around his theist friends His children would be confused and probably also have identity crisis of their own, considering their father just had a 180 in his personal beliefs
The list goes on... When trying to square the circle, one can't have it both ways. In the unlikely event it would happen - it more likely that the negative approach is the most likely outcome. Hope for the best outcome is unrealistic - I myself have gone through it, and it took a lot of strength to accept that. It would only make the negative aspects list more lengthy and more difficult to accept and overcome.

RE: Am I being weak minded? Actually I enjoy your other threads, and have been surprised to see you join us on our theist tirades. I don't hate you personally, but I do not like your beliefs.
Other than that you are pretty awesome.
