RE: Worst Self-Portrait Contest. When the sun comes up and I can take proper photos..... im gonna don this thread..... you'll see You're never going to say the things you want to say. The things you want to change will usually stay that way
The promises you break outweigh the ones you keep.

RE: Worst Self-Portrait Contest. Nope. I hit "add attachment" and the page just refreshes, and the "uploads disabled" is still there.
