Lol, not an obsession, just a reality and I like to let the Mods know that I know their tactics. If they dont, then in a short while I'll apoligize and admit that I misjudged them.
Have you considered that in the end, you will forget everything you knew about religion, thus becoming an atheist yourself?
Member of the Cult of Reason
The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

I've forgotten and I dont have the union list here? Why on earth would you try to defend Christians on an atheist site? Seriously, you dont know that atheists dont give one crap about how nice you are? They HATE Christians....let me say it again....THEY HATE CHIRSTIANS. They may act nice to you but thats just a ploy to suck you into their discussions so they can ridicule you. God bless you and your naivete. Keep fighting if you wish but you are fighting a useless fight. The atheists are NOT going to convert.
I don't hate KC. I don't hate my dad. I don't hate my mom. I don't hate my step-mom. I don't hate my brothers. I don't hate sister-in-law. So given all of that, it's safe to say I don't hate Christians. I dislike some things that they may do from time to time, or how they may talk to me on occasion. But that's not hating them. I love them as people, family, and friends.
I don't know you enough to hate you, but it's easy to despise what you stand for given how you've presented both it and yourself. Not that you care, I know, I get it. It means fuck all to you- because you have it figured out. You're a badass detective that knows everything you need to know, so everyone else can fuck off. Cool.
So you judge Christians by the behaviour of other Christians...I jusge you by the behaviour of other atheists. Yes, I paint all of you with the same brush. So, sue me. You can despise anything you wish, no one cares. No, I dont care. You are an atheist, therefore, you are an enemy of God. I'm supposed to love my enemies but that only means if you are dying or starving to try to help you, it doesnt mean I have to like you, and I sure as hell dont. Lol, I said one itsy bitsy tiny thing to another detective and you have all jumped on that as another point to ridicule me. How very atheistic of you. Cool.
