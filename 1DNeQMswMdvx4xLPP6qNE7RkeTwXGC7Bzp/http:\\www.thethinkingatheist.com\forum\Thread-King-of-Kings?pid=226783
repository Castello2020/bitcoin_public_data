RE: King of Kings Why is Jesus white in most pictures?
Did he not go out in the hot middle eastern sun?
He will need to supplement his vitamin D intake if thats the case Maybe FZU can give him a diet plan.

RE: King of Kings Ew - JC is looking a tad pasty. Maybe his character wasn't going to be killed, rather he was just sickly and died. Then, they had to make something up to be more "believable" for the already rabid cult following. Never know what goes on behind the scenes of these tall tales and legends.

RE: King of Kings If he had an already rabid cult following then announcing 'your boy didn't die of skin cancer, we nailed him to a tree' is like... yeah, that's a *brave* PR department there...

You're not so much offensive as pitiable.
What you don't seem to realize is that you yourself are your own best advertisement for non-belief. If the statement above is an indication of what your faith has turned you into, who in their right mind would want to follow your path?
Religious disputes are like arguments in a madhouse over which inmate really is Napoleon.

I pity the atheists who cannot separate Christ from the Christian Church; they remain in darkness, and they remain victims of the darkness. The reason I have never been successful at being an atheist, and the reason I have never been successful as a Christian is because of what happened in 1993.
In 1993, I tried an experiment: I read the Gospel of John, and when I did, I pretended I had never heard of it before. I pretended I had never heard of Christ, or the Church, or anything. I was just a man stranded on an island and this Gospel got washed up on the shore.
In reading it that way, and I realized immediately what I was looking at: This was a fictional story about me. Various aspects of my personality were represented by the various characters, and the ultimate being I was striving to be was Jesus Christ. I was amazed. Suddenly all the secret meanings, all the riddles, all the symbols and ideas of Christ became obvious. The Gospel was a story by me, for me.
That led me down a path that has never stopped in my life since then. I marvel at who could have written the Gospels way back when—who inspired the writers to write what they wrote? Where did they get the wisdom? I came to the reasonable conclusion that there must have actually been a person like Jesus Christ. I don’t know anything about him, because the Gospels are a fictional account and a teaching tool. They are designed to create a spiritual change in any person who reads them. But there must have been a person who inspired them. We call him Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
The following lyrics from the song, Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls sums up how I feel about Christ in my life:
And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later it's over
I just don't want to miss you tonight
And now that midnight has passed, it is his birthday, and we have not missed him. Yvonne Eliman puts it well:
Merry Christmas!
Fictional stories do not accurately depict reality. No matter how you emotionally connect to a character, the emotional connection does not make it a reality.

The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.
