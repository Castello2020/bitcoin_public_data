Secular Library Bitch Slap Awards Secular Library Bitch Slap Award
The Secular Library (irrationalist) Award shall be delivered in years applicable on Black Friday, at an event sponsored by the SLFoundation; and is to be well insulated from the Secular Library Humanitarian Awards, which is supposed to be an annual event.
Because the ambition of the award is to embarrass individual atheists, and to compel the atheist community to be more observant of reason, the event and award are not to be expected to be an annual. This should help to maintain the level of solemnity that the award is designed to be - it is not to devolve into a silly party like the USmedia's Annual Washington Corespondents Dinner. The atmosphere of the event should have that similar to a roast - perhaps that will be the designation, SLRoast.
Like the SLHumanitarian Awards the nominations are submitted by the SLNetwork, and the SLFoundation is responsible for evaluating and selecting candidates, who all shall be invited to the ceremony, at least, one month prior to the event; or possibly announced at the Secular Library Halloween event should there be such an event organized, coordinated when relevent. The SLFoundation is responsible to insure travel expenses for the candidates - gas & parking creditcard for POV, discount hotel, local car/taxi service, and meal per diem, should be acceptable levels of insurance.
The candidates are notified by the invitation, and probably a description of the infraction(s) of reason, and travel allowance. Candidates are allowed to publically contest the accusations, and are not required to attend the event, unless they accept the travel allowance. At the event, the candidates are allowed to further argue their case.
Selection of the recipient, and just award, shall be determined by the SLAdministration, and is to be presented at the event by an Administrator, or an SLMember authorized by the Administration.
Non-theists are only eligible for the award, however, because theists are welcome to SLMembership, and Administrative Office, theists are also welcome to submit nominations, and presentation, of the award.
____________________________________________________________________________
The Executive Administrator of the Secular Library, Ronald Martin, is determined to nominate and personally deliver the first such award to Sam Harris for his irrational hate-mongering of Sarah Palin, his silly patronizing descriptions of Barack Obama;and failure to guide atheist culture to its betterment, as is evident by the continued irrelevancy of his ambitious websites and brilliant letters. Although, Mr. Martin is very much impressed that Mr. Harris' probably has the ability to correct his thinking to acceptable standards, Mr. Harris, is ultimately responsible with having to demonstrate such adjustments.
Humanism - ontological doctrine that posits that humans define reality
Theism - ontological doctrine that posits a supernatural entity creates and defines reality
Atheism - political doctrine opposed to theist doctrine in public policy
I am right, and you are wrong - I hope you die peacefully

RE: Secular Library Bitch Slap Awards Where is the maybe option?
Member of the Cult of Reason
The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.
