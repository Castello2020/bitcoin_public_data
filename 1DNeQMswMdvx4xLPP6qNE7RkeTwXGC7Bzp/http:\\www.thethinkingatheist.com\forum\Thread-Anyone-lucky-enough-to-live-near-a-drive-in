Anyone lucky enough to live near a drive-in? My wife and I live within 35 minutes of a drive-in movie theatre. For any of you in or near northern NJ, it is located in Warwick NY. If any of you want to go to a drive-in and have no idea if there is one nearby, check out drive-ins.com http://www.driveinmovie.com/ is another good resource. I think my wife and I will have to get there again before the end of the season.

RE: Anyone lucky enough to live near a drive-in? Having never been to such a thing, I googled to see if Singapore had one.
Not since 1985.
But there have been some free events over the last few years and the theatre was mobile.
It looks like they might be doing it again this year.
Tempting.
But I think it will be too expensive. I'll have to buy:
1 x popcorn
2 x condom
1 x car

RE: Anyone lucky enough to live near a drive-in? I have a memory of going to one as a child. Tuning into the radio frequency, walking to the popcorn session. So much fun! Then the traffic to leave. Boo! Ha ha. I'm going to see if a new one is up, the one I went to as a child hasn't existed for awhile.

RE: Anyone lucky enough to live near a drive-in? I think I still live near one. I'll have to go see if it's still up and running.

If you're ever in this part of the world, look me up and I'll take you. You'll save money on the condoms and car. I might even pay for the popcorn. Although last time I went, we brought a pizza with us. Nom.

Thanks. That is most kind of you.
Are you saying you will bring the condoms?

No, he's offering unprotected sex.
Skepticism is not a position; it is an approach to claims.
Science is not a subject, but a method.

Anyone lucky enough to live near a drive-in? I guess it depends on how good the movie is. "All that is necessary for the triumph of Calvinism is that good Atheists do nothing." ~Eric Oh My

RE: Anyone lucky enough to live near a drive-in? Aaaah yes, the old Drive-In Theatres There's plenty of memories from those days....
Getting caught trying to get in for nothing by hiding in my own boot! (with someone else at the wheel, of course)
Getting caught for smoking shit and getting booted out.
Getting booted out for making too much noise and creating havoc...
Those were the days, my friend.....
EDIT: yes, there is one about 20 minutes away which was re-opened a few years ago.
Humankind (a total misnomer)
