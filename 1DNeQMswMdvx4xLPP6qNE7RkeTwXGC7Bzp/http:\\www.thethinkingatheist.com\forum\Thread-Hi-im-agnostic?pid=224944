Not at all. My father, for instance, claims to be a gnostic theist.

well youy father may claim to be a gnostic theist but he is incorrect.. i mean to say that he might think he knows something about the existance of god but in reality he does not. he simply believes that he knows. as we all know believing is not knowing.

RE: Hi im agnostic What exactly does it mean to move from agnosticism to atheism? I'm sorry, but as an agnostic, did you believe in God?

It means you move from there being a 50/50 chance of there being a god, to a place where you no longer believe. Just like many people, myself included, have done. Shouldn't be that tough to understand. "All that is necessary for the triumph of Calvinism is that good Atheists do nothing." ~Eric Oh My
