RE: not believing in god and believing in no god Hey, Zat.
Allow me to dramatise your last post.
I don't understand. I just don't. I'm not trying to be a dick. I'm not trying to undermine anyone. I'm not feeble minded. I just don't understand. C'est la même chose si je parle en français. Probablement, vous ne comprendrez pas ce que c'est que je dis. Ce n'aide pas si je continue à parler français ou si je parle plus fort. Vous ne me comprenez pas. (It's the same thing if I speak in French. Probably, you won't understand what it is that I'm saying. It doesn't help if I continue to speak French or if I speak louder. You don't understand me.) I don't speak the French of this distinction between "I don't believe in God" and "There is no God." I'm certain it makes sense to you. But I got nuthin.
Hey, Chas.
Quote: How is "I do not believe there are any gods as there is no evidence for their existence" not an answer? Because I BEGAN by saying that I don't see a difference between that and "There is no God." So what you did is akin to defining a word by using the word. "The sky means the sky." "Fast means going fast." It doesn't help. So I asked you what I still believe is a straight forward question. And you refused to answer with anything else but the thing I said in the beginning that I didn't understand and accused me of all kinds of nonsense for having the audacity to ask it. I wasn't looking for your standard answer because your standard answer means nothing to me conceptually. I wanted to hear your answer to my question so that I might get a better understanding of what it is that you actually believe. Because I don't. And I want to. So no, you didn't answer MY question.
Peace and Love and Empathy,
Matt

The first expresses a lack of belief without asserting an external fact, the second asserts a fact.
Skepticism is not a position; it is an approach to claims.

The former requires no evidence, the latter does.

RE: not believing in god and believing in no god Ok, Chas.
I think I'm done with you for today. I don't appreciate feeling like I'm being treated like an idiot and feeling like I'm not being taken seriously.

I can't seriously believe that you can't see the difference.

That is everyone's problem with the question. 'Believe' has multiple, nuanced meanings. This is why I would not answer Ghost's multiple choice question.

RE: not believing in god and believing in no god I like to strip things down, too - especially with twisty things. I hope this helps. I don't believe ________… means: I do not have proof of something (existence of god, in this case) doubt / skeptical I believe there is not ________… means: I do have proof of something … (existence of god, in this case) certainty / absolute The blank can be filled in with evolution or god or pretzels or masturbation.... etc.,.
I think in the end, I just feel like I'm a secular person who has a skeptical eye toward any extraordinary claim, carefully examining any extraordinary evidence before jumping to conclusions. ~ Eric ~ My friend ... who figured it out.
