RE: God Created the World (no big bang) You just willy nilly say things. You don't ever say why it is supposed to be true. Why do you think god breathed the bible into sheepherders ears? Why did he then go and tell a bunch of catholics to rewrite everything? Did he make a mistake the first time?
I think my Betta fish still makes a lot more sense. Everything he does serves a purpose.

RE: God Created the World (no big bang) I'd like a logical explanation of the reason the bible mentions unicorns. We have yet to find one. What exactly is the strength of a unicorn like?

No, scientists didn't create it, we have examined the universe, found facts, formed theories, and found abundant evidence.
We have examined the Bible and found that it is man-made.
We are not the ones who make things up, or believe myths.
It saddens me to see you spouting nonsense.
Skepticism is not a position; it is an approach to claims.
Science is not a subject, but a method.

He's not debating, just pontificating, regurgitating.

Some god ya got there. Making all those shitty creatures. Shame on her.
BTW, I wanna Ambassador job too. That is a work-from-home position, right. If I go to Monster.com, are they posted there ? Do they pay better than Arby's or McDonalds's ?

You made my day, thank you But Ambassador really lacks originality, at least Egor tries to be more creative in his new thread...

Man made religion, gods, demons, holy books, and all other manner of mythic thing you can name, genius.
A single action is worth more than the words it takes to describe it.

RE: God Created the World (no big bang) So, ambassador, why do you bother with us heathens?
Are you scoring brownies with your god?
What do you expect? You didn't expect to have us say: "Oh, yes, of course Jesus loves us!". So what is the goal here?
Or does it give you an ego boost - you feel so superior in your knowledge of god versus us miserable heathens?
Wondering just what makes you tick.

RE: God Created the World (no big bang) Where is Ambassador of Muhammad?
Member of the Cult of Reason
The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.
