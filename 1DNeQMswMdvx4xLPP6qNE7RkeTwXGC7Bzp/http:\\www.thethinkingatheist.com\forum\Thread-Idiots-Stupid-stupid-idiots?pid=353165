Oh, that must be why they advocated holy war against the Communists.
National Socialism has as much to do with socialism as a butterfly does with butter. Maybe you should read a history book. Let's not be reading any books here! What were you thinking! We'd gain the insight and knowledge of many generations! . . . Except, of course for one book! Let's read that sum' bitch backwards and forward! (except you can't really do that because it's not really a book, but a collection of scrolls. But I digress! (Sorry, I was distracted for a minute . . . coveting my neighbors hot ass wife! God damn!) Oh shit! I just sinned! Damn! Well I can fix that! I'm Catholic, so, I can buy an infarction, or whatever that thing is! Why is it that some think I'm stupid, just because I don't have a fact in my head or any original ideas???? So, I'm hereby blessing all you hell bound sinners! And begging you! On gods behalf! to never read another book! All but one are evil!
Um . . . sarcasm alert!

RE: Idiots! Stupid, stupid idiots! Quote:pleasejesus: Why do you even care about Socialism, when your god is doing such a poor job? He's had many years to fix this, and has failed! He's very concerned about whether I like to suck dick or lick pussy. He seems to watch what I watch. But he never helps! Never! When my brother was murdered, he wouldn't tell me who or why. When I was wiping my mom's ass, because she was near the end of her life and couldn't do it herself, he never said "Thanks!" "I didn't have time to deal with that!'
I'm sincerely sorry that you lost the brother you loved to a tragedy. I'm sorry you had a lot of trials with your mom and I'm glad for you and thank God that you were those helping hands for her. I'm admittedly surprised that you expect some kind of thanks from God for doing what's right. My mother was very ill recently and I made some offers to help and when she thanked me, I said, "That's what I'm supposed to offer to do--I'm your son."
And yes, God is concerned with your choice of partner and spouse and all these things but because of concern and compassion for you. I'm fine telling my children, "I'll always support you but person X is not the best choice for your partner because of Y."
Thank you.

How is the US supposed to compete with the rest of the world when we have these idiots trying to keep people in the dark ages. Shit on the shores of Shanghai, when will these people just......... GO AWAY!
The hard part about this guy condemning the teaching of science is his use of contradictory terms.
Fascism /ˈfæʃɪzəm/ is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism that came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. Fascists seek to unify their nation through a totalitarian state that promotes the mass mobilization of the national community, relying on a vanguard party to initiate a revolution to organize the nation on fascist principles. Hostile to liberal democracy, socialism, and communism, fascist movements share certain common features, including the veneration of the state, a devotion to a strong leader, and an emphasis on ultranationalism and militarism. Fascism views political violence, war, and imperialism as a means to achieve national rejuvenation and asserts that stronger nations have the right to obtain land and resources by displacing weaker nations.
Socialism is an economic system characterised by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy. "Social ownership" may refer to cooperative enterprises, common ownership, state ownership, citizen ownership of equity, or any combination of these.

RE: Idiots! Stupid, stupid idiots! I am not going to stand up for socialism, here. Because I haven't studied the subject enough to make an informed comment on the discussion. But I get the impression that, when many people approach the subject of socialism, they are talking about the idea of equality and distribution of wealth. I believe that the question of "Distribution of Wealth" is a valid question. And that the poor suffer from a lack of "fair" distribution. Why do I believe that? Let's assume that we, as a global society, are separated by stupidity, laziness, lack of ambition. And that those who succeed do so, because they have superior traits, genetic advantages and that their heritage offers them no advantage! If you feel that our current idea of distribution of wealth is not unfair. Let me propose these questions:
1: If the C.E.O of McDonalds dies tonight, Will McDonald's come to a screeching halt? What about the burger flippers? If we loose those burger flippers McDonald is done! 2: Doesn't the burger flipper contribute to McDonalds success? If not, he has no value. But if he does, shouldn't he share the rewards that his efforts have contributed to the company?

I thank you for your comments and your concern. I am concerned about you as well. "I'll always support you but person X is not the best choice for your partner because of Y."
This is not a quote from the bible, right? Not that it would matter if it were. But: Didn't you just put your words in your god's mouth? Didn't you just speak for god, because, you thought he couldn't speak for himself? Couldn't I, just as easily say: "God I thank you for the hard dick that I am about to receive?"

Since you asked, "Nazi Party" = "Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei" = "National Socialist German Workers Party". My, we reached Godwin fast on this thread.
All about us the warning signs of this collapse are apparent. Communism with its method of madness is making a powerful and insidious attack upon our dismayed and shattered nation. It seeks to poison and disrupt in order to hurl us into an epoch of chaos.... This negative, destroying spirit spared nothing of all that is highest and most valuable. Beginning with the family, it has undermined the very foundations of morality and faith and scoffs at culture and business, nation and Fatherland, justice and honor. Fourteen years of Marxism have ruined Germany; one year of bolshevism would destroy her. The richest and fairest territories of the world would be turned into a smoking heap of ruins. Even the sufferings of the last decade and a half could not be compared to the misery of a Europe in the heart of which the red flag of destruction had been hoisted. The thousands of wounded, the hundreds of dead which this inner strife has already cost Germany should be a warning of the storm which would come.... - Hitler

Really! Cause god's been a real dick to me! And many others as well. Children who have been raped, People who have been murdered. People who are starving and shitting in dark corners because they don't have access to toilet facilities. Let me talk to your wife! Is she allowed to speak? or do you dominate her? Does your wife have access to social media? Tell me about your wife! Is she allowed to speak? Or do you have her under your thumb?
Just asking.

Dude! Back up, like a thousand feet! You are rambling! I know that you are here to help the lost. But you don't understand that you are the lost! Get your nose out of that terrible book (the bible) And explore some happy things! Have you ever been diagnosed as schizophrenic? Honest question. If so, are you taking your meds? I know this is an ironic question from me, because my brother is schizophrenic and DOESN'T take his meds. I am far from a psychiatrist! But your comments indicate a preoccupation with fear based thought. And they are not coherent. (You can't explain The steps to your conclusion's.) Communism, Marxism, Veganism, are all philosophies regarding how people should live. These ideas are all responsible for tragic results. That includes the idea of Democracy. Because they are all human ideas, and humans, are imperfect. So is your favorite book. If you really want to understand the failings of the bible. Do some research. Start with THIS website! Have you watched any of the videos?

RE: Idiots! Stupid, stupid idiots! Um. I think I should make a clarification, here, before people get the wrong impression. I am not gay! Just saying: If I should choose to slip a fat one in my mouth: Why do you care?
