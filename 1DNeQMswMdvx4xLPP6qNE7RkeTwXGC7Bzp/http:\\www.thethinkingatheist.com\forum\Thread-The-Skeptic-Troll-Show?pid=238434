The Skeptic "Troll" Show Apparently members of the skeptic fence show and associates, were worried that there was too much focus on dramatic sensationalist events and not on evidence based inquiry.
To address this problem they decided to run a social experiment. Creating false drama to illustrate that problem. Claiming that Darkmatter2525 did something illegal and then refused to release the information, using mainly an appeal to emotion, to form false validity.
The response from the community at large was show us the evidence! Ironic I know.
I was trolled. I also wanted the evidence, and warned them that this was and is socially irresponsible. Saying that it was a matter of time before somebody somewhere would hack their accounts, involve the police, or do something else crazy.
After that was said and done they released videos explaining their reasoning behind their "dramagate" which I take as trollgate. In the aftermath I wonder what the backlash will be like for these users. Member of the Cult of Reason

RE: The Skeptic "Troll" Show The tlr version is that everybody pretended that darkmatter2525 did something illegal to negationofp to illustrate that people are more attracted to drama then their other videos.
