RE: Favourite pictures for a laugh at religion... Member of the Cult of Reason
The atheist is a man who destroys the imaginary things which afflict the human race, and so leads men back to nature, to experience and to reason.

...therefore anything is possible with God. He's Omazing! If there is a Biblical God and Biblical Demons, then i am convinced this guy drove away both parties with his singing. Thus, am I think I am looking at the equivalent of a Black Mass,or an Excorcism....or both. I think both.
Incredible.
