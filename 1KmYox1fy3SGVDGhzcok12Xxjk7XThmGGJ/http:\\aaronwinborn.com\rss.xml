 <title>Letter to Congress</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/letter-congress</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Aaron Winborn, and I am a 46 year old father of two young girls, ages 4 and 10, who lives in Harrisburg, PA. I am also an Open Source software developer, who was diagnosed three short years ago with Amyotrophic Lateral Schlerosis, ALS, more commonly known as Lou Gehrig&#039;s Disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the famous baseball player, I face the prospect of becoming locked-in, trapped in a body which is incapable of any movement. Already, my torso, arms, and hands are completely paralyzed, and I am incapable of speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Lou Gehrig, I happen to live in an exciting time when technology has grown in leaps and bounds, offering me and other similar patients if not hope, as we are still no closer to a cure, then at least independence, from the power wheelchair that can be controlled by the patient&#039;s hands, feet, or even eyes, as the need arises, to a communication device, such as the Tobii I-15  that I am using to type this letter with my eyes alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This device, acquired mostly through Medicaid Assistance, has been virtually a life saver. It allows me to communicate with my family and friends directly, without the need for flashcards, which would have been my only option for communication a mere ten or fifteen years ago. It allows me to continue writing my blog, which is my portal to the world. It has even allowed me to continue work as a software developer. Most important, it allows me to communicate with my wife and my two young daughters as they try to deal with my ever-declining health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you read this letter, I urge you to please consider the future Americans, one every 90 minutes, who will be afflicted with this cursed disease. Imagine for a moment what it might be like to lose the ability to use your hands, your legs, and even your voice. Then imagine the indignity to have no access to a way to communicate with the world, or your loved ones, other than someone watching you blink as they point to a letter board. And yes, the human spirit is resiliant, and yes, people will make due in extraordinary circumstances, but I remind you that we are alive in the twenty-first century, and I ask you, who in this great country deserves to live with such indignities when the solution to their communication issues are at hand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will leave you with this thought: where medical science has failed the patient with ALS, technology has picked up the slack. Where medicine has failed to cure us, technology offers the cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;
Aaron Winborn&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Last Year’s Successful Charity Effort is Making a Difference</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/last-year%E2%80%99s-successful-charity-effort-making-difference</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, My name is Aaron Winborn, and I was the recipient of the Society for Venturism&#039;s charity last year, to receive a future cryonic preservation at the facilities of the Cryonics Institute for when the time comes. I&#039;m indebted to many of you for your contributions, and I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the peace of mind that this gives me. I still have an albeitedly diminished bucket list of things to do, but I don&#039;t stay up fretting over the things I&#039;m incapable of accomplishing, in large part to this assurance. I know the odds are still not in my favor, but at least I have a significantly better chance of revival than if I were buried or cremated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, This past year has been both challenging and a blessing. Challenging because of all the difficulties brought on by having to adjust to the continuing degeneration brought on by Amyotrophic Lateral Schlerosis, ALS, better known in the United States as Lou Gehrig&#039;s Disease, or Motor Neuron Disease in other parts of the world. Although I am not yet completely paralyzed, or locked in as they say, I am confined to my wheelchair, and cannot move my hands or arms. My breathing capacity is no longer measurable, and I cannot go for more than thirty seconds without mechanical ventilation before I&#039;m in distress. I am not yet on a vent with a tracheostomy, but we are considering that as the next step to prolong my life. It&#039;s a difficult decision to make, however, because of the extraordinary amount of care that I would require around the clock, not to mention the possible loss of a quality of life. It&#039;s no wonder that only about ten percent of patients choose a tracheostomy, and only fifty percent of those go on to survive another year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounds scary to think about, well yes, it is. I could go on with a report of challenges we face, including the utter loss of the ability to speak or to understand spoken language, to the loss of the ability to eat or drink, to the devastation this awful disease has wreaked on my wife and our two young daughters, but I wouldn&#039;t be able to do it justice in a few short paragraphs, especially when I want to make sure that I leave space for the good things in my life. So on with the good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I have, after a year or so of giving up reading anything not available on the Internet, have reawakened my love of literature. I&#039;ve rediscovered the ebook format, and am now devouring about two books a week. Mostly science fiction, but dotted with the occasional contemporary fiction. I&#039;m also still participating in the Drupal community, with a friend who volunteers two hours a week and a tricked up communication device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I have been largely holed up this winter, I still manage to get out every couple of months to see a movie with some friends, and it&#039;s been fun sitting at the picture window and watching the girls play in the snow. Oh, how I look forward to the warmer seasons when I&#039;ll be able to &quot;walk&quot; the neighborhood again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have been exploring new ways of communicating with my sweetie. Certainly challenging, because of my inability to use the verbal bandwidth, and because so much of her time is taken up as both my primary caregiver and being almost a single parent. On top of that, my day is so broken up and consumed with my caregiving that I find it difficult to even focus on an email that I find myself consolidating my efforts and try to cheat, by counting in my mind a quick CC in an email, or say a mention in a magazine article or a blog post as a valid form of communication. But I know in my heart that doesn&#039;t fully count, so I continue to find new ways to let her know how special she is to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am enjoying the simple things in life. I know that&#039;s a cliche, but as with all good cliches, there&#039;s an element of truth to it. From when our cat decided that my lap is warm and available for napping, to the spontaneous hugs my youngest daughter gives my leg, to watching my older daughter play computer games, to watching my wife&#039;s beautiful smile. These are the things that make up life, and I am so excited to have another day of it each morning I awaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay strong,&lt;br /&gt;
Aaron Winborn&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Pirates Aren&#039;t Afraid of the Dark</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/pirates-arent-afraid-dark</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The power went out last night, while Sabina and I were playing pirates. She wore a patch on her eye, and I had my eye closed, and we were both shouting, &quot;Arrh! I&#039;m a pirate!&quot; Ashlin helped translate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/pirates12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the lights flickered off, and Sabina started crying. Michelle picked her up (Gwen was at Lowes) and I said, &quot;Pirates aren&#039;t afraid of the dark.&quot; That was the best interaction and the first fatherly advice I&#039;ve had with her in months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m in a period of rapid decline, after a most welcome year of a relatively stable plateau. The changes are noticeable on a nearly daily basis, ranging from a bib to catch my drool, to giving up the bidet for a shower/commode chair, to struggling to find comfort in my new hospital bed, after having finally gotten comfortable sleeping in my recliner. It&#039;s been a glorious and busy year. From the Halloween parade of pirates, witches, vampires, and a princess firefighter, to a few concerts throughout the year by my daughters, to watching the entire, what, first six seasons of Mad Men with my Sweetie. I bet you can remember the days when you had to wait an entire, get this, week to watch the next episode of Friends or Mash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a nightmare the other night. I lived in a walled village that was under siege by a pin-headed giant. My father was one of the village elders, and he nominated me to go out and slay the giant. I was afraid to do this, and asked my father why he&#039;d volunteered me. &quot;Because you&#039;re the bravest person in the village,&quot; said he. But I didn&#039;t feel brave. I spent the rest of the night trying to get on with the inevitable fight, because you have to face your fears head on, even in your dreams, but I was instead assailed by some rather inane dreams, except for one with my old friend and mentor Stephen Poplin, who told me to stop worrying, that the fight wasn&#039;t scheduled for a week Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book of the week was Neptune&#039;s Brood, which takes place some seven thousand years in the future, after the fourth extinction of the human race. Spoiler Alert: This space opera by Charles Stross has as its protagonist an actuary historian, and features bat-winged insurance underwriting pirates, a shapeshifting zombie high priestess, and bitcoins! The first fiction I&#039;ve read featuring bitcoins, and it&#039;s a doozy, written by the author of such post-singularity works as Accelerondo, Singularity Sky, and Glass House. I highly recommend this sequel to Saturn&#039;s Children, and you don&#039;t have to read the other one first. But this book has only whetted my appetite for good bitcoin fiction. Please let me know of other such works out there!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Last Week&#039;s Reads</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/last-weeks-reads</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This contains spoilers for the Hunger Games trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished the Hunger Games trilogy, and was abhorred, but not surprised, by Katniss&#039; choice to hold a revenge hunger games. I wonder if Hollywood will treat that the same, or if they&#039;ll leave that part out. I&#039;m glad for Donald Sutherland&#039;s part as President Snow; I can&#039;t wait to see his portrayal of his final hours. We have a wait, though, with Hollywood&#039;s new formula to extract more money from the masses by splitting the final book of a series into two movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/PlanetSaturn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I started Greg Bear&#039;s Vitals, but wasn&#039;t able to get past the beginning. Instead, I read Charles Stross&#039; Saturn&#039;s Children, which was a riveting blend of what would happen if Heinleinesque sexbots got ahold of Asimov&#039;s three laws of robotics. And I was completely enthralled, as I imagined I would be, by the author of such forward seeking works as Accelerondo, Glass House, and Singularity Sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was Twilight, which I promised a friend I would read. It wasn&#039;t entirely bad, once the vampire part of the story began, but I&#039;m not certain I&#039;ll finish the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough about books. What I want to say is that when my health declines and I find myself gasping for breath, or in a funk because I can&#039;t scratch an itch, I always come back to thinking about how my dad would handle this horrid disease, and that gives me the fortitude to go on, because I expect that he wouldn&#039;t moan and grumble quite so much as I.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>How to Get Wealthy Beyond Your Wildest Dreams in Two Easy Steps</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/how-get-wealthy-beyond-your-wildest-dreams-two-easy-steps</link>
 <description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy a Bitcoin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Die.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;????&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profit!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/bitcoindead.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of Open Source, I&#039;m going to share with you the secret that wealthy men have been literally dying to learn since at least the age of pharaohs. How to take it all with you after you&#039;re gone. In the interest of disclosure, first let me tell you that I am, as you likely already know, fast on my way myself, having been diagnosed with ALS some nearly three years ago, which has the pleasant side effect of leaving me trapped in a body that has progressively forgotten how to move, before my diaphragms collapse entirely, leaving me in respiratory failure. And ALS could care less that I have two young daughters that I am responsible for raising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&#039;m not here today to tell you about that. I&#039;m going to lay out my two step plan to have glorious wealth, and take it with you at the end. Another disclaimer: I am not a professional financial advisor, and you can take what I offer with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, on to the nitty gritty. Step one, get a bitcoin or three. Yes, this plan depends on large part on that shadowy currency of Silk Road fame, but we&#039;re going to play it safe. Only tie up a small few of these bitcoins, for several good reasons: first, because you don&#039;t really want to risk too much wealth in some hair-brained scheme you heard about on the Internet, do you? Secondly, possibly you would like to leave a legacy? I mean, I know that like any good information, once the cat&#039;s out of the bag, there&#039;s nothing stopping someone from using it for nefarious reasons, but I would hope that you&#039;re not seriously considering taking it all with you? I expect you have kids, or plan to someday, or at least have a charity that you would like to leave a bequest to or something? I would change the title of this post, except it&#039;s too catchy, and besides, it&#039;s too damn hard to make Dasher, the Open Source eye gaze typer that I use, to back up to the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last reason that it&#039;s not a good idea to tie up too much wealth is more philosophical than anything, and understanding it requires knowing step two of my plan. You have to die. And by that, I mean you have to die in every current legal and medical definition of death, and then you have your body frozen. And you thought the bitcoin was a long shot? Well, it&#039;s nothing compared to what I have in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let&#039;s say for the sake of argument that I&#039;m right, and there is someday a technology capable of reviving the dead, assuming a proper cryopreservation. Hello, everyone&#039;s going to want to &quot;die,&quot; and let their wealth accumulate a little interest, and be revived a lot wealthier. The living will grow to resent their earnings going to the dead, and the next thing you know, stagnation or revolution, either of which could prove disastrous to our hopeful revivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we&#039;ve read the warning label, let&#039;s find out how to take this bitter pill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just realized that some of you might not actually know what a bitcoin is, so I&#039;ll briefly do it an injustice and mangle a quick explanation. At its core, a bitcoin is a string of seemingly random characters, which many geeks and libertarians have decided to give value to. It&#039;s obviously slightly more complicated than that, involving a ledger that is held in the public commons, complex equations that are solved by prospectors digging for this virtual cryptogold, and millions, billions, or potentially quintillions of wallets to store all this cash on your hard drives. But that&#039;s just the beginning; look up bitcoins on your favorite search engine if you want a more vigorous definition. For the purposes of our demonstration, we only need to know that a bitcoin is currently trading for several hundred dollars, and that the potential growth on the timescales we&#039;re imagining could exponentially rise to levels that might make today&#039;s millionaires seem like paupers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also need to understand a little bit about computer security. As in, there ain&#039;t no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#039;s say, for argument&#039;s sake, that you&#039;ve created a bitcoin wallet, and have purchased a shiny new coin to store in it. Or to be conservative, let&#039;s say you&#039;ve only bought $20 of it, since you don&#039;t have to buy a full coin to get in with the bitcoin crowd; this is part of the beauty of the system: each bitcoin can be divided to eight decimal points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just what do you do with it? Well, if you&#039;re like most people, you leave it on your laptop or smartphone and forget about it, which is fine for a small amount that you might use to buy a pizza or tip a starving blogger. But what happens when a virus hits your laptop, stealing your precious bitcoin for some Russian syndicate? Or you accidentally sit on your phone? Don&#039;t say I didn&#039;t warn you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so the first disaster can be averted by keeping your anti-virus software up to date, and by encrypting your wallet. That&#039;s jargon for use a password.The second case is admittedly more difficult to protect against.Bitcoins are irreplaceable if lost, whether by damaging the device it&#039;s stored on, by theft, or by forgetting the password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you have some fancy insurance policy, you&#039;re better off forgetting about bitcoins, right? Wrong! I&#039;m happy to report that there is a way to keep your bitcoins safe from nearly any calamity. Keep them in your brain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What? I hear you cry. Have you gone off the deep end? How do we store a currency in our brains? I&#039;m glad you asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m not going to go to the details of how to make a brain wallet. There are some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bhffb/how_to_create_and_use_an_offlineonly_wallet/&quot;&gt;good tutorials&lt;/a&gt; out there already. But, it is important that I reiterate what I said about there being no such thing as computer security. This truism extends to brain wallets. When choosing your passphrase to store it, you can forget what your grandma taught you about choosing a password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You basically have the following two choices: memorize a string of fifty random characters, or a sufficiently randomized but easy to remember passphrase with enough entropy to throw off the quantum computers of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I mean to say is that it will do no good to have a password of only eight characters, or even sixteen, for there are squatters sitting on those already, waiting to snatch up any stray bits that anyone foolish enough to use might leave. Because, there&#039;s money to be made in bitcoin, and like the wild west, there are claims and prospectors jumping those claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what kind of password are we talking about? I would suggest at least fifty characters. But don&#039;t fret, that&#039;s only ten words. And before you pack it up and leave in frustration, because who can remember even ten words, I&#039;ll pass on a few tricks. First, let&#039;s use a lyric from a well-known song. Say, Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you go and throw away your hard earned cash on a song, another word of warning: don&#039;t use any phrase from a popular song or from literature. There are criminals out there just waiting for some easy money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&#039;s okay, we&#039;re going to mix it up a little. We&#039;ll just add a change of phrase, a few random punctuation marks, and the first hundred digits of pi. That should throw them off our trail! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can&#039;t possibly remember the first hundred digits of pi! Well, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.michael-hogg.co.uk/pi.php&quot;&gt;yes, you can&lt;/a&gt;, but you don&#039;t need to. I guarantee that a future that honors bitcoin will also have search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we end up with the following memorable and uncrackable little ditty: Twinkle, twinkle, Aaron&#039;s b!tco!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;n, you are my 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679 in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that takes care of step one! I hope that it&#039;s a long, healthy time before you have to tackle step two, but if you do, there&#039;s always cryonics. And if you choose that route, don&#039;t be an idiot. It can be quite affordable to fund it with a life insurance policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, although I do have a small few bitcoins, I&#039;m not planning to take more than a couple with me on my minute a million year sleep. The bulk I intend to leave for my daughters on their twenty-first birthdays. If you want to donate towards that end, you can send your bits of bitcoin to this address: 1KmYox1fy3SGVDGhzcok12Xxjk7XThmGGJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay strong,&lt;br /&gt;
Aaron Winborn&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Happy Halloween</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/happy-halloween</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Aaarrrrh! Shiver me timbers, it&#039;s Trick or Treat night, which for the first time since we&#039;ve moved to this blooming city, falls on Halloween.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first year we moved to Harrisburg, when Ashlin was four, Halloween was on a Tuesday, I believe, and the Thursday before, we were all getting ready to go out to dinner, when the doorbell rang, and a cute princess held out a basket and said, &quot;Trick or Treat.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color me surprised, literally fifteen seconds later, and Ashlin would have missed out on Halloween. While I was still trying to figure out what was wrong with the girl&#039;s parents, I mean didn&#039;t they get the memo that Halloween was still five days away, Gwen was busy throwing on a costume on Ashlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A neighbor later filled us in about the peculiar custom in Central Pennsylvania where they celebrate Trick or Treat night on a different night than Halloween. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ostensibly this is to fool teenaged hooligans who might be interested more in tricks than in treats, because supposedly they&#039;re too confused to know which day is Roll your Neighbor&#039;s House Night, although I figured for some time that it was secretly because Jesus didn&#039;t want little devil worshipping Batmen and Hannah Montanas going door to door with their sacrilegious greetings of Happy Halloween on Halloween. It wasn&#039;t until two years later, when Ashlin compared notes with a friend at school that I learned the real reason: different neighborhoods celebrate Trick or Treat night on different nights of the week, which means seven nights of candy heaven for the ingenious kids who can score the rides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/20131031_180405.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, here it is, Thursday, and the girls are all decked out for their night to stock up on their sweet tooth fixes. Ashlin is a spooky vampire, and Sabina is a fire fighting fairy princess. Except she decided the fire fighter&#039;s hat was too hard to keep on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gwen is a witch, and I, courtesy of Diana Sheppard, am a swashbuckling pirate, complete with ship, and flying the Jolly Rogers! I was the hit of the neighborhood! Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum, aaarrrh!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Helen Keller with ALS</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/helen-keller-als</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We have an amazing group of volunteers, who help to make our lives just a little bit more tolerable in the face of the devastation caused by my having ALS. They are coordinated by a smaller group of co-captains who meet occasionally at our house. This afternoon, they met, and asked me as part of the agenda, how was I feeling. I said that I was feeling fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the lesser known facts about ALS is that it, contrary to common wisdom, does have an effect on the brain. I don&#039;t know, maybe they say that it doesn&#039;t to try to soften the blow when you&#039;ve been diagnosed with a terminal illness that will slowly rob you of the ability to move a single muscle in your body. &quot;At least his mind will be unaffected.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/Helen-Keller-Quotes-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that about 40% of ALS patients are afflicted by some cognitive disability, caused by scarring in the frontotemporal lobe. Some 10% experience such an amount of cognitive changes that they are diagnosed with a related illness called Frontotemporal Lobe Degeneration, which ends up resembling dementia. The rest of us experience more minor symptoms, which are normally not even noticed in a clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they are noticed by the families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of my particular journey with ALS, about three years ago, I experienced what I thought at the time was hearing loss. I was not surprised, because my father has always been hard of hearing. Although he attributes it to his nearly thirteen years aboard a submarine with no hearing protection, I figured that it may have had a genetic component. In any case, it had caused just enough conflict in my own home that at the same time I was going to the doctors to find out just why were my arms getting so damned weak, I was also going to an audiologist to find out why I couldn&#039;t understand what my wife was saying so frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that my hearing was fine. Other than a slight loss in upper ranges in my right ear, there was absolutely no problem with my hearing. Except for a slight, inexplicable anomaly: I was unable to understand about twenty-five percent of spoken words. They tried me on hearing aids for a couple of months, but they simply became earwax collectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my diagnosis of ALS, my hearing continued to deteriorate, so back to the audiologist I went. Yet again, my hearing was nearly perfect. Only this time, I was unable to understand fully seventy-five percent of words. According to my wife, this ensued in some hilarity, as the doctor said some things like truck, ice cream, and ball, and I would repeat ridiculous answers such as onions, avocado, and hot dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Gwen did some research and learned about the potential cognitive losses attributable to ALS. At the top of the list was Receptive Aphasia, which includes the loss of the ability to understand spoken language. My neurologist said that hearing loss is not, no, he said that it is &quot;unequivocally not related to ALS.&quot; An assistant of his later admitted that yes, indeed, they have occasionally found patients exhibiting symptoms similar to mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have adjusted as well as could be expected, given the circumstances. Although it stinks, I have learned that I can sometimes read lips. And the Regal Cinemas have also come to my rescue, offering glasses that project subtitles on the lenses of all their movies. If only life came with subtitles…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the story doesn&#039;t end there. Starting sometime this spring, I learned about another manifestation of my flavor of the curse of Lou Gehrig. For no discernable reason, my eyes shut about ten times an hour, and I am incapable of opening them again of my own volition. My neurologist doesn&#039;t know if this is muscular or cognitive. As with the other symptom, this is another rare outcome. About ten percent of patients lose the ability to move their eyes. Although at least he admits that this might be caused by ALS. He told me of a patient who is unable to close his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a long story short, I find myself often trapped in a dark world, filled with mumbling and white noise, as my brain recoils at the sensory deprivation. I found myself at the co-captains&#039; meeting this afternoon, surrounded, blind, by a group of Charlie Brown&#039;s teachers, when I was asked how I was feeling. Because it&#039;s so difficult to speak, thank you Lou, I lied and said I was fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&#039;m not feeling fine. I feel sad, and frustrated, and angry, that I am locked out of the world of verbal communication. That I am frequently forbidden from even being a spectator to my life, when my eyes shut unbidden, without an attendant at arm&#039;s reach to pry them open. I feel like Helen Keller, but without the benefit of not knowing the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Dealing with Spasticity</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/dealing-spasticity</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, here is my experience with and some solutions to the problem of spasticity, more commonly known as muscle cramping or charlie horses. Other than frozen shoulder syndrome and the recovery from various surgeries, this can be one of the few, albeit annoying, sources of pain suffered by ALS patients. If, like me, you&#039;re left in the dark by your neurologist, until it gets to the point where you need medical intervention, fear not, for there are some tricks you can use to make it bearable, or even pain free.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>I&#039;m part of the Keynote at Drupal Camp NYC 13</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/im-part-keynote-drupal-camp-nyc-13</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been invited to the wonderful opportunity to come speak as part of the keynote address for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nyccamp.org/&quot;&gt;Drupal Camp NYC 13&lt;/a&gt; this weekend. You should come too, at least if you&#039;re in New York, and you have an interest in Drupal, or just want a chance to watch me make a fool out of myself on stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/logo-drupal-camp-nyc-eyes.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been invited, presumably, because of my work with the Media project of Drupal. Although I would question their choice, as my work would not have been possible without the work of the giants on whose shoulders I stand, not to mention the work of countless other developers who have and continue to contribute to making the Media project as awesome as it is. I am, as the saying goes, but a drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But regardless of my thoughts on the matter, I&#039;m the person they&#039;ve chosen to come chew your ears for ten minutes on Saturday, July 13, in the evening, following Larry Garfield, one of those giants I mentioned. So please, come to Drupal Camp NYC 13, to experience what it means to be part of the Drupal community, to learn from some of the giants in some of the many offerings available in the sessions over the weekend, to help make history in one of the sprints following the camp, or just to hear an old fool pontificate because the organizers didn&#039;t know what they were getting themselves into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I&#039;ve been told that 100% of the proceeds from the camp after expenses will be donated to the Special Needs Trust that has been set up for my family and me, because of my ongoing struggles with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, otherwise known as ALS or Lou Gehrig&#039;s Disease. Just one more reason you need to be there. Plus, you&#039;ll get to hear me do my Stephen Hawking impersonation with the speech assist device I&#039;ll be using. Now if only they could make a speech-writing assist device...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Reddit AMA about ALS and Assistive Technology</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/reddit-ama-about-als-and-assistive-technology</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;ONLINE RIGHT NOW ON REDDIT: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1glbmg/iama_chief_assistive_technologist_for_the_als/&quot; title=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1glbmg/iama_chief_assistive_technologist_for_the_als/&quot;&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1glbmg/iama_chief_assistive_techno...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, June 18, at one o&#039;clock EDT, I will be on a panel for an Ask Me Anything (AMA) on Reddit - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/&quot; title=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/&quot;&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/&lt;/a&gt; - The topic will be ALS and Assistive Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why should you attend?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it&#039;s only an hour or so, and it&#039;ll look better if more than one or two people show up. Besides, it&#039;ll be a great opportunity to spend your lunch hour with me. Being online simply makes it that more simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, if you have any pressing questions, such as how do you manage to write awesome modules for Drupal when your hands are completely useless, then this is your opportunity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My qualifications: I was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig&#039;s Disease about two years ago, just before my newborn&#039;s first birthday. At first, my arms and hands were weak, so I purchased a magic touch pad and keyboard for the mac. By September, I needed to supplement this with Dragon Dictate (Naturally Speaking on the PC). This combination served me well until last year, when my hands became too weak to control the touch pad, so I began looking at eye gaze solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/404188_10150564127580423_810852970_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first iteration was a custom built eye gaze tracking system built by my father, from an open source concept over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eyewriter.org/&quot; title=&quot;http://www.eyewriter.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.eyewriter.org/&lt;/a&gt; . It was cumbersome and difficult to calibrate, however, so beyond a couple of proof of concept demonstrations, I didn&#039;t really use that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then about July I got a head tracking piece of software for the Mac, which served me well for a few months. However, it was doomed from the start, as my neck strength was already failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in September of last year, I finally got a Tobii PCEye, and used it to control the mouse, while I continued to use Dragon to dictate code and emails to the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this January, my voice had degraded to such an extent that I gave up struggling to keep training and retraining Dragon, and now use the Tobii, in combination with Dasher, an open source word predictor for use with eye gaze systems, to control all aspects of the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m planning to get a stand alone Tobii system next month, which will allow me to speak when I have lost that ability entirely, using my own voice banked with Model Talker, and have also begun a trial using a brain computer interface (BCI) for the possible loss of eye movement in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the best thing I have done during the course of this debilitating illness has been to try to stay one step ahead, by training myself to use the next bit of software or hardware before I actually need it. I believe that where medicine has completely failed patients with ALS, technology has taken up the banner, and offers the only hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So join me Tuesday at 1:00 for an AMA on Reddit, to have a chance to chat with me live. I&#039;ll post the URL here and on Twitter: &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/aaronwinborn&quot; title=&quot;http://twitter.com/aaronwinborn&quot;&gt;http://twitter.com/aaronwinborn&lt;/a&gt; soon before the session starts.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Monday was my 46th birthday and likely my last. Anything awesome I should try after I die?</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/monday-was-my-46th-birthday-and-likely-my-last-anything-awesome-i-should-try-after-i-die</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;First, some background. My name is Aaron Winborn, and I am a developer for Drupal, which is an open source content management system, used to make web sites. I also the father of two young girls, who bring much joy into my life, and married to a beautiful woman. You may have heard of her, her name is Wonder Woman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/sXsmTXYHjxA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just over two years ago, I was diagnosed with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig&#039;s Disease. In short, that means that my mind will increasingly become trapped in my body as the motor neurons continue to die, and the muscles atrophy and waste away, until my diaphragm dies, bringing me with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hands and arms are already completely paralyzed, and I&#039;m confined to a power wheelchair. My diaphragm strength is largely diminished, and I am using breathing assistance 24/7, and I am at imminent risk for respiratory failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if I am fortunate enough to survive another year, which is only likely if I opt for a tracheostomy, my chances of surviving much longer become increasingly unlikely, as pneumonia becomes a specter haunting the late stages of ALS. There is no cure for this awful disease. My family gets to take care of all my needs and wipe the drool off my face, until I die, and leave them to pick up the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yes, there is a silver lining to this all, such as it is. Kim Suozzi made a similar plea to the Internet a year ago today, and came up with the brilliant idea of freezing her body in the hopes of a distant advanced technology being able to revive her someday. Her body now rests at liquid nitrogen temperatures. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uvaqe/today_is_my_23rd_birthday_and_probably_my_last/&quot; title=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uvaqe/today_is_my_23rd_birthday_and_probably_my_last/&quot;&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uvaqe/today_is_my_23rd_birthd...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I approached the organization responsible for raising the funds to help her out, the Society for Venturism, last November, and they agreed to take on my case as well. &lt;a href=&quot;http://venturist.info/aaron-winborn-charity.html&quot; title=&quot;http://venturist.info/aaron-winborn-charity.html&quot;&gt;http://venturist.info/aaron-winborn-charity.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I am actually telling you all this in order to come up with a sort of reverse bucket list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve had a full life, with no regrets. I&#039;ve done some travel, have lived in some cool places, like the Netherlands and London. I&#039;ve made lots of good friends, and continue to do so. I&#039;ve contributed to my debt to society, working hard throughout my life, as a teacher, a waiter, an open source software developer. I&#039;ve worked with a few interesting characters, like Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, and even lived in a Buddhist monastery before I met the woman of my dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&#039;m not ready to hang up my jacket quite yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was ten, I came up with three things that I wanted to be when I grew up: a teacher, a writer, and an astronaut. I&#039;ve been two of the things, which is not bad. As an aside, I once told that to some people, and was asked, &quot;Oh, what did you write?&quot; To which I replied, &quot;I didn&#039;t say I&#039;ve written anything.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joking aside, I&#039;m looking for some grandiose ideas of things to do after I&#039;ve died, and have hopefully been revived. And by that, I mean the sky&#039;s the limit. Don&#039;t worry about whether something seems technically feasible. This is your opportunity to think big. Like, go skinny dipping in the methane oceans of Neptune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to do so much more with my life, but it&#039;s not in the cards this go around. I&#039;ve become a spectator in life, living vicariously through my daughters, and relegated to typing with my eyes at fifteen words per minute on a good day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&#039;m not complaining. I awaken each morning as I always have, excited to take on the day. This is just a way to do some more brainstorming, to come up with a list of things to do during the next century, should we be so fortunate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay strong,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS This question was originally banned from the Internet at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1g7h69/anything_awesome_i_should_try_after_i_die/&quot; title=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1g7h69/anything_awesome_i_should_try_after_i_die/&quot;&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1g7h69/anything_awesome_i_sho...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>I&#039;m making a virtual appearance in Portland</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/im-making-virtual-appearance-portland</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;I want to thank the good folks at ThinkShout and ZivTech for organizing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pdxdrupaldogooders.eventbrite.com/&quot;&gt;Drupal DoGooders Happy Hour&lt;/a&gt; to benefit my family and me, as well as giving people attending DrupalCon an opportunity to hang out and have some drinks. Even though I will not be in Portland this week, I plan to be present in spirit, beginning with a virtual appearance there. Join the crew this evening (May 20) at about 4:00 PDT to raise a glass in toast of doing Drupal Good and for a quick Q &amp;amp; A with me beginning about 4:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a long strange trip it&#039;s been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Sunnyvale in 2007 when I conceived the Embedded Media Field module, to Boston DrupalCon in 2008, where I presented my first State of the Media session, to DC in 2009 where we launched the Media sprint supporting the Media suite of modules, to Chicago 2011 and Denver 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the fun times that I recall fondly, doing good with my fellow cohorts. And by doing good, I mean really doing good things. Because where else in the business world can you spontaneously form a group of competitors, build something awesome, and give it freely to the rest of the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m really going to miss that this year. I mean that even though I continue to contribute to Drupal whatever and whenever I can, I am going to miss seeing you guys this year. There is a magic that happens when you get three or more Drupalers together in the same room. But circumstance has had its way with me these past two years and until we have a DrupalCon &quot;Three Mile Island&quot;, I will have to be content with a virtual appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, join me on Monday evening to see my Stephen Hawking impersonation.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Wake Up Winborn</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I just got an amazing email from AaronElBorg, a fellow Drupaler, father, and proponent of cryonics, who is also in the Seattle-based band, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/GloseSeattle&quot;&gt;Glose&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AaronElBorg has placed a geas on me to remember that there is to be a song written in my honor called Wake Up Winborn, and in the ultimate treasure hunt, to look for it after my passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now how cool is that? What an honor, to have a warrior&#039;s anthem written after your passing? With the challenge to find it afterwards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some may call it a fool&#039;s errand, and perhaps I am the fool, but I prefer the Tarot&#039;s version of the Fool, with one foot perched precariously off a ledge, ready for a journey of epic proportions, a dog nipping at his heels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/220px-RWS_Tarot_00_Fool.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, you&#039;ll most likely get to hear it before me. Eventually, I hope to be able to sit down with AaronElBorg and have a beer while we listen to the song, but a lot will need to happen before then. First, we&#039;ll need to sufficiently conquer or at least stave off physical death. For me to be able to take advantage of that will also require that we have found a way to reverse death, to the extent that we can repair any damage from the freezing process involved in my planned cryonic preservation. And we&#039;ll also need to have kicked the crap out of ALS. Alternatively, found a way to upload our consciousness to a computer or robot or some other containing form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tall order to say the least. But even before I can have the chance of partaking of this hypothetical revolution of medicine, we must raise the funds to freeze my body. That&#039;s where you come in. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. And even though I can barely take a single step, I am doing my best to walk that long journey, but I need your help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please help-- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/61124-appeal-for-als-sufferer-aaron-winborn/#entry577814&quot;&gt;your donation will be doubled with the matching grant posted by Longecity of a thousand dollars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, and Rock On!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Eight-Hundred Year Old Man</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/eight-hundred-year-old-man</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was hanging out with my good friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://stwaz.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Kevin Strawser&lt;/a&gt; the other night, and we got to talking about the recent news of the scientists at the University of Southern California who claim to have identified a way to allow humans to &lt;a href=&quot;http://io9.com/345728/geneticists-discover-a-way-to-extend-lifespans-to-800-years&quot;&gt;live for eight-hundred years&lt;/a&gt; or more. I&#039;ll just pause a moment to let you consider the vast implications of that finding, and we&#039;ll get back to that in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, though. What do you mean, eight-hundred years? How do they intend to do that? What does that even mean, I have no frame of reference. Over my cold, dead body. And can I have fries with that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are some of the questions I hear rattling around out there, and I&#039;ll try to answer them in turn. The first question, the how, is a bit tricky to understand, and boils down to an arcane bit of genetic tomfoolery with some yeast. And before you shrug the whole thing off scoffing at that, just remember that there&#039;s not much difference between you and yeast at the DNA level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that there are two genes hidden in the yeast that are common to all animals, and that includes you and me, folks, that are the lynchpin to the whole shebang: the first controls aging and the second bestows a susceptibility to cancer. It appears that with yeast that if you knock out those two genes, you increase their lifespan ten-fold. The really exciting thing is that in theory, we should see similar results after punching out the genes from fruit flies, mice, baboons, or any other laboratory animal, such as humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/Rat-in-Maze-by-Melissa-Baldwin.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really exciting stuff, folks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so what does this all mean? If you can live for eight-hundred years, what will that do to the job market?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#039;s an excellent question. Thanks for asking. I mentioned this whole thing to the aide who comes in the mornings to feed me, and her response was, &quot;I hope they give me more hours in eight-hundred years.&quot; And that is a powerful reason that I can see being an argument against longevity at these scales. It&#039;s hard enough to live in abject poverty doing menial labor for eighty years, but when confronted with the prospect of increasing that tenfold, I think we&#039;ll see a rash of suicides, or at least a refusal to take the blue pill, which will arguably be the same thing in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also said that she was pretty certain that the technology would only be available to the rich and famous. I easily refuted that notion. Yes, perhaps initially after whatever hoops the drug manufacturer will have to jump through to get FDA approval, and any concerns of animal cruelty (I mean, as bad as you might think flipping burgers for eight-hundred years might be, imagine that long as a laboratory rat) they might get away with charging a hundred thousand a pop. But I guarantee you that once they wise up and realize the vast scale of economy at play here, as in a market demographic of in the neighborhood of oh, freaking everyone, you will be able to get your injection of gene therapy at your local CVS for $2.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/04-ellis-nadler--the-beard--2010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming China doesn&#039;t pounce on the opportunity first, and I&#039;m rooting for some healthy competition in this arena, I suspect that we&#039;ll see this thing hit the grocery stores in about twelve years. And I expect that it will sneak up on you like your nine-year-old daughter&#039;s Dick Tracy iPod that&#039;s capable of video conferencing, texting, and phone calls, all without a plan. And even if you opt out, you&#039;ll have to do so knowing that she is opting in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, as excited as I am for this upcoming and inevitable potion of immortality, I am sitting here writing about it all with my eyes, trapped in this body with the life expectancy of a laboratory fruit fly. I used to think that I was born at just the right time in history to witness the end of senescence, but history is yet to have the last laugh. Even if this magic amulet of longevity were available tomorrow, it would be entirely useless to a patient of that harsh mistress, ALS, which accepts no quarter and offers no mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me, finally, to the silver lining to all this. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://venturist.info/aaron-winborn-charity.html&quot;&gt;Society for Venturism&lt;/a&gt; has chosen me as the recipient of its charity for this year, to hopefully offer me cryonic preservation when the time comes. And this month, Longecity, an excellent forum for the discussion of issues related to extending the lifespan of humans, has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/61124-appeal-for-als-sufferer-aaron-winborn/#entry577814&quot;&gt;offered up a matching grant of up to a thousand dollars&lt;/a&gt; to help out! So &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.longecity.org/forum/donate/goal-11-cryonicscharity/&quot;&gt;help out&lt;/a&gt;! Please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hang on to your Bitcoins, we&#039;re in for a long and bumpy ride. And did I mention long?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Letter to a Patient Recently Diagnosed with ALS</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/letter-patient-recently-diagnosed-als</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the stupid club. So you&#039;re at what, a month now? That sucks, my heart goes out to you and your family. I imagine the shock is over now, and you&#039;re probably slowly moving towards an acceptance. The first thing I want to say is that your neurologist doesn&#039;t know crap. Oh, he or she probably knows a lot about the mechanics of your disease, but what I mean is that they don&#039;t know diddly about anything important, from even what caused your neurons to begin to die off. Let alone have the first idea of what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that you are in charge of your treatment. And even though there is not much that can be done medically for you, there is some that can be done. Rilutek, yes, since you&#039;re bulbar onset. But also, technology holds the only real hope for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to use Dragon Dictate to control my computer, but now I have switched to an eye gaze tracker exclusively. If I become one of the lucky ten percent to lose control of his eyes, there&#039;s brain computer interface, still fledgling but very quickly improving. More importantly, there&#039;s the Bipap, which I depend on now to keep my breathing going. And soon, I&#039;ll need to have a tracheostomy if I want to go on with this sweet life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/Sumatran_Tiger.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tiger&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these are easy to learn about, and even though your doctor doesn&#039;t know jack, this is something they can actually do. It&#039;s the little things, though, that you&#039;ll need to learn about. The things that your neurologist will probably skip telling you about, or tell you about as an afterthought. And it&#039;s because your neurologist doesn&#039;t have ALS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like you&#039;ll want to get a bidet as soon as possible. This little device offers me the last bit of privacy and shred of decency. Or the sleeping situation, which you will need to adjust to and experiment with constantly. You&#039;ll need to discover for yourself if the bed will work for you, or if you&#039;ll need to sleep in a recliner, or even your wheelchair. And be forewarned, the most difficult part of this illness, for me at least, is your ability to get a good night&#039;s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&#039;t begun to do justice to what you&#039;ll need to learn. There&#039;s so much more, like make sure that you get your arms stretched daily, and don&#039;t forget your wrists and fingers, if you don&#039;t want to end up with claws at the end of your arms. And get a Vitamix to make green smoothies, and don&#039;t let them tell you that the cans of so-called food they will inevitably shove down your feeding tube are adequate nutrition. That crap is nothing more than corn syrup and multi-vitamins, and fifteen dollars a can, nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am so sorry that you have been diagnosed with ALS. I wish it were in my power to reverse that terrible death sentence. No, it&#039;s worse than that. It&#039;s a punishment where you get to slowly watch your body dissolve, as you are forced against your will to become a spectator in life, as the people around you can only watch helplessly as the man they know and love becomes trapped in a hollow shell of a body, and they can only wipe your drool and help dress you like a rag doll, knowing that at the end, which is approaching far too quickly, they&#039;ll have nothing left to wipe than their own tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&#039;s not all bad, before I drive you to think there&#039;s nothing left to live for. To the contrary, as difficult as my life has become, it&#039;s nothing compared to my wife&#039;s, Gwen. Or should I say Wonder Woman. She not only has to grieve the little losses every day, and try to pick up the pieces as quickly as they fall, she has to take care of our two young children and me, and take care of the bureaucratic tangle of health insurance and Medicaid, and deal with countless phone calls, as I am no longer able to speak on the phone. And she bears the brunt of my restless nights, unable to even nap during her hectic afternoons. And that is all on top of her full time job and night school as she pursues her Masters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/Common_Lime_Butterfly_Papilio_demoleus_by_Kadavoor.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Butterfly&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, there are lots of little joys in life that fill me up. I relish the time I get with my wife and daughters. Even though it is, by virtue of my physical limitations, as a spectator, these little moments are priceless. Although it comes with a corresponding and utter loss of privacy, I enjoy the company of my nurses, volunteers, and other visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the retirement is not all that bad. Although it&#039;s not at all what I imagined, and it&#039;s been thrust on me twenty years too soon, and I&#039;ve had to make hasty adjustments to my bucket list, there are still good things about life. I still wake up excited about the day, and have a growing list, albeit limited, of projects I want to complete. Like books to write and programs to code on the computer, and even drawings to paint with my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that my life stands testimony to the resilience of the human spirit, which cannot be killed, even when the mind is trapped in a body unable to lift a single finger in protest. And that even in a world that at times seems harsh and uncaring, that that same spirit grows ever stronger, vigilant against the injustices in the world, ever watchful for the joys it can bring to its fellow man, ever hungry for the simple pleasures to be found in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will conclude with the story I learned in my sojourn in a monastery about a decade ago, of a monk who was being chased by bandits wielding swords intent on killing the monk. They chased him right off a cliff, and he caught onto a branch. The monk looked up, and saw the bandits above him, brandishing their swords and shouting curses at him. He looked below at a ledge beneath, on which paced seven hungry tigers, growling as they waited for the inevitable fall of the hapless monk. And then he looked at the branch to which he clung, and he saw a butterfly. &quot;How beautiful,&quot; he said to himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay strong,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron Winborn&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Tribute to Rick Potvin&#039;s Cryonics Commentary</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/tribute-rick-potvins-cryonics-commentary</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/letter-writing-campaign#comment-3702&quot;&gt;outed by&lt;/a&gt; the sleuths over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://cryonicscafeteria.blogspot.com/2013/02/aaron-winborn-cryonics-charity-case-has.html&quot;&gt;Rick Potvin&#039;s Cryonics Commentary&lt;/a&gt;.

 <title>Persistence of Memory</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/persistence-memory</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I begin writing this, let me start by saying that I have officially given up wrestling with Dragon over control of my computer. Nuance has made an excellent piece of software, and I have no complaints, as it has served me well over the past year and a half. It&#039;s just that my voice has degraded to the extent, thanks, Lou Gehrig, that the computer no longer recognizes what I say with any reasonable accuracy. So how are you typing this, I hear you wondering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m glad you asked. World, meet Dasher, the marvel of the twenty-first century. Dasher is an Open Source piece of software that works in conjunction with my eye gaze tracker to allow words to fly across the screen. I&#039;m up to about twenty words a minute, with improvement every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My very first memory in life is when I rode on the back of a sidewalk chalk giraffe. I&#039;m sure you didn&#039;t see that coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it&#039;s true. It happened when I was almost three. March 11, 1970, to be exact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was dark, I remember. The giraffe was friendly, of course, though you would have already guessed that much, for what other sort of sidewalk chalk giraffe would allow a toddler on its back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/Giraffe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sidewalk chalk giraffe&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(This image was created by myself with my eyes only, in case you&#039;re wondering.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The giraffe had spots all over its neck, messy yellow and pastel purple spots, just like you would expect. Big round circles, drawn roughly, the sort that typically sport the back of a giraffe of that rare species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hold the memory dear, and when they make the movie of my life, I hope they get it right and animate this wild boy riding the sidewalk chalk giraffe of his dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oops, I gave it away, didn&#039;t I? About the dream, that is. And without a spoiler alert, even. Sorry about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of that memory becomes a little hazy to me. I do remember the shock of light flooding the playhouse, moments before being lifted rudely without my consent and taken outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the part where I cannot completely trust my memory, because I first of all remember the rest of this in black and white, and correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but I&#039;m pretty sure that color had been invented well before 1970.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second of all, although I remember my father telling me that there was someone he wanted me to meet, as he carried me out of the playhouse and away from my sidewalk chalk companion, the memory clearly shows my father standing a bit away, opening the door of a strange car, maybe a taxi, and with a red beard and his sailor&#039;s uniform, dashing, but, I hear you complain, how could you know his beard was red if the world was black and white? Bear with me, this is the way that ancient memories of childhood persist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, I remember quite clearly that my father was still holding me as he opened said car door. What, you ask, dear observant and slightly skeptical reader? Are you implying an out of body experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make no such claims. In fact, I make no judgements of value to this memory. I simply accept it as it comes flying across the decades to this man, sitting in his wheelchair and reminiscing on that far away time, when he could still walk, could still grasp tightly to his father, and had fanciful dreams of being a zookeeper or a sidewalk  chalk artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now if you&#039;ll forgive me, it&#039;s time I take a brief rest, for I&#039;ve just learned that Dasher interprets my tears as an indication to cause the letters to cascade in a mixed up clutter of word salad at the bottom of the screen, and I am unable to wipe my eyes without assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, I hear you cry. You can&#039;t leave us hanging. We don&#039;t know who your father wanted you to meet? And please, tell us more about that giraffe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, since you ask so nicely, gentle reader. After all, the cliffhanger is but a cheap literary trick whose sole purpose is to sell the sequel, and besides not wanting to be seen as cheap, I&#039;m not interested in causing undue stress. So let me wrap this up, and in a tidy package with a bow, nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it might have occurred already to you, astute and forgiving reader, that the person my father wanted me to meet may have been a new addition to the family, such as a younger sibling or a puppy or a visiting aunt. And right you are, there&#039;s no pulling the wool over your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the next part of my fuzzy memory is just that, although you have to remember that even though this memory is brought to you by a forty-five year old man, comfortable in his cliches, it comes from a very, very young child, in fact about the age of his youngest daughter, who should be getting home from daycare in a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father, still holding me from my distant vantage point, if you will recall, opened the door to the cab, an old black and white, if my memory serves me, and my mother, strangely skinnier than the day before, stepped out, holding this tiny, tiny baby. And I remember my dad saying, &quot;Aaron, Meet your new baby brother.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we all know how memory works, and we know that some memories are better than others, and that some memories shift and turn in our recollections, transmuting into weird shapes as we try to reclaim them from the hallowed shores of youthdom. And some interlopers, fancy doppelgangers come unbidden in the night to place themselves in our minds, are not even ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But regardless of the glaring inconsistencies and window dressings enshrouding this treasured memory of mine, two things have stood the test of time, entrenched in the clarity of hundreds of late night meandering recollections. The first, as I have already relayed, is that as impossible as it sounds, I clutched that sidewalk chalk giraffe&#039;s neck tight and rode it through some lazy afternoon nap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And next, and this is probably the reason the memory has even bothered to persist across the decades is this: the thing that stands out most to me is a vague feeling of annoyance that they dragged me away from my adventure with that sidewalk chalk giraffe for this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there you have it, dear and gallant reader, the defining oldest memory of mine, this sanctuary that bears me through difficult, long nights, this persistence of memory.&lt;/p&gt;

 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/password-algorithms-what-do-when-youve-been-hacked</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night, I was sent an email from a friend whose email was hacked. I am seeing a lot of that in the past year or 2, so I thought I would share my response to help  train folks into better password habits. And seriously, I think that it would be a good practice to install the &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/password_policy&quot;&gt;Password policy&lt;/a&gt; module on all your Drupal sites, to help   enforce better habits for everyone. That module can be configured to force passwords similar to what I described here, and much more, such as requiring that passwords be periodically changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/password.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image CC-BySA from http://gawdoflolz.deviantart.com/art/My-password-322798011&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear (Friend),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got those emails, it does look like it&#039;s possible that your email was hacked. You did the right thing, by changing your password. However, we need to do a few other things to try to minimize the damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1st, it is entirely possible, in fact probable, that they did not actually hack your computer. Identity theft  is rampant,  and in this interconnected world, does not even require any access to your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, it is still possible that your computer has a virus. That would be the 1st thing to check. If you have an antivirus program, you need to ensure that it has been updated. That may require a fee, if you are using a paid antivirus program subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not have an antivirus program, I would highly suggest Avast, which I have been using for years. You can safely use the free version of it, as it is not crippled in any way from the paid version. You can find it at &lt;a href=&quot;http://avast.com&quot; title=&quot;http://avast.com&quot;&gt;http://avast.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After, and only after you have scanned your computer for viruses, then you can get on with the business of securing your accounts against identity theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to change your email password yet again, I am sorry to say. Additionally,  you will want to change the security questions, which I believe that Yahoo will ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treat the security questions as passwords in themselves, as  these are most commonly used to hack in to  an email account. That means that you  should not use anything resembling what they actually ask for, such as your mother&#039;s maiden name or your 1st dog. That can be  discovered with Google these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, a word about passwords. As you may have heard by now, you need to have a password that cannot be guessed. Unfortunately, that is not enough. You also need to have a mix of cases, at least one number, and a special character, such as a punctuation mark. Additionally, you need to have a different password  for every account that you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot stress that last paragraph enough. It is too easy for a hacker to get  into, say  an account with  a  forum, and use that to get  into your Wells Fargo account. For instance, to use myself as an example, about 6 years ago, I accidentally broadcasted my password  into a chat room, and about 2 weeks later, I got an email from a  woman wondering where her Gucci bag was that she had purchased from my eBay account. It turns out that someone  in Russia had hacked  into my eBay account and listed about 100 fake Gucci bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that this sounds daunting, but it is necessary. Fortunately, you can use what is called an  algorithm to remember your dozens of  new passwords that you&#039;ll need to create. You can use that to create a new password for any site, and you will always remember it. Additionally, it will be secure for all intents and purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, you will choose a passphrase, modify and, and apply it to  any site. For example, and please do not use this example, let say you choose &quot;apple&quot; as your passphrase. We will modify that to have a punctuation mark and a number, so that it will be &quot;@pp1E&quot;. Then you would append that to the 1st 4 characters of whatever site that you are creating an account for.  For instance, for eBay, your password would be &quot;ebay@pp1E&quot;, and your Hotmail account would be &quot;hotm@pp1E&quot;. This will make your passwords  immune to so-called dictionary attacks, where they try to figure out your password by   entering random words from the dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much easier to remember, right?  And for your financial accounts, I would suggest creating yet another algorithm, as an extra layer of protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can apply this same idea to those security questions that you see everywhere. Basically, you do not want to actually use a real answer, because it is far too easy for a determined hacker to read about that experience in your 1st car that you posted in Facebook. Instead, treat them with the same respect as your passwords. For instance, you might create an algorithm with your grandmother&#039;s cat&#039;s  name that you apply to a site&#039;s question for referring to your own pet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have done this, you should be fairly safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a postscript, and not to deflect responsibility, it is entirely possible  that your email was not the one hacked.  It may have been a more intelligent hack,  where someone hacked into someone else&#039;s Facebook account, for example. From there, they may have  grabbed the contacts and spoofed  an email from it, sending spam  and making it look like it came from yours. This is a more insidious form of identity theft that is becoming more common. Still, the best defense is to  secure your passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Open Source Software Developer with Terminal Illness Hopes to Opt Out of Death</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/open-source-software-developer-terminal-illness-hopes-opt-out-death</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;TLDR: &lt;a href=&quot;http://venturist.info/aaron-winborn-charity.html&quot; title=&quot;http://venturist.info/aaron-winborn-charity.html&quot;&gt;http://venturist.info/aaron-winborn-charity.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe you&#039;ve heard about my plight, in which I wrestle Lou Gehrig in this losing battle to stay alive. And I use the phrase &quot;staying alive&quot; loosely, as many would shudder at the thought of becoming locked in with &lt;a href=&quot;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Gehrig&#039;s_disease&quot;&gt;ALS&lt;/a&gt;, completely paralyzed, unable to move a muscle other than your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&#039;s only half the story. Wait for the punchline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if the physical challenges of adapting to new and increasingly debilitating disabilities were not enough, my wife and two young daughters are forced to watch helplessly as the man they knew loses the ability to lift a fork or scratch an itch, who just two years ago was able to lift his infant daughter and run with the 7-year-old. The emotional strain on my family is more than any family should have to bear. Not to mention the financial difficulties, which include big purchases such as a wheelchair van and home modifications, and ultimately round the clock nursing care, all of it exacerbated by the fact that we have had to give up my income both because of the illness and to qualify for disability and Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/before-rollerskating.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet me, Aaron Winborn, software developer and author of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.packtpub.com/create-multimedia-website-with-drupal/book?mid=230609ykjxg1&quot;&gt;Drupal Multimedia&lt;/a&gt;, champion of the open source software movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago, I worked for the lady of death herself, Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, the author of On Death and Dying. Of course, I knew that one day I would need to confront death, but like most people, I assumed it would be when I was old, not in the prime of my life. Not that I&#039;m complaining; I have lived a full life, from living in a Buddhist monastery to living overseas, from marrying the woman of my dreams to having two wonderful daughters, from teaching in a radical school to building websites for progressive organizations, from running a flight simulator for the US Navy to working as a puppeteer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I accept the fact of my inevitable death. But accepting death does not, I believe, mean simply rolling over and letting that old dog bite you. Regardless of the prevalent mindset in society that says that people die and so should you, get over it, I believe that the reality we experience of people living only to a few decades is about to be turned upside down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray Kurzweil spells out a coming technological singularity, in which accelerating technologies reach a critical mass and we reach a post-human world.  He boldly predicts this will happen by the year 2045. I figured that if I could make it to 2035, my late 60s, that I would be able to take advantage of whatever medical advances were available and ride the wave to a radically extended lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALS dictates otherwise. 50% of everyone diagnosed will die within 2 to 3 years of the onset of the disease. 80% will be gone in 5 years. And only 10% go on to survive a decade, most of them locked in, paralyzed completely, similar to Stephen Hawking. Sadly, my scores put me on the fast track of the 50%, and I am coming up quickly on 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter Kim Suozzi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 10 of last year, her birthday, which is coincidentally  my own, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/22/kim-suozzi-cryogenicallly-preserved-cancer_n_2526415.html&quot;&gt;Kim Suozzi&lt;/a&gt; asked a question to the Internet, &quot;Today is my 23rd birthday and probably my last. Anything awesome I should try before I die?&quot; The answer that she received  and acted on would probably  be surprising to many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 17, 2013,  Kim Suozzi died, and as per her dying wish, was cryonically preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was a brave person,  and I hope to meet her someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, there we have it.  The point  that I am making with all this rambling. I hope to freeze my body after I die, in the hope of future medical technologies advancing to the point where they will be able to revive me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that in the scheme of things, it is not too terribly expensive to have yourself cryonically preserved. You should look at it yourself;  most people will fund it  with a $35K-200K life insurance policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad news for me is that a life insurance policy is out of the question for me; a terminal illness precludes that as an option. Likewise, due to the financial hardships in store for us,  self-funding is also out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I learned about  Kim Suozzi&#039;s plight, I reached out to the organization that set up  the charity that ultimately funded her cryopreservation.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.venturist.info/index.html&quot;&gt;Society for Venturism&lt;/a&gt;, a non-profit that has raised funds for the eventual cryopreservation of terminally ill patients, agreed to take on my case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of you  reading this post have already helped out in so many ways.  From volunteering your time and effort to our family, to donating money  towards my &lt;a href=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/special-needs-trust&quot;&gt;Special Needs Trust&lt;/a&gt; to help  provide a cushion for the difficult times ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am so grateful for all of this. It means so much to me and my family  to know that there is such a large and generous community  supporting us. I hate to ask for anything more, especially for something that may seem like an extravagance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is it really an extravagance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to ask for $100,000 for an experimental stem cell treatment, I doubt that we would even be having this conversation.  No one in their right mind would even consider a potentially life-saving procedure to be an extravagance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is cryonics, but a potentially life-saving procedure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People choose  from among many options for their bodies after death.  Some choose  to be buried, some choose cremation. Some choose to donate their bodies to science. That last is precisely what happens with cryonics: in addition to helping to answer the obvious question of will future revival from cold storage be possible, many developments in cryonics help modern medicine with the development of better preservation for organ transplantation and blood volume expanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I admit that the chances of it working are slim, but have you looked at the state of stem cell research for ALS lately? Consider that the only FDA approved medication to treat ALS,  Rilutek, will on average  add 3 months  to one&#039;s lifespan,  and you might begin to see my desperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you should be happy with the life you&#039;ve had. Why do you want to live forever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reasonable response to that is to ask why do you want to die?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love life. Every morning, even now with my body half paralyzed, I awaken with a new sense of purpose, excited to take on  the day. There is so much I have yet  to do. There are books to write, games to create,   songs to sing. If I can get the use of my arms  and hands again,  there are gardens to plant, houses to build, space ships to fly. And oh, the people to love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So please help me to realize this,  my dying wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://venturist.info/aaron-winborn-charity.html&quot; title=&quot;http://venturist.info/aaron-winborn-charity.html&quot;&gt;http://venturist.info/aaron-winborn-charity.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation, a sensitivity, and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do not just happen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Elisabeth Kübler-Ross&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Letter Writing Campaign</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/letter-writing-campaign</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;My good friend, Hannah, has started this letter writing campaign. Here is her appeal: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/Christmas Family Photo - thumbnail.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Christmas 2012&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Friends,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding for the Attendant Care Waiver/Act 150 Program has essentially been frozen in Pennsylvania due to the lack of movement on the federal budget. Act 150 provides funding for supports and services that allow people with physical disabilities to continue to live at home with their families. This funding is vital for the well-being of Aaron and his family.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>My response to the FDA&#039;s Prescription Drug User Fee Act Patient-Focused Drug Development Meeting</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/my-response-fdas-prescription-drug-user-fee-act-patient-focused-drug-development-meeting</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So get this. The FDA just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FDA-2012-N-0967-0001&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced a list of 20 diseases&lt;/a&gt; that they will focus on over the next 5 years. And guess what disease did not make it on the list, which includes such notables as narcolepsy, diabetic foot infections, and female sexual dysfunction? Not that I have anything against people who suffer from these other diseases, which also include HIV, lung cancer, and hepatitis C. It’s just that, come on, get serious. ALS should be at the top of the list, rather than invisible, mysteriously forgotten by the suits at the FDA, who are listening to paid lobbyists, and not the patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So read my response to them below. They are collecting comments from the public before they make their final decision. If you are so inclined, you have until November 1 to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FDA-2012-N-0967-0001&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/my-response-fdas-prescription-drug-user-fee-act-patient-focused-drug-development-meeting&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/EmpireModernMedicine_600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Evil Empire&quot; title=&quot;The Evil Empire&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the father of 2 young children, and last year, I was diagnosed with ALS. This disease has already wreaked havoc in our lives, as it has left me without use of my arms or hands, and with a severely compromised breathing capacity. The best is yet to come, however: I will become increasingly dependent on my foot-control power wheelchair for mobility as the atrophy in my legs and feet continue; as my swallowing and speech continue to decline, I will need to be fed through the feeding tube that has already been implanted, and I will only be able to communicate with the eye gaze tracker hooked up to my computer; and I will soon need to decide whether to die or to accept a locked-in state with invasive artificial ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was disappointed to learn that ALS was not on the list of 20 diseases being considered for the FDA&#039;s Patient-Focused Drug initiative. I can only assume that, considering a new patient is diagnosed every 90 min., while another dies every 90 min., this is an unfortunate oversight that will surely be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This disease is among the most universally feared outcomes that a person could be diagnosed with. That we have come 140 years since its discovery without a cure, any reasonable treatment, or even a hint of its cause, is a travesty. Please, for the sake of the 30,000 Americans who currently live with this horrible disease, their caregivers and families, and the 5600 unfortunate souls who will be diagnosed every year, reconsider your position, and help fight ALS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;
Aaron Winborn&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Special Needs Trust</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/special-needs-trust</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a difficult post to write. I had been sitting on it for several months, trying to decide best how to convey the emotions I am feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I was asked by a stranger if I had been in a car wreck, as I was wearing my neck brace. I replied that I was in a train wreck, and I was distracted by another person before I could finish my thought. He later asked where the train wreck took place, and I apologized for misleading him, and said I should be so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was first diagnosed with ALS last spring, I was overcome with grief, and spent many hours over the next month sobbing and screaming in rage. Eventually, life took over again, and I set all that aside for a while. After all, I still had two young daughters to help raise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/family.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My Family&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my initial fears have come to pass. I remember the initial struggles lifting Sabina, just a few short months after her birth, before we even knew that there was anything close to serious going on. By January of last year, I was not even able to pick her up at all. Fortunately, she began crawling soon after, and had figured out how to crawl into my lap when she wanted me to hold her. I am so happy now when she climbs up on my lap to have me read a story to her or to watch a YouTube video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Ashlin has been very understanding and helpful through this whole process. As I have been unable to give hugs for several months, she came up with a method where she pulls my arms behind her back. I just about cried the first time that she did that. The last couple of months have been difficult, as I am no longer able to turn the pages of books when I read to her. At first, she went through a period when she didn’t want me to read to her at all. But then she spoke with Gwen about her feelings about it, and now she turns the pages for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, however, I know that the worst is yet to come. I will be visiting with the ALS clinic soon in order to get a power wheelchair. At the same time, we need to expand our bathroom to accommodate it, and put in a ramp in the back. And yet, that transition does not feel particularly big for me. Much more difficult has been the fact that I need artificial ventilation in order to breathe at night already. Or that I am unable to play frisbee anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron Welch with &lt;a href=&quot;http://advomatic.com&quot;&gt;Advomatic&lt;/a&gt; recently set up a Special Needs Trust in my name. This unique trust allows us to use funds contributed by outside sources (we are legally not allowed to contribute to it), while protecting my eligibility to receive care-giving assistance through the state. The funds can be used to support my needs beyond what I will eventually receive from Medicare/Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, at some point down the road, I will be on disability and eligible for Medicare. The good news is that this happens almost automatically for a patient with ALS, due to some lobbying in the last couple of decades. As my needs increase, however, I will need more care and will need to become eligible for an attendant care program in PA, for which the income and asset allowance is almost nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If and when I choose artificial, invasive ventilation, I will require 24 hour care. At that point, I would also need to be Medicaid eligible. This is where things get extremely challenging financially. For example, with attendant care / Medicaid, not only do I need to be basically destitute, but the state looks back over 5 years, and if they see that I have given any money to anyone in that time frame, they assume that I am trying to scam them, and dock the time, adding several months or more to the time before I would be eligible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based solely on the odds, there is a 50% chance that I will die in 1 to 2 years, although it’s a little more complicated than that. There are two predominant flavors of ALS: bulbar onset (the brainstem) and limb onset. Mine is the limb, which makes it only slightly more likely that I may live for another 3 or 4 years instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to point out that I am doing everything humanly possible to beat those odds. When they talk about the life expectancy of ALS patients, however, they are really talking about the &quot;survivability&quot;, which is the point when a patient would require invasive ventilation to survive. Most of the 10% who will go on to live a decade or more have reached this point and are locked-in as well, trapped in their completely paralyzed bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have done what we can to protect what assets we do have. We have been consulting with an attorney as the information is very complex and we want to protect the future for our children as best as we can. We know that major purchases are down the road, such as medical and communications equipment, home modifications, a wheelchair, and an accessible van, all of which will be in the tens of thousands of dollars. The cost to support a patient with ALS in the later stages can run easily up to $100,000 a year or more. The funds in the Trust can help support me while I am alive.

&lt;p&gt;I am angry at this stupid disease. I know from my time with Elisabeth Kubler-Ross so many years ago that this is a natural part of the grieving process, and that eventually I will enter the acceptance phase. I even look forward to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my daughters, Ashlin (8 years old) and Sabina (2 years old), will not have the benefit of the acceptance of my death when it happens. I am being robbed of my time with them, of watching them grow up. It is hard enough to know that I will most likely not be around to watch Ashlin graduate. To know that Sabina will most likely not have any more than a fleeting image of her father from early memories makes me cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add insult to the injury, I am quickly losing my ability to participate in their lives, even now, becoming simply a spectator. What I would give to be able to pick up a frisbee and toss it to my daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to thank everyone for all your ongoing support and care. This slow-moving train wreck is more than any family should have to endure.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Demo of Drupal&#039;s Media: YouTube module</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/demo-drupals-media-youtube-module</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The following transcript is for the video at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfPKKisE88w&quot; title=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfPKKisE88w&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfPKKisE88w&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/XfPKKisE88w&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, my name is Aaron Winborn. I am a developer for Advomatic, the author of Drupal Multimedia, and a contributor and a co-maintainer of several Drupal modules, including the Media suite of modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I will demonstrate a new feature of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/media_youtube&quot;&gt;Media: YouTube&lt;/a&gt; module: browsing and searching videos directly from YouTube, in the media browser itself. So first, let’s set up our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are assuming that you already know how to install Drupal. If not, you can find information at Drupal.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So right now we are at the modules administration page. We are interested in the modules under the Media package. You will need to install and enable the File Entity module (version 7.x-2.x), and the same version of the Media module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will not enable the included Media Field module; it is there for legacy purposes, and has been deprecated in favor of core’s File Field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Media Internet Sources module, included with the Media module, is a dependency of the Media: YouTube module, so we will enable that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next will be the Media: YouTube module, also version 7.x-2.x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will install the WYSIWYG module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by configuring WYSIWYG. We do that by going to Configuration &gt; Content Authoring &gt; WYSIWYG profiles. Note that I have also installed and enabled the Admin Menu module and the Admin Menu Toolbar module, which gives us the fancy drop-down menus for administration that you see here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in order to use WYSIWYG, you need to have also installed a third-party WYSIWYG library, such as CKEditor or TinyMCE. You need to follow the instructions with the WYSIWYG module to install that, although it is quite simple actually. You just download and unpack the file into the sites/all/libraries folder. You can see that I am using CKEditor here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WYSIWYG module allows us to set up profiles for the various text formats on our site; in this demo, we will edit the Filtered HTML format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open up the buttons and plug-ins field set next. Then check the Media Browser check box. That will add the media browser button to our WYSIWYG editor, which we will see soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to use that however, we need to configure the filter in question. In fact, I believe that if we do not do this step 1st, we will get an error message, complete with a link to the format configuration page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this page, we need to check the box next to “Convert Media tags to markup”. That is the answer to the number 1 support question that we get in the Media queue, which is, “Why is there bracketed goobly gook instead of my images?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, as we will see, everything should be working now. So let’s test it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here on the create article page, we see a fancy button on the body text area! Let’s click it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are thumbnails being pulled directly from YouTube. How about that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there is even a ghetto pager, or at least previous/next links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you can also search YouTube directly from our browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we will select a video and submit it. Add a title and save the node. And there we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s it really. Well, almost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some more settings, specifically here to control which tabs show up for WYSIWYG. Note that at the time of this demonstration, you will not have this functionality unless you install the patch over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/node/1434118&quot;&gt;node 1434118&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complete the demo, we will also do the same for fields. Let’s add a field to hold YouTube videos. We will call it Media, and it will be a file field with a Media file selector widget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, let’s reorder it as well for the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We leave everything at their default settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hold on, I forgot that we need to allow the YouTube URI scheme. And the video file type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we will create a new article, and select the media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here we have all the tabs available to our browser, including the new and improved YouTube tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also, let us look at another new feature of the media module: My files!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a long-awaited feature for the Media module as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here comes the 2nd most asked question in the support queue: “How come there is a link to my file, rather than the file itself?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s just fix that now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are in the file type administration page, where we can configure the display for each of our file types. Note that we can also add fields to our files, although we are not going to do that in this demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will jump to the video display...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, we want to make sure that our large formatter is set up properly for YouTube. And it is, so let’s set up that as the formatter for our Media file field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there it is, as a generic file, which is simply a link to the file stream itself. We will change that to rendered file. And then we set the view mode to large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we are in there, we can do the same for our teasers. We will just set that to the preview view mode, which by default will display a thumbnail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoops, I forgot to save it. Let’s just do that again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there is the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there is the thumbnail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well done!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Spammer with a Heart of Gold</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/spammer-heart-gold</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I received a most &lt;a href=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/drupal-commuity#comment-3302&quot;&gt;heart warming comment from a spammer&lt;/a&gt; the other day. To understand why it has affected me, you might first need a little background. I have been diagnosed with Stephen Hawking’s ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease. Based on just that fact, and that my lab scores are dead even (and that I do not have access to Mr. Hawking’s money or universal health care) I will most likely die sometime in the next year or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I announced my condition to the world through my blog last August, and have had many heartfelt wishes and offerings of support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lots of spam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/Spam.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://mollom.com/&quot;&gt;Mollom&lt;/a&gt; to protect my blog which is powered by &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/&quot;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, and it does a fairly decent job. Still, about 50 instances of spam make it through the filters every month. I have to handpick those out, which is an increasingly difficult task, considering that I have little ability to use my hands anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this one comment stuck out, beginning as so many do, with concern for my condition, and well-intentioned advice, in this case to seek out Ayurvedic medicine. But then, the poster went on to chastise other spammers on this site, and I quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One more thing for some persons who comment here. Don&#039;t forget that you are humanbeing. I also come here to place my link here. But when a person is in such a condition and place his feelings here, then how the hell you are posting your links here for business purpose. I am also doing SEO. But not at the cost of humanity. It is the time to help and support him, materially or mentally. If you can&#039;t do that please don&#039;t at least post here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my sincere request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good reminder that even as we continue to fight the war against spam, that our combatants are human. Like so many soldiers, they are fighting for money (for “business purpose”). They also create internal justifications for what they do (“I am also doing SEO”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that at least one of them has a heart of gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Dillip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Here&#039;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh44QPT1mPE&quot;&gt;better version of the song&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Heaven Can Wait</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/heaven-can-wait</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I had an appointment this morning with my primary care physician. I thought that the appointment was to request a new lab test. Little did I know that the appointment was really so that my doctor, who shall remain nameless, could wax philosophical on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nearly fifteen minutes, I was subjected to a lecture about how I should look forward to heaven. As if that were not enough, he left me with a list of related reading material. And then he went on to tell me about how I should do something meaningful with my life, such as telling my story to the local paper, so that I can raise awareness of the devastating effects of ALS on one’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/Stairway_To_Heaven_by_Tizz77.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stairway To Heaven, by Tizz77&quot; title=&quot;Stairway To Heaven, by Tizz77&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not defined by this disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sorry, but I don’t need to be told how to die or how to live. I feel like I have a good handle on both. And it’s not like I don’t want to hear about others’ perspectives on life and the hereafter, it just seems rude to lay it on someone without being asked first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to live with Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, who wrote “On Death and Dying.” Not that he would know that of course, although he may have if he had shut his yap for more than five seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add injustice to the whole thing, he didn’t even order the lab tests that I had requested. I had wanted a Hair Element Test, to get a count of mercury in my body. He pooh-poohed that, telling me that because different labs report different numbers, that the test is meaningless. He instead ordered a Heavy Element Blood Test, which I have already had. I thought that I was prepared for a little skepticism, but after his lecture, I walked out of that office in a dazed condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I am open to recommendations for a new family doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>&quot;Cookie, Cookie!&quot;</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/cookie-cookie</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;“Cookie” has been the refrain from Sabina every morning for the past couple of weeks, thanks to Dustin and Lisa who brought us brownies the Monday before last. This is, in fact, the only word that she will say right now: Sabina will play with a word when she learns it, speaking it only about half a dozen times usually, before she decides not to say it anymore. She actually has quite a vocabulary, including such forgotten gems as “kitty”, “more”, and “sky”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family came up from Virginia last weekend, which was fun. It was good to see my aunt, uncle, cousins, and grandmother. I’m glad they got to see Sabina &amp;amp; Ashlin again in this snapshot visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other night, Sabina and I danced to the Wii. She particularly enjoyed marching (to “The Ants Go Marching On”) and wiggling (to “Pop Goes the Weasel”). Ashlin did not dance, as she was cleaning the house, because Makaela was having a sleepover here that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/sites/aaronwinborn.com/files/tree.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shauna painting a tree in Ashlin&#039;s room&quot; title=&quot;Shauna painting a tree in Ashlin&#039;s room&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Shauna is painting a mural in Ashlin’s room, and Lisa and Wolf did prep-work. Stef is here babysitting Sabina while Gwen and Jessica are working at our old house. Stef is planning to bring Ashlin to Claire’s farm tomorrow, where they will find pastel eggs. Shades of Easter...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was amazing watching how quickly the house was moved a couple of weeks ago. So many people working hard, and I felt like a lump, until Jane set me up directing traffic. I sometimes forget that I can still be helpful, even if I don’t have arms that work.  I just wish there was something I could do to help get our Park Terrace house ready to sell.  What’s been done there looks really great, and I know volunteers working over there must be getting tired and there’s still a lot that needs to be done.  Gwen and I are deeply appreciative of all of you who are reaching out and helping with these tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theo is well adjusted to the new house. Since about the 3rd day actually. He prowls the neighborhood, on the lookout for moles, chipmunks, and small birds. When he is inside, both he and Mia like to sit by the front window, where they can look out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am doing well enough. My arms are a lot weaker, but everything else seems fine right now. Jon installed a bidet yesterday, which should give me a modicum of independence again. Which is also timely, as the agency providing in-home assistance has failed big time recently, failing to show up three times in the past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s all for now. Sorry it’s been so long since an update.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>To the Drupal Commuity</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/drupal-commuity</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;You may know me through my work with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/media&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Media&lt;/a&gt; suite of modules, and before that for my work with &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/emfield&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Embedded Media Field&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/views_slideshow&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Views Slideshow&lt;/a&gt;. You may have read my book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.packtpub.com/create-multimedia-website-with-drupal/book/mid/230609ykjxg1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Drupal Multimedia&lt;/a&gt;, which I wrote before the birth of my second daughter, or seen me speak at a Drupal Camp or DrupalCon. You might have worked with me at a code sprint. Even if you haven’t met me, you might have seen some of my handiwork through one of the many sites I’ve helped developed over the years with &lt;a href=&quot;http://advomatic.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Advomatic&lt;/a&gt;. Drupal has been a central part of my life - one of my three loves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, my family and I were given some devastating news. I was diagnosed with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Als&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)&lt;/a&gt;, more commonly known in the US as Lou Gehrig&#039;s Disease, which is a motor neuron disease that is slowly killing the motor neurons in my body. This is an incurable, terminal illness: 50% of patients diagnosed are dead within 2-3 years, and a further 20% in five years. Only 10% of patients are still alive after 10 years, and the majority of those are &quot;locked in&quot;, like Stephen Hawking, unable to move any part of their body other than their eyes. The senses and cognitive functionality are spared. The disease is a progressively degenerative Motor Neuron Disease (MND), that eventually kills every voluntary muscle in the body, until the diaphragm collapses, which is generally when the patient dies, unless they are given a tracheostomy (and don&#039;t succumb to pneumonia).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rare disease is sporadic, with no known cause. It&#039;s considered an &quot;orphan disease&quot;, with an incidence rate of about 1 in 100,000. My neurologist is hopeful in my case, as it&#039;s limb onset (rather than bulbar, or brain-stem, onset), and I&#039;m on the younger side of the bell-curve. Still, an early prognosis is impossible, as the disease progresses randomly. Right now, he said that based on my EMG, he expects to see clinical signs in my legs by next year, although he can&#039;t say if I&#039;ll be in a wheelchair by then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am unable to lift more than about 1-2 pounds. It&#039;s been hard on my wife, as she&#039;s doing everything I&#039;m unable to do (vacuuming, dishes, etc.), on top of raising our children and pursuing her Masters. Our house is the opposite of accessible, with no first floor bathroom and being on a steep hill. Thus, we&#039;re in the meantime looking to buy a ranch house that we&#039;ll be able to modify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I have some visible atrophy in my shoulders, wrists, and thumbs, I&#039;m feeling on top of the world. I&#039;m trying to front-load my life now, to ensure I&#039;m doing what I&#039;m able to at full capacity while I still can. I&#039;m hopeful; I&#039;ve been expecting a medical revolution this decade, and if I can hold on with my wits, I might be able to take advantage of that. Even if that doesn’t happen, from reading about and connecting with other PALS (Patients with ALS), I&#039;ve learned, unsurprisingly, that the longer-lived people are those who manage to maintain a positive attitude in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m fortunate to be working with Advomatic, both because my job (Drupal!) is something I&#039;m still able (and love) to do, and because I&#039;m surrounded by such a supportive team. I plan to develop for as long as I&#039;m able; I&#039;m looking into voice recognition software for when my hands ultimately go. In a race against time, I&#039;m also &#039;voice banking&#039;, recording my voice so that when I ultimately lose my voice, the computer will sound roughly like me. (Hawking&#039;s complaint is that he sounds &quot;like a damn Yankee&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that many of you will want to know how to help me and my family. I know from experience that the first response is to want to make food. I appreciate that, as a gift of food directly helps to sustain a person, but we have a large, helpful community through our daughter’s school that is delivering meals once or twice a week. (Although if you’re local to us, we could use some occasional help with the yardwork...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also send donations to the ALS Center at Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center&lt;br /&gt;
(see &lt;a href=&quot;http://pennstatehershey.org/web/neurology/patientcare/specialtyservices/als&quot; title=&quot;http://pennstatehershey.org/web/neurology/patientcare/specialtyservices/als&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://pennstatehershey.org/web/neurology/patientcare/specialtyservices/als&lt;/a&gt; for more details).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Advomatic will likely be setting up a fund to help for when I’m unable to work any longer, and to provide a legacy for my family. Please &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.advomatic.com/contactus/partner&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;contact Aaron Welch&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested in contributing to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>Yet Another Drupal Installation Tutorial</title>
 <link>http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/yet-another-drupal-installation-tutorial</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a tutorial I wrote for a friend, who asked how to get started in Drupal. I figured I might as well share it, sorry if this is too basic for most of you hacks...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands on is the best way to learn Drupal...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s a handbook at &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/documentation&quot; title=&quot;http://drupal.org/documentation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://drupal.org/documentation&lt;/a&gt; -- there are several aspects to knowing Drupal. I would first suggest getting a site up and running so you can learn the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you&#039;ll need to set up a webserver. Unless you have a specific site you&#039;re trying to build, I would first install AMP on your desktop (this will be LAMP, MAMP, or WAMP, depending on your OS; you can find out about that with Google). That allows you to run local web sites at &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost/&quot; title=&quot;http://localhost/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://localhost/&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you&#039;ll need to install Drupal. Just download it from &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/drupal&quot; title=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/drupal&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://drupal.org/project/drupal&lt;/a&gt; (currently the 7.7 version, the tar.gz or zip file). There are easier ways to do that if you&#039;re comfortable with the command line; see &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/drush&quot; title=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/drush&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://drupal.org/project/drush&lt;/a&gt; if you want to get overwhelmed with details. But depending on your learning style, it&#039;s probably best to start basic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#039;ll need to download that into the directory designated by your AMP setup (might be /var/www/drupal, ~/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/drupal, or whatever WAMP tells you to do if you win the windows lottery; hold on, I&#039;ll look it up just in case... looks like it&#039;s c:\\wamp\www\drupal ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, you&#039;ll be able to go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost/drupal/&quot; title=&quot;http://localhost/drupal/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://localhost/drupal/&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8888/drupal/&quot; title=&quot;http://localhost:8888/drupal/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8888/drupal/&lt;/a&gt; (depending on your AMP installation &amp;amp; OS), where you&#039;ll see an Installation page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, you also need to create a database for your site. The easiest way to do this is to go to mysql from the command prompt and type&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;create database drupal;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as I recall, most AMP servers (other than Linux) don&#039;t do a good default setup, and it can be tricky to get mysql working from the terminal. So the next easier way is to navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost/phpMyAdmin/&quot; title=&quot;http://localhost/phpMyAdmin/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://localhost/phpMyAdmin/&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8888/phpMyAdmin/&quot; title=&quot;http://localhost:8888/phpMyAdmin/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8888/phpMyAdmin/&lt;/a&gt; and find the link to create a new database. You&#039;ll need to figure out (or figure out how to change) your default root password. It might be root, depending on your AMP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you&#039;ll enter your database credentials from the installation screen, follow the other instructions, and you&#039;re off!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I forget anything crucial?&lt;/p&gt;
