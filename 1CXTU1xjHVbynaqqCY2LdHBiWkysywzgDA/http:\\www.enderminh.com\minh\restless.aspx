        by Minh T. Nguyen</p>
    <p>
        Author's note: "Chi" is a Vietnamese word that literally translates into "older
        sister". It is a word used to address an older female of your generation. "Em" is
        a Vietnamese word that literally translates into "younger brother/sister". It is
        used to address persons that are younger than you. Because both words are used very
        frequently, I have decided not to omit them in this essay.</p>
    <p>
        When I moved to Seattle for my summer internship, I was stranded in an entirely
        new place. I did not know anyone. Unlike school, the internship gave me much free
        time in the evenings, and as a result, I wanted to quickly find ways to do community
        service and to meet people. Being Vietnamese and having mentored Vietnamese children
        back home, I knew I wanted to do something similar in Seattle. My search for such
        an organization led me to Helping Link and retrospectively, I wish that I would
        have found them right at the beginning of my summer, for Helping Link has created
        some very beautiful memories of Seattle for me. I was involved in their mentorship
        program for teenagers as well as their ESL tutoring program for newly immigrated
        Vietnamese.</p>
    <p>
        I found the Helping Link organization through a website that provided volunteer-matching
        services. After a few emails and phone conversations, I met the program's coordinator,
        chi Minh Duc Nguyen, in her office one evening.</p>
    <p>
        On the very first day that I met the Helping Link organization, I met some of the
        teenagers that happened to stop by to help chi Minh Duc with her immense paperwork.
        I remember the two inseparable Thuy Trang and Hai Chau, who bursted out in laughter
        while entering chi Minh Duc's office, and simply could not stop laughing although
        I was present in the office. This moment, as trivial as it might sound, was what
        made me recall how much I enjoy being around teenagers and children, and I could
        see clearly that there would be exciting months to come. By then I could already
        see that Helping Link promised much fun and refreshing laughter. After the initial
        introduction and paperwork, we agreed that I would be mentoring a teenage boy by
        the name of em Thanh.</p>
    <p>
        Meeting with my mentee Thanh in the Seattle library was a little bit scary because
        I was concerned about whether or not em Thanh would learn to trust me or consider
        me a friend. Thanh turned out to be very mature for his age, always eager to learn,
        and he was very pleasant to work with. I think I was fortunate to have Thanh as
        my mentee, for I can remember having less-motivated children in my previous mentoring
        experiences. Thanh was very easy to talk to, despite my insufficient Vietnamese.
        Outside of our tutoring sessions, he was simply a very funny boy. We met about once
        a week, and we spent the sessions reading and writing English. At that time, the
        children of the program were working on a group project, assembling a website about
        the Vietnamese culture in Seattle. Thanh wrote about Vietnamese history. I must
        admit that it has been a very enriching experience working with Thanh, for he knew
        more about Vietnam than I did - how lucky I was to have learned so much from a younger
        person.</p>
    <p>
        In addition to wanting to spend more time with Thanh, I wanted meet the other teenagers.
        Luckily, there was a Helping Link picnic that seemed a good opportunity to accomplish
        both endeavors. I was a little intimidated when I first drove down to the picnic
        but this quickly subsided once I arrived at the picnic. The teenagers were lively,
        playing games and having a barbecue by the time that I arrived, and they welcomed
        me in a way that I will not easily forget. With no hesitation to approach an elder,
        an ever-so-talkative mentee by the name of Quyen introduced herself to me with some
        twenty made-up names. I decided to remember her simply by her hairstyle. I assimilated
        quite quickly as I joined their games, and I even introduced some games that I remember
        from my mentorship program back home. Teenagers and children have this immense power
        to brighten up your life, as long as you are willing to let them approach you. I
        really enjoyed being around them that evening, and we quickly started to make plans
        for new events.
    </p>
    <p>
        I started to love the kids, and I always looked forward to the activities that Helping
        Link had planned. Helping Link has given me an immense joy with these children-the
        kind of joy that makes you smile all of the time. Unfortunately, most of the activities
        that were scheduled were on weekdays, and a conflict with my work schedule did not
        permit me to join many of them. Yet, for all the activities that I was able to attend,
        I enjoyed them so much. I joined the children on several Karaoke and game nights
        at chi Quynh Giao's house. Chi Quynh Giao was the other main coordinator of Helping
        Link.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the time came for me to leave Seattle, we were very sad. As a good-bye ritual,
        the kids all decided to run after me and pinch me-the price I pay for leaving them,
        I assume. I really have no idea where this ritual comes from, but the spontaneity
        is what I love so much in children.</p>
    <p>
        I wish that I might soon visit them again. I hope that they have not forgotten me,
        for I have not and will not forget them and the fun we shared in my short little
        visit up there. I miss the "folks" very much, and I wish that I had participated
        in more activities, and that I had joined the group much earlier than I did.</p>
    <p>
        In addition to providing mentorship for children, the organization provides free
        ESL tutoring for recently immigrated Vietnamese adults. Mentoring children is something
        that I have done for a long time, and I think I enjoy it because of the playfulness
        and happiness that children give me. However, it is through Helping Link that I
        have ventured to the other side of the generational bridge. One can imagine the
        difficulties that these adults face here in the United States.</p>
    <p>
        I have never taught English to adults before, and I figured that I should give it
        a try, despite my insufficient Vietnamese. I expressed my interest to help the two
        current volunteers Sheryl and Dave with the weekly evening ESL sessions, and they
        welcomed my help immediately.</p>
    <p>
        One thing that concerned me was whether the Vietnamese adults were offended by my
        age-that is, I wondered whether they were offended that they were being taught by
        someone at least ten years their junior. I am Vietnamese and I know the common Vietnamese
        customs. I knew that in addition to having to face the challenges of adapting to
        a new environment, they also had to face new customs and ways. I was afraid that
        they might have felt like they were being "lectured" to by a member of the younger
        Vietnamese generation-a scenario unacceptable in the Vietnamese tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, I did my very best to show them utmost respect, and I also wanted to make sure
        that they felt comfortable in asking me questions. However, I found my worries unnecessary,
        for they greatly welcomed having a Vietnamese person as a teacher in the first place,
        for Sheryl and Dave were not Vietnamese, and therefore, occasionally faced difficulties
        in explaining abstract English words and sentences. Having a teacher who spoke Vietnamese
        alleviated many of the communication obstacles. As it turned out, though, although
        I was able to help explain certain words, there were many questions that I myself
        could not answer because my Vietnamese vocabulary was not too expansive.</p>
    <p>
        Tutoring took place in a bi-directional way. I taught English as best I could, and
        in turn, I also learned and improved my own Vietnamese. For instance, while I was
        teaching the different colors, I realized that the same Vietnamese word, vang, was
        used to describe both gold and yellow. I've never noticed that. Similar to my experience
        with em Thanh, I found that it was very uplifting to see these adults make use of
        newly acquired knowledge. I was quite impressed by one man who learned things so
        quickly and asked me many questions after class. I had made "friends" with members
        of the older generation, something that is not necessarily common in Vietnamese
        culture. We often joked and talked about cultural differences, and I felt very appreciated
        when I was called upon to help with problems outside of the class. Explaining the
        difference between a checking account and a savings account, how to catch connecting
        flights in a connecting city on their way to Little Saigon, how to make a library
        card, are a few aspects of common American life that I helped to elucidate for them,
        and I enjoyed doing so.</p>
    <p>
        I enjoyed role-playing with the other tutor Dave in some everyday-scenarios, such
        as buying groceries at the supermarket. I enjoyed having them smile and laugh at
        jokes that Dave told, and I enjoyed seeing them exchange revelations they had about
        certain English words among each other in Vietnamese.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope that they have learned from me, and that they have enjoyed doing so on top
        of that. I hope that they have become more confident in approaching Westerners.
        On my last day of class, I assigned them to go to the supermarket and ask where
        they can find milk, because this was a scenario we practiced a gazillion times.
        I hope that they did.</p>
    <p>
        I truly have very fond memories of the teenagers and the adults of Helping Link.
        Above all, I became a part of Seattle's Vietnamese community-and that's not just
        because I ate "pho" (the Vietnamese famous beef-noodle soup) at the various Vietnamese
        restaurants on Rainer Avenue and International Avenue. I came to realize just how
        involved I had become in the Vietnamese community when I unexpectedly bumped into
        one of my ESL "students" at the Vietnamese pagoda on Vu Lan, the Buddhist equivalent
        to the American Mother's Day. I have made friends up in Seattle, and I know that
        the first thing I will do the next time I am in town will be to visit them. May
        the grown-ups always find the milk (and more) and the kids never forget to carry
        it for them.</p>
