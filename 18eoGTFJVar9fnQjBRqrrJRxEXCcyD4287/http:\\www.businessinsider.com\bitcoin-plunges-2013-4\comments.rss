				<description>For a currency that has &quot;crashed&quot;, it appears to be worth more than it was last month? 

As for the confidence thing, that applies to ANY currency and this is now the 2nd time Bitcoin has proven it can face a panic and just bounce back again.</description>

				<description>Whats REALLY FUNNY: the MtGox Exchange IS actually HAPPY that due to their own system failure people LOST MONEY (1 BILLION USD in less than 5 hours) - look for yourself what they write and how they write it:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtgox.com/press_release_20130411.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; &gt;https://mtgox.com/press_release_20130411.html&lt;/a&gt;
They admit that there was NO DDoS Attack and that the system frozen because it could NOT handle so many requests by VALID users. They write that they &quot;would love to share with you how successful they are&quot;. It all seems that they are bunch of kids that never understood the VALUE of money - for them losing money means nothing - its just a game - today 50 % up, tomorrow 50 % down. Who cares - its not our money - they seem to communicate. I'm glad that I didn't bought any Bitcoins at anytime (even when they were selling for 5 USD) because it is just PURE SPECULATION - it has nothing to do with investment.
Anyways - MtGox should be SUED - because they admitted that the system has frozen NOT because of an DDoS attack - but because THEIR own servers weren't prepared for so many 'sale' orders - IF they can not handle 'sell' orders how they want to run a COMPANY which is dealing with REAL MONEY - they caused a loss of 1 BILLION USD in 6 hours (not their own money but peoples money) AND they are AMUSED ABOUT IT. They are still in the world of the paper trade game 'Magic the Gathering' after which they named the Website MtGox and which was years ago selling paper trading cards of that game. (I have nothing against this MtG game because I played it as a kid and I really liked it but WHAT HAS it to do with REAL MONEY for which you can buy water, food and shelter.)</description>

				<description>Are you fucking kidding me? It's at $150 after being below $20 last year. 
Who the fuck cares if some of the bubble popped, it's still a 10x profit to anyone who invested a year ago.

The reason why BCoins are so inflate? Your paper money belongs in the toilet.

The REAL story you should be sensationalizing is how governments worldwide are &quot;PRINTING MONEY&quot;.</description>

				<description>Is it really a crash?

It was sell off caused by a DDOS attack on MtGox. The purpose of the DDOS attack is to get people to sell off bitcoins at a lower price after selling their coins before the DDOS attack. The article really just serves to aid in the black hat hackers goals of getting cheaper bitcoins at a later price.</description>

				<description>More like an orchestrated DDOS. This was all a scheme for profit by a group of individuals that created panic in selling, launched a DDOS, took advantage of MTgox's latency times under heavy trading and bought at recent all time low.
PS Litecoin trading values barely effected during this. Litecoin not traded on Mtgox. Coincidence?</description>

				<description>For those who didn't get @dividist's comment on showing a tulip image with the self-serving &quot;Hold&quot; chart, there WAS a bubble long ago, in the 1600's, over futures in tulip bulbs being grown in Holland - very similar to today's commodities futures, but in those times, with trades being done in pubs, the enthusiasm for imaginary riches from cashing-in &quot;later&quot; brought misfortune when the &quot;later&quot; never came because potential buyers realized one day that a tulip bulb could not be worth so much. Ettu FB?</description>

				<description>Ok well alot of today's market volatility was due to a series of highly organised DDoS attacks that affected several Trading Exchange sites including, MtGox, Bitfloor, bitstamp and others. Digital Currencies are by no means a fad nor are they a Bubble. Alot of today's investment vehicles ETF's, Penny Stocks, Junk Bonds, etc we're seen the same way. Best advice...like any investment, get educated on the subject, research the market, build a strategy and stick to your investment plan. Better the Digital Currency investors figure out the bumps in the road early then discover them later on...</description>

				<description>lol.

I love how biased BI is. I started mining NINE DAYS AGO. It was selling for $90 USD per coin.

Mt.Gox: $162
BTC-e: $170

Yep, I'm stilling making money.

And no, I haven't bought any BTC. Nor will I.</description>

				<description>All, I think this press release at 9am eastern by Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) is was triggered the bitcoin slide today: 

Fortinet(R)'s FortiGuard Threat Landscape Research Team Reports That Bitcoin Botnet, ZeroAccess, Was the Number One Threat This Quarter 
Wednesday, April 10, 2013 9:00:03 AM (GMT-04:00)
Provided by: MarketWire 
SUNNYVALE, CA, Apr 10 (Marketwired) -- Fortinet(R) (NASDAQ: FTNT) -- a world leader in high-performance network security -- today announced the findings of its FortiGuard threat landscape research for the period of January 1 - March 31, 2013. FortiGuard(R) Labs observed that the Bitcoin mining botnet, ZeroAccess, was the number one threat this quarter as reported by FortiGate devices worldwide. The report also reveals analysis of the South Korea cyberattacks and two new Android adware variants that have climbed the watch list in the last 90 days. 

ZeroAccess Shows No Signs of Slowing 

&quot;In the first quarter of 2013, we 

have seen owners of the ZeroAccess botnet maintain and expand the number of bots under its control,&quot; said Richard Henderson, security strategist and threat researcher for Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs. &quot;In the last 90 days, the owners of ZeroAccess have sent their infected hosts 20 software updates.&quot; 

Based on reporting from FortiGate devices worldwide, ZeroAccess is the number one botnet threat the team is seeing. ZeroAccess is used primarily for click fraud and Bitcoin mining. The value of the decentralized, open source-based digital currency continues to skyrocket, which likely means the amount of money being made by ZeroAccess is in the millions of dollars or more. 

&quot;As Bitcoin's popularity and value increases, we may see other botnet owners attempt to utilize their botnets in similar fashions or to disrupt the Bitcoin market,&quot; Henderson continued. 

In March and into April, Mt. Gox, the largest Bitcoin Exchange in the world, battled a continued Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack in an attempt to destabilize the currency and/or profit from it. FortiGuard Labs' analysis of ZeroAccess, which has the capability to load DDoS modules onto infected machines, revealed that the botnet does not currently have a DDoS module attached to its arsenal. This suggests other botnet owners are attempting to profit from fluctuations in the Bitcoin currency. 

The growth of new ZeroAccess infections has remained constant in the last 90 days. Since FortiGuard Labs began actively monitoring ZeroAccess in August 2012, the team has seen a virtually linear amount of growth in new infections. Most recently, the team is seeing a staggering 100,000 new infections per week and almost 3 million unique IP addresses reporting infections. It's estimated that ZeroAccess may be generating its owners up to $100,000 per day in fraudulent advertising revenue alone. 

Wiper Attack Hits South Korea Companies 

A massive malware attack on 

South Korean television networks and financial institutions in March caused wide-scale damage, wiping thousands of hard drives. FortiGuard Labs, leveraging its partnerships with both the public and private sector in South Korea, has uncovered information relating to the nature of the attack and how the malware was spread. The team's research shows the attackers were able to seize control of patch management systems and use the trusted nature of those systems to distribute malware within their targets' networks. 

&quot;During out investigation of the attacks, we discovered that a version of the wiper malware was able to infect internal security management servers and use the trusted nature of that internal server to spread infections inside the victim's network,&quot; said Kyle Yang, Senior Manager of Antivirus at FortiGuard Labs. 

Cleanup and restoration continues, and the perpetrators responsible remain unidentified. 

Two New Adware Variants Propagating on Android 

Two new Android adware 

variants, Android.NewyearL.B and Android.Plankton.B have seen a large number of global infections in the past 90 days. 

&quot;The new advertising kits we are monitoring suggest that the authors behind this are working very hard to remain undetected,&quot; said David Maciejak, senior researcher for Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs. &quot;It's also possible that Newyear and Plankton are being written by the same author, but being maintained separately in order to generate more infections.&quot; 

Both pieces of malware are embedded into various applications and have the ability to display advertisements, track users through the phone's unique IMEI number, and modify the phone's desktop. 

&quot;The surge in Android adware can most likely be attributed to users installing what they believe are legitimate applications that contain the embedded adware code,&quot; said Guillaume Lovet, Senior Manager at FortiGuard Labs. &quot;It suggests that someone or some group has been able to monetize these infections, most likely through illicit advertising affiliate programs.&quot; 

Users can protect themselves by paying close attention to the rights asked by an application at the point of installation. It is also recommended to download mobile applications that have been highly rated and reviewed. 

Q1 Threat Recap: 

NBC.com 

In February, using a popular cybercrime 

toolkit available in the cyber underground, attackers were able to leverage recently patched exploits in Oracle's Java and Adobe's PDF platforms to install the Citadel banking Trojan and ZeroAccess botnet onto systems that visited a number of NBC's digital properties. At the time of the attack, only three out of 46 popular antivirus applications were able to detect and mitigate this threat, and Fortinet's FortiClient was one of them. 

&quot;The reports of signature-based antivirus' death have been greatly exaggerated,&quot; said Derek Manky, global security strategist for Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs. &quot;A signature is often used loosely to refer to a simple pattern to match a virus. But, as we've seen recently, that's not always the case. Fortinet signatures, for example, are highly intelligent, as they work with our antivirus engine to identify the intent of a virus. In a case like the NBC.com attack, advanced signatures are proven to be proactive and can help in the fight against advanced persistent threats (APTs) and zero-day attacks.&quot; 

Today's APTs are able to defeat many technologies, including next generation firewalls. Building a network defense strategy that includes multiple layers of security is the best way to protect an infrastructure from attack. In the case of NBC, layers of security beyond traditional NGFW apply here -- Webfiltering, antivirus, intrusion prevision and application control all were involved. 

Spamhaus 

In March, global spam fighter The Spamhaus Project placed CyberBunker on their spam blacklist, which caused some groups sympathetic to the Dutch Web hosting provider to launch a sustained DDoS attack on Spamhaus. Content delivery provider CloudFlare was recruited to assist Spamhaus to help keep their blacklisting services available, but they, too, came under attack. At its peak, the attack on Spamhaus, CloudFlare and other groups reached a whopping 300 billion bits per second (Gbps), the largest online attack ever recorded. In what is referred to as a DNS Amplification attack, an attacking bot sends a spoofed request to an open DNS server and asks it to send back a large DNS file. 

&quot;As long as misconfigured or intentionally left open DNS servers exist, these types of attacks will continue and be difficult to protect against,&quot; Henderson maintained. &quot;As botnet owners grow the size of their armies and diversify the ways in which they launch attacks, we're likely to see even larger attacks like this in the future,&quot; Henderson said.

				<description>Didn't we have this story last week when it peaked at $145 and then tanked to $90? Only to go up to $250 and tank to whatever it'll tank to? Seems to me like no one has a clue what's going on, on any side of the discussion. From what I can tell it'll either be below $100 or above $300 tomorrow. And it's 50/50 which it will be. If anyone wanted to tell me which it was I wouldn't believe them. Unless their name was Madame Esmarelda and they had a crystal ball. Then I'd probably give them all the bitcoins I had.</description>

				<description>No not shouting my mouth off, well not intentionally to cause offence to anyone anyways. Apologies if you were offended :) I just think that the MT-Gox site is probably getting hit by a DDoS attack again (and it's probably not being helped by people like me refreshing the page to see what the current price is either!) - I have seen this happen a few times (Not to this extent) in the 5 weeks that I have been involved in Bitcoins. I really do think that by this time tomorrow the price will have risen again. It's just my opinion that's all.</description>

				<description>I like the idea of Bitcoins - but it is possible to annihilate the whole BTC economy with ASICs just worth under 2 Million USD - and why shouldn't somebody don't this (even CIA, FBI, FEDs or China) in some time in the future to destroy a economy that is worth 2 Billions of USD. Its just too obvious for me that the Federal Reserve will do this at some point in the future. The idea of a decentralized currency is awesome - but Satoshi was right when he wrote that Bitcoin will fall because of its own success. And maybe it'll even happen because of an 51% attack that 'll soner or later happen. Bitcoin can not get any much higher - because of this 51% flaw.... at 600 USD / BTC it would be very lucrative to take over the whole network - and even now it is.</description>

				<description>Lucky you:) €28 was a nice price to buy even from the current perspective. I hope you sell 'em with nice profit before its too late. From my own experience I know that its hardest to sell when the prices are falling because you fear to lose and hope that it'll jump back up - but its the worst thing possible to do and it always leads to losses. Good luck to you JimmyD!</description>

				<description>Yeah true - Some of my friends wanted to buy in this morning when they were €190 and I told them that it was too expensive for them to get in now. I got lucky when they were €28 so even though there's a drop I haven't lost my investment of 8BTC....yet!</description>

				<description>Have you ever though that OTHER people have problems too? Not only financial problems but even HEALTH problems. When you want to GET something from other people you should FIRST give them something and NOT WHINE about your 'miserable' situation and about how young you are (20 years hahahaa very very very young) ! Everybody has their own problems and everybody could need some extra money but they don't beg around. Shout up and at least shout down your whining blog!</description>

				<description>Sure, it's crashing from it's high, but look at the price vs. just a couple of weeks ago. But I agree, there is probably some manipulation going on, I would suspect networks of buyers more than Mt. Gox. (not that I really know anything). To me, it seems like a buying opportunity.

Want real fun? Look at the Bitcoin selling prices on eBay over the past few days, it's even crazier than the values on the exchanges.</description>

				<description>Bitcoin prices have dropped yes but I guarantee you that the price will be above today's peak by this time tomorrow - Possibly way higher. We have seen this happen over the past few weeks when prices have gotten high then they drop and drop..people cash out and I get the feeling that the price is somehow manipulated down so people can buy in large at low prices knowing that they will rise again. Cypriot banks open tomorrow - The Bitcoin craze will continue in 12 hours..mark my words.</description>

				<description>No, bit coin is hilarious. It's a made up tulip phenomena used to pay for assassins anonymously, or drugs, or child porn, with all the earmarks of a National Lampoon oriented central bank. It out shines the Fed and QE by a little, but only by the gullibility of the participants. Next comes the BOJ. Then QE. Will the S&amp;P fall like bit coin in a few weeks? Stay tuned.</description>

				<description>But but but HENRY said the sky was the limit and there was really no way to lose on this.

Henry, have you been telling the sell side one thing while pumping up the but side again?</description>

				<description>S&amp;P is still 1% of its all time high priced in bitcoins. In fact nothing is at its all time high priced in bicoins, not even bitcoins, any more. EVERYTHING is off its all time high priced in bitcoins</description>

				<description>I totally agree. So often the posts here are just a statement &quot;xyz happening!&quot; With no information about the who/what/where/when/why, that I believe 3rd graders are taught in crappy public schools when doing current events assignments. 

These bitcoin post are the worst. One earlier today was just a headline and a picture. I only come here because I don't know of another place that has the same category of headlines.</description>

				<description>Difficult to assess from the in-depth analysis, but looking at this graph it appears as if profit takers had set to sell (bailout) at $250 - $265.</description>

				<description>And by the way... its amusing that the biggest exchange market of Bitcoins - MtGox was named after the paper card game 'Magic the Gathering' and years ago it was a place where you could trade your MtG cards :) Thus MtG ox (which stands for 'o'nline e'x'change). Magic the Gathering is a nice card game but I'm sure many investors will sell in panic when (and if) they realize that the place where they trade thousands worth of USD was named after (and served) a paper card game :):):)</description>

				<description>At current total network computing speed 2 Million USD worth of ASICs can destroy the whole Bitcoin currency which is now valued at 2 Billion USD by performing a 51% attack... Bitcoin is a very good idea but this flaw which enables to destroy the whole system (in just 10 minutes) with such low amount of money - 2 Million USD (compared to the worth of the whole Bitcoin Economy, which is 2 Billion USD) makes it possible to any individual to wipe out Billions of USD of other people.</description>

				<description>and apparently readers agree with you. I have noticed a significant DROP OFF in readership over the last several months. Before the New Year average readership of an article, ANY ARTICLE, was in the 1100 to 1200 range. Average article readership lately has been in the range of 500. Could it be people are getting fed up with the LACK of REAL CONTENT in articles and reading Weisenthal et al's click bait headlines?</description>

				<description>Sold my small stake in bitcoins for a small profit this afternoon as I started to wonder if the bubble has burst. I think crypto currencies are the future but this was/is just a bubble. In the future, maybe there will be other players aside from bitcoin. 
Definitely hope there are other players in the exchange market, though. Mt gox were appalling with my trade this afternoon. It took them 33 minutes to process the sale. Shocking service. I lost a small chunk of my small profit in the delay. Won't use them again.</description>

				<description>Okay stop. Seriously, enough. If I want a bitcoin ticker, I'll get a bitcoin ticker. I don't need SAI updating me on every change.</description>

				<description>This post is useless. Business Insider needs to stop talking about Bitcoin completely. The stories provide no insight whatsoever. You want a story about bitcoin? Go write about how the main exchange for buying and selling bitcoins, MtGox, can't handle daily trading volume with their current infrastructure. The lag in the processing of orders creates a panic which drives these selloffs. 

You know, maybe do a little real research and reporting once in a while instead of the useless parroting of other articles that Business Insider is so wont to do.</description>
