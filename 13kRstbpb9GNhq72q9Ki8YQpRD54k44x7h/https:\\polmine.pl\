We have plenty of ideas and much willingness. So why not to earn more?
We encourage the people interested in developing our projects to the collaboration and to exchange the ideas. here Może być ciekawie :P 2011-07-22 23:05 the payments after 50 confirmations We decided, after consulting this with you, to introduce the payments after 50 confirmations.
This option is tested, if it succeeds, it will stay permanently.Everything depends on the number of people interested in digging. If the tendency remains constant, we may lower this level.
That is why we encourage all minors to dig!
Invite your friends above 200 G and we’ll reduce the level to 30 or even 20. We will see :)2011-07-21 8:33 – are we going to reach 200 G? Do you best, brothers miners! The development of the pool is going well, the average power increases every day. We are slowly approaching the level of 180 G,
maybe we’ll be soon able to reach 200G, that would be something :) The Server Works stable and fast and more and more minors join us! If you need more information or support, please write your post on the forum, we’ll do our best to include all the suggestions2011-07-16 7:31 the updated programming, LP returned To accelerate and improve the digging, the new programme version has been introduced and the server has been restarted. The digging factor has improved as well :)
Restarting the diggers – if someone wants to have a clear situation and watch how it is to dig in a new way :P
And remember… the administrator keeps watch! Please let us know about any problem2011-07-15 06:29 API is broadened and we find next blocks Additional data have been added to the API mechanism (collecting data with JSON).
Everything’s going fine and fast, we’re getting new blocks.2011-06-26 09:11 All in order,we're expanding and going into the world In the next few days few new thing will be completed. Thanks to it we will sail into

The procedure to change your BTC address is following: in space “New BitCoin address:” write new address which you would like to set up click on “enter new address” in order to enter new address an email will be sent automatically to your e-mail address given during registration you need to check your email and click on the link you receive or copy and paste it to your web browser
(this is very important step and you have to go through it) if you managed to complete above step (mail and clicking on the received link) then new address should appear in the space “to address:” now you can make the transfers....comments, approval and remarks you can give tutaj 2011-06-22 11:11 Free Payments !Rules of payments: - minimum amount for instant payment: 0.5 BTC - you can do up to 3 payments a day - transferring of BTC is free of charge ! (and will probably remain this way?) For more details and comments we invite you to the forum forum 2011-06-18 23:11 Next two blocks are in for all diggers to share :)Seems next gold series has began ! As per free mining, for reasons beyond our control (structure of bitcoin protocol and bitcoin client itself) adding the option of
free mining is significantly impeded, we are working to resolve this issue. It would be nice if fellow miners looked up the net for already developed patches for
the bitcoin client which provide options of much slower but free BTC transfers. We ask you to paste any tips in this topic on our forum here here We will have the opportunity to see what the most active forum users have relevant to contribute :) We await with anticipation :) Want free mining ?!
