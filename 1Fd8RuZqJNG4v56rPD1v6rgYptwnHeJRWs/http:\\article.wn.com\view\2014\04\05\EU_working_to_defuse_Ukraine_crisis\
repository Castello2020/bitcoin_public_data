The <a href="http://wn.com/Ukraine" title="Ukraine">Ukrainian</a> revolution of February 2014 took place after a series of violent events in the capital of <a href="http://wn.com/Kiev" title="Kiev">Kiev</a> culminated with the ousting of the then-<a href="http://wn.com/President_of_Ukraine" title="President of Ukraine">President of Ukraine</a>, <a href="http://wn.com/Viktor_Yanukovych" title="Viktor Yanukovych">Viktor Yanukovych</a>.<!--!ignored html tags--><!--!ignored html tags--><!--!ignored html tags--><!--!ignored html tags--> This was immediately followed by a series of changes in quick succession in Ukraine's sociopolitical system, including the installation of <a href="http://wn.com/Yatsenyuk_Government" title="Yatsenyuk Government">a new interim government</a>, the restoration of <a href="http://wn.com/Constitution_of_Ukraine" title="Constitution of Ukraine">an older version of the constitution</a>, and the call to <a href="http://wn.com/Ukrainian_presidential_election_2014" title="Ukrainian presidential election, 2014">hold impromptu presidential elections within months</a>.<!--!ignored simplehtml tags-->
</p>

<p>
After a first revolution, namely the <a href="http://wn.com/Orange_Revolution" title="Orange Revolution">"Orange Revolution" in 2004</a>, Ukraine had been mired by years of corruption, mismanagement, lack of economic growth, currency devaluation, and an inability to secure funding from public markets.<!--!ignored html tags--><!--!ignored html tags--> Because of this, Yanukovych sought to <a href="http://wn.com/Ukraine_European_Union_relations" title="Ukraine–European Union relations">establish closer relations with the European Union</a> (EU) and <a href="http://wn.com/Russia_Ukraine_relations" title="Russia-Ukraine relations">Russia</a> in order to attract the capital necessary to maintain Ukraine's standard of living without affecting the local population significantly.<!--!ignored html tags--> One of these measures was an <a href="http://wn.com/Ukraine_European_Union_Association_Agreement" title="Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement">association agreement with the European Union</a> which would provide Ukraine with funds contingent to several reforms in almost all aspects of Ukrainian society and break its economic ties with Russia.<!--!ignored html tags--><!--!ignored html tags--> Yanukovych, at first, considered the contingencies to be fair but ultimately refused to sign the agreement considering it too austere and detrimental to Ukraine.<!--!ignored html tags--> Besides that, EU demanded the release of Tymoshenko, who was in jail, as an incidental condition of <a href="http://wn.com/Ukraine_European_Union_Association_Agreement" title="Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement">association agreement with the European Union</a>. Therefore, Yanukovych <a href="http://wn.com/17_December_2013_Ukrainian_Russian_action_plan" title="17 December 2013 Ukrainian–Russian action plan">signed a treaty with Russia</a> instead, which sparked civil unrest in Kiev that ultimately led to violent clashes between protestors and law enforcement officers under unclear circumstances.<!--!ignored html tags--> As tensions rose, Yanukovych fled the country and has not returned. Russia has accused the United States and the EU of funding and directing the revolution.<!--!ignored html tags-->
</p>

<p>
After the 2014 revolution, Russia refused to recognize the new interim government, calling the revolution a <a href="http://wn.com/coup_d_etat" title="coup d'etat"><em>coup d'état</em></a><!--!ignored html tags--> and <a href="http://wn.com/2014_Russian_military_intervention_in_Ukraine" title="2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine">seized control of the Crimean Peninsula</a> in Ukraine.<!--!ignored html tags--><!--!ignored html tags--><!--!ignored html tags--><!--!ignored html tags--> Internally, the newly appointed interim government of Ukraine ended up signing the aforementioned association agreement with the EU and committed to adopt reforms in its judiciary and political system, as well as in its financial and economic policies, in order to comply with the provisions set in the agreement. The interim government also adopted other changes as it was unable to fulfill several contractual agreements after the revolution but needed external investments in order to do so. The external investments came from the <a href="http://wn.com/International_Monetary_Fund" title="International Monetary Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> in the form of loans amounting to more than $18 billion contingent to Ukraine adopting reforms in almost all aspects of society,<!--!ignored html tags--> including a raise in dometic gas-supply price to the global price.
</p>

<p>
The revolution was followed by <a href="http://wn.com/2014_pro_Russian_conflict_in_Ukraine" title="2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine">protests in its south-eastern regions</a>, a dispute with Russia regarding the <a href="http://wn.com/annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation" title="annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation">annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol by the Russian Federation</a>, and the amassing of Russian troops near Ukraine's borders.
</p>

<p>
According to polling data by <a href="http://wn.com/GfK" title="GfK">GfK</a> taken from 4 to 18 March in all regions of Ukraine (including Crimea), 48% of Ukrainians support the change in power while 34% oppose. In the Eastern and Southern regions the revolution is supported by 20% of the population, whereas 57% or more of the population in the rest of the country supports the change in government. Also, only 2% of those polled said they fully or partially trusted former president Viktor Yanukovych.<!--!ignored html tags-->

<p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
A period of relative calm in the anti-government demonstrations ended abruptly on 18 February 2014, when protesters and police clashed. At least 82 people were killed over the following few days, including 13 policemen; more than 1,100 people were injured.<!--!ignored html tags-->

<p>
The initial riots began on 18 February 2014 when some 20,000 Euromaidan protesters in Kiev advanced on <a href="http://wn.com/Verkhovna_Rada" title="Verkhovna Rada">Ukraine's parliament</a> in support of restoring the <a href="http://wn.com/Constitution_of_Ukraine" title="Constitution of Ukraine">Constitution of Ukraine</a> to its 2004 form, which had been repealed by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine shortly after <a href="http://wn.com/Viktor_Yanukovych" title="Viktor Yanukovych">Viktor Yanukovych</a> was elected president in 2010. Police blocked their path. The confrontation turned violent; the BBC, citing correspondents, stated that both sides blamed the other.<!--!ignored simplehtml tags--> Police fired guns, with both <a href="http://wn.com/rubber_bullet" title="rubber bullet">rubber bullet</a>s and, later, <a href="http://wn.com/ammunition" title="ammunition">live ammunition</a> (including automatic weapons and sniper rifles), while also using <a href="http://wn.com/tear_gas" title="tear gas">tear gas</a> and <a href="http://wn.com/Stun_grenade" title="Stun grenade">flash grenades</a> in an attempt to repel thousands of demonstrators, who fought back with crude weapons, firearms, and improvised explosives.<!--!ignored simplehtml tags--> Protesters broke into the headquarters of the <a href="http://wn.com/Party_of_Regions" title="Party of Regions">Party of Regions</a>. There were no party members there at the time. Police stormed the main protest camp on <a href="http://wn.com/Maidan_Nezalezhnosti" title="Maidan Nezalezhnosti">Maidan Nezalezhnosti</a> and overran parts of the square.<!--!ignored html tags--> The <a href="http://wn.com/Trade_Unions_Building_Kiev_" title="Trade Unions Building (Kiev)">Trade Unions Building</a>, the Euromaidan headquarters, burned down. Political commentators suggested that Ukraine was on the brink of a civil war.<!--!ignored html tags--> Some areas, including <a href="http://wn.com/Lviv_Oblast" title="Lviv Oblast">Lviv Oblast</a>, declared themselves politically independent from the central government.<!--!ignored html tags-->

On 19 February, the authorities instituted police checkpoints, restrictions on public transportation and school closures in Kiev, which media referred to as a <em>de facto</em> <a href="http://wn.com/state_of_emergency" title="state of emergency">state of emergency</a>.<!--!ignored html tags--> One member of parliament said in an interview that a state of emergency was de facto implemented nationwide as transportation to the capital was paralyzed.<!--!ignored html tags-->

<p>
On 20 February, Minister of Internal Affairs <a href="http://wn.com/Vitaliy_Zakharchenko" title="Vitaliy Zakharchenko">Vitaliy Zakharchenko</a> announced he had signed a decree authorising the use of live ammunition against protesters.<!--!ignored html tags--> Central Kiev saw the worst violence yet, and the death toll in 48 hours of clashes rose to at least 77.<!--!ignored html tags--> In response, the next day Chairman of the Ukrainian parliament <a href="http://wn.com/Volodymyr_Rybak" title="Volodymyr Rybak">Volodymyr Rybak</a> announced he had signed a parliamentary decree, condemning the use of force and urging all institutions (Ministry of Internal Affairs, Cabinet of Ministers, etc.) to cease immediately all military actions against protesters.<!--!ignored html tags--> The Ukrainian parliament also suspended Zakharchenko from his duties.
</p>

<p>
On 21 February, President Yanukovych signed a compromise deal with opposition leaders which would implement constitutional changes to hand powers back to parliament and early elections, to be held by December.
</p>

<p>
Despite the agreement thousands still protested in central Kiev and took full control of Kiev's government district; they took over the parliament, the president's administration quarters, the cabinet, and the Interior Ministry.<!--!ignored html tags--><!--!ignored html tags-->
On 21 February an impeachment bill was introduced in Ukrainian parliament,<!--!ignored html tags--> but no details were provided and the Ukrainian parliament did not vote to impeach Yanukovich according to the legal procedure.<!--!ignored html tags-->
On 21 February Yanukovich left for <a href="http://wn.com/Kharkov" title="Kharkov">Kharkov</a> to attend a summit of south-eastern regions, according to media reports.
</p>

<p>
On 22 February, Parliament voted to declare that the chair of the President is vacant due to the fact that Yanukovich left Ukraine and no longer exercises his duties. An editorial in <em>Der Spiegel</em> argued that the vote was unconstitutional.<!--!ignored html tags-->

</p>

<p>
On 28 February, President Yanukovych attended a press-conference in southern Russia and answered questions from mostly Russian reporters. It was seen that he believed the early presidential elections to be held in late May to be illegal and he "would not be participating in them". He also said that while it could calm the situation, 21 February agreement was not agreed to by the opposition.<!--!ignored html tags-->

<h2>Background</h2>
<!--!ignoredBrackets:File-->
Protests originally erupted in November 2013 after President <a href="http://wn.com/Viktor_Yanukovych" title="Viktor Yanukovych">Viktor Yanukovych</a> chose not to sign a political association and free trade agreement with the <a href="http://wn.com/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> at the summit of the <a href="http://wn.com/Eastern_Partnership" title="Eastern Partnership">Eastern Partnership</a> at <a href="http://wn.com/Vilnius" title="Vilnius">Vilnius</a>, choosing closer ties with Russia instead. Prime Minister Mykola Azarov had asked for €20 billion (US$27 billion) in loans and aid<!--!ignored html tags--> The EU was willing to offer €610 million ($838 million) in loans,<!--!ignored html tags--> however Russia was willing to offer $15 billion in loans.<!--!ignored html tags--> Yanukovych is widely disliked in Ukraine's west, but remains very popular in his native Russian-speaking east, as well as the south. The rallies were initially peaceful but eventually became violent in January 2014 after parliament, dominated by Yanukovych's supporters, passed laws intended to repress the protest. Russia, hoping to build an alliance of ex-Soviet states, has made extensive efforts to derail Ukraine's pact with the European Union with a mixture of trade sanctions and promises. The European Union and the United States urged Yanukovych to negotiate a peaceful end to the conflict and said they would introduce sanctions against those responsible for the violence.<!--!ignored html tags-->

<h3> Alleged Russian involvement</h3>
<!--!ignoredBrackets:File-->
The fact that Yanukovych was perceived as trying to establish closer ties with Russia played a major role in the protests. Yanukovych accepted "bail-out" money, $2 billion out of a $15 billion package, from Russia and this was interpreted as a sign that he would seek close ties with Putin.<!--!ignored html tags--> Russian authorities had been pressuring the Ukrainian administration to take decisive action to crush protests; and it has been noted that the assault on Euromaidan protesters by police was ordered hours after the $2 billion from Russia was transferred.<!--!ignored html tags--><!--!ignored html tags--> Several ministers from across Europe blamed Russia for exacerbating the violence.<!--!ignored html tags--> During a 20 February interview, the retired<!--!ignored simplehtml tags--> Colonel of the <a href="http://wn.com/Main_Intelligence_Directorate_Russia_" title="Main Intelligence Directorate (Russia)">Main Intelligence Directorate of Russia</a> (GRU) Aleksandr Musienko stated that the conflict could only be solved by means of force, and that Ukraine had proven it could not exist as an independent sovereign state.<!--!ignored html tags--><!--!ignored html tags--> According to alleged government documents released by former deputy interior minister <a href="http://wn.com/Hennadiy_Moskal" title="Hennadiy Moskal">Hennadiy Moskal</a>, Russian officials served as advisers in how to carry out the operations against protesters. Codenamed "Wave" and "Boomerang," the operations aimed to disperse crowds with the use of snipers and capture the protesters' headquarters in the House of Trade Unions; prior to police defections, the plans included the deployment of 22,000 combined security troops in the city.<!--!ignored html tags--> According to the documents, the former first deputy of the Russian GRU stayed at the Kyiv Hotel and played a major role in the preparations, and was paid by the Security Services of Ukraine.<!--!ignored html tags-->  According to <a href="http://wn.com/Reuters" title="Reuters">Reuters</a>, the authenticity of the documents could not be confirmed.<!--!ignored html tags-->  Interior Minister Arseniy Avakov has stated that the conflict was provoked by a 'non-Ukrainian' third party, and that an investigation was ongoing.<!--!ignored html tags-->

Following concessions on 21 February after a failed crackdown which left up to 100 killed, Russian Prime Minister <a href="http://wn.com/Dmitry_Medvedev" title="Dmitry Medvedev">Dmitry Medvedev</a> suggested Mr. Yanukovych needed to stop behaving like a "doormat," and that further loan tranches would be withheld.

<p>
During a press conference on 3 April 2014, Ukraine's new interior minister, chief prosecutor and top security chief implicated more than 30 Russian FSB agents in the crackdown on protesters, who in addition to taking part in the planning, had also flown in shipments of large quantities of explosives into an airport near Kiev. Valentyn Nalyvaichenko, the interim head of Ukraine's SBU state security agency, said the agents were stationed in Kiev during the entire <a href="http://wn.com/Euromaidan" title="Euromaidan">Euromaidan</a> protests, were provided with "state telecommunications" while residing at an SBU compound, and in regular contact with Ukrainian security officials. "We have substantiated grounds to consider that these very groups which were located at an SBU training ground took part in the planning and execution of activities of this so-called antiterrorist operation," said Nalyvaichenko. Investigators, he said, had established that Yanukovych's SBU chief <a href="http://wn.com/Oleksandr_Yakymenko_politician_" title="Oleksandr Yakymenko (politician)">Oleksandr Yakymenko</a>, who later fled the country, had received reports from FSB agents while they were stationed in Ukraine, and that Yakymenko held several briefings with the agents.

<blockquote><em>"In addition to this, snipers received orders to shoot not only protesters, but also police forces. This was all done in order to escalate the conflict, in order to justify the police operation to clear Maidan."</em></blockquote>
He further suggested that the current minister of Internal Affairs, Avakov, and the chairman of the SBU, Nalivaichenko, were, although not responsible for the killings, covering them up and protecting the personnel that actually planned and carried out the operation, in order to prevent backlash against the ministry and to avoid prestige loss.<!--!ignored simplehtml tags--> Interior Minister Avakov has stated that the conflict was provoked by a 'non-Ukrainian' third party, and that an investigation was ongoing.<!--!ignored simplehtml tags-->

Asked about who the U.K. recognized as the current head of state, Hague said Britain was working with the new government.<!--!ignored html tags--> "There is of course a dispute constitutionally about who is the president, but in this situation it is very clear that, whatever the constitutional provisions, the authority of Mr. Yanukovych is no longer widely recognized as president," he said.

Nigel Farage said the EU provoked Russia to take action in Ukraine. Farage, who is the head of the UK Independence Party, said the EU has QUOTE blood on its hands. He added that Britain also encouraged the bloc to pursue what he called an imperialist and expansionist agenda in Ukraine, which led to the protests in Kiev. Farage said London gave a false series of hopes to a group of people in Ukraine. He was speaking in a televised debate with the Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg.

Poles are concerned about the security situation in Ukraine, and Poland has seen increased support for right-wing parties. Meanwhile Ukrainians hope their country will be able to hold the elections and avoid the worst. 

Fears about the situation in Ukraine have become a key issue in the EU election campaign in Poland. Experts say it could boost the ruling centre-right government's showing. Unemployment, healthcare reform, and the spending of EU funds have been pushed into the background by criticism of Russia.

                  <div class="video-fulldescription description-scroll">Gold prices are little changed going into the weekend as worries about Ukraine and Russia tensions are offset by the prospect of economic stimulus in Europe. Safanad chief investment strategist John Rutledge tells TheStreet's Joe Deaux that prices likely won't move in a meaningful direction in the near term as developments in global events continue on a sluggish path. Rutledge says the next change in gold's fundamentals may have to wait for when the Federal Reserve begins to unwind its asset purchases from years of monetary stimulus. But, Rutledge says. such an event could be many years from now. ¿

EU foreign ministers are due to discuss further sanctions against Russia after a Moscow-backed referendum in Crimea backed a split from Ukraine.
The 28-member bloc is considering a visa ban and an asset freeze against a number of Russian officials.
More than 95% of Crimean voters backed joining Russia, local officials said. Moscow says it will accept the result.
The EU and US say the vote is illegal in Crimea, where pro-Russian forces took control in February.
US President Barack Obama has warned Moscow that Washington is also ready to impose "costs" over its actions in Ukraine.
The new authorities in Kiev say Russian troops moved in to Crimea after Ukraine's pro-Moscow president, Viktor Yanukovych, was ousted following months of street protests.
The Kremlin officially denies deploying its troops in Crimea, describing the armed men without insignia as "Crimea's self-defence forces".
'Weak hand'
The EU foreign ministers are expected to gather in Brussels at 08:30 GMT.
The bloc has already suspended talks on an economic pact with Russia and an easing of visa restrictions.
The ministers will now be toughening the measures by discussing a list of names of those who could be subject to an asset freeze and a visa ban.
However, the question remains whether it should just be the list of people related to the takeover in Crimea or should it target the inner circle around Russian President Vladimir Putin, the BBC's Europe editor Gavin Hewitt says.
He adds that - not surprisingly - there are divisions among the 28 nations.
One official said bluntly if you did not go after people in Moscow you were showing a weak hand. Others argued that Brussels could not impose bans on people it would be sooner or later have to negotiate with.
If an asset freeze and visa ban does not rattle Moscow or Russia makes further military moves into eastern Ukraine - then the EU has already warned of moving to another stage which would involve economic sanctions.
Earlier, the EU said in a statement that the vote was "illegal and illegitimate and its outcome will not be recognised".

Foreign ministers from France, Germany and Poland are to hold crisis talks in Ukraine after deadly clashes this week.
The talks with top government officials and the opposition come before an EU meeting in Brussels to decide whether to impose sanctions against Ukraine.
At least 26 people died in the clashes between protesters and police in the capital Kiev on Tuesday and Wednesday.
On Wednesday evening, President Viktor Yanukovych and the main opposition leaders agreed a truce.
In a statement, the president said "negotiations" would now start to end the bloodshed and stabilise the situation.
Fires have continued burning around the main protest camp, the Maidan, overnight, but no violence is reported.
Most of the victims died during the clashes near the parliament building in the capital and later police attempts to clear the Maidan on Tuesday - making it the bloodiest day since the unrest erupted in late November.
Thursday has been declared a day of mourning for the dead.
In other developments:
President Yanukovych sacked the armed forces head, Col Gen Volodymyr Zamana, replacing him with the navy commander, Adm Yuriy Ilyin. No reason was given for the dismissal
US President Barack Obama warned there "will be consequences" for anyone who steps over the line in Ukraine - including the military intervening in a situation that civilians should resolve. He also expressed hopes that the truce "may hold"
Russia characterised the violence as an "attempted coup" by extremists
German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his counterparts from France and Poland, Laurent Fabius and Radoslaw Sikorski, are expected to meet President Yanukovych and other government officials on Thursday morning.
The EU ministers will also hold separate talks with the opposition.
Ahead of the Kiev visit, Mr Fabius called the warring sides to "return to dialogue", condemning the violence as "unacceptable".
"Perpetrators of these acts cannot go without sanctions."
The three EU ministers will then fly to Brussels for a crisis meeting with EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and other EU foreign ministers, where the issue of sanctions may be discussed.

Other reports are indicating at least 100 Russians were burned alive in the Odessa Massacre. This documentary highlights how racism and neo-Nazi fascists are provoking the Russian and Muslim Ukrainians into an all out Civil War as the ignorant Eu, NATO and the 'West" blame Vladimir Putin with all that is wrong in a very racially charged Ukraine.
