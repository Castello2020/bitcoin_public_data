I have heard from friends that Panama has very good incentives for those that wish to retire there. <p> <p>What I would be very interested in, would be to buy a plot of land and build my own home. Can you please let me know the situation for a British person buying land in your country? Also do you have any plots of land that sits back high up that over looks the Caribbean seas? <p> <p>Any advice would be great. I heard about Alto del Maria, although its not on the Caribbean side it is only an hour away from Panama city so that may be a compromise... What do you think?<p> <p>Look forward to hearing from you.<p> <p>Kind regards<p> <p>Richard Cartier

The Majority of North Americans speak only one language. Many people in Europe and Latin America we speak 2 Languages. Second: Living in Panama is much cheaper than in the United States for many reasons that are easy to investigate on the internet. Third : Crimes and crazy people are all over the world and in all countries that happens.

You can get by in your day to day activities without speaking Spanish. <p>Its a pain, but you can do it. One thing I noticed, is if you attempt to speak Spanish, you get a little more respect and suddenly someone who "Only speaks Spanish" starts talking to you in English.<p>A good knowlege of Spanish is almost required when things aren't day to day" like your car (or something in your apartment breaks), and accident, etc. It gets very difficult without speaking Spanish.<p>I say "almost" required because my Spanish is not good, and we have struggled through. I know people who have lived here 5 or 6 years who don't speak any Spanish, but I think that is the wrong approach.<p>2. Gasoline may be $1.00 cheaper in Miami, I don't know. But it is more expensive in Washington than in Panama. Not a lot, pretty much on par. Much cheaper than Canada.<p>3. Auto insurance $1300 in Panama, $650 in Miami<p>Don't know where you got your auto insurance, but ouch. I don't know anyone who spends anywhere near that much. Depending on coverage $200 and up.<p>4. Purchase Prices of Condos Higher than Miami<p>Maimi has crashed big time, so this is believable now. I know you could never get a water front condo anywhere on the west coast for $250, 000 though even with the crash. Any major city on the West coast would still be almost double. Like I said, I know Maimi crashed. As a side note, I checked out Ft. Lauderdale, and Panama is still cheaper for an equivelent condo. The gap is less than it used to be though, because the US nosed dived and Panama prices haven't dropped.<p>5. Getting things Done.<p>Ok, getting things done is a pain, especially if you don't speak Spanish. But it doesn't take 2 months for a drivers licence and 3 months for a vehicle license. It takes 1 or 2 days max for each depending on how prepared you are, and how early you start in the morning. And in the case of vehicle registration you can hire someone to do it for you. <p>6. You can't take Taxi's?<p>Ok, there is a risk. But there is a risk in the US that is just as high. In fact, I have heard of more US and Canada instances of problems in Taxis than in Panama.<p>You have to be careful for sure, but I have never had a problem and I used to take taxis all the time. <p>So, I would say risky yes, but a certain death or "Americans don't take taxis" is totally bogus. And "You cannot take public transit" as total garbage. Everyone takes public transit (at least taxis). <p>7. Groceries more Expensive than Miami.<p>Have to agree, at least for packaged goods and anything imported. You will definately pay more for your favorite brands of packaged goods. And good beef (which is I admit hard to come by). Produce and local poultry and seafood etc are much less expensive in Panama.<p>8. Clothing more Expensive in Panama<p>Hmm depends. Brand name clothing is similar or maybe more expensive in Panama. If you don't care about brand, you can definately get MUCH cheaper clothing here.<p>9. "Police will Shake You Down ..."<p>I don't see this. I know I have heard stories about bribes. But this is definately getting better. I have been stopped at several road checks and never had a problem. I got stopped for an infraction and got off with a warning. I had no idea I even broke a law. I did get the feeling he may have been fishing for a bribe, but I can't even say that for sure because my Spanish is bad. Overall, I am no where near as nervous here when I have a police car following me, than I am in the US.<p>10. Driving Unsafe<p>Yep, no argument here. They drive like maniacs. If you are a nervous driver to begin with, you do NOT want to drive in Panama city. But I have heard it is much worse in Costa Rica, Milan and other big cities. I can't argue though, it is crazy.<p>11. Crime / Murder Rate.<p>First of all, yes there is crime and it is bad. But I do want to put it in perspective. Crime is getting bad everywhere. Home invasions are off the charts in the US and Canada to.<p>One of our first trips here we heard a shootout in front of our condo. That gave us pause. It was 3 in the morning, and we were getting ready to go to the airport to fly back to the US.<p>The day we returned to the US though, there was a shoot out at the mall in Seattle, in the middle of the afternoon. So, shoot out in the middle of the night involving a couple of drug dealers or a shootout in the middle of the day in the middle of a mall where there are innocent people around?<p>Also, yes, the Murder rate is very high. But, a vast majority of those murders are between drug dealers. So the number in my opinion is sku'd. Murders involving foreigners is actually pretty rare (but happens).<p>Overall, Panama is not without its problems. But, there are problems everywhere. In my opinion, and that of my friends here, the benefit / problem ratio makes Panama a much better choice than the states.<p>But you have to make your own decision.<p>I included a link to an article about Casco Viejo that shows how contrasts in perspective can change your views. And why no one should tell you that you will hate (or even love) Panama.</td></tr></table><table border=0 cellpadding=5 width="100%" class='ubut'><tr><td width=150 valign=top><div class='bsmall'><a name="c1270837534"><b>Comment 17</b></a><br><b>04/09/10 14:25</b><br><div style='font-size: 12pt;'><b><b><a href="http://board.panamatotal.com/profiles/Glen_2" rel="author">Glen</a></b></b></div><div><ul class='star-rating'><li class='current-rating' style='width:37px;'></li></ul></div>International Citizen :-)<br><div onclick='return loginnow(4)'><img src="http://xp.loszona.com/xml/contact.png" width=75 height=16></div><script type="text/javascript">

They all know what it is like to live in this kind of life style, but they want the tropical weather and their goverment hasn't changed much over the years. We looked in Costa Rica last year and ran into some problems, and I really did not like the looks of that place. Bars on all the windows, scarey, but I would love to live in the David area or Mountain area, my husband farms and would love to have some new friends and tranquility. We know about not flashing money ect. but we will be on a fixed icome and want the weather and all. Now listened to all this I am scared to go in a way.

Panama City is very hectic and I do not recommend it to anyone who wants tranquility. Yes most all of the homes in Panama have bars on the windows, except in the newer developments. We just sold our home here in Washington state and are building in Boquete. We have made several trips and fell in love with the Boquete area on our first trip and bought a lot. We will be moving into a development called Montanas de Caldera. (No bars on the windows) Many many years ago, it was not safe to live in a country that supported the drug cartel. Panama with help from the US has done a great job cleaning up the country. I can tell you that I feel safer walking down the streets of Panama City and Boquete than I do in New York City or Chicago or LA. We too have been stopped at check points along the Panamerican Hwy. Never once have we felt we needed to bribe the police. I'm not saying this does not happen, we have just never experienced it. <p>I have said in this forum many times, "you are a guest in this country, treat them with respect and be kind, don't try and make them see the American way of doing things. Which is often very hurried." When you treat someone with kindness, often you will receive it in return. Like any place in the world you have issues that are hard to deal with, just keep your cool and relax. <p>The reason we decided on Boquete was they have a huge population of Americans and Canandians and no matter where you go in town, the Pensionado's invite you to sit at their table and chat. We have made some very good friends down there and are very excited about our final move which will be at the end of this year when our home is done.<p>Go--take the plunge. You will not regret it. This will be a new chapter in our life and we look forward to the challenge. Our kids think we are going through our second childhood. What a great second childhood it will be. </td></tr></table><table border=0 cellpadding=5 width="100%" class='ubut'><tr><td width=150 valign=top><div class='bsmall'><a name="c1271167169"><b>Comment 20</b></a><br><b>04/13/10 09:59</b><br><div style='font-size: 12pt;'><b><b><a href="http://board.panamatotal.com/profiles/Glen_2" rel="author">Glen</a></b></b></div><div><ul class='star-rating'><li class='current-rating' style='width:37px;'></li></ul></div>International Citizen :-)<br><div onclick='return loginnow(4)'><img src="http://xp.loszona.com/xml/contact.png" width=75 height=16></div><script type="text/javascript">

But please if you are going to show us examples or statistics please lets use Panama only as this is the forum we are on. Also I believe that you could walk down the streets in your current town and find many people who have had bad experiences in that town. I live in a small rural town in Washington state about 1 hour from Seattle and I can tell you we have crime here too. We have even had a few murders. But this is not the norm. My husband and I experienced a burglary in our home a few years ago and they stole about 40, 000 worth of stuff. They hit about seven homes in our area. So you see, , , , no matter where you live, this can happen. They never did catch the jerks who broke into our home and we never recovered any of our items. <p>I think some people are not as accepting of your life style as others. Even though that is no excuse to hinder an investigation. It sounds like you two had a great life together and maybe some day you will have that again with another. But if not, hope you find peace in Florida. As for us, we are going forward. Good luck and I truly am sorry for your loss. Our good friend just lost his partner of 18 years, at the age of 45.

Not everyone fits in everywhere. Panama City is not for the relaxing type. Driving is like NASCAR without the rules. The language barrier has not been that difficult because I have found many Panamanians eager to help, unlike how Mexicans are treated in the US. Yes, it is a hurry up and wait society. That is why you have to put yourself with people that know how to get things done. With the right paperwork, you can open a bank account within a few days...we did. Hiring a good lawyer, one that has been referred is a must. You also cannot depend on what anyone says...the laws are constantly changing....they don't take months to make rules. If Martinelli wants it...it happens tomorow. As for holidays, yes....the people party and things shut down. The main problem is that you don't have as many national chain stores and businesses unless you are in the malls so, just like 1950's America..they close and respect days like Mothers Day much more and don't work. But, you can still get anything you need at the malls. As for pricing....are you kidding? Penthouses that are 2200 sq. ft., on the ocean for $350, 000! Try finding that in Destin, FL for under $500, 000. New visitors should hire a driver. I have two great people if anyone needs names and numbers...it is worth it to spend $100/day to have a good driver with a nice car. To rent a Prado you will spend $100/day and be scared to death of driving and if you have a wreck, you have to go to court. You can also find these drivers at every hotel. I have a few tips. 1) keep your wine list at the table. If you give it back, they may charge you double what it was priced...especially in some restaurants in Uruguay. 2) If you are planning to move and not retire...technically you cannot work there...just like the US, you would need a work Visa. But, what most Americans do is work as consultants for Panamanians. Especially realtors. With Obamacare, I predict that many doctors will want to move to Panama. The problem is that they cannot practice unless they are Panamanian or go through the ten year process. But, with the new trade agreement with the US, hopefully that will change soon. 3) all taxis have to be painted yellow now and the colorful worn out school buses are being replaced as we speak and they will be bought by the government and turned into school buses which will definitely improve traffic as more will use them now that the new ones have A/C. I only had one instance where a taxi driver carried me through the scary part of Chorillo on the way to Amador at 10pm....very scary, but that is where most of the crime is that create those numbers. Every other taxi ride was great except for some crappy cars. Plan to spend $2 for short rides and $3 for across town. If you get a ride from one of the larger minivans near hotels, plan to spend twice that. 4) You have to throw away your thoughts of spending one day to go and get things...things like furniture mean purchasing and waiting for delivery....3-4 days and that is not guaranteed. The day before delivery, personally go by the store and confirm. Also, check your building admin for delivery times allowed. Offices usually do not allow any work or deliveries of large items during work hours. 5) Items sometimes cost a little more, but if you stay away from North American labels on groceries, etc. you will do fine. Where you save the most money is on services....a live in maid for $300/month. Lawyers for pennies compared to the US....doctors and chiropractors that even make housecalls...that is the huge difference in expenses. I have learned an immense amount and made many great connections in one year. I don't look at Panama as this wonderland that is better than the US. I look as Panama as a place to escape the oppression of US politics and as the dollar continues to crash...I suggest that anyone with some cash, buy something in Panama. Panama has seen growth of over 6% each year for the past 3 years...cannot say that about the US. I look at Panama as 1950's America....a budding infrastructure, but one with hope.</td></tr></table><table border=0 cellpadding=5 width="100%" class='ubut'><tr><td width=150 valign=top><div class='bsmall'><a name="c1294350437"><b>Comment 30</b></a><br><b>01/06/11 16:47</b><br><div style='font-size: 12pt;'><b><b>mike wilson</b></b></div><br></div></td><td valign=top><b>"las tablas"</b><br><br>Read all the messages on both pages and it seems there are more "ranters" then "ravers".

My first visit was approximately a year ago when I went to check out what I had read on the internet. I fell in love with the people and the place. I found a caring, smart female lawyer and within ten months got my permanent Pensionado visa. I have now visited Panama 4 times and intend to move there in 2012. <p>I have found the people very friendly and nobody has tried to scam me. I started renting and driving cars there on my second visit and I have had no problems. You do get used to the traffic pretty quickly and it is not any worse than driving in New York City. I got lost in a rainstorm near Gamboa and ended up in Chilebre, asked the locals for directions, found my way back to Corredor Norte. Once I got on that highway it was easy finding my way back home. Advice: Study a map of Panama city before you start driving. Once you get the general layout: Corredor Norte, Corredor Sur, Via Espana, Albrook, Amador, Tocumen, El Cangrejo you are in business. Driving outside Panama city is a piece of cake. It is fun exploring Santa Clara, Coronado etc. in your own rental car. I have also taken the regular bus from Albrook - National Transport Center to Colon. Hired a taxi for $40 dollars to give me a tour of Colon, The Freezone, Gatun Locks etc. The bus fare to Colon was about $2.50 each way, for each person. On my last trip I rented a car from ACE at the airport. I paid $46 per day ($9 per day plus a bunch of taxes, insurance and fees). I reserved the car on the Internet.<p>Hotels: On all my visits to PTY I stay at the Hotel Milan in El Cangrejo ($72 per night but @56 if you pay cash). I now pay $26 per night during the week with the Pensionado card. It is nice, clean and comfortable and within walking distance of nice restaurants, Veneto Casino, Via Argentina etc. Nice, tasty food in their small cafeteria (Breakfast for two for about $12. <p>At dinner their creole, steamed or fried Red Snapper (Pargo) is wonderful and cost about 10 bucks. Don Blas restaurant on Via Espana at the Via Argentina intersection- lovely interior decoration, great food, great service and cheap by U.S. standards.Try Their Langostinas (large prawns)!!!! N.B. There is a wide range of restaurant services and prices in Panama. I feel comfortable walking around El Cangrejo at midnight and later. Everbody I meet, greet me with 'Buenas' (they drop the Dias or Noches).<p>Bank: Got a letter of referral from my lawyer and two reference letters from my U.S. banks. Established a bank account at Banco General in a little over an hour. I have online banking and a debit card.<p>Knowing some Spanish is very helpful. I studied it in High School and did an intensive two week course in Madrid. There is a Spanish Language school on Via Espana. Buy a DVD online and learn some phrases. You can get by speaking English only but it is a lot more fun trying out your Spanish.<p>On my next visit in January, I plan to explore Bocas, David and Boquete.<p>Santa Clara has a very nice beach with clear water but the current is strong. Be careful and stay with others since there are no lifeguards.<p>I believe one should rent for a year before committing yourself to buying. PTY has a surplus of nice apartments at decent prices. Why not rent there for a year, get used to the place, people and language then you can do whatever you want after.<p>About me: early sixties, travelled with my wife, U.S citizen, California resident.<p>Hope, I helped a little.

But there are beautiful parts of the country just like there are in any place! As long as you give yourself some time to explore the areas and see what it has to offer, you will find if it's the right fit for you. Explore the cities, sit at the beach for a few hours, and scour Panama real estate to see what it has to offer.
