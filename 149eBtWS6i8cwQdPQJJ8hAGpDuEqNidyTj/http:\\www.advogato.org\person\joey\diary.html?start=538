<p><b>a special announcement from RMS</b></p>
<p>A little grep has told me that RMS is going to announce something special
on <a href="http://olduse.net/">olduse.net</a> in two weeks time, on 27 September 1983.
Best not to speculate about the details, but this announcement will be
something people are still talking about thirty years later. So it's an
event you and your news reader won't want to miss.</p>

<p>I have set up an IRC channel #olduse.net on FreeNode, and we'll see who
first spots the post!</p><p class="syndicated"><a href="http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/a_special_announcement_from_RMS/">Syndicated 2013-09-13 23:21:41  from see shy jo</a></p></div>

<p><b>a rope ladder to the dgit treehouse</b></p>
<p>Ian has said something along the lines of dgit being a private club; if
you're not in the club the strange git-centric views of its members don't
affect you. With that said, dgit is now a quite usable and nice tool and we
would like more people in the club.</p>

<p>To that end, here's one way to get into our little world where the Debian
source repository is really a collection of git repositories. I recently
made a new package and added it to Debian, and here is every command I
typed to do it (other than vim, lintian, and dpkg -i). As you read through,
notice that every command has to do with git in one way or another.</p>

<p>
  <code>git clone https://github.com/blake2-ppc/git-remote-gcrypt</code>
</p>

<p>This software makes git be able to push to encrypted git remotes. Very neat
stuff.</p>

<p>
  <code>git archive --format=tar origin/master -o | gzip &gt; ../git-remote-gcrypt_0.20130908.orig.tar.gz</code>
</p>

<p>Like most software on github, this one has no upstream tarball; its git
repository is its native source format. Needing to manually generate this
tarball appendix is the only unpleasant part of the process.</p>

<p>
  <code>git add debian</code>
  <br/><code>git commit -m debianization</code>
</p>

<p>Had to write 48 lines of control file and stuff to make the package build.</p>

<p>
  <code>dgit build -tc</code>
</p>

<p>This just runs <code>dpkg-buildpackage</code>. But you need to commit all files before running it.</p>

<p>
  <code>dgit push --new</code>
</p>

<p>The --new is needed because this is a new package. This created the git
repository for the package on alioth and pushed my changes and the upstream
history to it, as well as uploadng the package to incoming.</p><p class="syndicated"><a href="http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/a_rope_ladder_to_the_dgit_treehouse/">Syndicated 2013-09-09 00:33:24  from see shy jo</a></p></div>

<p><b>best DebConf ever</b></p>
<p>For me, DebConf13 in Switzerland was a perfect DebConf, and generally an
great developer meeting and conference. I've attended several past DebConfs
in Canada, Norway, Brazil, Finland, Mexico, Scotland, Spain, NYC, Bosnia,
and Nicaragua. I have special memories of each. DebConf13 was ideal in every
way.</p>

<p><a href="http://joeyh.name/blog/./pics/debconf13/tent.jpg"><img src="http://joeyh.name/blog/./entry/best_DebConf_ever/x250-tent.jpg" width="188" height="250" class="img"/></a>

<p>Let's start with the camping. Only a minority of us did it, and my campsite
was located in a small field behind a bar that was often noisy
<a href="http://joeyh.name/blog/./entry/good_morning/">late into the night</a>, when I was trying to rest and preserve
my European jetlag remedy of inverted sleeping schedule. Still, I love
sleeping cocooned in a tent, and going through the routines of camping and
spending time alone there was a good counterpoint to DebConf. I generally
find myself retreating for a day or two in the middle of a week-long
conference, burnt out with social interactions. That didn't happen this
time. I need to find way to camp at future DebConfs.</p>

<p>(Also special shout out to wonderful people who lent me a warmer sleeping
bag, and bought me a pillow while on a trip to town! Upgraded my first
backpacking in Europe experience's comfort level a lot!)</p>

<p><a href="http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2013/debconf13/low/976_Debian_Cosmology.ogv"><img src="http://joeyh.name/blog/./pics/debconf13/cosmology.png" width="363" height="267" class="img"/></a>
<a href="http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2013/debconf13/low/975_dh_busfactor.ogv"><img src="http://joeyh.name/blog/./pics/debconf13/dhtalk.png" width="320" height="267" class="img"/></a>
<a href="http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2013/debconf13/low/1060_ikiwiki_BoF.ogv"><img src="http://joeyh.name/blog/./pics/debconf13/ikiwikibof.jpg" width="360" height="267" class="img"/></a></p>

<p>The next perfect thing for me were the <a href="http://joeyh.name/blog/../talks/">talks</a> I gave at DebConf.
I always enjoy presenting at DebConf, and barely remember when I'd get
nervous doing it. But I really felt comfortable giving these
talks in a way I've not before. I'm pleased with how
the <a href="http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2013/debconf13/low/976_Debian_Cosmology.ogv">Debian Cosmology</a>
talk turned out; I'd worried it would be a downer talk, or too light,
or not well received, and none of those problems surfaced.</p>

<p>I was especially happy with my
<a href="http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2013/debconf13/low/975_dh_busfactor.ogv">dh_busfactor</a>
session, which I prepared for all of 10 minutes and was structured entirely
to benefit me by talking over my thoughts and getting feedback, and in
which I probably drove the camerapeople crazy running my own mic into the
audience. Despite all that, I think it succeeded being interesting for the
participants as well as for me. Hope to follow up on it soon..</p>

<p>But beyond the two talks I submitted, there were a series of ad-hoc
scheduled talks. It seemed that every day I spent at least an hour
discussing something I'm deeply involved in. This started with the
<a href="http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2013/debconf13/low/1060_ikiwiki_BoF.ogv">Ikiwiki bof</a>,
and then there was an epic series of (unrecorded) BoFs about git stuff,
which basically turned into an unofficial git track at DebConf.
Much, much discussion of git-annex and other things I'm involved in.</p>

<p>BTW, I really like that DebConf, as well as being a formal conference on
top, is really an un-conference underneath, with new BoFs and things
popping up on the schedule all week long. You can even have completely
unscheduled meetings that somehow get just the right mix of people
to make something awesome happen.<br/><a href="http://joeyh.name/blog/./pics/debconf13/heads.jpg"><img src="http://joeyh.name/blog/./pics/debconf13/heads.jpg" width="320" height="240" class="img"/></a></p>

<p>But it wasn't all about talks. Indeed, I only attended 2 or 3 sessions a
day. The DebConf13 venue was controversial, but I found it excellent for
getting things done. Rather than one or two massive rooms that get too
noisy to think in, this venue had many little nooks and crannies
suited for different types of work. There were so many I only discovered
some while walking down the hill as I was leaving the venue! Anchoring it
all was the excellent view, and I particularly enjoyed the "scenic hacklab".</p>

<p>I was particularly impressed with the flexability of the venue's
management. Someone asked if we could have cheese for breakfast, and every
breakfast thereafter had not one but often three excellent cheeses. One day
we'd be complaining that there were not enough vegetables in the food, and
the next we'd be eating an excellent vegetarian Swiss lunch. They even
apparently relaxed stringent Swiss rules on not allowing tents in
sightlines visible from people further up the hill. They were clearly happy
to welcome our crazy gathering to Le Camp. They let a DD borrow and use a
chain saw and build a bonfire!</p>

<p><a href="http://joeyh.name/blog/./pics/debconf13/chainsaw.jpg"><img src="http://joeyh.name/blog/./pics/debconf13/chainsaw.jpg" width="320" height="212" class="img"/></a>
<a href="http://joeyh.name/blog/./pics/debconf13/eveningwalk.jpg"><img src="http://joeyh.name/blog/./entry/best_DebConf_ever/x212-eveningwalk.jpg" width="283" height="212" class="img"/></a>
<a href="http://joeyh.name/blog/./pics/debconf13/boat.jpg"><img src="http://joeyh.name/blog/./pics/debconf13/boat.jpg" width="264" height="212" class="img"/></a></p>

<p>The venue also encouraged getting out and exploring the surrounding
countryside. Too often I end up spending the whole DebConf without seeing
much of the area around. This time I at least got down the hill to see the
castle in Vaumarcus a few times, and enjoyed many evening walks amoung the
grape fields.
The conference dinner (on a boat!) tied into this well too. And the daytrip
to CERN was a great addition. We got to poke around the control center for a
massive particle accellerator! My only regret is we didn't get a chance to
actually go inside the LHC tunnels.</p>

<p>Back to DebConf, another thing I really liked about this one was that its
location allowed several upstream authors of software in Debian (other than
the usual suspects who are both upstreams and Debian Developers) to attend.
I don't know if Lennart Poettering changed any minds about systemd with his
talk, but I was happy for the opportunity to buy him a beer. I didn't get
to Monty's talk, but it was excellent to see him attend as well.</p>

<p>Finally, I got to meet old friends I'd not seen in years, and new ones I've
not met in real life before. We're still not sure where this whole DebConf
thing is going -- will it be all about the cheese and wine party and
greybeards in 20 years time? But one thing we know is we enjoy our little
slice of the year where kilts and coding are equally unremarkable,
where problems that seem intractable online somehow solve themselves in
person, where we come away with ideas for an entire year and memories for a
lifetime.</p><p class="syndicated"><a href="http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/best_DebConf_ever/">Syndicated 2013-08-30 21:53:10  from see shy jo</a></p></div>

<p><b>idea: git push requests</b></p>
<p>This is an idea that Keith Packard told me. It's a brilliant way to reduce
GitHub's growing lockin, but I don't know how to implement it. And I almost
<em>forgot</em> about it, until I had another annoying "how do I send you a patch
with this amazing git technology?" experience and woke up with my memory
refreshed.</p>

<p>The idea is to allow anyone to <code>git push</code> to any anonymous git://
repository. But the objects pushed are not stored in a public part of the
repository (which could be abused). Instead the receiving repository emails
them off to the repository owner, in a <code>git-am</code>-able format.</p>

<p>So this is like a github pull request except it can be made on any git
repository, and you don't have to go look up the obfuscated contact email
address and jump through git-format-patch hoops to make it. You just commit
changes to your local repository, and <code>git push</code> to wherever you cloned
from in the first place. If the push succeeds, you know your patch is on
its way for review.</p>

<p>Keith may have also wanted to store the objects in the repository in some
way that a simple git command run there could apply them without the git-am
bother on the receiving end. I forget. I think git-am would be good enough
-- and including the actual diffs in the email would actually make this far
superior to github pull request emails, which are maximally annoying by not
doing so.</p>

<hr/><p>Hmm, I said I didn't know how to implement this, but I do know one way.
Make the git-daemon run an arbitrary script when receiving a push request.
A <code>daemon.pushscript</code> config setting could enable this.</p>

<p>The script could be something like this:</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
set -e
tmprepo="$(mktemp -d)"
# this shared clone is *really* fast even for huge repositories, and uses
# only a few 100 kb of disk space!
git clone --shared --bare "$GIT_DIR" "$tmprepo"
git-receive-pack "$tmprepo"
# XXX add email sending code here.
rm -rf "$tmprepo"
</pre>


<p>Of course, this functionality could be built into the git-daemon too. I
suspect a script hook and an example script in <code>contrib/</code> might be an
easier patch to get accepted into git though.</p>

<p>That may be as far as I take this idea, at least for now..</p><p class="syndicated"><a href="http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/idea:_git_push_requests/">Syndicated 2013-08-25 13:07:32  from see shy jo</a></p></div>

<p><b>experimental multiuser git-annex repository</b></p>
<p>On the last day of DebConf 13, RichiH and Ganneff and I set up a
git-annex repository that all Debian developers have automatic
commit access to, and
<a href="http://annex.debconf.org/debconf-share/">everyone can clone and browse</a>.
See <a href="http://lists.debconf.org/lurker/message/20130817.192726.d50afadf.en.html">the announcement email</a>.</p>

<p>This is an interesting repository for me for several reasons. Selfishly, I
have always wanted an easy way to download lots of DebConf photos for
offline viewing, and never seem to get around to downloading everything
from gallery.debconf.org when I have bandwidth. I've also wanted an example
repository that shows how git-annex can be used by a large group for
collaboration. Finally, the way this repository is set up with an incoming
queue is fairly unique.</p>

<p>With 430 files in the repository, totaling over 3.5 gigabytes (which doesn't
include all the talk videos that are #included into it),
and at least 18 people having cloned the repository so far,
the debconf-share repository is well on its way to being a sort of large
git-annex repository.</p>

<p>Just running <code>git annex whereis</code> is interesting; many of the files already
have 8 copies. Some talk videos are more popular than others and you can
see when they're downloaded too. But enough snooping.. ;)</p>

<p>So far people have uploaded mostly photos and talk slides. Other places
exist to store those things in the DebConf infrastructure, but it's nice
to have them all available in one tree. I particularly like today's
addition of <a href="http://annex.debconf.org/debconf-share/debconf13/photos/chrysn/">chrysn's files</a>
which include the raw photos and hugin files used to produce panoramas,
and then pull those together into a postcard which has all its sources
available.</p>

<p>In my corner of the debconf-share repository, I'm collecting together files
regarding the possibly-historic <a href="http://annex.debconf.org/debconf-share/debconf13/dpkg-source-git-re-re-redesign/">dpkg-source-git-re-re-redesign process</a>
that would have otherwise been scattered around various places and probably
not all published. This includes an hour long recording of the main
design session (recorded with permissions) made by my laptop's mic, which,
surprisingly, turned out to be pretty listenable. I will probably have more
to say about this process later, once Ian announces dgit.</p>

<p>So, we're still seeing how usage develops. I hope that having this
available during the next DebConf, and other Debian meetings, rather
than only at the end, will further facilitate file sharing and storage.
Especially if a fast clone is available right on the DebConf LAN. ;)</p>

<hr/><p>The technical details of how the repository is put together are:</p>

<ul><li>There's a repository on git.debian.org, which piggy-backs on the collab-maint
group, so most Debian people have commit access to it.</li>
<li>git-annex is used to upload files to that repository, as an incoming
queue.</li>
<li>A git-annex-shell <code>annex-content</code> hook is run whenever someone uploads
a file to there. It moves all annexed content over to annex.debconf.org
for publication.
This involves some ugly but safe stuff to do with publically readable
restricted use ssh private keys. It was the hardest piece to get working,
and is only necessary because we don't want to bloat git.debian.org with this
stuff and it's not practical to give everyone logins to
annex.debconf.org.</li>
<li>As an additional guard against accidental bloat, the git.debian.org
repository will refuse to accept uploads when there is less than 5 gb
free disk.</li>
<li>annex.debconf.org was set up following the
<a href="http://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/setup_a_public_repository_on_a_web_site/">git-annex public repository on a web site howto</a>.</li>
</ul><p>I've found at least 4 bugs in git-annex as a result of this repository,
which is a rather unusual use case. And fixed 2 of them so far..</p><p class="syndicated"><a href="http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/experimental_multiuser_git-annex_repository/">Syndicated 2013-08-21 20:20:18  from see shy jo</a></p></div>

<p><b>Debian at 20</b></p>
<p>RichiH used flint and steel to light the bonfire. We carefully fed it up
from those sparks to a blaze. Put on the biggest logs we could find
to make it last. Now I'm sitting on the hill above it watching folks
gathered around. A poem is being read, in Hindi, then
translated for us to English. Others have shared songs and poems in a dozen
languages, both classics and their own. Out below the darkness of
the lake. This is Debian at 20.</p>

<p>At the start of this DebConf, I gave a talk on
"<a href="http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2013/debconf13/high/976_Debian_Cosmology.ogv">Debian Cosmology</a>.
In that (and a later
"<a href="http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2013/debconf13/high/975_dh_busfactor.ogv">dh_busfactor</a>"
talk) I shared my hopes and my fears.
I was conflicted about giving the this talk, worked on it for weeks,
felt it might not work, or be depressing. I've had nothing but good
comments about it.</p>

<p>20 years is ages in internet time and technical projects ossify over time.
The last session I was in this afternoon was a presentation of a new tool,
which I hope &amp; feel has the potential to fundamentally change an important
and suboptimal part of Debian. Then I walked outside to a rainbow over
crystal clear Swiss alps on the horizon. How encouraging, and what a nice
story that will be around some future campfire.</p><p class="syndicated"><a href="http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/Debian_at_20/">Syndicated 2013-08-16 22:16:42  from see shy jo</a></p></div>

<p><b>please build a haskell to perl compiler</b></p>
<p>The <a href="http://fay-lang.org/">Fay compiler</a> is a simple way to build fairly
comprehensible javascript code from Haskell source.</p>

<p>It occurs to me that it should be rather easy to modify Fay to emit perl
code rather than javascript. This would allow contributing things like
plugins to various perl programs, without writing perl.</p>

<p>Of course, the same idea could probably be used to compile Haskell to other
languages like python, but perl seems particularly well suited as a second
Fay target, since javascript and it have quite similar syntax and similar
support for features like closures which Fay relies on.</p>

<p>I do not have time to work on this idea myself. It would be a good project
for a beginning Haskell programmer. You probably don't even need to fully
understand monads to do it! Essentially, look at
<a href="https://github.com/faylang/fay/wiki/Generated-code">Fay output examples</a>,
translate them from javascript to perl, and then much of the code changes
in Fay would probably be in simple string generation code.</p>
