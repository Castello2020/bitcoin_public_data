<p><b>southern fried science fiction with plum sauce</b></p>
<p>Had an afternoon of steak and science fiction. Elysium is only so-so, but
look what we found in a bookstore that was half religious materials and
half SF, local books, and carefully hidden romance novels:</p>

markets Tomoko tells us about when she casually pulls out the good stuff at
family gatherings. I will be back for whole ducks, fresh fish, squid, 50
lb bags of rice, tamarind paste, fresh ginger that has not sat on the shelf
for 2 months because only I buy it, etc. Only an hour from home in the woods!

got for $10 today and this week's CSA surprise of 18 inch

<p><b>idea: git push requests</b></p>
<p>This is an idea that Keith Packard told me. It's a brilliant way to reduce
GitHub's growing lockin, but I don't know how to implement it. And I almost
<em>forgot</em> about it, until I had another annoying "how do I send you a patch
with this amazing git technology?" experience and woke up with my memory
refreshed.</p>

<p>The idea is to allow anyone to <code>git push</code> to any anonymous git://
repository. But the objects pushed are not stored in a public part of the
repository (which could be abused). Instead the receiving repository emails
them off to the repository owner, in a <code>git-am</code>-able format.</p>

<p>So this is like a github pull request except it can be made on any git
repository, and you don't have to go look up the obfuscated contact email
address and jump through git-format-patch hoops to make it. You just commit
changes to your local repository, and <code>git push</code> to wherever you cloned
from in the first place. If the push succeeds, you know your patch is on
its way for review.</p>

<p>Keith may have also wanted to store the objects in the repository in some
way that a simple git command run there could apply them without the git-am
bother on the receiving end. I forget. I think git-am would be good enough
-- and including the actual diffs in the email would actually make this far
superior to github pull request emails, which are maximally annoying by not
doing so.</p>

<hr/><p>Hmm, I said I didn't know how to implement this, but I do know one way.
Make the git-daemon run an arbitrary script when receiving a push request.
A <code>daemon.pushscript</code> config setting could enable this.</p>

<p>The script could be something like this:</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
set -e
tmprepo="$(mktemp -d)"
# this shared clone is *really* fast even for huge repositories, and uses
# only a few 100 kb of disk space!
git clone --shared --bare "$GIT_DIR" "$tmprepo"
git-receive-pack "$tmprepo"
# XXX add email sending code here.
rm -rf "$tmprepo"
</pre>


<p>Of course, this functionality could be built into the git-daemon too. I
suspect a script hook and an example script in <code>contrib/</code> might be an
easier patch to get accepted into git though.</p>

<p>That may be as far as I take this idea, at least for now..</p><p class="syndicated"><a href="http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/idea:_git_push_requests/">Syndicated 2013-08-25 13:07:32  from see shy jo</a></p></div>

<p><b>experimental multiuser git-annex repository</b></p>
<p>On the last day of DebConf 13, RichiH and Ganneff and I set up a
git-annex repository that all Debian developers have automatic
commit access to, and
<a href="http://annex.debconf.org/debconf-share/">everyone can clone and browse</a>.
See <a href="http://lists.debconf.org/lurker/message/20130817.192726.d50afadf.en.html">the announcement email</a>.</p>

<p>This is an interesting repository for me for several reasons. Selfishly, I
have always wanted an easy way to download lots of DebConf photos for
offline viewing, and never seem to get around to downloading everything
from gallery.debconf.org when I have bandwidth. I've also wanted an example
repository that shows how git-annex can be used by a large group for
collaboration. Finally, the way this repository is set up with an incoming
queue is fairly unique.</p>

<p>With 430 files in the repository, totaling over 3.5 gigabytes (which doesn't
include all the talk videos that are #included into it),
and at least 18 people having cloned the repository so far,
the debconf-share repository is well on its way to being a sort of large
git-annex repository.</p>

<p>Just running <code>git annex whereis</code> is interesting; many of the files already
have 8 copies. Some talk videos are more popular than others and you can
see when they're downloaded too. But enough snooping.. ;)</p>

<p>So far people have uploaded mostly photos and talk slides. Other places
exist to store those things in the DebConf infrastructure, but it's nice
to have them all available in one tree. I particularly like today's
addition of <a href="http://annex.debconf.org/debconf-share/debconf13/photos/chrysn/">chrysn's files</a>
which include the raw photos and hugin files used to produce panoramas,
and then pull those together into a postcard which has all its sources
available.</p>

<p>In my corner of the debconf-share repository, I'm collecting together files
regarding the possibly-historic <a href="http://annex.debconf.org/debconf-share/debconf13/dpkg-source-git-re-re-redesign/">dpkg-source-git-re-re-redesign process</a>
that would have otherwise been scattered around various places and probably
not all published. This includes an hour long recording of the main
design session (recorded with permissions) made by my laptop's mic, which,
surprisingly, turned out to be pretty listenable. I will probably have more
to say about this process later, once Ian announces dgit.</p>

<p>So, we're still seeing how usage develops. I hope that having this
available during the next DebConf, and other Debian meetings, rather
than only at the end, will further facilitate file sharing and storage.
Especially if a fast clone is available right on the DebConf LAN. ;)</p>

<hr/><p>The technical details of how the repository is put together are:</p>

<ul><li>There's a repository on git.debian.org, which piggy-backs on the collab-maint
group, so most Debian people have commit access to it.</li>
<li>git-annex is used to upload files to that repository, as an incoming
queue.</li>
<li>A git-annex-shell <code>annex-content</code> hook is run whenever someone uploads
a file to there. It moves all annexed content over to annex.debconf.org
for publication.
This involves some ugly but safe stuff to do with publically readable
restricted use ssh private keys. It was the hardest piece to get working,
and is only necessary because we don't want to bloat git.debian.org with this
stuff and it's not practical to give everyone logins to
annex.debconf.org.</li>
<li>As an additional guard against accidental bloat, the git.debian.org
repository will refuse to accept uploads when there is less than 5 gb
free disk.</li>
<li>annex.debconf.org was set up following the
<a href="http://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/setup_a_public_repository_on_a_web_site/">git-annex public repository on a web site howto</a>.</li>
</ul><p>I've found at least 4 bugs in git-annex as a result of this repository,
which is a rather unusual use case. And fixed 2 of them so far..</p><p class="syndicated"><a href="http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/experimental_multiuser_git-annex_repository/">Syndicated 2013-08-21 20:20:18  from see shy jo</a></p></div>

<p><b>Debian at 20</b></p>
<p>RichiH used flint and steel to light the bonfire. We carefully fed it up
from those sparks to a blaze. Put on the biggest logs we could find
to make it last. Now I'm sitting on the hill above it watching folks
gathered around. A poem is being read, in Hindi, then
translated for us to English. Others have shared songs and poems in a dozen
languages, both classics and their own. Out below the darkness of
the lake. This is Debian at 20.</p>

<p>At the start of this DebConf, I gave a talk on
"<a href="http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2013/debconf13/high/976_Debian_Cosmology.ogv">Debian Cosmology</a>.
In that (and a later
"<a href="http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2013/debconf13/high/975_dh_busfactor.ogv">dh_busfactor</a>"
talk) I shared my hopes and my fears.
I was conflicted about giving the this talk, worked on it for weeks,
felt it might not work, or be depressing. I've had nothing but good
comments about it.</p>

<p>20 years is ages in internet time and technical projects ossify over time.
The last session I was in this afternoon was a presentation of a new tool,
which I hope &amp; feel has the potential to fundamentally change an important
and suboptimal part of Debian. Then I walked outside to a rainbow over
crystal clear Swiss alps on the horizon. How encouraging, and what a nice
story that will be around some future campfire.</p><p class="syndicated"><a href="http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/Debian_at_20/">Syndicated 2013-08-16 22:16:42  from see shy jo</a></p></div>

<p><b>please build a haskell to perl compiler</b></p>
<p>The <a href="http://fay-lang.org/">Fay compiler</a> is a simple way to build fairly
comprehensible javascript code from Haskell source.</p>

<p>It occurs to me that it should be rather easy to modify Fay to emit perl
code rather than javascript. This would allow contributing things like
plugins to various perl programs, without writing perl.</p>

<p>Of course, the same idea could probably be used to compile Haskell to other
languages like python, but perl seems particularly well suited as a second
Fay target, since javascript and it have quite similar syntax and similar
support for features like closures which Fay relies on.</p>

<p>I do not have time to work on this idea myself. It would be a good project
for a beginning Haskell programmer. You probably don't even need to fully
understand monads to do it! Essentially, look at
<a href="https://github.com/faylang/fay/wiki/Generated-code">Fay output examples</a>,
translate them from javascript to perl, and then much of the code changes
in Fay would probably be in simple string generation code.</p>

a new take on the hopelessly blocked dpkg-source v3 (git) format.</p>

<p>A diagram of the new plan, which should meet all ftpmaster requirements,
