Thanks the log file did help. I asked my hosting provider about their redirects and they said moving me to an updated server would help but now it just redirects to this site purechimp.com. They are not being very forthcoming with a solution as I think they want me to pay them to install it but I don't see why I should pay to not have my sites redirected somewhere else!

Thank you. Although there's still work to do I think you answered as completely you could given the situation. Aside from that I have been trying to find the place where my PS1 is set for ages and finally I can get rid of the annoying PS1='\h:\W \u\$ 'and replace it with PS1='> ' thanks to you +1
