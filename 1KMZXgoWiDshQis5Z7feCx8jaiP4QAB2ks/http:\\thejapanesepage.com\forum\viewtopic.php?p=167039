(meaning e.g. "Should I start drawing my line from there?"). But if the context doesn't suggest anything like that, then I'm not sure. I could guess, but it'd be a guess. (I'm not particularly good with Japanese.) It might be something like "Is that why it's OK?"... but then, it might not.sore nara ii desu ka?I'm pretty sure that this would generally be "Is it OK if that's the case?" -- unless the "sore" refers to a noun, in which case, mentally substitute the noun. "Ringo nara ii desu ka?" (= "Is it OK if it's an apple?")

by takiras » Sun 10.17.2010 9:59 am それからいいですか - I'd guess the それ here would be referring to previously-mentioned things, so it might be literally 'Is that OK?'I totally agree with furrykef on the second sentence.

by Hyperworm » Sun 10.17.2010 10:08 am 「それから、」can mean "also", so it might be that.It could mean a range of different things depending on the context though.Provide more context if you want better answers. fun translation snippets | need something translated?BTC@1KMZXgoWiDshQis5Z7feCx8jaiP4QAB2ks

Re: Sore ...
by rachxo » Sun 10.17.2010 12:35 pm Thank you all for the feedback! I would have provided more context but it was a fill in the blank and it didn't give me much. It was a scenario at a doctors office and the doctor asked the patient to sit on the table, etc etc.. and I had to choose an answer out of those ones. I should have included that - my bad! But anyways thank you again. rachxo
