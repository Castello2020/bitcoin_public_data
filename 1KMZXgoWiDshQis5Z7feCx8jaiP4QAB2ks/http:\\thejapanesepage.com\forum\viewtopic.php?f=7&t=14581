怖くないと。。。。?
by katafei » Thu 06.10.2010 8:14 am I'm watching a movie, やわらかい生活 , and was wondering about the use of this と :context:man and woman are talking after having attended a memorial service of a late mom. The guy is lighting one sigaret with another and the woman says:ガンが怖い？死ぬの怖い？。。。。Man:怖くないと。。。。? (with a rising intonation...)Can anyone tell me what is the exact function of this　と in this sentence?
We are all but images of our time

by Hyperworm » Thu 06.10.2010 9:21 am It'd be interesting to know the tone of the woman's statements here too...It could be「（君は）（癌や死ぬことなどが）怖くないと（言うのか）…？」( If the man's tone wasn't questioning, it could instead be: )「（俺は）怖くないと（思う）…」

by katafei » Thu 06.10.2010 10:51 am hmmm, I'm a little too tired to figure out the intonation you're giving the woman...but after hearing the と a couple more times used by the same character, I realise now it is being used as a question marker....as for the conversation, my interpretation is like this:<<Hey...! (being a little angry he lights his next sigaret with his first...) what are you doing....aren't you afraid (you'll get) of cancer....aren't you afraid to die...?.....Aren't you afraid?>>Does that sound about right?

by Snowflake » Thu 06.10.2010 12:42 pm Going ever-so-slightly off topic here (sorry), but with the word "sigaret" are you going for the English word "cigarette"? When I read your first post, I thought a "sigaret" might be some sort of Japanese funeral ritual item that is lit to honor the dead.I wish I could provide guidance on your original question (the significance of と in the example), but I'm so much of a beginner I wouldn't have even known enough to ask the question. Now I'm curious to know the answer.

by Harisenbon » Thu 06.10.2010 9:22 pm I think seeing the clip would clear it up alot, but here's my take on it:ガンが怖い？死ぬの怖い？Are you scared of cancer?Are you scared of dying?怖くないと・・・(怖くないといったら?）"What would it mean if I said I wasn't scared..."Maybe?

by NileCat » Fri 06.11.2010 10:33 am Although there are a couple of possibilities, I for one assume that:（私が） 怖くないと（でも）（あなたは思うのか）？＝　（怖いさ、もちろん）And both of Hyperworm's and Harisenbon's sound fine to me too.

by katafei » Fri 06.11.2010 11:44 am ah, yes, I see where you're going...that does undermine my statement it was used as a question marker on at least one other occasion....I'll see if I can temporarily upload some scenes on youtube this weekend...But, thanks!
