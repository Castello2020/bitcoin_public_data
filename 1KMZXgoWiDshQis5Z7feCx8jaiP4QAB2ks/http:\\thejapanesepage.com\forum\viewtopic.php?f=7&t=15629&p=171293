よう after -たい
by SomeStupidName » Mon 08.29.2011 9:25 pm No, not 太陽.I feel like this is a bit of a novice-y question, but I'll often see よう in hiragana after a verb in the たい form (食べたい、いきたい、その他です。). What meaning does this add, and what would be a decent English parallel to this grammatical feature, if any? お世話になっております。　SomeStupidName

Re: よう after -たい
by Hyperworm » Tue 08.30.2011 9:53 am More context would be nice (specific sentences), but I think I can take a guess without it.If there's nothing after the よう, then this is just the normal sentence ending particle よ stretched out (also seen: よー, よぅ), which makes it sound a little more (deliberately) childish/whiny/longing. A similar sort of effect exists with extending vowels in English, I think.

by SomeStupidName » Tue 08.30.2011 5:04 pm Ah, that actually does make sense in context (apologies for lack of clarification). I would have expected ー to be used instead, but there you go. Thanks. :>

Re: よう after -たい
by furrykef » Tue 09.06.2011 11:06 pm Always, always supply an example sentence if at all possible! It helps prevent confusion.It seems more likely to me that this is actually the よう as in "seems". 食べたいようです = looks like he wants to eat. The です can be replaced with だ and it can probably be dropped altogether.
