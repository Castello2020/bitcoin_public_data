パズルメイとお絵かきメイと
by paste » Fri 02.26.2010 11:19 am おはよう~I was hoping someone might be able to help me with something: I bought the game in the title a loooong time ago, but now I've gotten to a puzzle that seems to have a bug in it. On the むずかしい difficulty level, puzzle 103 (in color), It seems like a have the right answer, but when I click the complete button, it says there's a mistake. Would anyone who speaks good japanese be able to help me search for information about this online? My japanese is a bit limited and the searches I did weren't very helpful.どうもありがとう！paste

Thanks ;]pasteI just got suspicious when I first read it... and then when I tried to google it and got zero results I was pretty sure... so I changed them and it worked. I don't want to mislead anyone into thinking I really know what I'm talking about. I'm just an eternal newbie. 猿も木から落ちる

Re: パズルメイトお絵かきメイト
by Hyperworm » Sat 02.27.2010 2:53 pm Color picross, huh. It seems much more likely that you just made a single mistake on one of the rows and haven't spotted it... >_< Check, check, and check again. :/I tried Googling for puzzle solutions but couldn't find anything. :/The key word for this kind of search is normally 攻略.It means "capture" or "conquer" ("gain dominance over", "master").A 攻略法 is "a method for how to capture/master/conquer/beat something". 攻略本 and 攻略ガイド mean "strategy guide".A 攻略wiki is a basically a FAQ/walkthrough in wiki form.etc.It doesn't look like anyone's made one for that game, though.

Re: パズルメイとお絵かきメイト
by paste » Sat 02.27.2010 5:39 pm Thanks Hyperworm.Unfortunately, I've checked and rechecked and it's correct in the rows but still telling me there's an error. That's only part of the problem, though. See, there's a mechanism in the game where if you tap on a square that is incorrect, it will put an X there for a second and won't fill it in with the color you are trying to enter. So there's a column in this particular puzzle I'm trying where the smallest number is 2. There's a piece colored in and I tap above it and it gives me the X. I tap below it and it gives me the X also. So there's definitely a problem in the puzzle.I was hoping maybe there was some kind of errata listed online, since this isn't the first puzzle in the game that's been incorrect, but I don't really know how to search for it I don't blame the developers, though, because there are a TON of puzzles in the cartridge so a couple with problems isn't so bad.Thank you for the help though!
