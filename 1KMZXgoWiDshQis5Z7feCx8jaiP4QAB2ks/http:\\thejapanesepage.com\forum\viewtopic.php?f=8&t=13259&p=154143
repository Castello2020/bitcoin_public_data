He is cooking. He is being cooked.
by guitarplayer7694 » Sun 05.31.2009 4:25 pm 彼は料理しています。彼を料理しています。Am I right in thinking that the first is "He is cooking", and the second is "He is being cooked"? A simple confusion of particles and you've made a terrible mistake.

A simple confusion of particles and you've made a terrible mistake.彼が料理しています means "He is cooking"; 彼は料理しています could theoretically be either "He is cooking" or "[Someone] is cooking him". Obviously 99% of the time it's going to mean "He is cooking", but は can mark either an object or subject of a verb.

Re: He is cooking. He is being cooked.
by guitarplayer7694 » Sun 05.31.2009 4:44 pm So 彼を料理しています isn't even a proper sentence?

by NocturnalOcean » Sun 05.31.2009 5:09 pm It's an active sentence. Which means "Someone " is cooking him.If you want passive, you need passive.彼は料理されています

Re: He is cooking. He is being cooked.
by Hyperworm » Sun 05.31.2009 10:12 pm (this may be obvious but)The two above posts that reference "someone" don't intend to imply that you can actually translate it as "someone". Where the subject isn't mentioned, it's understood to be a pronoun - "he"/"she"/"I"/"you"/etc, i.e. a known person. Which person is actually meant should be made obvious by the context.

Which means "Someone " is cooking him.If you want passive, you need passive.Unfortunately (for clarity) the passive voice can also be used in Japanese merely as a sort of politeness device, in which case the meaning is not passive at all.
Never underestimate my capacity for pettiness.

A simple confusion of particles and you've made a terrible mistake.Well, one thing about this sentence is that 料理する means more "prepare food" than "cook," so in that sense 彼を would be kind of strange and probably not misunderstood ("he" is not food, so you can't prepare him as such!).If you wanted to come up with a confusing sentence, try 彼が焼いてる。 It could mean either "he is cooking" or "he is cooking" Searching for models and actors in Tokyo.

Re: He is cooking. He is being cooked.
by Okayamapiper » Sun 06.14.2009 9:22 pm 彼は料理をしています。He is cooking.彼を料理をしています。In this sentence, the subject is omitted but assumed to be the speaker and the sentence itself would not have any meaning pertaining to cooking as it would literally mean "I am cooking him". 料理can also mean to process, deal with, handle, treat....For example, 敵を料理する would be transled as "I defeated my opponent."ピッチャがバッターを料理した。The pitcher struck out the batter.For "He is being cooked" you would need the passive voice, requiring the される/られる　form.

Just to reiterate, you cannot have two を in one clause; if the second one is dropped this is fine.

Re: He is cooking. He is being cooked.
by Okayamapiper » Mon 06.15.2009 12:10 am Sorry about the error. Typing Japanese without rechecking for grammatical errors was an error on my part. I will be more careful in the future. 日本語の文を確認せずにポストをした結果です。これから気をつけます。よろしくお願いします。
