Re: How do you translate "I live for nothing"?
by Hyperworm » Mon 04.13.2009 11:47 pm I'd say何のためにも生きていない。Or perhaps何かのために生きてるんじゃない。?It's a bit of a vague sentence originally, though. For instance, is the speaker supposed to sound depressed that he has no reason to live, or is he celebrating the fact that he doesn't have to waste his life for someone/something else, or is he being philosophical and saying "I don't have a reason or purpose to live; I just live", or...? Translating phrases which sound cool but have fuzzy/ill-defined/no meaning is a bit tricky >_>

by sampaguita » Tue 04.14.2009 5:23 am Let's just say that the speaker has no specific feelings for this -- he merely states the fact that he lives for nothing in particular. How would that be translated then? Thanks!

The intent is the OP's but they are trying to be vague so no one thinks they are pathetic or something.To the OP, if you aren't sure what context is, try asking and answering these questions..who? what? where? when? why? and how?

by Sairana » Tue 04.14.2009 11:39 pm For comparison, I asked one of my friends, completely randomly, what it means when someone says, "I live for nothing."Her answer was, "I don't know, why'd they say it?"Even in English, the answer requires context.

Re: How do you translate "I live for nothing"?
by sampaguita » Thu 04.16.2009 12:11 am I'm thinking of it as an answer to the question "What do you live for?"A: What do you live for?B: I live for nothing.Something like that. sampaguita

Re: How do you translate "I live for nothing"?
by furrykef » Thu 04.16.2009 12:32 am But "I live for nothing" is supposed to mean something, and it isn't obvious to us what that means, so how you translate it depends on what is meant by it. Taking your conversation, let's suppose it went like this:A: What do you live for?B: I live for nothing.A: Really? What do you mean by that?We need to know B's response to that before we can continue. You seem to be assuming that there's some magical, neutral, one-size-fits-all meaning of the phrase that can be translated, but I think there really isn't one.You see, when you translate into another language, to do the job properly, you can't just translate words and phrases. You must translate what they mean, not the words they used. Sometimes you can do it using similar phrasing, but, well, sometimes you can't.- Kef

Re: How do you translate "I live for nothing"?
by sampaguita » Thu 04.16.2009 10:44 pm Hmmm...yeah I get the point. This is a rather sensitive subject, so I guess that's where the confusion comes about.My basic question is, how do use "tame ni" when there is no reason to start with? I'm used to sentences like母のためにいっしょうけんめいはたらく。木村さんのためのペンを買いました。But what if there is no purpose at all? Do you use なんのためにもはたらかない。べつのためにはたらかない。このペンはだれのためにも買わなかった。Is there anything wrong with these sentences? Thanks!

This is a rather sensitive subject, so I guess that's where the confusion comes about.No, it has nothing to do with the subject being sensitive. I'm still not entirely sure what "I live for nothing" means in English, so I have no chance of being able to express it in Japanese.My basic question is, how do use "tame ni" when there is no reason to start with?You don't. "tame ni" expresses a purpose or reason, so you don't use it when there's no purpose or reason. 理由はない can mean "I have no reason".
