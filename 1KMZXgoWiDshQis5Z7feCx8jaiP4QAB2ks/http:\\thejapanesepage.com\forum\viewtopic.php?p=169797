Manga with furigana?
by ダラゴスちゃん » Mon 04.04.2011 7:10 am Hey,I'm wondering if anyone knows any manga that uses furigana in it, or a website that uploads pages with furigana. I think that would help me learn kanji a bit more.Thanks,ダラゴスちゃん

by domokun1134 » Fri 04.15.2011 3:50 pm I'm reading Pandora Hearts, and it uses full furigana. Quite a great series too. Seems most shonen manga uses furigana.
