Bloodred Moon
by Relye » Wed 06.25.2008 9:43 pm Guess I'm kinda weird, I named my sword, and I can't seem to find out what it would be in japaneseSo far I've came up with 血液の赤い弦月, ketsueki no akai gengetsu. Mainly what I'm wondering is, if there is a single word for 'bloodred' as 'ketsueki no akai' is kinda long, and if there is no other way, is 'ketsueki' or 'chishio' the best word for 'blood'.Sorry if you got confused with all the apostrophes.PS: I know getsu/getsuei/getsuga are better words for moon, gengetsu simply has a better ring to it, and my sources says it means crescent moon, so no obligations there either .Edit: Come to think of it, would crimson, 辛苦 shinku, mean the same, can't quite remember. Also the word cut, to cut something, what would that be, out of the words that popped up, 'kire', 'kireme' and 'wakemae' seems best, from my knowledge through animes . 'Kizu' also looks cool.Hoping for someone to help me on these matters, thanks in advance if someone decides to help.

by spin13 » Thu 06.26.2008 12:21 pm I think you guys are missing the important question here: is the sword a boy or a girl?Oh, and good job on 辛苦. I think it works.
You're probably not as smart as you think.Unskilled and Unaware

Sorry for him, though I don't know who he is, and thanks to the one above, I believe crimson is the color resembling bloodred.

by richvh » Thu 06.26.2008 1:50 pm Tony should stop talking in the third person. It confuses the newbies.辛苦 is not crimson. The IME is not always your friend.

Re: Bloodred Moon
by AJBryant » Thu 06.26.2008 2:38 pm There are times when Tony likes using the third person. Like when he is of two minds on something (although, admittedly, third-person plural might fit better, or perhaps just first-person plural). Sometimes, he is of three minds. But then he drinks more scotch until one or more superfluous minds pass out and leave him alone.Tony

Re: Bloodred Moon
by Hyperworm » Thu 06.26.2008 2:40 pm OK, sorry people, but I'm going to give this a go I think for a snappy name you'd want a kanji compound, not a phrase featuring relatively common words. I'd avoid adjectives and complete nouns and try to keep it below four characters.People are toying with this thread for two reasons, I think:- the ridiculousness of seriously giving a sword a name in real life;- the fact that you're clearly at too early a stage of learning to do this properly (before you even know what the verb "to cut" is or how to properly look it up, apparently).But anyway, I think people are taking the "sword name" thing too seriously I don't think there's anything wrong with making cool kanji compounds in itself; it's a fun exercise (even if not terribly useful ). Anyone feel like looking past the faults of the OP and giving this a go? I'm interested in clever kanji names.紅月（べにげつ） is a start... could we use 紅血（こうけつ） in some way?Edit: @ Tony

Re: Bloodred Moon
by two_heads_talking » Thu 06.26.2008 4:35 pm Lol, Tony, you will have to forgive my previous outburst. I couldn't think of a better person to do third person than the Rock. The Rock was always talking in third person and your third person antics earlier and my affinity for WWE just seemed to mesh perfectly..
