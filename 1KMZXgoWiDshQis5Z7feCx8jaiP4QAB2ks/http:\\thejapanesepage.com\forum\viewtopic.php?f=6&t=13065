Creating kanji or chinese symbols as an art-form
by kentaku_sama » Wed 04.22.2009 2:11 am I thought since Kanji and japanese symbols were so beautiful and awesome, I would like to create some totally original symbols just for fun, not to use in context!! I thought that it would be kinda neat to paint them in brush caligraphy and give them a reading. I wonder if this could be considered an art form. Another thing about it is that you could even go beyond kanji and chinese normal radicles and invent some totally orignal radicles and even strokes like this symbol: The radicle on the left is not in any japanese or chinese symbol. ALthough If I wanted to input them into a computer that is impossible (for free) as far as I know. I've tried but using Private character editor makes a HORRIBLE mess when making a kanji.here's one I made as kind of a joke: LOL! It means "to party"

by kentaku_sama » Wed 04.22.2009 6:32 pm Sure here you go, that symbol means Icicle and it has the "Icicle" radicle to the left. .

by Hyperworm » Wed 04.22.2009 8:26 pm *whoosh*Do I really need to put more than that in this post?Oh alright then...It's an interesting idea. The balance of your character construction could do with a little work though; they feel a bit misproportioned. fun translation snippets | need something translated?BTC@1KMZXgoWiDshQis5Z7feCx8jaiP4QAB2ks

Re: Creating kanji or chinese symbols as an art-form
by furrykef » Wed 04.22.2009 9:49 pm What Mike Cash was trying to subtly point out was that you kept spelling "radical" as "radicle". So he spelled "icicle" as "icical", deliberately making the reverse mistake. (I didn't get it either at first, but that's 'cause I didn't notice the "radicle" spelling mistake.)

Well I still like the icicle symbol.

Re: Creating kanji or chinese symbols as an art-form
by AJBryant » Thu 04.23.2009 3:08 pm I also enjoy fake kanji.But something that needs to be understood is *how* kanji are made -- rather than just being random applications of radicals... er, radicles... radicals, there is a method to the madness.Consider these new kanji:Kanji one could be icicle -- because it indicates ICE under a ROOF. (I almost went with an ice radical and 屋... maybe I should have).So....What are the other three kanji?Kanji two: 鬼＋母　＝【きょういくまま】Kanji three:【ジャングル】(Under the logical progression of 木=tree,　林=woods,　森=forest)Kanji four:【デンシ・レンジ】(If 焼く means cooking with 火, then cooking with 電 would be kanji four. )

(It's a family thing.)I looked at it and thought "mother in law" 笑点 has a corner like this sometimes, where they combine kanji and radicals<sp> to make up new characters.My favorite joke from ダーリンは外国人 isif 1 木 is きand 2 木 (林）is はやしand 3 木 (森) is もり,what's 6 木?Spoiler: 森森　森六本木
