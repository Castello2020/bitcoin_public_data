I'm asking this, because I get the distinct feeling that you write all horizontal lines from right to left. (the diagonal artifact in the cross part of あ, た and す is a particular tell-tale sign).As for your writing, I think you're on the right track, but you need to practice more. Also, I suggest using a thinner pencil or at least not as soft as this one. (0.5 leads of HB hardness should be good enough to avoid smudging and flexible enough to write even compex kanji). If you're indeed left-handed, then vertical writing should be even better for you. Keep up the good work.Yes Im left handed.

by RiP70R » Thu 05.29.2008 10:00 pm There are a lot of nice ones in there it's great to see other people's handwriting, especially in japanese because we can get a sense of what everyone can do and it makes it easier to read handwriting as we can see more different way to write.I've decided to show mine. The kanjis are the only ones I know for now lol.http://i29.tinypic.com/21bjfk1.jpg

Re: Kanji Handwriting Thread
by nukemarine » Fri 06.06.2008 10:52 pm It's only about 5 months of study into actual Japanese. 10 months since studying Kanji via Heisig's RTK. The sentences are either from "Understanding Basic Japanese Grammar" or "2001.Kanji.Odyssey". I adopted the vertical approach a month or two ago for legibility. Sorry if the photos are blurry, they were taken with a cell phone.

Re: Kanji Handwriting Thread
by nukemarine » Tue 06.17.2008 7:04 am Rich,I did not find any problems with your stroke orders from what's provided. True, your proportions are off at times, but as you say that's just due to lack of written practice. No more worse off than some of the native handwriting I've seen. Granted, mine above would be called "mechanical" due to the over preciseness (due to my over dependence on computer characters as reference). For your 二　and 昔, use a shorter first stroke. That's opposed to your ま character which will need a larger upper stroke. Your せ and certain kanji such as 探 are missing the "hook" at the end of a vertical stroke. As you only used 度once, I could not tell if you used the correct strokes or not (though I assume it's correct like all the other kanji).I liked how your story started off. Kind of nice to read it handwritten this time.

Re: Kanji Handwriting Thread
by Hyperworm » Tue 06.17.2008 1:43 pm You don't need a hook on せ when it's handwritten, and I don't think a long stroke on ま matters much at all.I agree about the hook on 探 though; richvh, I can see you're curving the stroke instead but it doesn't look quite right to me.You just need to practice writing more to get the proportions perfect I think ._.Some characters that need practice: 子, 女, 貧, 二, れ, らAlso, I think:in handwriting, り is normally two disconnected strokes;in handwriting, the third stroke of あ normally crosses itself rather than merely touches itself;物 has no hook on the bottom left (should just be straight).

It's only punctuation that goes in the upper right.
