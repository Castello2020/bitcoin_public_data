by becki_kanou » Sun 02.28.2010 9:03 pm Usually I would say it means "beginning with Pa". For example パのつく言葉 is "words beginning with パ" but in the case of socks?!? Can you give us a little more context please?

Re: パのつく ?
by Hyperworm » Mon 03.01.2010 5:38 am This'll be the second time on these forums I've suggested this answer.It turned out to be irrelevant last time if I remember correctly, so hopefully it answers the question this time XのつくY = Y with an X [in front / attached]So, ソックス with a パ attached = パソックスMaybe?For our interest, more context please, even if this answered your question.Where did you get this snippet? Can we have the full sentence, and more surrounding sentences?It would be nice to know why this particular phrasing was used, since I don't really see the relation between パソックス and ソックス, unlike other uses of this construction such as ドのつくアホ (where the relation between アホ and ドアホ is evident), and therefore I'm a little suspicious of the answer >_>

by Botte842 » Mon 03.01.2010 7:17 am The problem is that there are no sorrounding sentences. This is the title of a manga-chapter although I changed the last word into socks since I didnt want to copy it but you can see the original here http://img683.imageshack.us/img683/1964/panotsuku2.jpg
