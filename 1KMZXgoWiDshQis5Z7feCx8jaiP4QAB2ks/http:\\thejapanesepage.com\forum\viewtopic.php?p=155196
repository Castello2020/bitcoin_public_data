Help on Hiragana from youtube video...
by penholdr » Tue 07.14.2009 12:49 am So this phrase has been bothering me for the longest time, my japanese ear must not be all that good. The video is a clip from an episode of Sailor Moon. at 5 minutes and 30 seconds into the video, in response to "please go back and be seated." a girl says, "no way"... or atleast that's how it's translated. but i've been trying to figure out the hiragana for her "no way" for the longest time.i think it sounds like:そう わけない はsou wakenai waor sou aikenai wasomething like that, however I can't figure out if those phrases really make sense at all in context. From this youtube video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeTVIQgFn2Uif anyone could help me figure this out that would be awesome!thanks!

by AJBryant » Tue 07.14.2009 4:29 am It's そうはいけない（は）It's pretty much a set phrase (except for the "wa" at the end).

It can't go that way .. it can't be.. no way! etc.. We can't really know directly because it appears the OP isn't quite sure either..

by Hyperworm » Thu 07.16.2009 11:52 am My post there was just an attempt to show the (or, at least, a possible) reason why the sentence means what it does.It wasn't a justification for いかない, which I'm quite sure is correct anyway through personal experience and google results. Sorry if I was a bit confusing Results 1 - 10 of about 1,800,000 for "そうはいかない". Results 1 - 10 of about 185 for "そうはいけない".

Just listen to the video, and there you go.
