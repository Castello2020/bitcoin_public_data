I've been curious about this usage of "hai" for-almost-ever.
by Kisai » Mon 05.18.2009 3:47 pm I should explain how my particular curiosity came about. I downloaded some Card Captor Sakura episodes, and naturally, as any true fan would watch them, watched them dubbed, meaning none of Nelvana's silly changes. I quickly caught on that "hai" meant "Yes" or "Yeah" or whatever rather quickly. But so did a friend of mine, whom I gave the episodes to for her to watch.The way she uses the word "hai" makes me curious as to if it's actually accurate. I can't say for sure, but I just have a feeling it may be wrong, or... off somehow. I mean, she DOES sometimes use it as a substitute for "Yeah" or "Yes" when told things, but she often uses it as an actual literal equivilant for the English "Yeah" or whatever. Example: we're in a car, friend is driving, car ahead is going slow, driver jokingly shouts to her to fire the missiles, like as though our car has some James Bond-like missiles or whatever, and she responds, "Hai!" and that's fine, but they continued joking around or whatever (I can't remember any actual dialoug from their silly exchanges), with the driver ordering her to fire the lasers and nukes or whatever, and she just responds, "Hai! HAI! HAAIII!" with trigger-happy enthusiasm. (I guess like, "Yeah, yeah, YEAH!")Of course, I had to kinda kill the mood with my lameness and be like, "Ya know, I'm not entirely sure that's completely accurate how you're using that." but I quickly said I wasn't sure either. That's why I'm asking right now. I WISH I could think of other examples on how she's used that in ways that made me question her accuracy on its usage, but that's the only one that comes to mind right now.

by coco » Tue 05.19.2009 7:49 am I am also curious about that Hai usage. Could you please tell us where we can download that episode, if they have legally provided it?
