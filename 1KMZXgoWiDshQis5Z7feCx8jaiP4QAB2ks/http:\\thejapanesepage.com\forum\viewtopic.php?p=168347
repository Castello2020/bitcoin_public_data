Missed (opportunity)
by 100PercentWeasel » Fri 01.07.2011 11:23 pm Is there a japanese word or expression to express "missed opportunity" I know there is a way to express it in conjugation but I'm not sure what it is or how to go about searching for it.Also,How would one express missing another person? I know japanese don't 'miss' each other so how do they express it?
There is none more cunning than the weasel.
