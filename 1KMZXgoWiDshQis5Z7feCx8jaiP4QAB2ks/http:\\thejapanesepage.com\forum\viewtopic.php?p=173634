いいもんでろ？
by レトラーマンティーク » Wed 04.25.2012 9:05 am Hello all! I have trouble understanding what group of words it is made of and therefore of course, what it means. I'm going to post a screen cap of the sentence (well, part of it) and my romaji transcription of the whole sentence along with my attempts to deconstruct and translate it.Context: just picked my first Pokémon.Please tell me also what you think of my sentence deconstructing, as I am not quite sure of my understanding so far either...Thank you!
For me, style is about spirit and attitude. My style is not about “age,” it’s about having a little fun, opting for a bit of glamour, and not taking yourself so seriously. - Anna Sui

Re: いいもんでろ？
by Hyperworm » Wed 04.25.2012 10:56 am And to answer your other question:そうやって = so doing. Doing like that and. Describes "pkmn o tsure aruku" as what the listener is doing / has just done. I'd probably translate with just "like that".つれあるく = actually a single compound verb, to walk with / to bring along walking. It is connected to your noun tsure though (tsure is the masu stem of tsureru).の (the last one) = a substitute for が in modifying clauses (because が tends to emphasize the previous word a bit)Well deconstructed fun translation snippets | need something translated?BTC@1KMZXgoWiDshQis5Z7feCx8jaiP4QAB2ks

Re: いいもんだろ？
by レトラーマンティーク » Wed 04.25.2012 12:34 pm Ahh! How could I mix で and だ X__X Thank you very much richvh for helping me deciphering いいもんだろ. However, how does もの work in there? Wikipedia's list and explanation of particles doesn't mention anything about the use of mono outside of creating a noun when added to certain verbs or a casual feminine sentence ender. (And if you have something similar but better of that list with explanations I linked, I'd be grateful if you shared it!)Hyperworm, your help is greatly appreciated. I finally really understand how kanji is important in Japanese, because when I try to break down sentences from that kana-only game, I can never be sure if a group of kana make a word only or more than one. So now, would this translation be accurate?How is it (doudai)? Doesn't it feel (kibun) very (nakana) nice (ii) to be walking (aruku) with your companion (tsure) like that (souyatte)?As I said above though, I don't quite get the もの here. And what kind of sentence ender is だろう exactly? I know it's a form of the copula だ, but I've always wondered how it differenciates itself from it.Thank you guys for your help once again!

by richvh » Wed 04.25.2012 12:57 pm もの here is a noun, not a particle... an abstract thing.

Re: いいもんでろ？
by レトラーマンティーク » Wed 04.25.2012 4:38 pm Ah, I see, now that makes sense, thank you once again richvh. So iimono would mean "a good thing"? So how would you work it in this translation, because it obviously can't be right if what I thought was nice becomes "a good thing":How is it (doudai)? Doesn't it feel (kibun) very (nakana) nice (ii) to be walking (aruku) with your companion (tsure) like that (souyatte)?

Doesn't it feel (kibun) very (nakana) nice (ii) to be walking (aruku) with your companion (tsure) like that (souyatte)?"kibun no ii mono" would be "a thing that feels good (atmosphere-wise)".Add "daro?" for "is a thing that feels good, isn't it!" (seeking confirmation)Recognizing, of course, the fact that "what is literal and the correct way to understand the sentence" may not be the same as "what you want to translate it as".By the way, you lost "pokémon" in your translation It should take the place of "tsure" (which isn't a separate noun--just part of the verb "walking").
