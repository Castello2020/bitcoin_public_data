Re: 終り
by blutorange » Thu 06.16.2011 6:32 pm The kanji in the picture you gave is definitely the commonly used form of 終り today. The real question is, what "other form" do you mean? As Hyperworm pointed out, you may be experiencing technical problems with rendering Japanese correctly, as the kanji is correctly encoded (UTF8 etc.). Can you show us a picture of that other form?Also, http://www.kanjinetworks.com/eng/kanji-dictionary/online-kanji-etymology-dictionary.cfm?kanji_id=TONG10 displays a picture of a formerly used version of that kanji. And there is also the simplified-Chinese version, which looks like 终.

Re: 終り
by phreadom » Thu 06.16.2011 7:25 pm http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=7160http://code.google.com/p/chromium-os/is ... l?id=11699It's a known problem with the webkit back-end apparently. So I'm guessing that both Chrome and Safari based browsers would experience this problem? (EDIT: Also, I just checked in Safari 5.0.5 and it worked correctly, so this is apparently just a Chrome issue, and not both.)The problem being that you're actually seeing the kanji displayed using a Chinese font, which can look different and use a different stroke order than the Japanese version of the same kanji.I've confirmed the problem you're seeing in my Chrome browser here. This is definitely what's happening.Here is what it looks like in Firefox:

by Hyperworm » Thu 06.16.2011 8:00 pm The top link posted by phreadom was closed a while back as a duplicate, so I think the one you want to be starring to hopefully bring more attention to this problem ishttp://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2685Wish they'd fix it already fun translation snippets | need something translated?BTC@1KMZXgoWiDshQis5Z7feCx8jaiP4QAB2ks

Re: 終り
by phreadom » Thu 06.16.2011 8:36 pm I just went ahead and starred it and left a comment. It's one of 2 bugs that really shy me away from Chrome.The other one is related to Rikaikun not working in text input boxes (like the very one I'm typing this in) because of a lack of functionality in webkit.http://code.google.com/p/rikaikun/issues/detail?id=16Chrome really is fast and sleek... but some of the key plugins I use, and some totally basic things like font support are just fundamentally broken or unavailable on Chrome still. If they'd resolve some of those issues I might start using Chrome more often again.(I also hate the way Chrome manages bookmarks (ie; not at all basically) hehe)Enough griping from me. 猿も木から落ちる

Re: 終り
by furrykef » Mon 06.20.2011 5:01 am It's not a bug in Chrome unless the page specifies what language the kanji are in and Chrome is ignoring it. Otherwise it has no way of knowing whether it should use the Japanese style or the Chinese style.

When coding my site I made sure to mark up all the Japanese with lang="ja", but Chrome refused to put it in the right font without a separate CSS font-family rule.On other sites it also ignores encoding (Shift-JIS) and domain (.jp), defaulting to always using a Chinese font. ._.The presence of hiragana and katakana could also be a clue in the absence of a lang attribute.In any event, I'm not sure how other browsers seem to make the right guess when language markup isn't present (this page as an example), but they do it somehow... <_<;

Re: 終り
by phreadom » Mon 06.20.2011 7:58 am Mattias offered a "solution" to this problem that appears to work!In your Chrome settings, change the sans serif font to something like Meiryo and the encoding to "Unicode (UTF-8)" and your Japanese fonts should show up correctly again! They look slightly different than they might otherwise, but at least you're seeing the right characters.(Options → Under The Hood → Web Content → Customize Fonts...)Before:
font-settings.png (25.25 KiB) Viewed 3610 times
After (fixed):
font-settings-fixed.png (24.9 KiB) Viewed 3610 times
Hope this helps! Thanks Mattias! This is still a bug, as it seems to affect many people, doesn't work with the default settings, and doesn't do what it's expected to etc. I think the bug reports kind of bear this out? I'd have to read over the bug report again to say more clearly...

Re: 終り
by JaySee » Sat 09.10.2011 5:40 am For what it's worth, I use google chrome and for me 終 in the first post looks like it does in phreadom's firefox screenshot (meiryo though). I don't know if I'm doing something right (I've never messed with any of google chrome's settings, not really a computer expert ), but I've never had any problems with kanji showing up improperly. Maybe it's because I'm using a MacBook?

Re: 終り
by Hyperworm » Sat 09.10.2011 10:31 am phreadom's Jun 20 workaround has been working reasonably well for me, but some sites still aren't fixed even with that, including the read.crx 2ch browsing extension and the chromium issue tracker itself.This needs to be fixed properly. fun translation snippets | need something translated?BTC@1KMZXgoWiDshQis5Z7feCx8jaiP4QAB2ks
