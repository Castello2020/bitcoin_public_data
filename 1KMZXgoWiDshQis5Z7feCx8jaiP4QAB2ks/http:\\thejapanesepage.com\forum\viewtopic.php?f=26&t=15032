Kanon 2006 ending "kazo no tadoritsuku basho"
by Joey 鷹 Vega » Wed 11.10.2010 7:33 pm Since I have been trying to look for the lyrics for English translation of this very good Japanese song from Kanon 2006 (ending) but no luck of finding it, even on Animelyrics.com. I've decided to give a try by using Google translator and it sounds like it gave me good results, (I hope and hope that I put it in correct position of the kanji lyrics ). So here's the lyrics in Kanji and in English translation of Kazo no tadori tsusuku basho. I apoligize that I didn't get the Romaji lyrics for it .Kanji Lyrics: 足下に風　光が舞った 日常にだけ積もったぶんの奇跡が見上げれば雲　遠くへの帰路幼い日の自分よりも早く雪解けを待っていた子供のように走る　光る滴　飛び跳ねてる明日の出会いさえ　気づかずにいる季節たちの中で輝いているよ世界中には　どんな想いも叶う日がくるずっとお旅をしてゆく僕らに小さな精たち舞い降りる出会った場所も緑をなしてゆるやかにも流れる時に委ねて遙かに仰ぐ町並みの路地幼い日の自分がまだ駆けるあの遊歩道から聞こえくる木々の声や日々のざわめきに似た奇跡の足音に気づいたらこんなにまた強くなれるふたりだね世界中溢れる想いに　風が向いてるずっとこんあことを繰り返してさよならのない旅をする世界中には　どんあ想いも叶う日がくるずっと旅をしてゆく僕らに小さな精たち舞い降りるEnglish lyricsLight wind danced at his feetSentence only accumulated daily miracleI looked up the way back to the distant cloudsFaster than his childhoodLike a child waiting for a thawI'm running lights bouncing dropsEven unaware of the meeting tomorrowI'm shining in their seasonThe world can come true feelings any dayWe traveled with our long slide intoOur little spirit alightNot a place to meet greenEven when left to flow slowlyThe city streets are much seekRunning Through my childhood is stillThat sounds coming from the boardwalkSimilar to the buzz of voices and the trees every dayIf you notice the footsteps of a miracleYou're so two become stronger andI'm full of feelings toward the world the windNot to travel there today that repeated long goodbyeThe world can come true feelings there dull dayWe concentrate our alight goes a little far to travel
「鷹の魂は消えないで空の中に永遠に生きる。」 "A Hawk's spirit never dies, for it lives on forever in the sky"

I've decided to give a try by using Google translator and it sounds like it gave me good results ....In my best Yoda voice, "Google Translate like sounds" If that translation sounds like it gave you good results your spoken English must be very strange indeed. Just looking at the first verse this line is a real corker;"Sentence only accumulated daily miracle" Joey 鷹 Vega wrote:.... 足下に風　光が舞った 日常にだけ積もったぶんの奇跡が見上げれば雲　遠くへの帰路.....Light wind danced at his feetSentence only accumulated daily miracleI looked up the way back to the distant clouds.....Light 光 does not mean not heavy or not strong so 風光 (ふうこう) is not light wind. It actually means beautiful scenery or natural beauty. That line is probably, "Wind at my feet, the lights danced".While ぶん can be "sentence" 文 it can also be "part" 分. ぶんの奇跡 would be "part of a miracle/wonder/marvel". It is not a daily miracle, that would be 日常の奇跡 using the words from that line. The に following 日常 indicates that daily is the frequency with which the action, accumulates 積もった, occurs.見上げれば is the provisional form of 見上げる so it is not "I looked up" but more "if I can look up". 見上げれば雲 therefore has a meaning along the lines of "if [I] can look up [I will see] clouds" so the clouds are there but I am not actually looking at them so in English we would probably say "there are clouds overhead". [noun_1]への[noun_2] means that [noun_2] is "to" or "for" [noun_1] so 遠くへの帰路 means "the way back is to a distant place" or more naturally "it's a long way back/home". Song lyrics are difficult to translate because they are loose with grammar and Google Translate is never going to cut it. Don't complain to me that people kick you when you're down. It's your own fault for lying there

I get the feeling that the prevalence of meaningless translations for meaningful songs (boosted by the existence of genuinely meaningless songs), has made these kinds of translations "entirely normal and acceptable" to the majority of English-speaking fans of Japanese music. It's quite saddening. ._.chikara wrote:見上げれば is the provisional form of 見上げる so it is not "I looked up" but more "if I can look up".上がれば・上げれば are intransitive/transitive, not normal/potential, right? ^^; Delete that "can" fun translation snippets | need something translated?BTC@1KMZXgoWiDshQis5Z7feCx8jaiP4QAB2ks
