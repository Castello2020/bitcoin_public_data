ラストダンスは悲しみを乗せて
by Gan » Thu 06.17.2010 4:34 pm So ラストダンスは悲しみを乗せて is a song title and I'm wondering what the best translation would be. 1. Place Sadness Upon The Last Dance2. The Last Dance Rides the Sadness3. The Last Dance Bears Sadness4. The Last Dance Gathers (or assembles) Sadness5. The Last Dance Guides The Sadness6. The Last Dance Carries Sadness7. Put Grief on the Last Dance8. The Last Dance Takes on Grief or is(are) there another more correct translation(s)?Some help would be much appreciated. Thank you. -Jesse

Re: ラストダンスは悲しみを乗せて
by Hyperworm » Thu 06.17.2010 9:28 pm The best translation of a song title depends heavily on the lyrics of the song - how the title makes sense or is best interpreted within the context of the song. So it's hard to say unless I read the lyrics in detail, but here's some guidance.は is being tricksy here. ラストダンス is not the subject or object of the sentence.It's like this:For the last dance, 悲しみを乗せて（おどる）The way 乗せる is being used here may be a little confusing too. Perhaps explaining it as "on board" might work?悲しみを乗せて～ = ~ with sadness on board (with sadness in yourself as you ~)Further examples plucked from Google.わくわくな気分を乗せてライブを見れるの楽しみにしています言葉に気持ちを乗せて putting feeling into (lit: onto) your words"Dance The Last Dance Sadly"? ...

Re: ラストダンスは悲しみを乗せて
by NileCat » Fri 06.18.2010 9:54 am Hello Guys,I'm a native who ain't good at English as you know, spin13.Let me try to explain the difference. But before that, I want to tell that Hyperworm's interpretation is awesome. You're an artist, Hyperworm.Meaning-wise, roughly speaking, those two can convey the same meaning.The difference, however, exists in the usage in our history. You can sing a song with your whole heart, for instance. That can be translated like "心を込めて歌う", correct? In this case, "心を込めて" is an idiomatic esxpression. You could find it as an "idiom" in dictionarys.On the other hand, when you phrase something like"心を乗せてメロディを聞き手に届ける", the expression sounds like kind of lyrical. I don't think we had that expression a hundred years ago. The expression was created by relatively new generation. Regarding the phrases "気持ちを込めて" and "気持ちを乗せて", they both sound totally natural in our modern usage though, the latter sounds a little bit more modern to me. Some might insist that "気持ちを乗せて" isn't a proper Japanese, I'm afraid. That's the primary difference of the two.And, in the actual usage, many people would think that "気持ちを込めて" sounds "heavier" compared to "気持ちを乗せて". Because, when you want to deliver something to someone, it's more difficult to make it IN it rather than put it ON it, isn't it? And the fact that younger generation tends to prefer light and casual expression makes the new expression popular.That's only my personal interpretation. Don't get my words as an academic definition or something, please.Hope it helps.
