Dictionary review
by Mr.Paper » Thu 09.03.2009 9:37 pm Where I bought it: Barnes & NobleName of book: Random House Japanese -English English-JapanesePages: 666Author: Seigo Nakao More than 50,000 entries! This dictionary is very useful to me and is good. It solves my vocab problems 90% of the time and has a neat cover of a painting by Kotondo Torii. Its $12.95 and is worth it. Inside it has helpful pages on Japanese language, and has the kana charts for you to study which is great! I give this dictionary a 3.8/5.

Re: Dictionary review
by Hyperworm » Fri 09.04.2009 5:48 am Long post incoming.When I get my hands on a dictionary (electronic or regular) and want to test how comprehensive it is, I find it hard to think of any difficult words >_> So I think I need to build up a list to use in these situations.Here are some words that stumped me while reading 涼宮ハルヒの陰謀 today, and what the other Japanese-English dictionaries available to me were able to tell me about them, in short. (J-J dictionaries excluded to prevent this from getting too long >_>)If you could check what the Random House dictionary has to say, that might provide further insight into its strengths/weaknesses 麓（ふもと）Kodansha's Furigana Japanese Dictionary: foot (of a mountain) +1 example sentenceデイリーコンサイス和英辞典【第5版】: (at) the foot ((of a hill))プログレッシブ和英中辞典第【第3版】@yahoo: the foot ((of a mountain)) +1exニューセンチュリー和英辞典【第2版】@yahoo: the foot; a bottom; a base. +1ex新和英中辞典【第4版】@excite: the foot; the base +1exEDICT: the foot; the bottom; the base (of a mountain) +1ex庵（いおり）Ko: ---デ: a hermit's cellプ: a hermitage +1exニ: ---新: a hermitageED: hermitage; retreat加虐（かぎゃく）and 加虐趣味（かぎゃくしゅみ）Ko: ---デ: ---プ: ---ニ: ---新: ---ED: (加虐) causing pain　獣道（けものみち）Ko: ---デ: ---プ: ---ニ: ---新: an animal [a game] trailED: animal trail　円墳（えんぷん）Ko: ---デ: ---プ: ---ニ: ---新: ---ED: round burial mound +1ex余裕（よゆう）in the sense of "calmness"/"composure", not the sense of "room"/"leeway"/"spare [time/money]".in the part I was reading, this manifested as 「ようやく状況に慣れてきたのか、～Ｖ余裕が出てきたようだ」Ko: (entry, but no mention)デ: (余裕綽々としている: "be calm and composed", but no indication that 余裕 can mean "composure" on its own)プ: (similar to above)ニ: calmness; composure +3ex (余裕を失う lose one's composure [presence of mind].)新: composure; scopeED: surplus; composure; margin; room; time; allowance; [+3 more] (buried amongst quasi-synonyms, no example)　人恋しい（ひとこいしい）Ko: (doesn't have 恋しい even)デ: (恋しい definition is irrelevant, but it does list 恋しがる as: long ((for)); yearn ((after)), which helps)プ: (1ex) "miss human companionship"ニ: (nothing useful in the definition, but one of the example sentences for 恋しい is revealing)新: feel lonely; feel in need of companyED: longing for othersI must use EDICT more ._.; I generally stay away from it because the example sentences are a bit lacking compared to some other J-E dictionaries, but it at least had something to offer on every entry I tried here. My general pattern is Yahoo J-E dictionaries →(if not found) J-J, but I think EDICT deserves a place in the middle ^^;And Kodansha's furigana dictionary is apparently not very useful for reading actual literature. Which I should have expected since it says "basic vocabulary" and "most commonly used words" on the back. I should have thought further ahead before buying it (was a while ago but.)How does Random House fare? (also if anyone else has any other dictionaries to add?)(is there a comparison like this anywhere else?)
