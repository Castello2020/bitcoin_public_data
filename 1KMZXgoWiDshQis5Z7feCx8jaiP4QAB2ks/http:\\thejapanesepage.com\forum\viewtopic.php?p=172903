Re: Japanese translation help please?
by Hyperworm » Thu 02.09.2012 7:09 pm It feels like you're relying way too much on rikaichan...You make a lot of mistakes which seem to arise from disregarding the grammar and just combining things from rikaichan by "feel".Well, since there's so much to cover, I'm not going to go into any detail on each point, just enough for you to work it out.がんばって...!①　負の感情が自分に全く無いのかと言えば嘘になるけど　instance of the sentence pattern:　Ｘと言えば嘘になる　= if I were to say X, it would be a lie　= I'd be lying if I said X②　それらを吹っ切る不確定な希望を信じるしかない　それら＝backreference to 負の感情　（→①）③　不確定。。。か　不確定＝backreference to 不確定な　（→②）　か＝huh (reflecting upon the word)④　果たしてそうなのかな　果たして＝本当に　・　よく考えれば　そう＝backreference to 不確定な　（→②）⑤　最後は己との戦いだと想います　最後は＝結局　・　つまりは　・　全てが終わった時、結論は　己と＝自分自身と　戦いだ＝　○たたかい、だ　×そよいだ　⑥　敵は自分自身　（‥‥‥だ）⑦　、、、その言葉はよくないか　その言葉＝backreference to 敵は自分自身　（→⑥）　よくない＝良くない, from 良い （いい）　（surely you know this conjugation -- if not...）　か＝hm, I guess actually (reflection upon the previous statement)⑧　「己に克つ」と言う方がフィットするかも　言う方が＝　×いうかた、が　○いう、ほうが　instance of sentence pattern Ｘ（の）方がＹ　（Y＝フィットする）⑨　。。。なんだか今日は難しいよ自分　＝なんだか、今日は、自分は、難しい（よ）　＝なんだか、今日の自分は、難しい　（難しい serious; not easily satisfied; caught in difficult thoughts）

by tokyotower » Thu 02.09.2012 9:20 pm Thank you... I'll try to understand...so the first sentence is:負の感情が自分に全く無いのかと言えば嘘になるけど I'd be lying if I said there's really no negative feelings in meそれらを吹っ切る不確定な希望を信じるしかないthose (negative feelings) I can't do nothing else than believe incertains hopes? (I dont understand who to translate a long sentence with 2 "を"....the rest, I'll try to understand... but it's hard...

Re: Japanese translation help please?
by SomeCallMeChris » Thu 02.09.2012 9:39 pm There's only one を for each verb. It's your basic subordinate clause... a short sentence being used to modify a noun.I suppose there's an explanation somewhere on this site's 'learn' menu but I don't know where. You can read about here though:http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/subclauseI should add, the noun being modified is 希望 ; there's an adjective in-between, but both are modifying the noun.I should also add, Tae Kim's Grammar Guide has been translated into German so finding the corresponding German page may help your understanding far better than reading the English page.

by tokyotower » Fri 02.10.2012 3:30 am Thanks, I know that page, is very good made,but sometimes I can't applicate the example to my sentences,I'll try again;負の感情が自分に全く無いのかと言えば嘘になるけどそれらを吹っ切る不確定な希望を信じるしかないeven if I would lie if I saythere's really no negative feelings in meI have no choice that believe the indefinite hope 吹っ切る (this word don't exist in my vocabulary) maybe blowing? those (sorera) the (negative feelings)Still I'm not sure it's correct, don't sound that make sense in some part, please help?

Re: Japanese translation help please?
by SomeCallMeChris » Fri 02.10.2012 9:53 pm それらを吹っ切る不確定な希望を信じるしかない吹っ切る is in the dictionary here:http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF- ... x=03815900それらを　吹っ切る　不確定な　希望　をThese (direct object ; back reference to negative emotions) /get over, get rid of, get past, let go of (an emotion) / uncertain /hope (direct object)So the object of the sentence is 'an uncertain hope of getting past these'.The verb phrase,信じるしかない is the conjugation for 'can do nothing other than believe'.So, 'I can do nothing other than believe in the uncertain hope of getting past these.'I don't really know the words 吹っ切る or 不確定 - this is my first time seeing the first, and I've only seen the second a handful of times, so that's not a very nuanced translation relying on the dictionary heavily as it does. Anyway, 何々をする希望 is usually 'hope to do 何々' although grammatically it's ambiguous, it can also be 'hope that does 何々'. Since it doesn't make sense to talk about 'hope' getting over its feelings, it must be 'hope to... '.
