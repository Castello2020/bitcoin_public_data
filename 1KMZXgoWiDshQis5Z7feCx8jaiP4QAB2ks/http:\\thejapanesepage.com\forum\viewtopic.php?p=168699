by Hyperworm » Mon 01.31.2011 12:53 pm 「先週に映画を見たが誰」 doesn't work because you can't completely omit the noun at the end of a modifying clause, and also, が usually means "but" when it directly follows a verb.kt_anthrax's suggestion is good. Another alternative is that you could cut out 誰 entirely and leave the exact question implied (you might want to keep 人 instead of の in this case, to make it more clear). Whether it works will depend on context.「先週、映画見た人は？」

In this case it's just a placeholder for an omitted noun (in this case 人). You can think of it as like using "one" in English, like 赤いのを　ください = "gimme a red one!"A related usage of の is to turn verbs into nouns (in English, these will usually be gerunds or infinitives). 遊ぶのが好きです = "I like to play" or "I like playing". (This is frequently expressed 遊ぶことが好きです, which is probably more appropriate in formal language.)
