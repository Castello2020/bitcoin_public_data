by phreadom » Mon 03.21.2011 4:26 am Looks like an odd ウ to me. :/ or a mirrored と Can we have a little more context? 猿も木から落ちる

Re: How do you pronounce this symbol
by Dustin » Mon 03.21.2011 5:02 am It's an う　the dot is just touching the curved section.That's partly why it looks like a stylized ウ　cause they're essentially identical but rounded off, where the katakana version normally touches and the hiragana normally does not, but it's just stylized, similar to the complete rounding off of the ろ　character.Hope that helps Dustin

Re: How do you pronounce this symbol
by Internetmoneyacc » Mon 03.21.2011 5:10 am Thanks for that.I considered that it might be う but they had a perfectly well written う in previous speech bubbles.Now that I think about it though, I think this symbol only shows up when the little girl is speaking which explains the bad handwriting.Sometimes these things can throw me off so bad.Thanks for the help guys.

Re: How do you pronounce this symbol
by Dustin » Mon 03.21.2011 5:19 am No problem!Definitely looking back, the style of writing between the 2 individuals is different, which can make those subtle differences even harder for us!Glad we could help and good luck!

Re: How do you pronounce this symbol
by Hyperworm » Mon 03.21.2011 10:35 am Dustin already said this, but to emphasize - it's not really bad handwriting, just a stylistic difference because the text in that bubble is in a different font (specifically, ゴカールＢ / GoCurl B). The え in that font is probably also written with that type of line. Other fonts might even use a filled circle.I'm pretty sure I've seen う handwritten like that a number of times, so I wouldn't say it's unacceptable as handwriting.( It's how I've taken to writing mine, so I hope it isn't... >_>;; )GoCurl also has a pretty weird の, but I don't think anyone ever writes it like this:
