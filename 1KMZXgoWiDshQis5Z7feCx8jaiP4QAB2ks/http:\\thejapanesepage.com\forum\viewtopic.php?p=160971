Re: それを思わせない
by becki_kanou » Tue 11.17.2009 4:56 am "It wouldn't make you think" or in more natural English "you wouldn't think".木村さんの一声を合図に、演奏がはじまる。港町の喫茶店で毎月、ミニライブが開かれている。出演者の中には、障がい者もいる。それを思わせない、いや、むしろそうだからこそ、心の奥底に届く歌詞がつくれるのかもしれない、と木村さんはいう。Quick and dirty, but maybe something like: Although you wouldn't think it to hear them, there are some handicapped performers as well. In fact, Kimura says, it is precisely because of this that they are able to create lyrics that touch the heart.

by katafei » Tue 11.17.2009 5:08 am Thanks, Becki.But with that translation, I still have trouble with the full sentence, though.それを思わせない、いや、むしろそうだからこそ、心の奥底に届く歌詞がつくれるのかもしれない、と木村さんはいう"you wouldn't think so, no/but, on the contrary, if not (handicapped) we might not be able to deliver lyrics from the bottom of our heart...."Is this along the right lines??I can't quite combine それを思わせない with むしろそうだからこそ and the rest of the sentence...

Re: それを思わせない
by katafei » Tue 11.17.2009 5:09 am O let me read what you added to your post first ^^EDIT:yep, that's more or less the same as my latest.それを思わせない、いや、むしろそうだからこそ、心の奥底に届く歌詞がつくれるのかもしれない、と木村さんはいう.I guess it's also the comma after それを思わせない that confuses me. A full stop would seem more natural to me....?EDIT2;O, and it's 'lyrics that touch the heart' and not 'deliver from the heart'....Yes, that does sound a lot better katafei

Re: それを思わせない
by Hyperworm » Tue 11.17.2009 8:39 am I think the structure here if he hadn't said the extra part would have been[それを思わせない、心の奥底に届く歌詞]がつくれる、と木村さんはいう。i.e. それを思わせない is part of a long modifying clause on 歌詞. The comma is used to indicate that 思わせない isn't modifying the noun that immediately follows it (心) but a noun later in the sentence (歌詞)."They can produce lyrics that (overcome this / don't label them with this / wouldn't make you think of them as this); lyrics that touch the depths of the heart, says Kimura-san."However, there's a subclause inserted in the middle (and also the end part changes a bit as a result):それを思わせない、いや、むしろそうだからこそ、心の奥底に届く歌詞がつくれるのかもしれない、と木村さんはいうbut それを思わせない is still to be taken as part of the modifying clause on 歌詞:"They can produce lyrics that don't label them with this -- no, rather it is perhaps precisely because of this that they can produce lyrics that touch the depths of the heart, says Kimura-san."What's odd about the sentence is that the 「いや、むしろそうだからこそ」 jumps entirely out of the modifying clause. Delete the first part of the sentence and this is evident:そうだからこそ、心の奥底に届く歌詞がつくれるのかもしれない、と木村さんはいうThe modifying clause begins after the bold. そうだからこそ isn't modifying 歌詞.So that section jumps out of the modifying clause, makes its statement, and then when it's done it throws us back into a modifying clause again, which is either:a continuation of the one it interrupted, oran entirely new one and we're to restart our parsing of the sentence after the repudiating いや, while still being aware of the fact that それを思わせない, which was interrupted, was anticipating the noun that's going to come later....I fear that was quite confusing fun translation snippets | need something translated?BTC@1KMZXgoWiDshQis5Z7feCx8jaiP4QAB2ks

It's basically spoken language, so I guess that would explain that bit......I fear that was quite confusing Only a bit No, just kidding, it was very understandable and definitely very helpful. Thanks ^^
