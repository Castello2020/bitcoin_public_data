Rock Paper Scissors おにに
by themonk » Tue 02.21.2012 9:40 pm In the classic song, Rock Paper Scissors, towards the end, it says:あらあら どなた そのはさみはさみがおににきまったWhat does おにに mean here? Thank you.

by Hektor6766 » Wed 02.22.2012 3:06 am 鬼 (oni) is the "demon, ogre" or "it" in games like tag, etc. Seems at this point in the song, scissors decides who is "it".

Re: Rock Paper Scissors おにに
by SomeCallMeChris » Wed 02.22.2012 3:34 am I don't think so, but I'm not sure. I looked at like this, that the song is like'A tie... repeat... how many times... a tie... repeat... how many times... who threw scissors!?' and then the line in question.The grammar looks like the use of 決まる as to win/score/hit.'Scissors beats oni!' １、じゃんけんぽんよ　あいこでしょ　あらあら　だめよ　もういちど　じゃんけんぽんよ　まだだめよ　なんべん　やっても　きまらない２、じゃんけんぽんよ　あいこでしょ　あらあら　だめよ　いしかみじゃん　あらあら　どなた　そのはさみ　はさみが　おにに　きまった　I suppose it -could- be that they are playing junken to decide who's it for tag. But I would expect the particles to different in that case.There's probably a commented version somewhere but I'm going to bed rather than search for it tonight.

Re: Rock Paper Scissors おにに
by Hyperworm » Wed 02.22.2012 3:59 am Particles look fine to me.Hektor6766's interpretation is correct, except for a small complaint about the translation/interpretation of "scissors deciding".It's 決まった, not 決めた -- we don't have something 決めるing something else.決まった : [something is/has been/was] decided / determined / fixed.鬼に決まった : [something is/has been/was] decided on as "it" / determined to be "it" / fixed as "it"はさみが鬼に決まった :(The person who threw) Scissors is (the one who is)* decided on as "it" / determined to be "it" / fixed as "it".*this part due to the emphasis of が
