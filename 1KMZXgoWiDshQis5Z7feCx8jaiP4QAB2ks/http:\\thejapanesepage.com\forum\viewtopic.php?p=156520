Re: please check these sentences
by NileCat » Thu 08.13.2009 11:07 am The only mistakes I could find out were...どこでもに行きたくないです。→　どこにも行きたくないです。誰かが一番大好きですか。→　誰が一番好きですか。(Question mark is optional)Meaningwise, all your translations seem good to me.But..., What mountain →　Which mountain ( Am I wrong ? )EDIT:誰が一番大好きですか？ Many people actually use this expression recentry also in Japan. Especially young people.So it's not necessarily wrong. But I recommend you to avoid it in your exams.In grammar, it's like ...well... " the most biggest " or something like that.

Thanks for the explanation, NileCat.

For example I would say "Majora's Mask is my most favourite out of the Legend of Zelda series."EDIT: Hmm, I looked in my dictionary and it states “favourite” as a prenominal adjective which means “most liked”.However, something like “This is my favourite television programme” or “This is my favourite game” do not give me a strong feeling of “most”.

Re: please check these sentences
by Yudan Taiteki » Thu 08.13.2009 1:53 pm As a native speaker, I can see the objections to "most favorite" but it is often used anyway, perhaps just for emphasis. Since you have to say "This is my second most favorite food" (rather than just "*second favorite food"), there would be an obvious tendency to also say "This is my most favorite food"."This is my favorite game" and "This is my most favorite game" mean the same thing and I think the second one might be considered prescriptively wrong, but it has an emphatic feeling to it. I would have no problem using it in casual speech.

by NileCat » Thu 08.13.2009 2:10 pm Thanks for your explanation.Speaking of 一番大好き, in my personal observation,If you are a young and pretty lady, it would sound very charming ! ( with a smile is preferable )If you are a middle-aged gentleman, you would just sound like an idiot.I know some would have objections though. NileCat

Re: please check these sentences
by keatonatron » Thu 08.13.2009 6:17 pm The problem is many people have more than one favorite Vanilla and chocolate are my favorite flavors of ice cream, and I have many favorite movies.So, if you have many favorites (and many 大好き's), it sometimes becomes necessary to specify which of your favorites is the most favored. Grammatically it makes sense, because you favor all your favorites, so which one do you favor the most?You can rank it as such:好き一番好き大好き一番大好きI like strawberry ice cream (I don't not like it!), but it isn't one of my favorites, so I would use 好き but not 大好き.Of course, it's possible for someone to have an 一番好き and no 大好き's, so depending on the person 一番好き and 一番大好き could mean the same thing.

by Yudan Taiteki » Thu 08.13.2009 6:29 pm I looked in some dictionaries, and none of them said that "favorite" had to be superlative. Although I'm not sure "more favorite" would ever be good.

"Most favourite" sounds horrible to me in any context and "second favourite food" sounds perfectly acceptable.

Re: please check these sentences
by lonelytraveler8 » Thu 08.13.2009 6:46 pm Odd. I'm not sure I've ever heard "most favorite." I don't think I would have any real problems, though, so I may have just not noticed.I generally stick to 'favorite,' 'second favorite,' etc. When I want to emphasize that something is my favorite, I usually use the word 'absolute,' as in "That is my absolute favorite drink." I don't think it sounds much better than using 'more' now that I think about it, though.Nevertheless, I find the whole situation odd because when I think of something as being a favorite, I think of it as the most liked. In my head, I can't possibly see there being more than one most liked, since 'most' is so absolute. I kind of wish their was a word to indicate things that you like almost, but not quite as much, as your favorite.
