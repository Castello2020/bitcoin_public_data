by Hyperworm » Wed 10.20.2010 9:31 pm Japanese-language-learning nakama might be more suited than "friends" depending on the person I guess ^^Though...Someone can "become" a nakama, and you can probably "find" nakama too, but can you "make" nakama?Hmm ^^Anyway, welcome! fun translation snippets | need something translated?BTC@1KMZXgoWiDshQis5Z7feCx8jaiP4QAB2ks
