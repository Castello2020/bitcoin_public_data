help w/ translation attempts
by QuakerBits » Wed 05.23.2012 10:15 am I have a few sentences I've been collecting(I'll use 5), some I can roughly translate, some I'm very confused on, so I'll try to do most of the work. I am using Torbira now, so these sentences are taken from there (all of them I think?). Recently I just kept studying until I figure something out, sadly some things I still can't figure out on my own, so sorry to bother you guys:(・この町は車がないと生活が出来ないから、どの家でも一台か二台は車がある。No matter which house you go to there are 1 or 2 cars, because you can't live in this town without them.・ベートーベンは音楽家にとって最も大切な耳が聞こえなくなってしまったのに、あの有名な「第九シンフォニー」を作った。Although ベートーベン as a musician was deaf(???), he made 9 シンフォニー.（underlined: I just translated as deaf. "Most important ear can't hear?" is what I'm reading it as, but makes no sense!!!）・去年さとうさんと来た日本料理のレストランは、ここじゃなかったかなあ。The japanese restaurant I came with さとうさん last year, I wonder if it's not here.(?)・一人の人しか言わないことを一般化するのは、よくありませんよ。I don't often generalize saying each person is alone.(?)・子供が礼儀正しい人間に育つように、子供を武道の道場に通われる親もいる。So that kids grow up to be respectful people, they go to and from the 道場 with their parents. So that's the 5 sentences I have.. I left Japanese words in some of the translations because i can't spell them in english, or it feels weird to type them in english->道場, sorry about that QuakerBits

"Most important ear can't hear?" is what I'm reading it as, but makes no sense!!!）Wrong decomposition ベートーベンは（【音楽家にとって最も大切】な耳）が‥‥‥(If you can't get it, try thinking of ～な as ～なことである)QuakerBits wrote:・去年さとうさんと来た日本料理のレストランは、ここじゃなかったかなあ。The japanese restaurant I came with さとうさん last year, I wonder if it's not here.(?)Needs more context, probably, but "wasn't it here, I wonder...?" = I think it was here, am I wrong...? Maybe being faced with some evidence that it isn't here, or maybe just saying it to get feedback from others. QuakerBits wrote:・一人の人しか言わないことを一般化するのは、よくありませんよ。I don't often generalize saying each person is alone.(?)It's not good to generalize* what only one person says*generalize = apply to everyone; take as everyone's opinion instead of just that one personQuakerBits wrote:・子供が礼儀正しい人間に育つように、子供を武道の道場に通われる親もいる。So that kids grow up to be respectful people, they go to and from the 道場 with their parents. You have a typo. 通われる→通わせるDoes it make sense now? ;

Maybe being faced with some evidence that it isn't here, or maybe just saying it to get feedback from others. Makes perfect sense. There was no other context given, so yeah(:Hyperworm wrote:You have a typo. 通われる→通わせるDoes it make sense now? ;Yes, definitely does!! Thanks for the help btw!! Much appreciated (:

For instance, Japanese uses phrases like 目が見えない for "can't see"/"blind", and it's pointless trying to force the word "eyes" in there.I'd tidy it up with something like"Beethoven made his famous Ninth Symphony in spite of losing the most important thing to a musician: his hearing."(or "Even though Beethoven lost his hearing, the most important thing to a musician, he made his famous Ninth Symphony.", I think it would depend on the surrounding context where to place the focus...)Ninth, by the way 第九
