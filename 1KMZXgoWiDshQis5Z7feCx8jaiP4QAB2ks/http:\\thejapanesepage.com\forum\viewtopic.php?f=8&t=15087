Translating a Pokemon manga short
by Kodama_30 » Thu 12.02.2010 9:23 pm I got linked to this recently; and decided to try and translate despite being very inexerienced with this sort of thing. Although saying that I figure the only way I can remedy my stunted vocab is to seek material out as much as I can. Ok first off, I had to use Jim Breens wonderful site and manually search kanji by radical to get each of the kanji (seeing as there is no furigana) If there is an easier way please tell me lol. カプルモってさ八重 歯 すげえよなーこれで噛み付いてチョボマキ吸うのかなMy attempt:A Kapurumo.doubled fanged ya know.Doesn't this bite and suck chobomaki's though...** alot of slang and contractions I've noticed. The って I'm assuming is a contraction of という and is sort of operating as a casual は in this case right? I also have no idea what the (I'm assuming slang) すげえ means - my dictionary has no definition of it.The last sentence also threw me off a bit, and thats the closest I could come up with. Would I be right in assuming some particles have been omitted? Thanks for any help guys . Kodama_30

Re: Translating a Pokemon manga short
by NileCat » Thu 12.02.2010 11:56 pm First sentence:カブルモってさ、八重歯すげえよなー。Meaning-wise, there are two ways to interpret it.a) Kaburumo has an awesome double tooth.b) Kaburumo, you have an awesome double tooth.If you want to rephrase it in standard expression:a) カブルモは、八重歯がすごい。/ カブルモの八重歯はすごい。b) カブルモ、きみの八重歯はすごい。“ってさ” is a popular colloquial expression which is very casual. It emphasizes the subject like...with something like ”hey ya know” feelings. Never use it to your boss. “八重歯” (やえば）is an oblique tooth. Interestingly, it used to be considered as a sign of cuteness in old Japanese society. So it’s a bit different from 牙（きば)(fang). JFYI.“すげえ” is a slang altered from “すごい” which means stunning/terrific/awesome/cool/terrible/awful, etc.It is an adjective, however, in slangy expressions, you can use it as an adverb.adjective) ポケモンは、すごい。→　ポケモンって、すごいね。→　ポケモンってさ、すげえ！ adverb) ポケモンは、とてもおもしろい。→　ポケモンは、すごくおもしろい。　→　ポケモンって、すごいおもしろい。→　ポケモンってさ、すげえおもしろい。→　ポケモンってさあ、すっげえおもしれえ。(proper → slangy)(おもしろい=fun）But note that kids are usually to be scolded if they use the word すげえ in front of their parents.Second sentence:これで噛み付いて、チョボマキ吸うのかな。It/he/you bite and suck Chobomaki with it/the tooth, I guess/I wonder.The omitted words are:この八重歯で噛み付いて、カブルモはチョボマキを吸うのだろうか。(If it's blood he sucks, it means “チョボマキの血を吸うのだろうか”. ) Hope it helps.

by Hyperworm » Fri 12.03.2010 7:00 am I'm just going to further emphasize something NileCat-san said.NileCat wrote:“ってさ” is a popular colloquial expression which is very casual. It emphasizes the subject like...with something like ”hey ya know” feelings.As an English approximation to 「～ってさ、～な（ね）」Hey, ya know Kaburumo? (It has) Awesome double teeth, huh!Hey, Kaburumo(, ya know)... you have awesome double teeth, don't you!(those translations are 'illustrative for feel', not saying that's the way you should/need to translate it)Since NileCat-san used the same words "ya know" as you in the first post, I wanted to make sure you spotted the difference - it works on the subject ^^;(I bet I'd find this funnier if I'd played Black/White ... I won a copy from a Bulbagarden competition, but it got lost in the post somehow, and now I'm waiting for another copy to be sent out... )

Re: Translating a Pokemon manga short
by Hyperworm » Fri 12.03.2010 3:31 pm What's it doing exactly? Trying to attach itself via a sucker (e.g. for evolution)? Or is it itself sucking? ...Maybe *shlrp* *shlrp* ? (squishy suction-type sound)*slurrrp*? (like sucking through a straw)I don't really have a talent for onomatopoeia though The lazy can just use a verb ("*suck* *suck*")

by becki_kanou » Fri 12.03.2010 7:49 pm That pokemon is kissing the human, right? In which case, *kiss* or *smooch* or even *smack* for a big kiss. For a little kiss *peck*.

Re: Translating a Pokemon manga short
by Kodama_30 » Fri 12.03.2010 8:46 pm Thank you so much for the detailed responses guys. And on retrospect maybe I should have figured that すげえ was some how related to すごい - seems quite logical now that I look at it (for slang anyway )In regards to your question NileCat, I don't think there is an exact English equivalent. (well, that's my own personal thinking anyway) The sounds that becki posted are pretty close though. Kodama_30

Don't complain to me that people kick you when you're down. It's your own fault for lying there
