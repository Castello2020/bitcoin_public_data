Kaiwa (Conversation) Question!!
by rachxo » Thu 10.14.2010 12:02 am Hi! I am having trouble understanding this sentence (in my Japanese textbook)Person 1: このポケット全部に何か入れたら、重いし動きにくいよ。Person 2:全部に入れなければいいじゃない。Person 1: そっか。じゃあ、一度はいてみようかな。I don't understand how they used zenbu in this and what about the mi you kana part?? Also, what is the rule for adding 'shi' to the ending of adjectives? I would appreciate it VERY MUCH if someone could help explain this. Arigatou gozaimasu !!!! =)

by 風と月の夜 » Thu 10.14.2010 10:17 am I think maybe this conversation is 2 people talk about　trouser pockets.ポケット全部＝全部のポケット　全部（all) の（of) ポケット（pockets)＝all of pocketsWhen i put something in all of trouser pockets,i feel the trouser is heavy and not easy to move.For exsample, " She is clever(賢い《かしこい》.adj ） ＝　彼女は賢い。　And, she is beautiful美しい《うつくしい》）. adj　＝彼女は美しい”　”She is clever and beautiful (賢いし美しい）　(彼女は賢いし美しい。＝彼女は賢いそして美しい。　This "shi(し) is used in the same meaning as "soshite(そして＝and).　In Japan ,when it is talked adj ＋adj, "Shi(し） is used very often. ・ このテストは難しい《むずかしい》し長い《ながい》（です）。adj＋adj　・　あの動物園は広い《ひろい》し楽しい《たのしい》しきれい（です）。　adj＋adj＋adj はいてみようかな　＝　はく（put on) ＋みようかな（i maybe decide　to try~)一度はいてみようかな。I maybe decide to try to put on the trouser.見る　＋　みようかな　＝　見てみよう。　I maybe decide to try to look~ 風と月の夜

Re: Kaiwa (Conversation) Question!!
by NileCat » Thu 10.14.2010 1:07 pm The pants/trousers they are talking about have more than one pockets on them.Here, ポケット全部 means "all of the pockets".みよう means (I'll) try.かな means I guess.し works as "and" in casual conversation. "It would become heavy AND 動きにくい" ...what do you call it in English?...dysfunctional? (one word adjective meaning "difficult to move").The rule is very simple. Just add the し to any adjective. e.g. 近いし便利だ, 安いしおいしいEDIT:When I wrote this, 風と月の夜-san's post was invisible to me for some reason. Weird...

by yangmuye » Thu 10.14.2010 2:08 pm Hi, I found this on the internet, it may be a multiple choice problem.Could you explain a little more? I don't understand the fourth sentence. Is it a complete negation?Thank you.2008年　日本語能力試験　３級　聴解スクリプト ２番　女の人と男の人がデパートで話しています。二人は今見ているものはどれですか。 女性：ああ、これ、ちょ っといいわね。いろいろな形のポケットがたくさんあって、おもしろいよ。 男性：うーん、でも、このポケット全部に何か入れたら、 重いし、動きにくいよ。 女性：全部に 入れなければいいじゃない。男性：そうか。じゃ、一度はいて見ようかな。 二人は今 見ているものはどれですか。

Re: Kaiwa (Conversation) Question!!
by NileCat » Thu 10.14.2010 2:44 pm The girl is suggesting.入れなければ ＝ 入れる + ない + ければif not puttingいいじゃない = good/works, isn't it/doesn't it ?"How about not putting things in all of the pockets.""You don't need to fill up all the pockets."The right picture(?) you are expected to choose here would be a pair of pants that have many pockets. Note that the verb meaning "to try" is はく（履く）, not 着る. Logically speaking, it can be a pair of shoes, though I have never seen a shoe that has pockets on it.着る・・・上着／ジャケット／シャツはく・・・ズボン／パンツ／靴EDIT:Just one thing. Are you sure about "二人は". If I were the questioner, I'd say "二人が".

by yangmuye » Thu 10.14.2010 3:50 pm NileCat-san, thank you very much.Just one thing. Are you sure about "二人は". If I were the questioner, I'd say "二人が".I'm not sure. It's not the "official" version. I found another one, which has a typo.Do you think there's something strange in the first sentence?女の人と男の人がデパートで話しています。二人は今見ているものはどれですか。"How about not putting things in all of the pockets."You don't need to fill up all the pockets."So it's not a complete negation.A little off topic, how about the following sentence?"全部には 入れなければいいじゃない"このポケット全部に 入れなければいいじゃないこのポケットに全部何か入れたらAnd how do you express "How about not putting things in any of the pockets?"

Grammatically proper, maybe more than the simple "全部に". You can use this expression too.このポケット全部に入れなければいいじゃないFine. However, you are just repeating what the person said. It is not necessary, or even redundant.このポケットに全部何か入れたらWell, it slightly sounds off to me. We don't see what 全部 is modifying, strictly speaking. But we often use this kind of expression in our daily conversation. So I wouldn't say "wrong", though. It sounds very casual to me, at least."How about not putting things in any of the pockets."どのポケットにも入れなければいいじゃない。どのポケットにも物を入れなければいいじゃない。ポケットには何も入れなければいいじゃない。ポケットに何も入れなければいいじゃない。
