Right-hand Side-bar
by becki_kanou » Fri 02.12.2010 3:51 am Before it would pop-up for a moment and then hide itself, but recently it's been staying which is a pain because it blocks everything under it like posters' names access to smilies etc. Is there any way to get it to back to how it was?

Re: Right-hand Side-bar
by phreadom » Fri 02.12.2010 4:01 am It still works here in both Firefox (3.6) and IE (IE8)... Is this something that is intermittent? Does it work if you resize the window and then restore it? (like if you double click on the titlebar, and then double click again or something)I haven't changed anything in the code, so it shouldn't be any different. 猿も木から落ちる

Re: Right-hand Side-bar
by Hyperworm » Fri 02.12.2010 9:55 am It works onresize but not onload. (Refresh the page when it's too small to contain the sidebar; the sidebar won't disappear)I had some time to kill so I poked around the source code.The problem is the function which hides the sidebar onload is never fired.(There are a few places where window.onload is set, and there seems to be an array onload_functions to stop things colliding with each other. Instead of setting window.onload = getWidth, doCode: Select allonload_functions.push('getWidth()');)The bigger problem though is that http://s3.buysellads.com/ac/bsa.js which is included for advertising purposes sets window.onload at the end of the file >_>; This overrides the implementation that evals the functions in the onload_functions array I guess all you can do is onload on another element (not window) or change what you're doing advertising-wise? ._. (Or ask them to add to window.onload instead of setting it?)(Are you sure it works for FF and IE? ._.)

by becki_kanou » Fri 02.12.2010 10:48 am OK! It works if I manually resize it, without reloading. Thanks phreadom, tokai and Hyperworm!

Re: Right-hand Side-bar
by phreadom » Fri 02.12.2010 10:39 pm Thanks a bunch for the troubleshooting... now that I've spent ~2 weeks learning JavaScript and crunching on a project on the side, I actually totally understand what you're saying and feel like digging into it to fix it as I actually understand what's happening. Funny how a few weeks of studying can really change how you think about things. I had kind of forgotten that I didn't really know JavaScript when I hacked together that functionality.... and now I have a much better grasp of it, so the problem might have been readily apparent to me now, had I just taken the time to look. heheMaybe after a nap and then some coffee... 猿も木から落ちる
