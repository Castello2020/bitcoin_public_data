Re: Could I ask you a favor?
by NileCat » Fri 10.08.2010 4:44 pm Thanks for your wonderful comments, SakeIt2Me-san.Now I think I can see the long, long way I have to go along.My goal would be that I will be able to use the appropriate style of English as the situation demands, let alone the grammatical accuracy. Textbooks are very important, of course. But at the same time, learning some casual (spoken) style wouldn't be harmful. I found I needed to study both of them.Please help me out every now and then.Thank you. NileCat

(A, let alone B ＝ Bはおろか、A)I found I needED to study both of them. ← 両方を勉強してから、どちらも不可欠だったと判断したときに使います。今の時点では、「I've found I need to...」などの方が適当かもしれません・・・

Re: Could I ask you a favor?
by NileCat » Sat 10.09.2010 2:06 pm Thanks, Hyperworm!Although there are some websites offering corrections for your writings, the ones you give me here are a little bit different. I really appreciate it....Yes. Now I'm wondering if the 'offering' part makes sense and 'the ones' is ok... "I have visited a couple of websites where they give me grammatical corrections when I post my writings there, but the corrections you all have been giving me in this forum seem totally different to me, which is great and I'm grateful for your help."

"I have visited a couple of websites where they give me grammatical corrections when I post my writings there, but the corrections you all have been giving me in this forum seem totally different to me, which is great and I'm grateful for your help."Those are ok. I can see possible confusion about why "ones of my weak points" is wrong but "the ones you give" is correct. I can't think of a good principle that explains it, but maybe someone else can. It's worth noting the number of Google results each phrase gets. One phrase yields 2 results (1 of which is this thread) and the other 1.53 million.

No problem, except I'll do it discreetly via a pm if I find it is necessary. 血まみれ剣術師

Re: Could I ask you a favor?
by ss » Mon 10.25.2010 10:42 am Nile-catさん、こんにちは。ネイティブスピーカーとコミュニケートできるくらい良いですね。Nile-catさんはネイティブスピーカーの書くように英語を書きます。ミスをしてもくよくよしないです。１つの言葉が様々な意味があるのと同じように多くの異なったし言葉が同一の意味を持つこともあります。たぶん、間違いを起こすことがあるかもしれませんがでも気にしないでくださいね。私達は毎日頑張り過ぎているので、時々は自分のために時間を使ってください。英語でのフォーラムのやりとりを通じて、どうか英語の勉強を楽しんでください。　ss
