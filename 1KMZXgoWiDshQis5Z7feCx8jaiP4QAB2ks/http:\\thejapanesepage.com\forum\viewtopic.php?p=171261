by Hyperworm » Mon 09.05.2011 7:58 am Parsing error! (So often this is the problem...)だけど(however) + そりゃ（＝それは）だけど is だ(＝です) + けど. See also だが. Basically means the same thing as しかし. fun translation snippets | need something translated?BTC@1KMZXgoWiDshQis5Z7feCx8jaiP4QAB2ks

Re: どそりゃ
by micahcowan » Tue 09.06.2011 2:10 pm So, given what Hyperworm has pointed out, a better translation (without knowing anything further about the context) might be, "But that's a mistake." だけど but; そりゃ that; 間違い a mistake; だ is/(copula). Other translations are possible, but "You were only wrong" is not one of the possibilities.
