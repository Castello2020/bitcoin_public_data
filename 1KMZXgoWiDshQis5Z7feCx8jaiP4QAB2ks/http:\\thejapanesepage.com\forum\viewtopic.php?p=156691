Quick Translation - Grammatical Error?
by allismine » Mon 08.17.2009 12:00 am For a project, I needed to use the expression "my best friend". Along with the more common shinyuu, the phrase "ichiban nakano ii tomodachi" was suggested. I liked the look and sound of the latter better than the former, as it feels stronger (my number one / best friend) and more fitting for my project. The project isn't related to dialogue or characters speaking to one another, hence its informality.I came to the conclusion the phrase would be written out as 一番仲のいい友達. I was quickly corrected by a user who claimed to be a native speaker, and he said the proper translation was 一番仲がいい友達. I messaged them back asking why that was, and still haven't received a reply.I'm only starting to learn Japanese, but I believe the reason why it was wrong is because I used の for 'no', whereas の is used strictly as a possessive and not as a syllable. I just wanted to make sure this was accurate, and if not, why? EDIT: Forgot to clarify; I thought "my" would necessitate の, so...not sure what's going on there.Any help / confirmation would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

Re: Quick Translation - Grammatical Error?
by lonelytraveler8 » Mon 08.17.2009 12:27 am I'm still new myself, but this is how I would interpret each of those:「一番仲のいい友達」[My] number one good/best friend.「一番仲がいい友達」[My] number one friendship/relationship is a good friend.I think I did a terrible job of putting each into English, but basically I see the first as a single word describing a best friend and second as describing a best relationship as being your good friend.Sorry if I wasn't helpful. I wanted to take a crack at giving back to the community, but I'm sure the experts here will give a better response.Edit: Oops.

by NileCat » Mon 08.17.2009 12:38 am You are not wrong. Both are fine.But, well... generally speaking, when the term is shown alone like you did here.一番仲のいい友達 would be preferable as a " good Japanese ". But among young people, some of them would prefer the latter.Well, and I know it is not necessarily true, but 一番仲のいい友達 sounds more matured.EDITED

by Hyperworm » Mon 08.17.2009 9:13 am lonelytraveler8: You missed out 「仲」^^; 「一番仲がいい友達」 is parsed as「((一番)仲がいい)友達」 not 「(一番仲)が(いい友達)」, and の here is a replacement for が in modifying clauses, and has the same meaning as が (but が tends to emphasize the word before it more than の).It's not a grammar problem or anything, but there may be other more subtle differences like NileCat says. I can't help with that ._.

by lonelytraveler8 » Mon 08.17.2009 11:26 am I'm glad to be corrected. Forgetting that character is a bit embarrassing, but the rest of the corrections are helpful and I'll remember them.

Re: 仲「の」いいvs. 仲「が」いい
by coco » Mon 08.17.2009 6:38 pm Welcome to TJP forums. As NileCat-san said, 「（一番）仲の[よい/いい] 友達 」 sounds perfect. He will find it's right when he looks up the word　親友 in a dictionary.互いに信頼し合っている友達。きわめて仲のよい友達。
