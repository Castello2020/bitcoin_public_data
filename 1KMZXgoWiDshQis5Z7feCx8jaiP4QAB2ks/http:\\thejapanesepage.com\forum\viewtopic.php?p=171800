Context, convention, and circumstance are all.And coming into a language learning forum where one of the rules in fact is to take time to write properly, both to show respect for those teachers taking their valuable time to teach you for free, and for the other language learners who might not be native English speakers and who look to others here as, even indirectly, both examples of and teachers of the English language.From the forum rules thread:AJBryant wrote:When you write, please write with proper capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and syntax. In short, like a literate adult instead of a text-messaging chimpanzee.Not everyone here is a native speaker of English, and it would help to make your posts as clear as possible. In addition, it shows a modicum of respect. If you don't respect us enough to take the time write like an educated adult, why should we take the time to respond to you?Dropping a Stephen Fry video and thinking it absolves you of any responsibility to put more effort than a 5 year old into your writing on a language learning forum frankly steams my britches a little in its audacity.I just felt the need to clarify that, since while I do in fact love Stephen Fry, and happen to agree with most of what's said in that video from a linguistic standpoint... your use of it here is improper to put it mildly.I think I was more than polite about this issue at the start, even if Shiroisan wasn't. But to keep arguing with site admins about your right to type like a lazy kid on a language learning forum while expecting us to spend our valuable time trying to help teach you for free... that's a little rude I think.So as a native English speaker, either take the time to write "I'm" instead of "im", especially when asked to do so by the admins on a language learning forum, or go find another website where people don't mind if you, as AJBryant put it, type like "a text-messaging chimpanzee".Seriously... I didn't care at first... but your rude and obstinate attitude about being asked to type a little more "correctly" just smacks of disrespect for the people here who are taking their own time to try to help you.

Sorry I'll try to make more so that maybe you can carry out childish retribution.What you pointed out were subtle errors that native speakers make all the time, which don't sound unnatural in conversation. With you, on the other hand, the errors are very unusual, unnatural and running a spell-check wouldn't fix them. I'm still 100% sure THAT (<---if you insist) you're being deceptive about your native language. However, I won't pursue it further if you're still unwilling to admit the truth.Good day.

Of course, hope may be a tricky example, in that one can have less hope, but one can also have fewer hopes (note that non-"fewer" words can't be pluralized). And of course there is a different air that can go with "fewer": "She puts on fewer airs since I put her in her place." Water can technically be pluralized ("sailing to safer waters"), but it's hard to imagine a sensible phrase where one could say "fewer waters"...All of which of course is really beside the main point phreadom was trying to make... micahcowan

by phreadom » Sun 10.09.2011 4:53 am And that's the fun of language. ^_^ Nothing wrong with that. It's fun food for thought about some of the nuances of English. Maybe some of the non-natives will enjoy trying to wrap their heads around it. 猿も木から落ちる

Re: Hi, (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
by Hyperworm » Sun 10.09.2011 7:24 pm How ironic ... we've entered into the exact discussion I said we wouldn't.And in fact, I said no one would bring it up, but it looks like I'm the one who started it. The prescriptivist would say:You have less than half a gallon left.You have fewer than 10 items.The number of items you have is less than 10.Interestingly, the opposite of "less" is "more" even for uncountable items.You have more than half a gallon left.You have more than 10 items.But not for math, where it's "greater". It seems math does strange things.The number of items you have is greater than 10.( * You have greater than 10 items. ) would probably be thought of as an error, or at least strange.Less/fewer isn't really an important distinction. You can get by without ever using "fewer", though it does sound nicer than "less" in some cases (I like this one I found on google: "fewer words and more action").

by chikara » Sun 10.09.2011 8:51 pm I'd just like to add that I'm a big fan of Stephen Fry also. Oh, and welcome to the forum naranero-san. Don't complain to me that people kick you when you're down. It's your own fault for lying there

Surely our textbooks can't be wrong?That's because NUMBERS (themselves) aren't counted. Ten is LESS than four. In some cases, you have a choice:Ten cows is LESS than twenty cows. (Note the use of "is" -- the "ten cows" is a single unit that is being compared to another single unit of twenty. Treat it like "a six pack.") You can also say "Ten cows are fewer than twenty cows" when you're thinking in terms purely of quantity of cows. It's the same reason a prison sentence of five years should be treated as a single concept when we say "five years isn't that long." We're talking about the TIMESPAN, the SENTENCE, rather than the individual years.

by kuri-chan » Sun 01.01.2012 6:41 am Wow...I just joined and I clicked on this thread because the original poster had so many replies! I thought, "Wow...28 replies?? What in the world happened here?" Interesting first impression! I'm only slightly kidding, as these things tend to happen in almost any forum. I'm still surprised though at how it dragged out. (I wouldn't be honest if I didn't say I didn't also immediately find the first person's post as sounding like a non-native English speaker, but I can't believe it came to this!)I decided I don't care about any of that anymore - I just want to know the details of this 1985 book with the differences in it. I want to know what it shows compared to what we know would be shown today. Could you possibly scan it and just crop down to the letters themselves, so as to not show the book? Don't want to break any rules or anything. I'm very curious about this. And this is my very first post. Hello everyone! I am using a computer at work and don't have the ability to type any Japanese characters at the moment. Chrisaka Kurisuaka Kuri-chan
