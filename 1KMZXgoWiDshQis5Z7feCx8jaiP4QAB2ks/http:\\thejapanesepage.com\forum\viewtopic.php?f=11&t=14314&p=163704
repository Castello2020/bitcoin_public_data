Free online furigana literature?
by Kenitai » Thu 03.04.2010 4:12 pm Hi,I've been wondering if there's any Japanese/English websites that provide free literature, using furigana?Or, if there's a program to instantly evoke furigana from kanji in a bunch of Japanese web literature.Just to prepare for my future university studies... Cheers,Kenitai

by Hyperworm » Thu 03.04.2010 10:52 pm Hiragana Megane may help for furiganaing text.It doesn't work in Google Chrome right now, in case you're using that - the CSS styling Hiragana Megane puts on the ruby tag in order to display furigana in most browsers breaks rendering in Chrome now that Chrome has some support for ruby.Kind of ironic that implementing support for ruby was what caused ruby to stop working, but there we go ^^;Obviously, Hiragana Megane falls into the category of automated language-processing tools, so don't expect it to be 100% reliable.As for free literature with furigana already attached, Aozora Bunko might have some... ._.But generally, by the time you can read that kind of work, you don't need the furigana on most kanji, so... ._.
