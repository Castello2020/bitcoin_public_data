Where is the word for "two " ? i am guessing that "te" in "ryoote" is hand/hands. ...The word "two" is not there but 両手 (りょうて) means "both hands".oldwordstudy wrote:Line 3 kuma san kata ashi ageteWhat is "kata" doing here, since i already knew that "ashi" means "leg"? ...方 (かた) meaning "way of" or "manner of". 方足 by foot? Not sure on that. oldwordstudy wrote:Line 4 kuma san sayoonaraWe Can Hear the Frog SingLine 1 Kaeru no uta ga, kikoete kuru yo"Kikoete" means "can hear." So what is the role of "kuru"? ...Kikoete is "to be heard" or "to be audible" not "can hear" the "kuru" gives the meaning "can be heard". oldwordstudy wrote:Line 2 Kwa kwa kwa kwa ....Are you sure it is kwa and not gwa? I thought the sound of frogs,croak and ribbit, in Japanese is gwa and gero?
Don't complain to me that people kick you when you're down. It's your own fault for lying there

I would say -ete (from 得る) gives the "can" and kuru the "be ~ed" part. Anyway.Blutorange

Re: Mr. Bear, Mr. Bear - lyric question tranditional Jp Song
by Hyperworm » Fri 04.08.2011 2:14 pm 聞こえる isn't a potential verb itself and, as far as I know, has no connection to 得（え）る.It's just a fundamentally different way of expressing the idea of audibility, compared to English.聞こえる１ 音・声などが耳で感じられる。自然に耳に入る。「汽笛が―・える」(1) [Of a sound, voice etc] To be perceived by the ears. To naturally enter the ears.歌が聞こえる the song is perceived by the ears / enters the ears(I hear the song)Examined this way, ～てくる can be seen in its normal function "this verb happens while in a sense approaching the speaker"."the song comes entering(into) the ears", or "the song will come entering the ears".It could be taken as emphasizing the apparent distance/faintness of the sound（遠くから聞こえてくる音） or the fact that you only just begun hearing it（あ、今聞こえてきた）.It also seems like it can describe the situation from a more third-person perspective...?How to translate this is another question...

I thought the sound of frogs,croak and ribbit, in Japanese is gwa and gero?I can't attest to "kwa" vs. "gwa", but frogs can definitely say either "kero" or "gero". For example, Slippy Toad in the video game Star Fox uses both "kero" and "gero".
