English to Japanese translation question!
by Afro di Ziac » Wed 10.20.2010 8:24 pm Okay, so I'm writing and speaking to myself in Japanese...and I'm not sure if I'm saying this correctly: "Since I didn't know how to write this word in Kanji, I wrote it in katakana."Is this correct? 「漢字で書けませんから、かたかなでこの言葉をかきました。」Also, if I were to write this in the plain form(s), is the following how I would say it?「漢字で書けなくなかったから、かたかなでこの言葉を書いた。」

by Hyperworm » Wed 10.20.2010 9:23 pm The end part would sound more natural as 「この言葉はカタカナで書きました。」, but it's not really wrong as-is, I think. Your plain form has a mistake.書けなくなかった → 書けなかった (or, 書けない)

Don't complain to me that people kick you when you're down. It's your own fault for lying there
