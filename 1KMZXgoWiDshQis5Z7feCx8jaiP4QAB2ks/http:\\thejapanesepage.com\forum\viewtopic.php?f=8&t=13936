Help with matching handwritten kanji
by badshotbaby » Sun 11.08.2009 2:22 am Hi TJPers, I am reading this manga and can't seem to match this handwritten kanji (I attached a picture) in my dictionary (Spahn-Hadamitzky) or at KanjiDB (http://www.whiteknightlogic.net/kanjidb/). The characters are talking about sitting posture. I thought it looked like the kanji here: http://www.whiteknightlogic.net/kanjidb ... /kb9b9.php. But then the sentence wouldn't make sense.I would be grateful for any ideas as to which kanji it is.Yoi ichinichi all!

Re: Help with matching handwritten kanji
by magamo » Sun 11.08.2009 2:32 am It's 悪. The phrase is 座りが悪い, which means "unstable," "be/feel uncomfortable," "not quite right" and the like.EDIT: The reading is すわりがわるい.
Before you criticize someone, walk a mile in their shoes. That way when you criticize them, you are a mile away and you have their shoes.

Re: Help with matching handwritten kanji
by badshotbaby » Thu 02.04.2010 3:00 pm Hi there, I ran into another mysterious handwritten kanji (well, mysterious to me, anyway) in my manga. I uploaded the partial scan here. The closest symbol I could find was 齡, which doesn't fit in with the sentence. The radical on the left looks like "white"...any suggestions on what radical this may fall under is appreciated.
