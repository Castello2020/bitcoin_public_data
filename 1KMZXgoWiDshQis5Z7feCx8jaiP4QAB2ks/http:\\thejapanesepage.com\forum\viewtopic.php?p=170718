Re: Terribly confused :S
by micahcowan » Fri 07.08.2011 10:08 pm I'll just add, it's a more common, generally useful phrase in Japanese than its English equivalent.For example, in the book "Reading Japanese With A Smile" (a collection of short stories in Japanese), there's a story where a woman is saying it to herself (「これは手を出さないわね！」) as she hungrily eyes her mother-in-law's box of donuts.(You can read that story, freely and legally, via this direct link to the PDF sample.)
