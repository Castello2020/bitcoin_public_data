How would one say "over the past few weeks/days"?
by Sivak » Fri 05.15.2009 1:09 am Well, topic pretty much says it all.But if I wanted to say the following, how would I do it?Over the past few weeks...Over the past few days...For the past month or so...I had a guess for this situation:"For the past two weeks or so..."略２週は。。。 though I'm probably wrong.Thank you for any information!

by Hyperworm » Fri 05.15.2009 9:54 am この数週間 also works.(but it seems to get fewer hits... more when you use 2週間 instead though ._.)

Re: How would one say "over the past few weeks/days"?
by Sivak » Fri 05.15.2009 1:23 pm Hello. I see. 数 functions like "several", which is nice. I kind of feel silly since I saw something in Genki a little bit ago about this sort of topic.So to be sure I fully understand...僕は日本語を３週間ぐらい勉強しました。"I've been studying Japanese for approx. 3 weeks" ???僕は日本語を数週間勉強しました。"I've been studying Japanese for several weeks" ???Is this right? Thank you!

by Sivak » Fri 05.15.2009 2:31 pm I see. Yes, I knew that I was using the past tense and I know about the interpretation you mentioned. I was wondering if this could also be interpreted as "have been studying" or is that another grammar point I'll be finding out later? Thanks for the info, folks.
