by becki_kanou » Sat 04.30.2011 8:21 pm The old Mangajin had some great tips on studying with manga, and they put out two books which are still available from amazon. MangajinI'd recommend getting a strong grasp of the basics before diving into manga though, otherwise you'll find it very frustrating.

Re: Learn Japanese through MANGA
by Hyperworm » Sat 04.30.2011 8:28 pm Wow, it's pretty impressive that a legal free website like Jコミ exists at all. Of course, the selection isn't very big. It's surprising to see Love Hina being offered ._.becki_kanou's advice is very good. You don't want to attempt to learn basic grammar through manga. Use manga at the stage when you already know a good deal of grammar, and just want to pick up vocab and make yourself more familiar with slang.I prefer reading manga from tankoubon rather than online. I'd advocate buying a couple from yesasia/jbox (or Japanese sites like bk1 or HMV) if you already know which series you like. (Get the feeling I've left out a site there...)

Re: Learn Japanese through MANGA
by caladwenaeariel » Sat 04.30.2011 11:19 pm I am doing this too! I bought six Kuroshitsuji manga, and I'm going to translate them.BUT... I can't read Japanese... so right now, reading manga is mostly just about appreciating the pictures ... I'm still working on my kanji and grammar, but I have some great dictionaries and I'm going to take it slow! The website for manga sounds like a really good idea, I might try it, but I'm much more motivated to stick with it when I have a book in my hands.
