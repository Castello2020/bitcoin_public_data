Are these sentence forms correct?
by kentaku_sama » Sat 09.04.2010 10:55 am I've been using a random sentence generator and this is some of the forms I learned:彼は店に行ったに偉いない。　He must have went to the store.彼は店に行ったははずがない。　He must not have gone to the store.　彼は１度も店に行った事がない。He has never gone to the store.　I want to make sure I'm not learning wrong.
