by wccrawford » Tue 11.10.2009 8:50 am I had fun trying to figure this out. I managed to figure out that it was saying something about 'other pokemon', but that was all. (I misread pasocon, or I'd have understand that bit as well, I think.)

by Hyperworm » Wed 11.11.2009 7:16 am Given the stage's purpose, "mitsu" probably comes from "three", so maybe "The Tristage" or something? I'm sure they'll come up with a different name when it's localized. ^^;
