Help with a couple short audio clips
by Frobnitz » Fri 12.11.2009 9:31 pm I just can't make out a couple certain words, even with slowing down the audio. The character's telling a ghost story: someone's in an old building at night, they come across a door that's not supposed to be there, they enter it and see something, they die - the usual stuff. Clip 1: "Sono mayonaka ni, sakasa ni tomoshita rousoku o motte..." (Is that correct? I initially couldn't make out what I think is the "rousoku", but how does one have a candle lit from "sakasa"? Is it "sakasa" being said?)Clip 2: "Sono heya no naka ni wa, mirai no jibun **nai de**, kiku koto wa nan de mo kotaete [kurenasasou da]." (I imagine he's seeing an image of his future self, but I can't make out the short bit after "jibun".)Thanks for any help.

by Hyperworm » Fri 12.11.2009 10:23 pm 2 is "ga ite".I guess 1 just means "lit upside-down", though I seem to be getting zero results for "sakasa(ma) ni tomoshita" (kanjified various ways), which is confusing me a bit.

by kurisuto » Fri 12.11.2009 10:45 pm I'd say "he held upside-down a candle that was lit" (i.e "tomoshita rousoku o sakasa ni motte"), but then, it's the first time I've seen "sakasa ni", and I don't really know how it's used.

Re: Help with a couple short audio clips
by Frobnitz » Fri 12.11.2009 10:58 pm Thank you, both of you. A Google search did nothing for me on the "sakasa" bit, either. Apparently, candle technology has advanced in some way unknown to us.Anyone else have any ideas on how you light a candle backwards/upside-down?

Re: Help with a couple short audio clips
by Frobnitz » Sat 12.12.2009 12:21 am Do people really do that - hold candles with the lit end on the bottom? Is there some cultural detail I'm missing? It seems an oddly random detail to put in a ghost story.

Re: Help with a couple short audio clips
by magamo » Sat 12.12.2009 3:12 am The first clip is saying "その真夜中に、逆さにともしたろうそくを持って、" (そのまよなかに、さかさにともしたろうそくをもって、)The second clip abruptly ends before the speaker finishes his line, but the sound it has in the mp3 file is "その部屋の中には、未来の自分がいて、聞くことは何でも答えてくれ..." (そのへやのなかには、みらいのじぶんがいて、きくことはなんでもこたえてくれ…) I kind of think it's a bit odd [nasasou da] follows it though.The reverse lit candle thing seems totally random to me too.
Before you criticize someone, walk a mile in their shoes. That way when you criticize them, you are a mile away and you have their shoes.
