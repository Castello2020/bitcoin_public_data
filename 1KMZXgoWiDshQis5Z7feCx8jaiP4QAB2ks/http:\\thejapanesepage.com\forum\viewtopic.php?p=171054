A compilation of random questions
by BlindReader » Sun 08.14.2011 1:03 am 1. 昨日、時間がなかったんです。 - Is there any difference between ありませんでした　and がなかったんです?2. In the above sentence. Why is there an "n" before desu? Did I miss a rule about n before desu? Another example: どこに　書くんですか。3. Difference between 知る　and 分かる.4. How do you say: What is the difference between A and B?5. At what JLPT level does honorifics/humble forms appear?6. すみません。あしたの　じゅぎょう、　休みたいんですが。 - Why does it end in ga?7. 食るながら? I don't get it. What does this mean? I also found this "見ながら" so it must be a set expression that I haven't studied yet. What is it?8. れ, ... starting a sentence with this letter. What does it mean and is it still pronounced re?9. 会えれば - Why not 会えば?

Re: A compilation of random questions
by squarezebra » Sun 08.14.2011 7:27 am 1. the existence of ん in the first sentence2. ん in 行くんです etc is a contraction of the explanatory のです used for giving explanations or creating a greater sense of closeness between the speaker and listener3. very similar to the difference between to know vs to understand. 「Did you know that π = 3.142? 知らなかった」 「do you understand this equation? 「分からない」Read lots of example sentence for these words at http://www.alc.co.jp/ and you'll soon get it4. AとBはどう違いますか？5. Can't answer that question really. At the latest I'd say you need to know them for N36. Difficult for me to explain, probably better looking in a textbook for that question. It raises the politeness level of the sentence. Often used when asking for favours, or giving an explanation for some unfortunate occurence (like you didn't do your homework, or you're on the phone and the doorbell rings); I'm sure there are MANY more uses than this, but thats all i can think of right now. 7. 食べるながら is wrong. It's 食べながら, and it means whilst eating (the doorbell rang, or i had a heart attack). 見ながら - whilst looking .. you get the picture. Attach ながら to the ます stem of a verb8. i have no idea what you are talking about, but the Japanese pronunciation doesn't change.9. Now don't quote me on this, because I'm just guessing really. 会えば - if we meet. 会えれば - if we COULD meet ((会うことが出来れば)) (会えれば嬉しい- I'd be happy if we could meet; you might be asking someone if they'd like to meet, or you could be daydreaming). These are my thoughts, but I'm by no means any kind of expert ... ask around to be sure Spend less time thinking, and more time doing. squarezebra

Re: A compilation of random questions
by Retsubty » Mon 08.15.2011 1:08 am ending a sentence with けど or が is liek "well....I would like to take a day off but.." to lighten the request or even "you should watch this movie but yea" "you should watch this movie but it's ok if you don't" 会えれば＝会えるーー＞会えれば　If can meetinformal 違うformal 違いますinformal explanatory: 違うんだformal explanatory：違うんです

Don't think "ga" has the function of lightening the request. It is the result of omitting the last half.

Re: A compilation of random questions
by Hyperworm » Mon 08.15.2011 7:55 am Would you not say that the implicit asking of permission caused by が lightens the request? .-.Without が it's just a blunt statement saying "This is what I want."

Re: A compilation of random questions
by Retsubty » Mon 08.15.2011 9:35 am But essentially that's what it does. It lightens the request the second part has that function. In english casual talk adding "but yea" to the end of the sentence is exactly the same as けど or が to the end of a japanese sentence.みてほしいんだけど I want you to see it but yea (informal) みてほしいんですが Well I would like you to see it... (less informal)Another thing that lightens the mood of a sentence in english is "lol",I hate you lol.you should read this book lol.

Re: A compilation of random questions
by richvh » Mon 08.15.2011 9:03 pm 8. Are you sure the sentences aren't starting with ね? If so, it's a casual attention getter, sort of like "Hey, ..." or "Say, ..."

Re: A compilation of random questions
by Ranja » Mon 08.15.2011 9:17 pm Ga means "but ..." or "and ...", which is different fromt Yo or Ne that actually ends and softens the sentence.Omitting the actual part of the request is some kind of politeness in Japanese.Ending a sentence with Ga is always implying something to be followed after that. This technique is called 言葉を濁す(Kotoba o nigosu)."Guess what I want" is the basis of Japanese conversation. (Wow)Retsubty wrote:But essentially that's what it does.

(less informal)Another thing that lightens the mood of a sentence in english is "lol",I hate you lol.you should read this book lol.I haven't encountered "but yea" expression, but are you saying "appending lol or 'but yea' at the end of a sentence lightens the mood of the sentence. Ga at the end has the same effect."?If that is what you are claiming, then I'm afraid you are wrong.In normal context "みてほしいんです" is not a strong request, so you need not to lighten the sentence. Literally it only states that the speaker has some humble wish. By adding Ga at the end, the speaker is converting the *humble wish* to a request, implyingみてほしいんですが（どうでしょうか？）So you might encounter the conversaiont such asA. ○○をみてほしいんですが。B. が、なんでしょう？A. あしたにしましょう (Let's do it tommorow.) / おねがいできますか？(Could you, please?)B. OK。Ending in Ga can be sometimes too ambiguous. In that case, you can ask a question in return by saying something like "が?", "が、なんです？", which implies "Go ahead. Feel free to say what you want".

Re: A compilation of random questions
by Retsubty » Mon 08.15.2011 11:43 pm Umm but that's exactly what "lightening the request means" "I want you to watch this but what do you think?" is a lighter request than "I want you to watch this""but yea" is a method of shortening this not unlike けどLightening a request is to take the other person's opinion into account or to not force yourself onto another. Which is exactly what the second part of every sentence you've added does. I believe our definition of Lightening the Request is what is differing.It can be "pushing the time back (you don't have to do this now)" "is it okay?" "what do you think?" etc all of these that you mentioned are less pushy than just saying "I want you to see this"I didn't say it wasn't a guessing game, honestly it's not hard to guess it's obvious that there is a slight hesitation in asking the question and the result is always a lightening of the request. It helps in not sounding quite pushy as I've mentioned.YO and NE do not lighten the request. Ne can lighten the mood, but most of the time it has absolutely no meaning. YO is used when you are telling somebody something, similar to "you know."

Re: A compilation of random questions
by furrykef » Thu 08.18.2011 1:29 pm Nobody ever says "but yea". "But yeah", maybe. "Yea" is a different word from "yeah" and is pronounced "yay". It's mostly encountered these days in the phrase "yea or nay".Of course, many people online spell "yeah" as "yea", but then, they often spell "you" as "u", so...(Note that this "so..." is similar to the very phenomenon we've been discussing! I didn't even do that on purpose.)
