Re: Anyone like Yaoi/Shounen-Ai?
by Sairana » Fri 06.20.2008 1:57 am ? I can pull lots of threads where people have talked about what they find attractive, and no one pulled the "questionable content" card with them. Why is this different?

by chikara » Fri 06.20.2008 2:34 am Sorry, it would seem I was over zealous. Only religion and politics are taboo subjects on these forums. Discussion of sex and sexual orientation is OK. Please proceed.But I would still like an answer to my question Don't complain to me that people kick you when you're down. It's your own fault for lying there

Things got a whole lot more suggestive with all the schoolgirl-outfit-discussing over in the "favorite fashions" thread a few months back.I'm not a boy-on-boy fan. I just find it a bit distressing that this particular comment was immediately pounced on and referred to the faq. The grandma litmus test is flawed, anyway. My grandmother was racist (and I'm quite serious, not being cheeky). The things I could say that she'd approve of aren't appropriate here.

Still not exactly erotic in my book but in many countries it would be considered such. There are a lot of homophobic people in the world. I am not one of them.I apologise for any offense I may have caused. Mr Grumpypants

Despite the Japanese meaning of it, a name ending in ~ra　screams girl to me. I avoid picture threads, since I never post pics of myself, I suppose I don't feel I have the right to gawk at others'. PS: We apparently have some very hot guys around here. Sairana

by becki_kanou » Fri 06.20.2008 4:30 am Thanks for posting that link. I haven't looked through the archives that much, but it's interesting to see what everyone looks like. Most people didn't look anything like I imagined them.
