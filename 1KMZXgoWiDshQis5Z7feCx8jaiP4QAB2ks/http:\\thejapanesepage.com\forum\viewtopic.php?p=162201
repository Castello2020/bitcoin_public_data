Could you correct my English?
by aky2010 » Sat 01.02.2010 3:23 am こんにちは。英作文の練習をしております。私の祖母について（なんとなくですが）書いてみました。なぜか少し暗い話になってしまいました。。grammarも正しい単語の使い方も、間違いだらけだと思いますのでどうかよろしくお願いします！My grandmotherThought she is dead when I was 14, but I'm still remember that she was really kind and generous person. She loved their ground children include me and she always gave us some snacks,ice cream and juice whatever children like.I've never seen that she get angry. She might had been overprotective person for us, so my parents used to complain about that she gives us some snacks. But she didn't stop it in the end.When I was 13, she was getting feel bad and then went into the hospital for treatment for a long time because it seemed to have a malignant tumor on her brain. She was getting forgettable about everything, which means it was started her dementia.About half year later, she got out of the hospital temporarily. But I didn't talk much with her because it wasn't easy for her to talk logically any more. Then finally, She even forgot my name. It was really sad. But to be honest, I had been impatient rather than sadness at that time because of my childish thinking. What a stupid.What the most regrettable thing is why I understood her disease. It was too late when I noticed about that. She wasn't there anymore.-------------------------------------------------------以上です。I'm confused which tense I should use. because my grandmother is not alive anymore..for example this sentence,"I've never seen that she get angry." ....Should I use past perfect ?I would be happy if someone help me.Thank you,Aki2010

Re: Could you correct my English?
by Infidel » Sat 01.02.2010 4:48 am Hrm, we need a strike through button for editing. Since you asked I'll just do a quick sentence-by sentence correction as the forum isn't really designed well for showing edited text. Anything that doesn't become obvious, just let me know and I'll explain why I made the corrections I did. These corrections mainly address the wording, my punctuation corrections are a bit less reliable--punctuation was always my weak point. To keep close to the original wording, I'll try to make few changes purely for reasons of style, and keep my changes for the purpose of clarity. My grandmotherThought she is dead when I was 14, but I'm still remember that she was really kind and generous person. Although she was already dead when I was fourteen, I still remember her as a really kind and generous person.She loved their ground children include me and she always gave us some snacks,ice cream and juice whatever children like. She loved her grand children, including me, and she always gave us some snacks: ice cream, juice, anything a child would like.I've never seen that she get angry. I never saw her get angry.\I've never seen her get angry. She might had been overprotective person for us, so my parents used to complain about that she gives us some snacks. But she didn't stop it in the end. She probably spoiled us, so my parents would complain when she gave us snacks. But in the end she wouldn't stop.When I was 13, she was getting feel bad and then went into the hospital for treatment for a long time because it seemed to have a malignant tumor on her brain.When I was thirteen, she started feeling bad and went to the hospital where she stayed for a long time for treatment after they found a malignant tumor in her brain. She was getting forgettable about everything, which means it was started her dementia. She was forgetting everything before going to the hospital, which meant her dementia had already begun.About half year later, she got out of the hospital temporarily. About half a year later...But I didn't talk much with her because it wasn't easy for her to talk logically any more. ...anymoreThen finally, She even forgot my name. It was really sad. But to be honest, I had been impatient rather than sadness at that time because of my childish thinking. ...I had been impatient rather than sad... What a stupid. I just didn't know any better.\I was such an idiot. ..I'm guessing your intent here.What the most regrettable thing is why I understood her disease. It was too late when I noticed about that. She wasn't there anymore.The most regrettable thing is when I finally understood her disease, it was too late...
なるほど。

Re: Could you correct my English?
by aky2010 » Sun 01.03.2010 9:33 am Camino1ca and Infidel , Thank you so much for correcting!! I read your correction carefully, and I have some questions again →I never saw her get angry.\I've never seen her get angry. Can we use "I had never seen her get angry" as well ? Because,umm..how should I say,I don't have any chance to see her get angry anymore.(祖母の怒った姿を見られる機会はどのみちもう無いから?)→She probably spoiled usspoiled ＝甘やかす　なんですね!! I didn't know that..Is "overprotect" too formal or just irrelevant?→so my parents would complain when she gave us snacks. But in the end she wouldn't stop.・We shouldn't use "used to"? I thought "used to " can be used as repeated action in the past ・What's the different between "didn't stop" and "wouldn't stop" in this situation? Anyway,thanks again!!

by Hyperworm » Sun 01.03.2010 3:31 pm spoiled ＝甘やかす　なんですね!! I didn't know that..Is "overprotect" too formal or just irrelevant?I think it doesn't apply here. "Overprotective" is used in contexts like- not allowing someone to do something (go to a club, eat certain types of food, etc) for fear it will hurt or damage them in some way (overprotect because it might be considered normal for that person to eat those foods or go to clubs, and the protection might be considered unnecessary)- responding fiercely to any slightly negative comments made about that person even when the person is not within earshot, protecting them from criticism (overprotect because it may be unnecessary to rebuke all such negative comments)and so on. I don't think there's this kind of "(over)protection" in your sentence. Spoiling / doting on someone is not necessarily an act of "protection" from external threat.We shouldn't use "used to"? I thought "used to " can be used as repeated action in the past "used to complain" and "would complain" are both fine to me here.What's the different between "didn't stop" and "wouldn't stop" in this situation?I think "wouldn't" emphasizes the fact that she made a conscious choice not to stop. She refused to stop.

Because,umm..how should I say,I don't have any chance to see her get angry anymore.That is the reason why we don't use "had never seen" "had never seen" means "until that point I had never seen her get angry, but then that changed/it might change from now on"(Had never seenは「そのときまでの範囲で、見たことがなかった（が・・・その後見ました・見る経験の無さはこれから変わる可能性があります）」という意味です)We often use this tense in sentences like "I had never seen her get angry until that day" （その日まで、怒った姿を見たことがなかった）When talking about something which has not happened and has no possibility of happening, we use the normal past tense. (I didn't visit the world trade center towers in NY / I never visited the world trade center towers in NY) For something that hasn't happened but might in the future, we use the tense you suggested. (I haven't visited Italy [yet])

Anyway,thanks again!!Oops, and I meant to not make stylistic changes so my corrections would be easier to understand. "used to" and "would" are interchangeable here. And as Hyperworm said, I used "wouldn't stop" to emphasize that her not stopping was a deliberate decision on her part and not carelessness. I actually considered using "refused to stop." But it seemed too confrontational. Keat and Hyperworm explained the rest pretty well--better than I would have been able to.

Re: Could you correct my English?
by aky2010 » Sun 01.10.2010 8:46 am みなさまThank you so much and ご連絡が遅くなりましてごめんなさい。Finally, I got it the difference between "used to" and "would".Although both can be used when I describe "repeated action" in the past, "would" can't be used when I describe states. like, ×I would have a cat in my child food. ○I use to have a cat....I hope it is right..and now I understood how to use "overprotect" and "had never" as well たぶん・・・笑umm...but I have no idea the difference between American English and British. 回答頂いた皆様、ありがとうございました。I would be happy I could ask this kind of questions sometimes.

X child food O childhoodX use to O used toand now I understood how to use "overprotect" and "had never" as well たぶん・・・笑umm...but I have no idea the difference between American English and British. To my ear at least, the biggest differences between British and American English are the vowel sounds (母音) and the lack of rhoticity (Rの音) in British English. There are also some vocabulary differences too. e.g. lorry/truck, flat/apartment, biro/ ballpoint pen etc.回答頂いた皆様、ありがとうございました。I would be happy I could ask this kind of questions sometimes.Feel free to ask all the questions you want! そうだ、嬉しいんだ、生きる喜び！

I have no idea the difference between American English and British. ......The difference between written British English (Queen's English, BBC English) and American English is the spelling. In American English "anymore" is a word and it has a different meaning to the words "any more". In British English "anymore" is not a word and is considered a misspelling of "any more".

It's me!" the demon shouted to him.- Just fine, but add a space after the comma.Peter looked back again slowly and looked at him.There was a young boy who was holding a demon mask by his hand laughing.- Change "by" to "in.""Sorry,my little brother.I didn't mean to surprise you." Jack said.- "my little brother" is ok, but I don't think most brothers would say that. Try removing the "my." Also one space after the comma and two after the period.Jack seemed to found the mask in a old house,which was not used for a long time,on the way back to home from school. - seemed to => "probably" or "must have"- Space after the comma.

Same here!
