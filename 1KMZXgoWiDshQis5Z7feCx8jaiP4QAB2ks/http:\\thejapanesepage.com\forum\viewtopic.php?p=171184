explanation for 徹底
by mella » Mon 08.29.2011 4:30 am 里で徹底したある掟が作らんだ。A rule, who is complete, was created for this village.I think that my translation is not correct, but 徹底 means completeness or thoroughness.

Don't complain to me that people kick you when you're down. It's your own fault for lying there

by Ranja » Wed 09.07.2011 11:10 am 里で徹底したある掟が作らんだ。This is evidently a typo. It must be 里で徹底したある掟が作られた。A certain strict rule was made in the village.
