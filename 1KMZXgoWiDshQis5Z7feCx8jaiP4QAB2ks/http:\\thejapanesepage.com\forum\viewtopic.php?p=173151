Re: Puella Magi Madoka Magica
by Hyperworm » Tue 03.13.2012 10:37 am In all seriousness, I liked Madoka. Good series. I just love the animation (the witch segments are really unique), there are some awesome character abilities, and the Homura plot is moving The music was really good too. (Although there weren't as many awesome action tracks as I remembered when I checked out the soundtrack... )I've been wondering whether I should check out either of the other Puella Magi manga.I have three recommendations for anyone who liked it, most relevant first (I will refrain from going into any detail on the plot...):Mai-HiME:The last 10 episodes are absolutely what make the series. If you give up before then, it's the same as not watching it at all. It's twice the length of Madoka, but it gives you more time to familiarize yourself with the cast. The manga of Bokurano:Compared to Madoka, the stakes are raised.Steins;GateFighting a fixed destiny to save someone.

Re: Puella Magi Madoka Magica
by phreadom » Tue 03.13.2012 10:47 am I've been toying with the idea of checking out Steins;Gate...I'm not big into anime these days, but I was poking around the net recently seeing if there were any out there worth checking out (that I hadn't seen already).

Re: Puella Magi Madoka Magica
by Hyperworm » Tue 03.13.2012 1:06 pm I'd feel sorry if this turned into a Steins;Gate thread, since it's not really all that relevant Some videos of Madoka Portable (released in a few days ) should bring this back on topic fun translation snippets | need something translated?BTC@1KMZXgoWiDshQis5Z7feCx8jaiP4QAB2ks
