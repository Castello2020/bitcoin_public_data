Listen to this sound file? (beginner japanese)
by Shiroisan » Sun 11.06.2011 2:21 am Edit: Wow, after typing a whole post asking for help on what the very last verb this guy said was, I finally heard it myself before even submitting. I'm now surprised that I didn't hear it until now. I think it's because I didn't realize that word was supposed to use that specific particle, so I thought it was a different word all together.Instead of not publishing this post, (since I already went through the trouble of uploading it for here) I'll leave it for any beginner that comes across this to practice their listening comprehension. I'll type out what he's saying below in hiragana...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TZ_322igSE(How do you link youtube videos on this forum anyway?)Script:Spoiler: これはあたたかそうなセーターですね。ええ、あまりたかくないし、いろもきれいですね。そうですね。もうすぐちちのたんじょうびだから、ちちにかいたいとおもうんですがー。いいですね。じゃあ、ちちのプレゼントはこれにきめました。I underlined the sound that I had to listen to over and over again to understand -.-
