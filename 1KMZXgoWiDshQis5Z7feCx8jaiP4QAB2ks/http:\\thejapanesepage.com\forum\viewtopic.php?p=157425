On the former, not very good. On the latter... also not very good.It would help, in future, if you want sentences *checked*, that you provide the original intent. You might be correctly saying ONE thing, while incorrectly saying what you MEANT to say. It is also possible that you might be producing gibberish, and we would have no idea of how to help with what your intent may have been.Tony

(In italiano potrebbe essere qualcosa del tipo "mi fa schifo" che come sai è abbastanza forte ...)Hello Astaroth!In my grammar book there's written that you can use it (kirai) when you want to say "I don't like"...But now that you make me think about the usage of "kirai" I agree with you.Maybe きらい is used preferably in situations like "I hate" or "I detest" as you said!Thank you!(Essì, sarebbe troppo forte. C'è una differenza abissale tra il dire "non mi piace!" e "mi fa schifo!". Grazie per avermi fatto notare questa cosa )Greetings,Minarai
Oooh it's always the same...c'mon Zenigata!Let me go, I'm just a gentleman!Good bye paparino!...Make a better world, that's for you and me...

Re: Japanese sentences in the Informal Present Negative.
by furrykef » Tue 09.01.2009 12:14 pm Here it is in English, with the part you're confused about in bold: "Mr. Paper-san tried to call France yesterday, but since France is not a person, but a country, it doesn't talk."It's entirely possible that I said it wrong or unnaturally. I was just being silly. (In fact, the first time I posted it, I had actually written "France is not a language, but a country"... now that doesn't make sense. ^^; Guess it was a Freudian slip...)- Kef

I looked up "Not an X but a Y" in Pocket Kenkyusha and that's what it had -- even had an example sentence that didn't seem that different from what I was trying to say...but it is a weird sentence. Yeah, but then, so is "furansu ga hanasanai" - Kef

Re: Japanese sentences in the Informal Present Negative.
by Astral Abraxas » Fri 10.30.2009 8:26 pm Learn hiragana/katakana if you still haven't. Then you wouldn't make mistakes likeseeing suki as an i-adjective... miruku ga sukkunai naミルクが好きじゃないmiruku ga suki ja nai(I) don't like milkmiruku wa yokunai shinjiru信じる(shinjiru) is a verb that means "to believe" or "have faith in"I was practicing grammar awhile back with it so I have an example sentence:日本人は生きる目的が天皇に仕えることだと信じた。 (nihonjin ha ikiru mokutekiga tenou ni tsukaeru koto da to shinjita) Which means "Japanese believedthe purpose of life was to serve the emperor." That's how 信じる(shinjiru) isused.ミルクがよくないと思う。miruku ga yokunai to omou(I) think milk isn't good.kyou wa koukou e ikanai今日は高校へ行かないKyou ha koukou e ikanai(I) won't go to high school today.You may want to consider the use of 学校(gakkou) instead. 高校(koukou) isn't wrongbut I'm just thinking of the scenario that you're probably thinking of. 高校(koukou)just seems highly specific for most situations in my opinion. When I was a high schoolstudent I wouldn't ever say "I'm not going to high school tomorrow"... I would alwaysjust say "I'm not going to school tomorrow"You did your contrasting with は(wa) wrong in the next two. They are both negative.what exactly are you trying to contrast? You should try having one in the negativeand one in the positive. I'm going to put them into 1 sentence.tamanegi wa taberu koto ga sukkunai na. soshite, tamago wa taberu koto ga sukkunai naYou tried to say "I don't like to eat onions. And then, I don't like to eat eggs". That doesn't evenreally make much sense in English to be honest. Let's try doing it this way:たまねぎは食べることが好きじゃないけど、たまごは食べることが好きだ。tamanegi ha taberu koto ga suki ja nai kedo, tamago ha taberu koto ga suki desu.I don't like to eat onions but, I like to eat eggs.Here you are contrasting eggs with onions in a way that makes sense. Before you werecontrasting them in a way that didn't make much sense.kono bideo geimu ga sukkunai naこのテレビゲームが好きじゃない。kono terebi ge-mu ga suki ja nai.(I) don't like this video game.furansu ga hanasanaiフランス語が話せないfuransugo ga hanasenaihanasenai is the negative-potential of hanasu. Which I believe is what you really wanted to say. Also don't forget to append the -go to the name of the country to specify that you're talking about the language.フランス語を話さないfuransugo o hanasaiisn't incorrect but it means "I won't" or "I don't speak french"... Nothing about your ability. Which is something I think you didn't intend.One last note: when I see -na I think either "negative-imperative" or "kansai-ben of ne" either of which would be wrong in all of the cases you used. I think you meant なあ(naa). Please do a long a sound when doing that I realize this is a slight necro-post however the rules state that it's ok to necro-post if what you have to say contributes to the topic. I believe this contributes. So don't jump down my throat lol -_-
