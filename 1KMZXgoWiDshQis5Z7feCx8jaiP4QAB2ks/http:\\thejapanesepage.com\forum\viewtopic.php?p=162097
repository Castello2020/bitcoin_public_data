Sentence help
by leonl » Thu 12.31.2009 7:37 pm 私はこれからも医者のしごとをしながら、この子を育てます。I am a little confused about this sentence.I know nagara is being used to connect these two sentences saying while doing x I also do y, but I am confused as to the overall meaning. Separately I think I understand both sentences fine, but together I'm not exactly sure what the entire sentence is trying to say, or why nagara is being used hereI've translated the sentence like this.1. While beinig a doctor I will raise a child.2. While i work as a doctor, I raise childrenThanks for looking

Answer those two questions and you'll get it immediately wouldn't the -te form of sodateru be そだてて　育てている?You are right In which case, これからも is another important component which shouldn't be overlooked!Breaking it down like this might be easier to understand:これからもこの子を育てます。医者のしごとをしながら。(I got 育てる mixed up with 育ってる, but even that wouldn't be right!)

Re: Sentence help
by leonl » Sun 01.03.2010 10:55 pm Thankyou for the responses, sorry it has taken so long for me to reply. I took another look at this sentence and I'm afraid its still above my head. Seperatley all the words and grammar make perfect sense to me, but I'm still a little lost.I made another attempt thoughtAs a doctor I care for children.I think the korekara mo is whats tripping me up here. Korekara from what I understand means after this, or from now, but I don't understand what meaning mo has here.

Re: Sentence help
by becki_kanou » Sun 01.03.2010 11:33 pm I think the most important thing your missing is (as keatonatron pointed out) この子.i.e. it is not just the generic "children" but rather the specific "this child".

Re: Sentence help
by leonl » Mon 01.04.2010 12:36 am As a Doctor I will also raise this childThats my best guess, I think its right. Thanks again for the help guys, this was only one out of the four example sentences for that pattern that gave me any trouble at all, I'm actually kind of embrassed.

Re: Sentence help
by Hyperworm » Mon 01.04.2010 10:35 am The sentence makes the following important assertions.1. I will bring up / raise this child.2. I will do so while doing my job as a doctor.3. I have done (at least one of?) these things in the past, and will continue to do so.The last one is slightly uncertain based on what これからも actually applies to - i.e. is the sentence equivalent to3a. 私は医者のしごとをしながら、これからもこの子を育てます。or3b. 私はこの子を育てます。これからも医者のしごとをしながら。(dubious?) or3c. 私はこれからも医者のしごとをするし、これからもこの子を育てます。I would say 3c is most likely, then 3a, then 3b. Context would probably answer this question."I will continue to raise this child, and I will do so while doing my job as a doctor."

As for context, this sentence exist in isolation in a textbook for the purpose of illustrating the use of nagara so no context for this one
