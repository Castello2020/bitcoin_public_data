Japanese - English \ Kanji Dictionary
by 血まみれ剣術師 » Thu 10.21.2010 7:18 pm I've been searching for some paperback\hardcover dictionarys. Kodansha's Furigana Japanese-English Dictionaryhttp://www.kodansha-intl.com/books/9784770027504/The Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionaryhttp://www.kodansha-intl.com/books/9784770028556/....were both highly recommended. Anyone have a printed dictionary they'd like to recommend? Please clarify why you like it with addtional details. 血まみれ剣術師

Re: Japanese - English \ Kanji Dictionary
by Hektor6766 » Fri 10.22.2010 12:34 am The New Nelson's is also good. It has a larger vocabulary, standard characters and their non-standard variants, domestic and foreign geographical list, historical table, weights and measures, stroke-counting and radical identification methods, names and English translations of all radicals at each radical heading, a full reading index (on and kun, not nanori) and joyo list (now a little outdated). But that Kanji Learner's is a great value for the beginning and intermediate student, the SKIP method is a huge help, even as you familiarize yourself with the radicals.

Re: Japanese - English \ Kanji Dictionary
by The Lady Ashuko » Fri 10.22.2010 3:32 pm I've used that J-E dictionary and have found it to be lacking recently. It's a small book and thus missing a lot of words. I got http://webshop.kenkyusha.co.jp/book/978-4-7674-2058-5.html at my college bookstore and I think it's been great so far. It doesn't have furigana, but that isn't such a problem in a J-E since the entry head is in kana anyway. It just means you might not be able to read all of the words in example sentences.I have not used that particular dictionary, but I have this one: http://www.kodansha-intl.com/books/9784770028914/ and I'm very happy with it.

The furigana isn't worth that trade-off.The Kanji Learner's Dictionary is good though.Beyond that I can't offer many suggestions for paper dictionaries. I love my iPod + Kenkyuusha's New J-E 5th Edition (Green Goddess).

Re: Japanese - English \ Kanji Dictionary
by Hyperworm » Sat 10.23.2010 7:40 am The digital version I own was only about £65 or something. Worth every penny in my opinion. But I'm not sure I'd recommend paying so much more for the paper dictionary ^^; It might be possible to find it cheaper elsewhere of course, like Amazon Japan.

I wonder how much the cost of shipping would add to that? Not that it really matters... it's still well over $1,000 cheaper! 猿も木から落ちる

Today I'm lucky enough to have fifth edition in my hands thanks to my local library. An outside library lender is allowing me to use it till Feb 15 off premises. It's huge in person. lol The best place to try out books before you buy them is a library. I've been mostly absent from the internet for over a month now due to moving to another location. During that time I built another rig. Hoping to have my phone line and everything else hooked up tomorrow... maybe. 血まみれ剣術師
