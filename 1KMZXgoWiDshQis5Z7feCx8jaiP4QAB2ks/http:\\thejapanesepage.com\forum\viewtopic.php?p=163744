Buying Japanese manga?
by tydin » Sun 03.14.2010 10:26 pm あいさつ みな! First, I would like to say if this has already be discussed I'm sorry, but I could not find it. I'm not really a big manga/anime fan, but I think it would be good reading practice. Unfortunately, all the shops I've been to either have ridiculous mark-ups or do not have what I want. Does anyone know of a shop with well-priced manga like Junjou Romantica, or Gravitation?

Don't complain to me that people kick you when you're down. It's your own fault for lying there

Re: Buying Japanese manga?
by Sairana » Mon 03.15.2010 10:41 pm あいさつ is the noun, as in "a greeting" or "a salutation", not what one says to actually greet someone.--EDIT: Guess this info was already passed along in another thread, but I'll leave it in for posterity. --You should also be made aware that there's no such thing as JLPT lists anymore as far as I am aware. The JLPT has been revamped and they are not making public specific vocabulary/grammar/kanji for the various levels. There's now 5 levels instead of 4 (numbered N5-N1, easiest to hardest).

Well, I'm still going to learn the previous JLPT1 list before this year's test >_>On-topic, I use bk1.jp for manga/book purchases. It has a good variety of shipping options, no markup over the MSRP/RRP or the shipping cost imposed by Japan Post, and decent stock. I usually have stuff shipped by SAL and it gets here (UK) in about 1 week without VAT or customs charges. (The one time I used expensive shipping, I got hit with VAT, though >_>)YMMV if you're not in the UK.When you factor in the miserable (gbpjpy) exchange rate and the shipping costs it's still not as cheap as I'd like but... ._.

Re: Buying Japanese manga?
by DevilishMaiden » Tue 07.12.2011 5:30 pm Not sure where you live, but Book Off is a good place to go. The store in NYC has a HUGE selection of manga in Japanese (also a nice selection in English) for just $1 (English a bit more, usually around $5-$7). I also went to their store in Torrance, CA - not as big of a selection in Japanese but it was a very small store. Keep in mind though - a lot are used books in good condition. Unfortunately they don't have any online shop so you'd have to live near a location to have any use of it here's a link to their locations:http://www.bookoffusa.com/?cmd=store#store7
