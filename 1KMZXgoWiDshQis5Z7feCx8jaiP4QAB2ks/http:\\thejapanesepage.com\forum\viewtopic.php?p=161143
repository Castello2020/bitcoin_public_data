Some learning with songs
by tony24601 » Thu 11.19.2009 2:38 pm Hello, I used to lurk here long ago (and post once or twice, but not often). Since then I've gone and studied in college and now that I'm in my third year I finally have some amount of confidence in my abilities so I thought I'd contribute here.But this isn't really an intro post so let me get to the point. I wanted to make some "fun" learning material for my site. So I thought I'd translate a few songs and explain some grammar behind them. For my first effort I chose a relatively easy song that you may have heard of. "エアーマンが倒せない". It's basically a Megaman tribute that's getting pretty old now, but is still fun. You can watch it here:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLbFctG3tw0Anyway, I aimed this at someone who already knows a little but of grammar, so I didn't go explaining every particle or anything. Before I get hated on too much, I left it in Romaji (and plan to do so for one or two more), to give people a chance to learn kana. And yes, I realize that ideology is conflicting with my saying I skipped the intro grammar. I figured I may try to do some more basic grammar next "lesson". Oh, and I went for more literal translations for the sake of teaching, I realize some things came out a tad awkward sounding in English.Without further ado:————————————————————–Vocab List:ki ga tsuku: To notice/become aware/realizeonaji: The samemen: This one is a bit odd in that when I look it up I get “face” or “mask”, but it can also mean a surface, whichseems more fitting here.bakari: A multi faceted word, but here it means “nothing but [whatver precedes it]“.purei: playEnglish word.soshite: Thus/thereforeitsumo: alwaysbasho: place/location/spotshinu: to dieakirameru: To give upkieru: to go out/vanish/be extinguishedashiba: footing/scaffoldingchousen: challenge/defiancesuru: to dokedo: butsugu:soon/nearbysugu ni: instantlyochiru: to fallaitemu: itemnigou: second volume/editionraku:comfortmukou: opposite sidekishi: bank/shoremade: up totsuku: to arrive atnankai: how many timesyaru: to dotaosu: to fell/knock downtatsumaki: tornadoyokeru: to avoidusiro: behindmawaru: to turn/revolveuchitsukeru: to knock/strike hardizure: sooner or laterkaze:windtobasu: to fire/hurlrenda: barragetamesu: to attemptaite: opponentimi: meaningtsugi: nextzettai: absolutely/unconditionallykatsu: to wintame ni: for the sake ofboku: I (masculine)dake: onlysaigo: one’s last momenttotte oku: to set asidesukoshi: a little/small quantityshika: only, nothing buttsukau: to usetadoritsuku: to struggle on to/to finally arrive atkeredo: alternate of kedozanki: remaining livesnakunaru: to die, to disappear/get lostkonoha: foliage/leavessagaru: to hang down/step backkyori: distance/rangetottemo: very/exceedinglytsumeru: to pack/plug/stop up, to make room foraitsu: he/shekuguru: to drive/pass through, to evade/hide, to survive, to get in————————————————————ki ga tsuitara onaji men bakari pureisoshite itsumo onaji basho de shinuakiramezu ni kieru ashiba ni chousen surukedo, sugu ni shita ni ochiru yoaitemu nigou ga areba raku ni mukou no kishi made tsuku kedonankai yattemo nankai yattemo Ea-man ga taosenai yoano tatsumaki nankai yattemo yokerenaiushiro ni mawatte uchitsuzuketemo izure wa kaze ni tobasarerutaimu renda mo tameshite mitakedo tatsumaki aite ja imi ga naidakara tsugi wa zettai katsu tame ni boku wa E-kan dake wa saigo made totte okuki ga tsuitara raifu mou sukoshi shika naisoshite itsumo soko de E-kan tsukauakiramezu ni Ea-man made tadoritsuku keredo, sugu ni zanki nakunaruri-fu shi-rudo ga areba raku ni Ea-man o taoseru kedonankai yattemo nankai yattemo uddo-man ga taosenai yoochiru konoha wa nankai yattemo yokerenaiushiro ni sagatte kyori o tottemo izure wa kyori o tsumerarerutaimu renda mo tameshite mitakedo aitsu no janpu wa kugurenaidakara tsugi wa zettai katsu tame ni boku wa E-kan dake wa saigo made totte okuaitemu nigou ga areba raku ni mukou no kishi made tsuku kedonankai yattemo nankai yattemo Ea-man ga taosenai yoano tatsumaki nankai yattemo yokerenaiushiro ni mawatte uchitsuzuketemo izure wa kaze ni tobasarerutaimu renda mo tameshite mitakedo tatsumaki aite ja imi ga naidakara tsugi wa zettai katsu tame ni boku wa E-kan dake wa saigo made totte oku————————————————————–ki ga tsuitara onaji men bakari pureitsuitara is the "potential" form of tsuku. it's roughly equivalent to "if X" in English, but that's not the whole story. It can also mean "when". I good, although awkward, general translation is "assuming the completion of X". To form it, just make that direct style perfective and add ra. (tsuku->tsuita->tsuitara). Bakari is kind of like dake but not exactly. It roughly ends up meaning "nothing but X".Translation: When I realize it, I don't do anything but play the same place.soshite itsumo onaji basho de shinu[question word] + mo = "every instance of that question word". In other words itsu(when) mo = always, dare(who) mo = everyone.Translation: Furthermore, I always die in the same place.akiramezu ni kieru ashiba ni chousen surukedo, sugu ni shita ni ochiru yoThe -zu (alternate negative form) of akirameru + ni, = without doing [the verb].Translation: Without giving up, I challenge the disappearing platforms but instantly I fall.aitemu nigou ga areba raku ni mukou no kishi made tsuku kedothe -eba is another way of saying "if". This one roughly means "X will surely lead to Y". In other words, it focuses more on how to achieve an outcome. To form it, just drop the -u at the end of the imperfective distal and add -eba (aru->areba)Translation: If I had the items from the second installment, I could comfortably arrive at the other side but. . .nankai yattemo nankai yattemo Ea-man ga taosenai yoThe gerund (-te form) of a verb plus mo means "even if", or "whether or not". Taosenai is the potential form of taosu "to fell/knock down". The potential form just adds a "to be able to" to the verb. To form it drop the -u off and add -eru to a consonant verb and drop the -ru and add -rareru to a vowel verb.Translation: No matter how many times I try (x2), I can't beat Airman.ano tatsumaki nankai yattemo yokerenaiTranslation: No matter how many times I try, I can't avoid those tornadoes.ushiro ni mawatte uchitsuzuketemo izure wa kaze ni tobasareruJust a quick note here. You can use the gerund to string together verbals.Translation: Even if I get behind and turn and strike, sooner or later he'll hurl wind at me (wow the literal translation of that is awkward).taimu renda mo tameshite mitakedo tatsumaki aite ja imi ga naiTranslation: There was even a time when I tried a barrage but against the tornado there's no meaning.dakara tsugi wa zettai katsu tame ni boku wa E-kan dake wa saigo made totte okuTranslation: So next, in order to win no matter what, I set aside my last E-can for my last moment.ki ga tsuitara raifu mou sukoshi shika naiTranslation: When I realize it, I already have only a little bit of life left.soshite itsumo soko de E-kan tsukauTranslation: So, I always use an E-can there.akiramezu ni Ea-man made tadoritsuku keredo, sugu ni zanki nakunaruTranslation: Without quitting, I struggle on to Airman but there I lose my remaining lives.ri-fu shi-rudo ga areba raku ni Ea-man o taoseru kedoTranslation: If I had the Leaf Shield I could comfortably beat Airman but,nankai yattemo nankai yattemo uddo-man ga taosenai yoTranslation: No matter how many times I try (x2), I can't beat Woodman.ochiru konoha wa nankai yattemo yokerenaiTranslation: No matter how many times I try I can't dodge those falling leaves.ushiro ni sagatte kyori o tottemo izure wa kyori o tsumerareruTranslation: Behind him I step back to a safe distance, sooner or later he'll close the distance.taimu renda mo tameshite mitakedo aitsu no janpu wa kugurenaiTranslation: There was even a time when I tried a barrage but his jump evaded it.dakara tsugi wa zettai katsu tame ni boku wa E-kan dake wa saigo made totte okuTranslation: So next, in order to win no matter what, I set aside my last E-can for my last moment.aitemu nigou ga areba raku ni mukou no kishi made tsuku kedonankai yattemo nankai yattemo Ea-man ga taosenai yoano tatsumaki nankai yattemo yokerenaiushiro ni mawatte uchitsuzuketemo izure wa kaze ni tobasarerutaimu renda mo tameshite mitakedo tatsumaki aite ja imi ga naidakara tsugi wa zettai katsu tame ni boku wa E-kan dake wa saigo made totte okuThis is the same as above.So, what do you guys think/what mistakes have I made (I'm sure there are some)/is this a cool thing to do? Any feedback would be appreciated.

by Hyperworm » Thu 11.19.2009 5:01 pm Well we've already had Okkusenman, so why not There's game-specific terminology here that you're not getting.men (面) : "screen" (when you reach the edge of a "screen", you are put onto the opposite border of a new "screen")aitemu nigou (アイテム２号) : item 2Astro Blade on GameFAQs wrote:Item 2 serves as a moving hoverboard. It only moves in one direction, and it can't go up and down. You get Item 2 after defeating Air Man.taimu renda : repeated pressing of the start button while playing, which causes certain values like Megaman's fall-speed and Woodman's jump speed to be repeatedly reset, allowing Megaman to jump further, and causing Woodman to jump much higher (thus you can run under him), but it doesn't help against Airman (apparently).uchitsuzuketemo doesn't come from uchitsukeru, but from 打ち続ける (utsu here is to fire).[edited a bit out of this post]

Good to know about okkusenman since that was one in my "maybe" pile for a future one of these. Here I am thinking I'm being original.面 there was really confusing me since I was like "face? what's that doing there?", so I defaulted to "surface", which I found as an alternate definition. I can't believe I didn't think of item number 2. I always assumed it was an error on the part of the song writer and they were talking about the first game and it's rope/platform item.Didn't know about that taimu renda thing, and I really should have double checked the kanji version of the lyrics I had for the utsu thing.
