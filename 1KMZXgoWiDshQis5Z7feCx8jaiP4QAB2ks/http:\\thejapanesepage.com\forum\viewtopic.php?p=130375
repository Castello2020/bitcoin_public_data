Question...
by fading.colors » Sat 06.14.2008 6:57 pm I've been trying to learn Japanese for a while now, and my friend pointed me to this site. However, while doing the Hiragana tutorial, I noticed that all the example words were written left-to-right. But isn't Japanese written right-to-left? I'm really confused about this, so if someone could explain it, it'd be much appreciated. fading.colors

Re: Question...
by Yudan Taiteki » Sat 06.14.2008 7:40 pm Japanese is written in two ways:1) Vertically, going up-to-down and right-to-left2) Horizontally, the same way as Western writing (left-to-right)#2 is most often used on the Internet and computer related things because of the difficulty of representing vertical text on computers. It's also used for a lot of technical writing. Newspapers, fiction, and other things are written vertically.

Re: Question...
by Mike Cash » Sat 06.14.2008 11:12 pm Horizontal right-to-left writing largely disappeared from common use many decades ago. The most common place you can see it still used is on the right side of trucks and other commercial vehicles....and not always then.

Re: Question...
by Hyperworm » Sun 06.15.2008 2:25 am To my knowledge, novels are almost always written vertically and bound on the right. If a book was written in the horizontal style, which would be common for books which necessarily must include a large amount of horizontal text (such as computer programming manuals), it would be bound on the left.
