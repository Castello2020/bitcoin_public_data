Bit offtopic:leergierig wrote:My mother tongue is Afrikaans.Do you really say "Afrikaans" in English, because this is the same way you'd say/write it in Dutch (just sounds really weird to me, I'm not saying it's written the wrong way or something). I was also really surprised how much Afrikaans(?) looks like Dutch when I red your signature (Traai toe raait Iengliesj joezieng Afrikaans vounettieks. Iets diffiekult. Prubeer om Ahfrikahns ta skrayf mett Engulsa funeetica. Diss muilik.), I understood it all!Yeah! It's very alike with dutch, it's caus' dutch went to their contry at a times, and so the african language have been influented in this way! (sorry for my unperfect english) (a beautiful african language is swahili, but stil hard, I really prefer japonese. I know a few words of hawaïan too, like "vahiné" that means "woman".

Same for french and other french speaker (like belg, Switzerland etc), we really have adventage too with the prunonciation, but for english speaker is very difficult, 'caus they have serveral accent for every consonant and voyels, so it make it harder...!

by Hardi_E » Wed 04.16.2008 6:43 am エストニアご (Estonian Language)Even though I have found some Estonian websites to learn Japanese, they aren't so good. So I have to use English ones. I saw also a Estonian - Japanese dictionary in book store, but I didn't bought it. It didn't look so good. I think it would be much better to learn from Estonian books. Since there might be words that are better to translate to Estonian. Though there might be also some that that are easier to translate to English. And by translating to English first there are probably big loss too.. Yet I have managed to think in English. In my improper English probably.Anyway it seems Japanese is kinda popular amongst of Estonian language learners. Someone told me that it's most popular after Russian German and English.. Maybe French is also more popular.. or same popular. I don't know that. Russian have every one to learn in middle school. Yet I can only understand very little Russian. I had also to learn Germans but that I can understand even less. I haven't learned English, but it's the one of my foreign language I can understand best. English did teach it self to me.

by Kamwah » Sat 05.10.2008 9:48 am My mother tongue is Cantonese. It is a dialect of Chinese used in southern China (i.e. Guangdong province, Hong Kong and Macau). So Kanji is quite easy for me because the kanji is come from my language.

by Hyperworm » Sat 05.24.2008 7:30 am It wasn't that much of a thread hijack IMO ... the topic's question was answered (日本語ですよー), and the rest could be taken as just a small self-introduction ._. I don't see anything wrong with putting off-topic comments in your post as long as some of it is on-topic and you don't ask questions which derail the thread, which I don't think has been done here (it's not like they asked "hey, can anyone in this thread help me learn English?")......and just so I'm on-topic, mine is British English.[edit: rephrased the first sentence so it isn't a question anymore xD]

Re: 母語は？what´s your mother tongue?
by richvh » Sat 05.24.2008 10:15 am Might I suggest posting a thread in the Introductions section? Tell us more of yourself, and what kind of penpal you're looking for; since there are a lot more English speakers here looking for Japanese to correspond with than vice versa, you can pick and choose.
