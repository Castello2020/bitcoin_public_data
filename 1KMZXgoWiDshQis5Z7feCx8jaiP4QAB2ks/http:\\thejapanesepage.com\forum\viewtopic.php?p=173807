Fun modern twist on Ukiyo-e
by phreadom » Fri 05.25.2012 1:08 pm Jed Henry over at http://jedhenry.tumblr.com/ has started a series of classic (Nintendo so far) video game characters rendered in classic Japanese wood block (Ukiyo-e) style.Be sure not to miss the others on page 2!I took the latest one and changed the title to kana since I felt it completed the "authentic" look a bit better, while still showing the name of the game in question. Enjoy! tumblr_m4h8k1u95P1rtd4n3o1_1280kana.jpg (351.5 KiB) Viewed 2480 times

There's a picture of an actual woodblock in one of the posts.EDIT: Oops, actually this only applies to the Mario Kart one, and even then the woodblock isn't the original. Still, at least one of them is available as real ukiyo-e.
