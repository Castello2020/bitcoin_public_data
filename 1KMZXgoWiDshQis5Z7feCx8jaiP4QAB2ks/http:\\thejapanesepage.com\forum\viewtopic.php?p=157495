Re: colloquial Japanese
by furrykef » Tue 09.01.2009 9:52 pm A lot of guides (such as Tae Kim's) cover some colloquialisms, but perhaps the best way to get acquainted with it would be to watch Japanese TV (anime would probably not be the best example unless you're careful to figure out what sorts of stuff people say in anime but not in real life).

Re: colloquial Japanese
by Yudan Taiteki » Tue 09.01.2009 10:00 pm It also depends on what exactly you mean by "colloquial". Most beginner classes and books cover "colloquial" Japanese in the sense that they cover the language that is used in everyday speech, but they tend not to cover very casual speech or slang; that's not really something you should learn first anyway. You have to understand the basic grammar and structure before you can handle extremely casual stuff.

Re: colloquial Japanese
by furrykef » Tue 09.01.2009 10:10 pm Ugh. I wouldn't consider text-speak, l33t-sp33k, etc. to be colloquial English; why would it be colloquial Japanese? (OK, technicially it is colloquial speech, but when somebody says "I want to learn colloquial speech", they usually don't mean "d00d im sk8tn". )

Because Japanese people don't use text-speak.They simply write informally (and quite close to how they actually talk) when conversing on the internet.

My experience is that they write fairly different when being on chats. But then again it all depends what kind of chat and who they are talking with.
