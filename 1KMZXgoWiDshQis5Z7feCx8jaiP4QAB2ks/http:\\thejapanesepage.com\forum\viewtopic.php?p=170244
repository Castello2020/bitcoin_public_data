translating a complex sentence
by Hektor6766 » Fri 06.03.2011 12:39 am I'm wondering how accurate my translation of this sentence is.菅総理大臣が大震災の対応に一定のめどがついた段階で退陣する考えを表明しましたが、その具体的な時期については年明けになる可能性に言及した問題で混乱が広がっています。Prime Minister Kan declared his definite intention of commencing a retirement by steps phased to coping with the earthquake disaster, but the problem of the allusion to that specific period of time stretching to the beginning of the year has created chaos.

[A definite めど]がついた : "a definite end is in sight" (to the response to the ...)2. [A stable めど]がついた : (the response to the ...) "looks to be stabilizing" / "shows a stable outlook"It's hard to tell exactly which is meant here (2?).(Native speaker comments appreciated )
