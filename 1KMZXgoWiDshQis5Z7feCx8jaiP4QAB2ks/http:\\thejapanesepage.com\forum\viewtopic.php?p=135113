One for the Learners: A Rarely Seen Kanji
by Mike Cash » Sun 08.17.2008 4:38 am Saw this up in the mountains of Tochigi today and took the photo just to share with you nice folks.The third kanji is easy to figure out, and can be found in (some) dictionaries, but you'll rarely see it in the wild.As a little hint for those who might like one....if you can recognize the fifth and seventh kanji there is no reason on earth you can't just guess the third one.....whether you can read the first two or not.
Never underestimate my capacity for pettiness.

by AJBryant » Sun 08.17.2008 12:54 pm Very cool. And it looks all old and traditional there. That really is the first time I've ever seen it in something monumental. Heck, I think I've only seen it in print a few times. Neat.Tony

Re: One for the Learners: A Rarely Seen Kanji
by richvh » Sun 08.17.2008 1:22 pm Took me a while to figure it all out.昭和丗一年七月竣功Completed in July, Showa 31 (1956)Kanji 4 and 6 were obvious. Once I figured out what kanji 7 was, what 5 was wasn't hard to figure out (though the semi-script form of it was something I wasn't familiar with.) I had to use IMEPad's handwriting interface to find kanji 3 (kept using wrong radicals/stroke counts trying to find it in Nelson's) then used a list of era names to figure out kanjis 1 and 2. (Again, the semi-script form of these two kept me from recognizing something I knew.) Kanji 9 was obvious, and I did a dictionary search using 功 as the last character in JWPce to find kanji 8.

Re: One for the Learners: A Rarely Seen Kanji
by Hyperworm » Sun 08.17.2008 1:39 pm I could recognize most of them by sight, but I thought 丗 might have been an alternate version of 世 or something (thinking "generation/era" would kind of fit with 昭和). And I didn't know the word 竣功, so I didn't get that first kanji either.An actual kanji for thirty? Weird, but cool Are there any others like that?

Re: One for the Learners: A Rarely Seen Kanji
by Pork Chop » Tue 08.19.2008 11:01 am Was just reading Henshall's last night where he's talking about separate kanji for 200, 300; based on the number of lines over "white". Now it seems the 10s have something similar.
