Song Translation Attempt (long)
by Hektor6766 » Wed 11.11.2009 1:50 pm With 3 months of Japanese study under my belt, I took on the challenge of translating the song Love by Hanako Oku, I hope that some of you would review it and offer your advice. The kanji has the refrain but I didn't repeat it in the translation. I've tried to be accurate to the best of my abilities and still keep some poetry in it. Hey, if you don't dare to make mistakes, how will you learn?偶然街で二人を見かけたあの子があなたの言っていた彼女ね。お似合いだった事よりもずっと見た事もないあなたの笑顔が悔しかったどうしてあたしじゃ駄目なの?どうしてあなたでなくちゃ駄目なんだろう好きなのに。。。届かない想いをあたしの胸に隠して苦しくて息出来なくてこれ以上あなたを想い続けらるかな好きになってくれる人だけを好きになれたらいいのにあなたと同じ性格をして同じ顔した人がいたらいいなそんなくたらない事を言って苦いコ-ヒ-真似してあたしも飲んでみた何度も聡めようとして何度も嫌いになろうとしてみたけどもう少しこのままの気持ちであたしをごまかしていて淋しくて声を聞きたくてどれくらいあなたを想い続けらねるかな好きになったくれる人たけを好きになれたらいいのにどうしてあたしじゃ駄目なの?どうしてあなたでなくちゃ駄目なんだろう好きなのに。。。届かない想いをあたしの胸に隠して苦しくて息出来なくてこれ以上あなたを想い続けらるかな好きになってくれる人だけを好きになれたらいいのにBy chance on the street two people appearedThat young woman is your beloved, isn’t she?Oh! The sight of a couple well-suited to each other embraced, And from a distance I watched, Left with nothing.Your smile brings tears of regretWhy should I be of no use? Why, without you, have I no hope?I love, and yetLost-letter feelings hidden in my breastDifficult, painful breaths, spirit I cannot releaseI wonder at these strange thoughts affixed to you Love is good to bear, to give to just one personGrowing to love feels good, but then…You, that very same oneThe same exquisite face of that particular person.That stupid, worthless need, I call it a bitter cup of coffeeI pretend to drink up and make light of it.How many more times to play the stunned victim?How many more times as the hateful doubter?Only a few more!I am deceived to feel this way as it isI hear a lonesome voice This darkened longing for you persists.Love is good to bear, to give to just one personFalling in love is good, and yet…

Re: Song Translation Attempt (long)
by yukamina » Wed 11.11.2009 3:14 pm Here's my translation of the first section:偶然街で二人を見かけたあの子があなたの言っていた彼女ね。お似合いだった事よりもずっと見た事もないあなたの笑顔が悔しかったどうしてあたしじゃ駄目なの?どうしてあなたでなくちゃ駄目なんだろう好きなのに。。。I happened to see a couple on the streetShe's the girlfriend you were talking about, isn't she?More frustrating than how good you looked togetherwas your smiling face which I had never seen beforeWhy aren't I good enough?Why am I no good without you?Even though I love you...By chance on the street two people appeared 見かけた means " to happen to see" or "to notice", not "to appear".That young woman is your beloved, isn’t she?Your translation excludes the 言っていた part and inserts "beloved"?Oh! The sight of a couple well-suited to each other embraced,And from a distance I watched,Left with nothing.Your smile brings tears of regretHmmm...There are no embraces, no watching from a distance, no tears... how did you interpret that from the Japanese? Stylistic choice? The お is simply part of the word お似合い.

Re: Song Translation Attempt (long)
by Hyperworm » Wed 11.11.2009 7:21 pm I'm afraid you're way off the mark on the next section too.It's to be expected after only 3 months; if you ask me, you're giving it good effort (though many will argue it's misdirected). There's nothing wrong with trying though. Here are the next few lines by me.I'm going to add a disclaimer here that I haven't listened to the song (yet) so I'm taking the breakpoints from your translation in the OP.japanese original wrote:届かない想いをあたしの胸に隠して苦しくて息出来なくてこれ以上あなたを想い続けられるかな <- れ was missing好きになってくれる人だけを好きになれたらいいのにあなたと同じ性格をして同じ顔した人がいたらいいなそんなくだらない事を言って <- missing dakuten on た苦いコーヒー<- don't mix up hyphens with long vowel marks真似してあたしも飲んでみたmy (not very poetic) translation wrote:I know you'd never understand my feelings, so I keep them hidden on my chestIt's painful and makes it hard to breatheHow much longer can I keep up these feelings for you?I wish that you could only fall in lovewith the people who'd love you backI wish there was someone else who had your exact personalityand the very same face, as wellSuch are the meaningless things I mumbledas I lifted my bitter coffeeand wondered if I'd like it as much as youHektor6766 wrote:Lost-letter feelings hidden in my breast届く here means "to be successfully conveyed (通じる)".私の好意は彼に届かなかった He did not appreciate my kindness.女の誠意が彼に届いた Her sincerity touched him.胸 here means chest/breast as in "The seat of affection and emotion: 'Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast' (Shakespeare)" but since it links up to difficulty breathing in the next line you probably want "chest"Difficult, painful breaths, spirit I cannot releasespirit? release?I wonder at these strange thoughts affixed to you check your kanji, 以上 is not 異常Love is good to bear, to give to just one personGrowing to love feels good, but then…see belowYou, that very same onewhat happened to "personality" (性格)?The same exquisite face of that particular person.That stupid, worthless need, I call it a bitter cup of coffeeneed?I pretend to drink up and make light of it.I think 真似して refers to her imitating him, by drinking the bitter coffee which he's drinking (he always drinks?) but she's never had before. At first I imagined her alone at a table, but I suppose he might be with her? She could be obsessing over him, thinking that drinking the same thing he always drinks will bring her a little more into his world, or maybe they are actually having coffee together and she's trying to bond by picking the same thing. Not sure. ^^I feel like pointing out this line.「好きになってくれる人だけを　好きになれたらいいのに」Many other lines in the song might be a little vague or use words in a characteristic song-like way that's a little harder to understand (届く, 胸, 苦しい), but that particular line spells everything out for you I think. ^^;It might be a good starting point to make sure you're familiar with the grammar constructs used in that line.好き　に　なる (twice)て form + くれるだけをpotential form (なる→なれる)～(たら)いい, のに, and ～(たら)いいのにand the ability to piece it all together.

Re: Song Translation Attempt (long)
by Hektor6766 » Fri 11.13.2009 3:27 am Thank you for your responsesI've seen that "o" can be used as an exclamation as well as an honorific. Lose the exclamation.Datta and itteita: Well, I've learned my lesson about e-dictionaries! datta isn't the past tense of daku, "to embrace", and itteita doesn't mean "constant". I'm embarrassed. But the polite forms are introduced before the plain or direct, and I'm not yet accustomed to these.I used "beloved" instead of girlfriend because for the more mature connotation. A personal preference.I took "zutto" to mean "far away" or "for the entire time". Is this actually what you're interpreting as the singer's frustration, or does that come from the reference to regret or mortification?todokanai...so: really needs tegami to be a lost letter, but for "ideas or thoughts undelivered, or not conveyed" it's a nice alliterative.Breast/chest Another stylistic choice (one beats their chest in aggression or beats their breast in despair). I saw something in there that I took to mean something like "pneuma, spirit"I thought the cup of coffee was figurative, too. Mane can be imitate, mimic or mock. Since the ex-boyfriend isn't mentioned I presume this meant miming the act of, or appearing (mita) to be drinking the bad cup of joe. The singer seems to switch gears here: where are we drinking a cup of bad coffee all of a sudden? Did she stop off at a Denny's?On the lines about wishing for someone else with "his" qualities, I missed the subjunctive flavor there. I was thinking since these things make individuals unique, those qualities make "him" irreplaceable, hence the pathos of the song.Ijo is the kanji from the source. I can't remember where I got the "dark" interpretation from. So that should be "Now that this thought of you continues"? (I copied the source faithfully-sorry about the hyphens; I thought they'd be passable as vowel extension.)そんなくたらない事を言って "That kind of [くたらない] thing (matter, incident) I call..." I interpreted kutaranai as something worthless or stupid. Is that right?I agree about that particular line defining the theme of the song. "Falling in love with only one person/falling in love is nice, but..." seems essentially right to me. But then, I'm just the student. I'm grateful for all the suggestions.

Is this actually what you're interpreting as the singer's frustration, or does that come from the reference to regret or mortification?悔しい (past tense 悔しかった) means "emotionally painful (when things turn out differently from how you hoped)", so that's where "frustration" came from. ～よりも means "more than ~" (how good you looked together; see yukamina's translation), and ～よりもずっと means "far (far) more than ~".Hektor6766 wrote:I thought the cup of coffee was figurative, too. Mane can be imitate, mimic or mock. Since the ex-boyfriend isn't mentioned I presume this meant miming the act of, or appearing (mita) to be drinking the bad cup of joe. The singer seems to switch gears here: where are we drinking a cup of bad coffee all of a sudden? Did she stop off at a Denny's?「真似してあたしも飲んでみた」 "in imitation, I too tried drinking [the bitter coffee]" implies there's someone else who is drinking it or does drink it. I doubt it's figurative; the lines seem too literal. And maybe she was always at the coffee shop, thinking about him, right from the first line where she saw them walking through town. (which would seem to imply she is on her own here.)Hektor6766 wrote:On the lines about wishing for someone else with "his" qualities...あなたと同じ・・・ = "the same ... as you".Hektor6766 wrote:Ijo is the kanji from the source.以上 and 異常 are both read いじょう. My point was the word "strange" crept into your translation, which would seem to be a translation of 異常, but what appears in the lyrics is 以上. Be careful when you look up words. ^^(これ以上 = "more than this", roughly)Hektor6766 wrote:そんなくたらない事を言って "That kind of [くたらない] thing (matter, incident) I call..." I interpreted kutaranai as something worthless or stupid. Is that right?くだらない, but yes. Something (in this case) not worth committing to voice.However, the grammar's wrong. 「～を言って」 can only mean "saying/[I] say ~" here. For "That kind of worthless thing, I call ~" I'd expect 「そういうくだらないことは、～と言う」 rather than 「そんなくだらないことを言って」.Hektor6766 wrote:I agree about that particular line defining the theme of the song. "Falling in love with only one person/falling in love is nice, but..." seems essentially right to me.It's still way off. Those two lines form a coherent single logical well-constructed sentence that would stand up just fine in spoken Japanese, and there's nothing omitted at the end. And most importantly your translation doesn't even slightly mean what I put ("I wish that you could only fall in love / with the people who'd love you back"), so unless you're arguing ... I don't think you should be expected to translate that kind of line after 3 months, and you probably haven't covered any of the grammar that line demands of you yet, so don't worry about it, but I'm a little concerned by "seems essentially right". Please don't brush off misunderstandings or think guesses are in any way a substitute for nailing the grammar. There are far too many mistake-riddled song translations out there already, and it really sucks when the mass internet populace gets their experience of what should be a good song through a mangled translation of the lyrics. Save songs from this fate ^^Incidentally, I forgot one item of grammar that line also uses, which is "[plain form] verb(/clause) + noun" ([好きになってくれる人]) for noun modification, so add that to the list. ^^(If you're following some kind of course or textbook, though, keep up with the order you're doing stuff there, of course.)

by IceCream » Fri 11.13.2009 9:38 am sorry i can't help with your translation, but you might like to look at Rikaichan to help you make sure your on the right lines... it'll un-conjugate things for you and save a lot of work. Maybe you're translating using a j-j dictionary or something though, in which case, ignore me... http://www.polarcloud.com/rikaichan/

Re: Song Translation Attempt (long)
by yukamina » Fri 11.13.2009 6:57 pm Here's my translation for the last section. I don't know the word 聡める and I can't find it in a dictionary, so I've inferred the meaning from 聡い.何度も聡めようとして何度も嫌いになろうとしてみたけどもう少しこのままの気持ちであたしをごまかしていて淋しくて声を聞きたくてどれくらいあなたを想い続けられるかな好きになったくれる人たけを好きになれたらいいのにI've tried to wise up so many timesand I've tried to stop loving you so many times (lit. I've tried to get to dislike you)Fool me with these feelings the way they are nowa little moreI'm lonely, I want to hear your voiceHow much more can I continue to love you?I wish I could only fall in love with someonewho would love me backHow many more times to play the stunned victim?How many more times as the hateful doubter?Only a few more!The key grammatical structure here is ～ようとする which means "try to ～". もう少し is part of the next section.I am deceived to feel this way as it isI hear a lonesome voiceThis darkened longing for you persists.さびしい is in the -て　form so it's not modifying 'voice'. It's separate from the words that follow.

Re: Song Translation Attempt (long)
by Hektor6766 » Mon 11.16.2009 12:37 am Hyperworm,I'm sorry if I gave the impression that I was second-guessing anyone. It was precisely that my ignorance of the grammar prevented me from seeing the reasoning behind your translations. No, I'm definitely not prepared to joust with my dull arsenal. Both you and Yukamina laid out the translation, you yourself gave me the hints about -tara making the preceding clause provisional and I failed to pick up on them . I can now see it as the conditional phrase both of you were providing.I still have a couple of questions about those lines, though. You had translated them as "I wish that you...", while Yekamina translated as I wish that I..." Did you decide on directing them toward the 2nd person from the noun modification you referred to? Or because of the preceding lines (or maybe another construct I'm not aware of)? And is the "ii noni" incorporated in the "I wish...", as in "But it would be nice if..."? (but that would move that clause into the other one...[scratching head])Presumptive=volitional; toshite after volitional form= "tried"; '-me": derogatory suffix: "Many times I've tried to wise up/Many times I've tried to despise you." Aha!-ite: "As these feelings are, keep deceiving me a bit longer"-te form, continuing, progressive action; -'takute, "want": "I'm lonely, I want to hear your voice." Ok, a light's coming on...I now understand the yori zutto is the "ever" in "More vexing was your smiling face that I never saw (for the whole time we were together)" I don't quite understand the use of koto in there, though.I'm going to keep parsing the song until I do have the grammar nailed down.

by Hyperworm » Mon 11.16.2009 10:03 am Sorry if I sounded a little harsh also. Hektor6766 wrote:I still have a couple of questions about those lines, though.

Either as a wish for oneself, or as a more general wish of how the world should work. I thought it a little more poetic to go with the latter, that's all.Hektor6766 wrote:And is the "ii noni" incorporated in the "I wish...", as in "But it would be nice if..."? (but that would move that clause into the other one...[scratching head])Yes. "I wish [I?] would..." / "If only [I?] would..." / "It would be good/nice if...".I'm not sure what you mean by the last part though. ^^;Hektor6766 wrote:I now understand the yori zutto is the "ever" in "More vexing was your smiling face that I never saw (for the whole time we were together)" I don't quite understand the use of koto in there, though.Hm. There are a couple of 事s here, in that line and the previous one. ^^The "ever" in "that I never saw (for the whole time we were together)" actually comes from こともない; see ことがある. よりもずっと refers to how much more(far and away more?) frustrating the smiling face was than the fact that(←other こと) the couple looked good together.Both these 事 are actually acting as nominalizers.
