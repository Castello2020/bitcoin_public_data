Artistic Kanji - incomprehensible for me :<
by Matysier » Mon 10.05.2009 4:08 am Recently I received a present from my friend, it was really beatifully written kanji. I tried to find out the meaning with jisho.org but it seems that I can't count the strokes correctly. I'd be glad if anyone with more keen eye than me took a look at it ;] I'd love a translation in hiragana or romaji.Here's the spoken kanji: http://img41.imageshack.us/img41/3418/29092009p.jpgThanks in advance!

by NileCat » Mon 10.05.2009 8:38 am Well, it's tough.It doesn't look Japanese.I showed it to a man who is familiar with 書道 and 草書. But he had no idea.The 落款印 (signature in red) doesn't seem normal Japanese, too.

by Hyperworm » Mon 10.05.2009 11:08 am 帰参 sort of comes to mind but there are many differences... I'm also wondering why (what seems to be) the first kanji is so much larger than the second .-.If NileCat-san says it doesn't seem to be Japanese, then... ._.

by Matysier » Mon 10.05.2009 12:08 pm Well I couldn't understand it at all but I was told that it's Japanese. Maybe someone fooled my friend and written something in chinese knowing he won't be able to see the difference anyway. He got it from man who introduced himself as Japanese and was writing whatever someone asked to write in Japanese. My friend asked him to write my name which is "Mateusz" in polish (the Japanese was speaking polish btw) so that's why I'm curious what does that Japanese wrote there. I'm pretty sure that "Mateusz" can't be written in katakana let alone kanji. I wonder whether it's a random kanji or some kind of translation of my name?BTW Kanji maker also told my friend that if I study japanese I should know that this red stamp is showing where the bottom of the kanji is. Actually I didn't : P I thought is just the signature. But is it really that way?

by NileCat » Mon 10.05.2009 12:45 pm My guess:The guy maybe coined the "seeming kanji" for some artistic reason. (It might read "マテウ・・・" in KATAKANA) Who knows?The guy mentioned about the stamp meaning... "if someone knows Japanese, the person at least couldn't put it upside-down because a signature always comes at the end." NileCat

"if someone knows Japanese, the person at least couldn't put it upside-down because a signature always comes at the end."Now I feel like an idiot xD Well now it seems quite logical that signature comes last : P I didn't think about it that way ^^'At least the stamp part is clear but still what does that really mean?

by AJBryant » Mon 10.05.2009 2:57 pm I've not done much reading into it, so I don't know if such things were done -- but is there any possibility that this is someone being calligraphic with bonji?

by NileCat » Mon 10.05.2009 3:03 pm Ahh, oh, yes, it's possible.Anyone can read bonji? I think many Indian people can.EDIT:Because it looks too decent as a sheer joke.The OP seems to be accustomed to dealing with 筆 and it's rare to see someone possess his/her personal stamp. I guess he is a kind of artist. (calligrapher, avant-garde, tatoo-artist...etc)

by Matysier » Tue 10.06.2009 2:49 pm What is bonji? I've never heard of it. Well that person was really well equipped. He had many types of brushes but this one was written with a stick. He had pretty professional stand.EDIT: That can mean that he's indeed an artist calligrapher.NileCat wrote:Anyone can read bonji? I think many Indian people can.So it's not japanese?

(Are you a Democrat perchance? )It really does look like that. ス is a little off but everything else looks like マテウッ. This might be the key to solve the Kanji Mystery - Kanji turned out to be... Katakana! We should make a movie out of this Onwards! To Japan Matysier
