ただいま / ただいます
by phreadom » Mon 04.19.2010 7:01 am Someone in the chat asked;TJP chat in the lounge wrote:(6:27:32 AM) phreadom: ただいま～ (6:28:33 AM) Relye: Why does no one put the 'su' at the end?And since I really couldn't give a good answer without basically guessing (by trying to explain the difference between "tada ima" and "tada imasu")... I figured it was better to ask here and see if I (we) could get a more accurate, succint, and education answer. ありがとうございます！ 猿も木から落ちる

Re: ただいま / ただいます
by Hyperworm » Mon 04.19.2010 8:08 am ただいま is actually ただ今 and has nothing to do with います ^^;It's an adverb as well as a phrase, and means "just now" or "in just a moment".Daijirin says that as a phrase it comes from an abbreviation of 「ただ今帰りました」 ("I have just now returned").

Re: ただいま / ただいます
by ss » Mon 04.19.2010 10:04 am Hyperworm already answered the question. Just want to add, as been said, 「ただいま」　is a shortened way of saying something in a longer form like ｢ただ今帰りました」。For example, when you just came back from vacation, say Australia, you sayただいまオーストラリア から帰りました。皆さん、お久しぶり。元気にしていますか。I'm back from Australia. Long time no see, how are you doing?Or you just returned from office, you sayただいまオフィスから戻りました。I just got back from office.In short, just the "ただいま”
