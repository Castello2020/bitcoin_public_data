Re: Hooked and Booked...
by ピーター » Mon 02.28.2011 2:16 pm Greetings. I'm doing fine thanks, and I just received my JLPT result today - I passed the N4 with a total of 151/180. Oddly enough, I got a near perfect score on the listening section, with the vast majority of marks being dropped in the other section. That listening section certainly was so much easier than any practice I'd done. Looking forward to trying for the N3 this year now.

Re: Hooked and Booked...
by Hyperworm » Wed 03.02.2011 10:05 am Woot The results confuse me a little since I actually skipped some of the harder Vocabulary/Grammar questions (at the end I filled them all in with "1"s) in order to give myself more time on the Reading section to read slowly and carefully...yet somehow I have 60/60 on Vocab/Grammar and only 38/60 on Reading... ...Also, they somehow got my date of birth wrong on the test certificate and score report. ._.I've emailed them... we'll see ._.;;

Re: Hooked and Booked...
by katafei » Wed 03.02.2011 4:04 pm Passed with 122...N2! I was hoping for higher scores, but I'm still pleased... JLPT will be in Europe this July as well, so maybe I'll go to dusseldorf and see if I can score a bit more... And Hyperworm, I'm totally impressed!! Well done.
