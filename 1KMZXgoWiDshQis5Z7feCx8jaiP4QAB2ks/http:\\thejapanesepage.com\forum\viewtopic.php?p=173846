歌詞を訳します - I'm translating song lyrics
by trilliondrive » Sat 06.02.2012 5:29 pm (Please feel free to correct my conversational Japanese as well, please! Try not to be rude about it though ;;)こんにちは、皆さん！日本語を勉強するために、私は歌詞を訳します。 今、ステファニーの「言葉なんかいらないほどに」を訳します。誰か、私にお手伝いしませんか？ 私の通事はちょっと不細工けど、趙訳でいたいです・・・　通事の正しさを確保できるために。その後で、本家みたいな美しさに綺麗にやります！Hello everyone,To study Japanese, I'm translating song lyrics.Right now, I'm trying to translate Stephanie's "Kotoba Nanka Iranai Hodo ni". Will somebody help me out?My translation's a bit plain, but I want to keep it as literal as possible... To ensure that the translation is correct. Afterwards, I'll make it as pretty as the original!The lyrics:言葉なんかいらないほどに君だけを君だけを愛してるよどうして泣きたくなるんだろう 手を繋ぎながら見上げてる空泣き虫なのは変わらないけど 涙の意味は変わったよこの手を離すたびに君のぬくもりに気づく Why?強がりで自分を守る生き方など もう必要ないね My Love言葉なんかいらないほどに君だけを君だけを愛してるよ出会ったことが運命(さだめ)ならば何度でも何度でも君のもとへそっと今そっと今 愛が生まれる甘いココアの湯気の向こうに 見えるものすべて失くしたくない幸せはなんてありふれてて 優しい景色なんだろう信じることは怖いけれど逃げ出したくない Tryふたり笑い合える 小さなこの奇蹟 私が守るから Your Loveたとえ遠く離れていても誰よりも誰よりもそばにいるよ嘘ひとつもないこの想いまっすぐにまっすぐに伝えたくてそっと今そっと今 愛が…心が近づいて 鼓動が重なって 続いていく愛しい日々痛みを見せ合って 抱きしめ合ってずっと 生きていく 君とふたりで…言葉なんかいらないほどに君だけを君だけを愛してるよたとえ遠く離れていても誰よりも誰よりもそばにいるよ出会ったことが運命(さだめ)ならば何度でも何度でも君のもとへそっと今そっと今 愛が生まれるMy Translation: (Corrections by Hyperworm!)To the extent that I don't need anything like words,I love only you, only youWhy do I feel like crying? While we're holding hands, looking up at the skyI'm a crybaby, and that hasn't changed, but the reasons for my tears haveEvery time I let go of this hand, I notice your warmth-- "Why?"You don't need to live putting on a brave face like this anymore, My LoveTo the extent that I don't need anything like wordsI love only you, only youIf our meeting was destinyI'll come back to you time and time againGently now, gently now, love is being bornBeyond the steam of my hot chocolate, I see everything that I don't want to loseHappiness is so very common, it's such a nice scenery isn't it?To believe in something is so frightening, but I don't want to run away-- "Try"The two of us laughing together-- this kind of tiny miracle, is something I will protect. Your loveEven if we are long ways apartMore than anyone, more than anyone, I'll be by your sideThese feelings that don't have even one lie in them,I want to tell them to you, directly, directlyGently now, gently now, love is...Our hearts are growing closer, their beats are intertwining. Continue on, beloved daysWe show our pains to each other, we hold each other, I'll live forever with you...To the extent that I don't need anything like wordsI love only you, only youEven if we are long ways apartMore than anyone, more than anyone, I'll be by your sideIf our meeting was destinyI'll come back to you time and time againGently now, gently now, love is being born--I know this post is super long, but if anyone could help me, I would be endlessly indebted to you. This is probably not the best way to increase my Japanese skills, but I love doing it. And I need all the help I can get! Thank you.

Re: 歌詞を訳します - I'm translating song lyrics
by Hyperworm » Sun 06.03.2012 12:00 am Good Only a few errors. I normally expect a lot more when people post translations of song lyrics. Something like happiness is flowing,ありふれてて is from ありふれる, to be common(place). Often seen as ありふれた. Here it finishes off in て form, so: "commonplace and kind/gentle" ...なんて is, in this case, an intensifier meaning "how very ~".If we are separated in the distant future (?)Right to be suspicious 遠く refers to distance not time. "Even if we are a long way apart"I want to tell them to you, immediately, immediatelyHmm. I think there may be certain circumstances where まっすぐに can mean "immediately" (or if not something very close to it like "straight away" or "without taking any detours"), but here I think it just means "straight", "directly", "honestly", etc.Please continue on, beloved daysNo "please" here. 続いて is only in て form so it can couple with いく for 続いていく.The rest is great. fun translation snippets | need something translated?BTC@1KMZXgoWiDshQis5Z7feCx8jaiP4QAB2ks

Wow, is that all the errors I made?? I was expecting a lot more too, haha! But anyway, thank you so so much! For the first one, I supposed I confused ありふれてて（ありふれる） with あふれてて（あふれる） (to overflow). And the rest of the mistakes, I understand. Thank you so much for your help, Hyperworm! 本当にありがとございました！I would like to continue to translate song lyrics in the future, and this post is still open to anyone who would like to help!
