Windows 7 Lost functionality
by Infidel » Wed 12.02.2009 8:06 pm I've been using the handwriting recognition tool for Windows Vista for a while now, and was very happy with it when writing Japanese. Recently I upgraded to Windows 7 and the Japanese handwriting recognition only works with Windows 7 Ultimate Edition now.It's very disappointing to pay for an upgrade and lose functionality. So this is a heads-up for anyone considering upgrading to Windows 7.

Re: Windows 7 Lost functionality
by Infidel » Wed 12.02.2009 10:28 pm yup. Now you have to either set your system language to Japanese to make it work, or buy the Ultimate Edition of Windows 7 to make the Japanese handwriting recognition work in an English System. Now if I click on the JP symbol with my handwriting recognition tool, it turns into a keyboard--that won't convert to Japanese either.I hate when an Upgrade removes functionality. Like when I could overclock my video card using the base drivers. Then they released a update that required me to pay extra for the privilege. Unfortunatly, my Japanese is not yet strong enough that I'm confident in switching my system language to Japanese. Most programs don't even ask what language you want, they just go with the system setting.

by Infidel » Wed 12.02.2009 11:34 pm The IME input panel, that really only lets me write one kanji at a time still seems to work fine. It's the Tablet PC Input Panel, Journal, and other areas that it fails to work properly.
