by Ongakuka » Fri 03.09.2012 9:27 am 1) 6カ国10公演とても刺激的な日々でしたSomething feels odd about the Japanese to me here. It seems strange there is nothing connecting １０公演　To とてもI would translate 刺激的な日々でした　As 'some very inspiring days'　Or something. 'Everyday' is not necessarily a wrong translation though.I went around for 12 countries including also the days of countries of passageThe translation is correct but the English in the second half is a bit clunky. Maybe try keeping the sentence structure the same as the Japanese (i.e starting with 'Including')10分に睡眠はとれなかったけどThis expression sounds unfamiliar to me but I would have thought it means 'I was not able to sleep for 10 minutes' I feel the memories of many people I encounterMaybe 'I could charge my motivation...'3)新しく見えてきたものそれをMUSICという形で具現化して行きたいと想いますWhat I have come to see anew, I would like to realise that in the form of MUSIC4) this is hard I was not able to write it something that make sense:Me too. It seems to be poetic on purpose but I can't really untie the true meaning behind it. Anyway great job! なぜなら、おまえは・・・・・・人形だ

You'd need の instead of に (and probably は would need to change too).Hint: it's wordplay. Try kanji fun translation snippets | need something translated?BTC@1KMZXgoWiDshQis5Z7feCx8jaiP4QAB2ks

by tokyotower » Fri 03.09.2012 12:24 pm I think that expression mean:十分に睡眠はとれなかったけど (I couldn't get enough sleep )Because 十分に dont mean always "10 minutes" but also 'not sufficently' /plenty.Right?
