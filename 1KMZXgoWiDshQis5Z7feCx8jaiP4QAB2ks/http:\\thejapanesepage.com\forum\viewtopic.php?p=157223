by Yudan Taiteki » Sat 08.29.2009 2:20 pm "sukkunai" is not a word; if you mean "don't like" that's "suki ja nai". There is a verb "suku" that means "to like", but it's not very common and the negative of it would be "sukanai".miruku wa yokunai shinjiruThis doesn't work, but I'm not sure entirely what you are trying to say.furansu ga hanasanaiThis has to be either:furansu ga hanasenai (I can't speak French) orfuransu o hanasanai (I don't speak French -- this does not express ability like it does in English, it just means that you do not perform the action of speaking French.)

by Yudan Taiteki » Sat 08.29.2009 2:34 pm "wa" is possible there; it depends on the context.(as for furansu->furansugo; that's completely right)

Why doesn't that work? Verbs can't come after i adjectives? Suki ja nai? Are you sure?The sentence is saying I don't speak French. Where did you get can't speak from? I use ga instead of o for emphasis, aren't you allowed to do that? Oh and yeah I forgot to put the go at the end of the furansu.

Are you sure?I'm not quite sure what you mean by the part I bolded; if perchance it was intended as a counterexample to "verbs can't come after i adjectives", you should know that:1. "ja nai" (and "da") is not considered a verb, as previously discussed elsewhere2. "suki" is not an i-adjective, as it ends in "ki".If on the other hand you were just wondering if "suki ja nai" is valid, then yes it is.Anyway, regardless of the above, the reason it doesn't work is that 信じる means more "to believe" rather than "to think" (as said by astaroth above, you should use "omou"), and also that (yes) verbs can't normally come directly after i-adjectives. You need the particle と (to) before "omou", which serves to mean "that".Also, concerning "I don't speak French", you should realize (you made this error in one of your previous threads as well) that mostly when you say "I don't speak French" in English, you're actually referring to your inability to speak French, rather than saying that you have made the choice not to utter any French words even though you may be able to speak the language (almost the same as "I won't speak French"). In order to express inability, you need the potential form that Yudan-san indicated. ^^

No. In this case you need to use "to omou". In other cases the -ku form is used to connect i adjectives to verbs.Suki ja nai? Are you sure?100% sure.I use ga instead of o for emphasis, aren't you allowed to do that?No. Ga and o are not interchangeable.

There is a verb "suku" that means "to like", but it's not very common and the negative of it would be "sukanai".I completely agree with Yudan Taiteki. And please, let me throw my 2 cents equally When you want to say something like " I don't like" you can use also the expression "kirai da/desu". In this case, the sentence "Miruku ga suki ja nai" would be "miruku ga kirai da". I'd prefer to use きらいだ instead of すきじゃない in these situations.Greetings,Minarai Oooh it's always the same...c'mon Zenigata!Let me go, I'm just a gentleman!Good bye paparino!...Make a better world, that's for you and me...

Though as far as I understand, kirai comes out rather stronger than "I don't like". It's more like "I hate" or "I detest". (In italiano potrebbe essere qualcosa del tipo "mi fa schifo" che come sai è abbastanza forte ...)
