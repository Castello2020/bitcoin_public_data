Aural translation
by Hektor6766 » Wed 10.06.2010 3:36 pm I've been watching some old anime to improve my listening skill, and there's a line from Maisson Ikkoku I wanted to check. It wasn't subtitled, so I had to translate straight from the audio. Here's a link:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ASUK7ZDuU It's at 3:16八神息吹 (I love that name!) Looks out her window at the night sky, clasps her hands together and says, 「今度こそ……この真実な愛を貫いて得も制定わ。」"This time...I will break through to attain this true love."At least I think that's what she says.

Re: Aural translation
by Hektor6766 » Wed 10.06.2010 4:10 pm She says that last part so fast and breathlessly that it's really hard to understand. I had to put it on a loop and listen to it over and over. ... みせるわ...the み and the る are really soft.Thank you!Oops! Presses her hands against the window...still melodramatic.

by NileCat » Wed 10.06.2010 11:48 pm Sorry. Maybe I didn't make myself clear.What I wasn't sure about was my ENGLISH translation. I'm 100% sure about her line in Japanese.There is no other possibility.EDIT:I know the line sounds too fast and unclear to you for now. But I can assure you that you will find it very clear and obvious soon if you keep going your good study.

Re: Aural translation
by Hyperworm » Thu 10.07.2010 8:31 am "'go' through" doesn't feel right here...This is 貫く as in 「正義を貫く(enforce ~)」「自分の主義を貫く(stick with ~ all the way through, see ~ through)」 etc, isn't it?"This time, I'm definitely going to make this true love work"?"This time, I'm definitely not going to let this true love fail"?

Re: Aural translation
by NileCat » Thu 10.07.2010 10:40 am ははは、難しいので、日本語で書いておきます。 「愛を貫く」とは何を意味するのか？日本人としても面白い疑問です。辞書っぽく説明すれば、この場合「貫く」は、「考えや態度などを変えることなく保ち続ける」「始めから終わりまで方針や考えを変えないで続ける」という意味です。「愛を貫いてみせる」は、言い換えると、「たとえどんな困難があろうと」「それを乗り越えて」「愛し続ける」「必ず」「この私は」といった意味の、「芝居がかった」慣用句です。「みせるわ」という語尾も特徴的ですね。ここではヒロインの「強い意志」を表現しています。映画などで、名台詞ってあるでしょ？たとえば、LOVE STORY (1970) の中の、"Love means never having to say you're sorry" みたいな。そんな感じのする台詞です。ですので、逐語的に訳す必要はないかもしれませんね。 NileCat

Re: Aural translation
by Hektor6766 » Fri 10.08.2010 1:08 am My turn for これはそちらに簡単です。That みsounds so much like もう to me, but then, ぴったり and　二人 both still sound like "fstari" to me."I'm gonna go through and show this true love." -Too literal?
