Hello
by maruko » Sat 10.16.2010 9:58 am Hello. I'm maruko, a Japanese middle-aged woman. I know this site is for Japanese learners, but English learners also use this site, right? Yes, I've been learned English for many years. Sadly, my English is still not so good...(;_;) I hope my English will improve on this site and I'll be happy if my Japanese knowledge can help you.どうぞよろしく(^^)/
