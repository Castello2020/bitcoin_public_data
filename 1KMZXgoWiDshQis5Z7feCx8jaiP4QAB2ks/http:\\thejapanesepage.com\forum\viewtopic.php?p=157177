Sentence I can't find context for.
by space_bubble » Thu 08.27.2009 11:18 pm 二人はお金を払って席に着く。ジェイソン：日本のマクドナルドはアメリカのとちょっと違うって聞いてたけど、ほんとに違うね。健一　：どこが。ジェイソン：アメリカのマクドナルドで売ってるものが、日本の店にもあるとは限らないし、それに日本のマクドナルドにしかないものもあるね。健一　：例えば、てりやきマックバーガーとか？ジェイソン：うん。健一　：そうだね。ほかに、えびフィレオっていうのもあるよ。ジェイソン：外国の物でも、日本に入ると日本化しちゃうんだね。健一　：うん、でも、そういうことは、日本だけのことじゃないと思うなあ。I understand all the grammar and vocabulary in that passage except the last sentence. (The passage is the end of a sample textbook conversation.) In that last sentence, I can't find the context for what 健一 says, in the conversation which precedes it. My reading (which may be wrong), is "Yes, but I think that such things aren't only Japanese things." So is 健一implying there that things that enter other nations from overseas become "other-nationized"? (For example, things that enter the U.S. from overseas become Americanized, things that enter Vietnam from overseas become Vietnamized, etc.) Or did I misread his sentence, and he actually means something else?

by becki_kanou » Thu 08.27.2009 11:24 pm Exactly! He's saying that the same process happens whatever the country. For example Chinese food in the U.S. is different from Chinese food in Japan which is different from actual Chinese food. When a food (or anything else for that matter) migrates to another culture it gets adapted, or localized, not only in Japan, but everywhere.

by keatonatron » Fri 08.28.2009 7:50 am I think it's important to point out that the two こと's in this sentence refer to the same thing.そういうことは、 That kind of thing日本だけのこと A "Japan only" thing (a thing that is only in Japan) じゃない Is notThat kind of thing is not something that is only in Japan.(In this case, 日本だけのこと does not mean "only Japanese things" )

There are two ways to divide the words:[only Japanese] thing (日本だけのもの)[only] Japanese thing (日本のものだけ)If you just say "only Japanese thing," we don't know which one you are talking about.When Space Bubble guessed about the meaning and said "Yes, but I think that such things aren't only Japanese things," that is meaning #2, but the original Japanese sentence uses meaning #1.

by Hyperworm » Fri 08.28.2009 9:54 am "That kind of thing is not something that is only in Japan" is (I think) a bit of a forced unnatural literal translation. It does show up both "thing"s well, but more naturally it would be "That kind of thing doesn't happen only in Japan" or "That kind of thing isn't confined to Japan."There is another problem with"such things aren't only Japanese things"vs"that kind of thing" & "a 'Japan only' thing" (no "s")which is the difference between「日本に入ると日本化するという現象」（単数）and「日本に入ると日本化する物・事」（複数。「てりやきマックバーガー」や「えびフィレオ」など。）thingが指すのは前者、thingsが指すのは後者です。

It's an easy sentence to those of you who are experts in the language, I'm sure, but it took a bit of energy for me to puzzle it out. It's motivating to find that I did see the right context after all. keatonatron wrote:I think it's important to point out that the two こと's in this sentence refer to the same thing.Thanks. Like particles do a bit, こと is a tiny word that plays big havoc with my mind from time to time. But I am starting to get a better understanding of it by and by.

by NileCat » Fri 08.28.2009 11:21 am Thank you, Keatonatron and Hyperworm !Your explanations were super(ちょー) helpful. And Space_bubble.When I read English, it takes ten (or a hundred) times longer than you.When I write, I always make mistakes. English is very tough for me, to be honest.But now I'm kind of enjoying it. NileCat

It's much more important to understand the logic than to translate it into natural English (although of course it's nice to be able to do that).NileCat wrote:English is very tough for me, to be honest.How do you think most of us feel when reading Japanese? - Kef

If I had meant to provide a translation of the sentence in question, I would have said so Searching for models and actors in Tokyo. No experience required!

by Hyperworm » Fri 08.28.2009 11:48 am keatonatron : I was aware of the explanatory intent of the translation, and I know it wasn't intended to be natural I just thought I'd make it clear that it wasn't entirely natural, because it looked like NileCat was starting to analyze it. ^^;

English is very tough for me, to be honest.But now I'm kind of enjoying it. Your English is very, very good. Japanese people like yourself, who gain such strength in English, have accomplished a ton. (Same goes for English speakers and speakers of other languages in here who have such great mastery of Japanese.) Having but 2 1/2 years' studying Japanese independently, I can still only dream of attaining such goals. I'm still some goodly distance from being even minimally proficient in reading Japanese, and 1 percent proficient in being able to speak it. space_bubble

by NileCat » Fri 08.28.2009 1:47 pm space_bubble, you're too modest.It's actually amaging that you can read that Japanese conversation you posted with ONLY 2.5 years study.(I'll never tell you how many years I've been studying English!)And the textbook you're using seems very good, too. I thought it very natural and very practical. No easily-revised-unnatural-textbook version. It's real.
