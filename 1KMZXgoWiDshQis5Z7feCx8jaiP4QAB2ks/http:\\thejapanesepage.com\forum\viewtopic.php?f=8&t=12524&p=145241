If you want to...
by o-bake » Sun 12.28.2008 1:57 am Hi, I am not that advanced yet, so I am having trouble combining lessons. >_<I want to say, "If you want to study English, please write me once in Japanese and once in your best English."I'd also like to keep this as polite as possible, since it's my friend's mom and I think she's already a saint to put up with my crappy attempts to write her in Japanese. My turn to help her! Here's my best effort. Let's just say her name is M:Mさんは英語を勉強したがれば一度日本語と英語で書きます。I know you're not supposed to ask people directly if they want something. Can someone help please? :S

by Dehitay » Sun 12.28.2008 1:26 pm Mさんは英語を勉強したがれば一度日本語と英語で書きます。I'm not entirely sure how to say this myself, but there are some things I can help with at least. I'm rather confident you want したければ instead of したがれば. I read the last part as "will write one time in Japanese and English". Though I'm not sure how proper this is, I think what you would probly want to use is 一度日本語で書いて一度英語で書いてください. You'll be wanting to use the てください form of 書く since this is a request and not a statement.

by richvh » Sun 12.28.2008 7:14 pm Except you can't use ば when volition is involved on both sides of the condition; you need たら here.Mさんは英語を勉強したかったら、今度は英語でも日本語でも書いてください would be my suggestion.(たがる form is generally used for speaking of the desires of third persons; when asking second persons about their desires, use たい form.)

by becki_kanou » Sun 12.28.2008 10:48 pm The OP wants her to write twice, once in English and once in Japanese, not once in either Japanese or English though, so it should be:英語を勉強したかったら、一回日本語でメッセジーを書いて、そして一度英語で同じメッセジーを書いて、送ってください。At least that's the gist I got from the post.

You can just say 「はい、その通り（とおり）です。」and to ask if your Japanese is correct, you can say 「この文は正しい（ただしい）ですか？ 」

by becki_kanou » Mon 12.29.2008 11:06 pm Indeed you are correct. I hate katakana English, it's almost harder than kanji in my opinion. Thanks for picking up on that.
