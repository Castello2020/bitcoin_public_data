Don't complain to me that people kick you when you're down. It's your own fault for lying there

Oh, and is separating words using multiple "to" particles okay in Japanese? Kakads wrote:Nakagawa Izumi wrote:私のしゅみはアニメを見ますとコンピューターゲームを遊びます. 私も寿司を食べます事が好きです.私の趣味はアニメを見ることとコンピューターゲームをします。私も寿司を食べることが好きです。[/quote]Hmm, from your correction I can draw a few conclusions:1. The word "koto" should be written with kana2. The phrase "play a game" in English translates into "geemu wo suru/shimasu" in Japanese, which literally means "to do a game"3.The polite verb forms (+masu) are not necessary in this caseYet again, thank you for helping me Kakads! 中川 泉 です. どうぞ よろしく.

While in English it is common to replace all but the ultimate "and" with a comma this is not the same in Japanese.

As verbs go at the end of the setence, you would need to turn them into noun phrases to fit them into one sentence. Think of the first sentence as 'My hobby is the thing(koto) of watching(miru) anime'.
