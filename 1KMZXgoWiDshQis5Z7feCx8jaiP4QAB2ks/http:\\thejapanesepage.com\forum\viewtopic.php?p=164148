by アシカス » Wed 04.07.2010 2:18 am Hi,　I just wanted to make sur ethis was right, as I'm putting it in my speech for school：ひるごはんをたべることがで前に、レベッカにプレゼントをあげました。Does it mean:　Before eating luｎch, we gave Rebecca presents.　？？　Also, is there a way that　I could make it say:　Before we could eat lunch, we had to give Rebecca presents.？Thanks for the help!

by Hyperworm » Wed 04.07.2010 9:35 am Be aware of nuances in play here though.The English versionBefore we could eat lunch, we had to give Rebecca presents.can be interpreted as eitherBefore lunchtime came around, there still remained the matter of giving Rebecca presents.(speaking with reference to the day's schedule; fairly neutral) orBefore we were allowed to eat lunch, we were required to give Rebecca presents.(implies that you did not want to give Rebecca presents or that you are only doing it to get lunch)Personally I can't help but read the Japanese versionひるごはんをたべさせてもらえる前に、レベッカにプレゼントをあげなければならなかった。as the second one...

The Japanese translation here makes it sound like there's someone holding back your meal, and you have to do what s/he says (give the present to Rebecca) to get permission to eat.We need context to translate it properly. What was the situation that made you have to give the present first?

Re: Quikie
by アシカス » Tue 04.20.2010 4:09 pm We were at her B'day party, and...ひるごはんに　レベッカのりょうしん　は　バーベーキューを　りょうりしました。　その上　おなかが　すいていましたかれ　いいにおい　だとおもいました。　しかし、ひるごはんをたべさせてもらえる前に、レベッカにプレゼントをあげなければならなかった。Does that fit in the context? I think it's more, I wanted to get the present-giving out of the way so we could eat lunch, because I was hungry and it smelt good. Thanks! That's helped already.
