by Hyperworm » Sun 01.10.2010 5:12 pm You may like to know of the existence of Knuckles in China Land, which may have got there before you (or not depending on what exactly your ideas are). I'm not sure what state it's in at the minute, but I remember playing it a few years ago.

Re: Kanji Game - A RPG for learning Kanji
by 1gn1t0r » Sun 01.17.2010 9:13 am Yeah I know. I have played both Knuckles and Slime Forest. The latter actually giving me the idea. But it was outdated and had too few kanji. Currently my game will feature 3006 kanji. Using the index of Remembering the Kanji

Re: Kanji Game - A RPG for learning Kanji
by yukamina » Sun 01.17.2010 1:27 pm If you could make the learning content customizable, that would be more useful. After I finished the kanji in SFA, I wanted to use the system to learn vocab, but, of course, I couldn't. If the game is limited to whatever kanji/vocab that the maker decides to put in it, it would be useless, say, for a learner that already knows that stuff, or doesn't want to learn isolated kanji.

Re: Kanji Game - A RPG for learning Kanji
by 1gn1t0r » Tue 01.19.2010 1:21 pm Yes that would be possible to add custom content. Since the kanji is stored in xml. This is the program to add / edit the list http://kanjigame.blogspot.com/2010/01/kanji-adder.htmlSo I suppose you could create your own lists

Re: Kanji Game - A RPG for learning Kanji
by WeeFugu » Fri 11.05.2010 2:42 am I was dissapointed to see this game had been discontinued. I need all the help I can get to learn kanji. I have really started to pull my finger out with regards to learning Japanese. My wife is Japanese and we have moved back to Japan.Anyway, thanks for the other links. I am sure it will make my kanji learning more fun.
