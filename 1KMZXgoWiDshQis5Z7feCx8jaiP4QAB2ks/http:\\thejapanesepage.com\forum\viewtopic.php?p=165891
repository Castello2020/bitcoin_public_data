Hey Everyone
by Kukaelio'ono » Wed 08.11.2010 1:34 am 初めまして，フォーラムの名前はKukaelio'onoなのです。二年前に日本語を勉強したことがあるのに、高校で普通話を習い始めてたんだ。本当に中国語は日本語よりちょうっぴり学びやすいだ。実を言うと、北京から来たばかりだ 。日本に行ったことないけど，来年に行くつもりだ (だって，お金がないそうです。。。）とにかく，読んでくれたありがとう！Alright, please correct my Japanese because I know some of my sentences are awkward. I used this website for two years and I never bothered to make an account until now. Anyways, my real name is Ian and I'm half chinese and half white--just to introduce myself. I'm planning on taking 4 years of Mandarin Chinese even though there is a Japanese class offered in my high school. So yep, nice to meet everyone!

by Snowflake » Wed 08.11.2010 8:33 am Hello, Kukaelio'ono! Welcome! To my beginner's eyes, it looks like you have a good handle on the Japanese already. Are you planning to study both Chinese (formally, in class) and Japanese (informally, on your own) simultaneously? How ambitious! Good luck!

Re: Hey Everyone
by The Lady Ashuko » Thu 08.12.2010 1:46 am Welcome! Is your username by any chance Hawaiian?And feel free to take this little critique with a grain of salt, I'm hardly an expert. It seems a little strange to me to use 名前 when you aren't talking about your actual name. I would probably use フォーラムの名　or ユーザーネーム (but probably the latter)

Re: Hey Everyone
by The Lady Ashuko » Sun 08.15.2010 4:31 pm I actually moved to Oahu about two weeks ago for school. I love it so far!Kukaelio'ono wrote:Yes it is ハワイ語で「おいしいキノコ」という意味なんだ。<--again I dont know if I typed that right So it's "Delicious mushroom," correct? The sentence is a bit awkward though. What I get from the sentence (in a vacuum) is "It is because Hawaiian has a meaning called「おいしいきのこ」"Kukaelio'onoは日本語で「おいしいきのこ」です。Kukaelio'onoはハワイ語のことばが日本語で「おいしいきのこ」といいます。These are two sentences that I think carry the meaning you are looking for. The first is, "Kukaelio'ono is 'delicious mushroom' in Japanese," and the second is, "Kukaelio'ono is a Hawaiian word that they call「おいしいきのこ」in Japanese.

by Hyperworm » Sun 08.15.2010 7:25 pm Hm, to my (non-native) language senses,ハワイ語で「おいしいキノコ」という意味なんだ。 seems fine, andKukaelio'onoはハワイ語のことばが日本語で「おいしいきのこ」といいます。 seems bad (mainly because of the が).

My learning style is a little different and I find translating to be very difficult because I didn't use any textbook until just recently. If you don't mind me asking, could you elaborate on what you take issue with here?
