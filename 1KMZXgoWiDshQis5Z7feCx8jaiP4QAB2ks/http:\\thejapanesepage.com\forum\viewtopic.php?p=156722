不自然だけど使われる言い方
by NileCat » Mon 08.17.2009 5:55 pm Could anyone try and translate this sentence into English for me ?Yes. I know it sounds weird.But in Japanese we sometimes say like this when you're upset and confused.「君は僕に嘘をついてたんじゃないって言ってるわけじゃないよね？」Thank you.

by Harisenbon » Mon 08.17.2009 8:53 pm I'm always bad at putting these double negatives into english, but I'm thinking something along the lines of:"You're not really trying to tell me that you're not lying, are you?"Gah, I fail at english.

by Hyperworm » Mon 08.17.2009 9:12 pm Surely you're not going to pretend you haven't been lying to me? Surely you're not going to pretend you've been telling the truth( all this time)? perhaps...Tricky.

Re: 不自然だけど使われる言い方
by NileCat » Tue 08.18.2009 3:39 pm Thank you, becki !I was always wondering how I could translate this sort of ambiguity that seems to be indigenous to Japanese.Now I think I got a clue, thanks to all of you.I really appreciate it.

Is that implied with "よってことなんだ" ?
