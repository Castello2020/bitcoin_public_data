Could I ask you a favor?
by NileCat » Thu 09.30.2010 1:02 pm I was wondering if someone could do me a favor and correct my unnatural English for me at times.Since coco-san is absent now, I think I'm kind of responsible for some questions which require native-ish interpretation.But I always find my answers awkward, to be honest.I'll do my best to help out the questioners in this forum, But it would be highly appreciated if some of you could correct my English whenever you find it odd.Thank you!

by micahcowan » Thu 09.30.2010 1:20 pm If I notice anything, I'll let you know. Your English has always seemed exceptional, though; I obviously haven't been around here very long yet, but I wouldn't have known you weren't a native English speaker without you're saying otherwise in your profile and posts.

I'm a little guilty of not offering corrections, I'm afraid. I'll make sure to do so in the future. ^^;However, I'm happy to say that I couldn't find a single mistake in that post. fun translation snippets | need something translated?BTC@1KMZXgoWiDshQis5Z7feCx8jaiP4QAB2ks

I have never corrected your English as I know it is not your first language and I did not want to appear picky but since you have asked I will do so in future. Don't complain to me that people kick you when you're down. It's your own fault for lying there

Re: Could I ask you a favor?
by NileCat » Fri 10.01.2010 11:25 am Thank you everyone for your kind replies and encouragement.I just wanted to say that I didn't want to be a "teacher" here. As I am Japanese and this forum is for Japanese learners, I often stand on the side of answerers though, I know all of you can be my teachers potentially. Regarding my self-study, this forum is like a paradise to me. Because I might be able to be helpful for someone through my studying English here! So, please feel free to point out my mistakes, not only grammar errors but also like going "your explanation doesn't make sense" or "it sounds weird in English". I have a feeling that some of you have overestimated my English skills. I always wonder if my English would sound like "example-based machine translation".ありがとう！ NileCat

Because I might be able to be helpful to someone through (myは不要) studying English here![1] A little unclear. Did you intend to contrast "my self-study" with "others' self-studies"? In that case "my"→"my own" can help.Also "for" may be less stiff than "regarding"."This forum is like a paradise to me for (my own) self-study(ing)"--------------------------------------------------Perhaps I'll post any corrections in a small font, so it's clear they're an aside to the main topic. fun translation snippets | need something translated?BTC@1KMZXgoWiDshQis5Z7feCx8jaiP4QAB2ks

by NileCat » Sat 10.02.2010 11:48 am Thank you very much, Hyperworm!Your correction was amazingly helpful (maybe more than you think). That kind of help is exactly what I wanted! Please give me a hand every now and then to improve my English! NileCat

Re: Could I ask you a favor?
by SakeIt2Me » Sat 10.02.2010 1:55 pm I don't know if I'll be much help but I'll give it a shot, NileCat! When I've learned more about Japanese I will need lots of help, and you help so much here you deserve favours! Someday I hope to know Japanese as well as you know English.Because I might be able to be helpful for someone through my studying English here!Generally, you shouldn't start a sentence with "because". Instead of "through my studying" did you want to say "while I study"?Either sounds right, but "while" is more natural in my opinion. (Others may differ.)
Maybe I will meet you one day, maybe Wednesday, maybe not...not

Re: Could I ask you a favor?
by NileCat » Sat 10.02.2010 2:38 pm Thanks SakeIt2Me!I see exactly what you mean.As you know, "I understand it" does not necessarily mean "I will be able to use it properly", though. I know so-called "conjunction and syndeton" are ones of my weak points. Since the logic of structuring a sentence is totally different in Japanese, I often mix them up.Please keep your eyes on my posts! NileCat

Re: Could I ask you a favor?
by Hektor6766 » Sat 10.02.2010 10:11 pm Good catch, SakeIt2Me!One possible revision of that sentence:"Regarding my self-study, this forum is like a paradise to me, since I may be able to help someone else with their Japanese while I study my English here!" ("even as" for "while" could provide emphasis of the simultaneous events occurring.)You may be surprised at how many native English speakers would struggle with a sentence like that.One day on a crowded bus, a man suddenly stood up and shouted, "My wallet's been stolen!" Immediately, an English teacher sitting nearby jumped up and shouted, "No! Someone stole your wallet!"

Since the logic of structuring a sentence is totally different in Japanese, I often mix them up.Please keep your eyes on my posts!Your posts in this thread sounded quite natural. I just have one correction from among them: "ones of my weak points" -> "a couple of my weak points" or "two of my weak points".

What is supposed to be wrong with "My wallet's been stolen!" ?
