The verb is:Ohana mi ni itagootoo ga arimasu ka? ....itagootoo Maybe you mean ittakoto (行ったこと)?itta (行った) - past plain form of iku (行く)koto (こと) - thing/matterarimasu ka - do you have/have youIn English we say "been" for the "thing of gone". Don't complain to me that people kick you when you're down. It's your own fault for lying there

Re: "Have you" been to the flower viewing? - - Tense-related
by Hyperworm » Sun 02.27.2011 7:15 pm The important part to "koto ga arimasu (/aru)?" isn't "have you ~ ?" but "have you ever ~ ?"The original information is still true in the sense that"Did you go to the flower viewing [e.g. today]?" = "Have you been to the flower viewing?" = plain past.If you want to ask about "ever" you need "koto ga arimasu". ^^
