日本語 vs 中国語 thread
by Adriano » Fri 11.12.2010 8:19 am Hi! This is a topic about chinese language, for all learners, aspirants and interested people in general!Chinese is a really amazing language.Specially for those who've been studying Japanese for a long time and sometimes get bored with the language, because after all those inspiring years learning seemingly unlimited kanjis and stuff, you end up with nothing new to learn, but very complex expressions/colloquialisms, weird slang words from Shōnen Jump, and kanjis never even used by japanese, like plants, animals and general words usually written in kana(おもちゃ＝玩具、ガラス＝硝子・・・) In chinese, since you start the Lesson 1, you just can't stop turning the pages.As a gamemaniac (and proud of it), I compare the learning of kanjis with that widely played RPG of 2000's.You start in a little city, only one pokeball in the pocket.But since you can't control your curiosity about what's coming next, in what each one will evolve into, after the first step, you just can't stop holding it off, because of such a huge combination possibilities of ideograms.After "clears the Yellow Version" over 10 times (i.e. mastering japanese), then it comes the "Gold Version" (Mandarin), with a lot of new stuff, and even the old things you knew well in the past, becomes new, I mean, you'll have to "relearn" all the readings, from the most basic kanjis.For instance, after reading for centuries 学校 as "gakkou", then you'll have to get your ears used to "xuéxiào".That's no katakanized strangerisms to help you anymore, as long as パン becomes 面包, コンピューター → 电脑, etc..At least you don't have to learn how to write those complex ideograms from stroke to stroke, just "assemble" the new ones (ex: 這、笨) with the tools you already know from Japanese.Another nice point is that 99,9% of the chinese characters used in mandarin has only one reading.You don't have to scratch your head to guess if that 上 is a うえ、うわ、じょう、あげる、あがる、のぼる、かみ anymore.上 is 「Shàng」 and that's all!Furthermore, you won't ever be caught with an weird ateji again. (you know how a japanese read 女形？)Spoiler: おやま＝male actors who impersonate women in Japanese kabuki theatreNaturally, comparisons between the 2 languages are inevitable; every page turned, that's a interesting difference sparkling your attention..for instance, the verb 行く、the chineses uses 去 instead, for 見る→看, 歩く→走, 帰る→回 and so on... Below, I made a little list of curious 简体字 (simplified characters), some resembling japanese, some too simplified that after you learn it, you'll get too lazy to write in japanese form again （can you figure out 时间，会议？）梦　＝　夢鸟　＝　鳥无　＝　無风　＝　風车　＝　車冈　＝　岡东　＝　東亿　＝　億丰　＝　豊 （weird,don't?） 龟　＝　亀飞机　＝　飛行機电话　＝　電話艺术　＝　芸術运动　＝　運動国际　＝　国際→ （国际机场：　国際空港）农业　＝　農業广场　＝　広場练习　＝　練習故乡　＝　故郷奋斗　＝　奮闘兴业　＝　興業发音　＝　発音 (what's the "simplified" here? ¬¬)开发　＝　開発认识　＝　認識公园　＝　公園远足　＝　遠足（got it from the previous word?）广义　＝　広義竞技　＝　競技实际　＝　実際议论　＝　議論专门　＝　専門评论　＝　評論履历书　＝　履歴書领事馆　＝　領事館

Re: 日本語 vs 中国語 thread
by Hyperworm » Fri 11.12.2010 8:17 pm つまり、ポケモンが好きだ、というわけですね（冗談 ）Chinese interests me on a linguistic level. Simplified kanji certainly seems appealing when you bring up 議 vs. 议 xDIt's interesting that some kanji which seem to have no redundant parts in Japanese are reduced to bare minimum in Chinese. For instance, if 習→习, then 羽→？ (Maybe it stays the same? XD) I'm not particularly attracted to the sound of Chinese, though, and I don't think there's anywhere near as much material that I actually want to read in Chinese as there is in Japanese, so I'll be sticking with Japanese only for the foreseeable future. ^^ (I think I'd be more likely to learn Korean.)

by AJBryant » Fri 11.12.2010 9:01 pm God, but I hate the PRC's simplified hanzi. Some of them just look so... ugly. I really prefer the original hanzi, but most of the things being printed now come from the PRC rather than Taiwan. http://www.sengokudaimyo.com

So it creates more work for you, not less. 議 isn't a kanji I had to put particularly much effort into learning anyway (but then, I used Heisig...)

by Hyperworm » Sat 11.13.2010 9:14 am Actually, I was more thinking about the effort required to write it... XDThere are abbreviations even in Japanese, though (see: ryakuji; replacing right half of 議 with ギ), and writing by hand isn't something I do often enough for it to be an issue anyway.>_>

Fortunately, this is an exception,if you learn that 车 is 車,then it becomes easier to figure out 军人, for instance (軍人).Hey AJBryant, traditional kanjis are great, but think about the time loss in these days.. who wouldn´t like to write 汉字 instead of 漢字？Or save hours while writing 2 pages about the Liaoning Province? （遼寧＝辽宁） The curious thing is that japaneses uses some "mid"-simplified kanjis.. and sometimes even more simplified kanjis than chinese.. it happens with 桜. All what chineses could do with 櫻 was 樱.. Again, japaneses uses 辛 instead the 辣 used in chinese.I made a little chart here, with some "semi-simplified" kanjis used in japanese:豐→豊→丰樣→様→样發→発→发歲→歳→岁UPDATE:访问　＝　訪問县　＝　県　（新潟県→新泻县　／　沖縄県→冲绳县）铅笔　＝　鉛筆动词　＝　動詞目录　＝　目録选举　＝　選挙观点　＝　観点

I would never confuse them. I dunno about Chinese, but I'm sure you're aware that 友 is an extremely common kanji in Japanese (particularly in the word 友達); if this is true in Chinese as well, I'm sure the shape of 友 would get hammered into your brain pretty quickly, and the differences in 发's shape would leap out at you.I think it's easier to confuse e.g. 描 and 猫... and I wonder whose bright idea it was to come up with 土 vs. 士, and 未 vs. 末...The same happens with the 練、that becomes into , with a new (strange) order of strokes..If 東 becomes 东,why did they put 2 more strokes? That one is baffling.Hey AJBryant, traditional kanjis are great, but think about the time loss in these days..In these days? The time loss is mostly in the old days, not these days. These days we have computers. And of course for us foreigners, Simplified Chinese can cause significant time loss because many of us learn both Simplified and Traditional. I imagine some native Chinese grapple with this problem as well, though of course it's more of a problem for people who know Simplified and are learning Traditional than the other way around.Simplified characters can also obscure the etymology of the word and make it harder for foreigners to learn the kanji. More strokes makes a kanji more complicated, but it also provides more information for you to attach a mnemonic to. Often I see a Simplified Chinese kanji and think, "This doesn't resemble any Japanese kanji I know. How would I go about remembering it?"This is probably made up for by the situations where multiple traditional kanji are written with only one simplified kanji, reducing the number you have to learn, but I don't know how significant an impact that has.

Re: 日本語 vs 中国語 thread
by Kukaelio'ono » Mon 11.15.2010 1:27 am 我现在也学中文 I'm actually taking Mandarin in school and it's very interesting to know that some sounds in Chinese sound like words in Japanese! In fact, a lot of famous words in Japanese come from Chinese origin.Chinese: 可爱 ke3 ai4 (kuh eye)Japanese: 可愛い　kawaiiChinese: 图书馆 tu2 shu1 guan3Japanese: 図書館　toshokanChinese: 料理 liao4 li3Japanese: 料理 ryouri*These are actually two different verbs but I'm just showing how similar the sounds are.Further on, some words that are the same sounded completely different from the two languages. However, I realized that Mandarin is a fairly new dialect in China and the Japanese adopted mostly the Wu (Shanghainese), and the Han (Cantonese) sounds---far before Mandarin was even spoken. So:Chinese: Mandarin＝ 学校 xue2 xiao4 Cantonese＝ 學校 hok6 haau6Japanese: 学校 gakkou (Sounds more like Cantonese than Mandarin)Chinese: Mandarin＝ 电话 dian4 hua1 Cantonese＝ 電話 din6 waa6*2Japanese: 電話 denwa (Again, sounds like Cantonese than Mandarin)And, there are words that don't sound anything alike but they are from Chinese origin. Such words are: Sushi (shou4 si1), Nihon (ri4 ben3), Chitetsu (di4 tie2), and of course the numbers. Your totally right on the different verbs in both languages. Since I learned Japanese before Chinese, it's obvious to at least think that 走 is run (when in Chinese it's walk) and 写 is to reflect (when in Chinese it's write) when I took my Chinese class last year.So I actually like both the languages and continue to learn both at the same time. They kinda mutually help me (I know stroke order from Japanese so my Chinese is neater and I know the On-Yomi from Chinese)

Re: 日本語 vs 中国語 thread
by ss » Tue 11.16.2010 6:46 am As we all know, Japanese's kanji writing is a mixture of simplified and traditional forms. For example,頭が痛いから今日学校を休もう。因为头痛，今天不上学了。 (all simplified)因為頭痛，今天不上學了。 （all traditional)豚が公園の中を走ってる。 猪在公园里跑。(all simplified)豬在公園裡跑。(all traditional)芸術艺术 (simplified)藝術 (traditional)道元禅師と公案禅道元禅师与公案禅 (simplified)道元禪師與公案禪 (traditional)If you show 「発」 and 「豚」　to the children here, I think 99.9% of them can't recognize these words, because they have never learned in schools. Last time I asked Coco san this word 东, she said it was not a Japanese word, but she knew it meant "East", 「東半球」 vs 「东半球」。回家 = go homeIn Japanese you say 家へ戻る, hardly see the word 回 use for "return home"But, you'll find 北回帰線 as "Tropic of Cancer" In additional to simplified and traditional Chinese hanzi, 古文 (ancient writing) is another interesting writing styles which will mostly appear in classical novels. For example, the word 「仝」 "same" 「同」 (tong) 「同じ」 (onaji), quite common in modern script. The 古文 for 藝 is actually a 「禾」+ 「丸」, you can find this word in some modern novels. The 古文 for 登 is 「癶」 + 「弁」, occasionally you'll still find this word in modern script.浮草 = 浮萍 fúpíng (duckweed)撮影 = 摄影 shèyǐng (photographing)速報 = 快报 kuàibào (bulletin)There are indeed many confusing words, to add what Furrykef said, there are also 卯，卵日，曰无，旡兮，分力，刀牛，午于，干见，贝己，已戊，戎往，住刺，剌爪，瓜历，厉吏，史衷，哀鸟，乌国，匡荼，茶亦，赤栗，粟考，孝胃，胄币，巾良，艮亘，旦丹，舟捐，损杲，呆That's also the reason why if you want to make tattoos, you have to be very careful, without one little tiny dot or stroke, it will become another character. Have you heard of the joke "He is a 大使" becomes "He is a 大便"?

How would I go about remembering it?"Personally, I believe that if you are diligent enough,you will learn 豊 as well, study its etimology (or not), and then,the simplified mode.So, from now you know what 豊 means, but won´t never lose time writing it fully.It´s like those kanjis you recognize when you see it, but since its compounded by so many strokes, you don´t know how to write it properly, wishing you could write it with only 3 or 4 strokes..（丰） Kukaelio'ono wrote:it's very interesting to know that some sounds in Chinese sound like words in Japanese!

I always got confused with the word 头发（ｔóｕｆɑ）, the chinese way to say 髪.If 头＝頭、and 发＝発, why is that 髪？ Now you gave me the answer, 头发＝頭髪（though it´s not a word usually spoken in japanese,I think）.SS wrote:于，干己，已刺，剌荼，茶胃，胄are they really...different kanjis? As Furry and SS pointed out, sometimes it´s really confusing get so many similar kanjis...but worse than that, is get the same kanji, different 1 or 2 strokes between the languages:隐　＝　隠别　＝　別巢　＝　巣换　＝　換両　＝　两携带　＝　携帯经济　＝　経済銭　＝　钱 （not the simplified 金 radical,but the one less stroke in the right half）Confusing?

I don't know if it's because of the culture differences or how the kanjis were introduced in Japan, but we can find expressive difference between the use of a certain kanji in mandarin-japanese.As you pointed out, 写 indeed means 書く。Then, you learn that the kanji 书（書） means 本 in chinese.Furthermore, the 本, a measure word for long, thin objects (including pencils) is shifted by 枝（branch） in chinese, that makes much more sense.. 我有2枝笔 - I have two pens. （笔＝simplified 筆）Again, 枚, once a measure word for thin and flat items in japanese, is shifted by 张（張）, and now is a measure word for small objects.There are countless "mysteries" to solve yet.. have you ever asked yourself why "stamp" is 切手（cut+hand）, "postcard" is 葉書（leaf+write）..?In chinese it makes more sense（邮票、明信片）、but why do japaneses write りんご as 林檎 if actually the chinese word is 苹果？The same happens with：窓→窗箸→筷子靴下→袜子誕生日→生日麒麟→长颈鹿 (giraffe,the "long neck deer") Though I think 麒麟 and きりん are just 2 different words with the same sound. A lonely giraffe among all those sake bottles and chinese unicorns if you search for images typing the kanji.
