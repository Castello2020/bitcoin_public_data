Homework help, please!
by Momo-taro » Sun 06.05.2011 5:56 am Can someone help me with these sentences please. They are pretty simple I guess, but I'm struggling a bit. I attempted them, but I'm really not too sure about some of them. For example, when you say German camera, do you need something else between the ドイツ and the カメラ other than の?1. she is German. 彼女はドイツ語です 2. She speaks German and English. 彼女はドイツ語と 英語を話す3. She bought a German camera. 彼女はドイツのカメラを買った4. She writes English letters to her English friends. 彼女はイギリス人友人を英語に手紙を書きますI hope my attempts are not too bad Momo-taro

by Hyperworm » Sun 06.05.2011 9:48 am Hmm, are we allowed to give outright fixes for homework problems?I'll err on the side of caution (so sorry if I seem unhelpful! ).1: (EDIT) 語?2: Looks perfect.3: Completely fine, but if you like, you can add 製（せい） after ドイツ to say "German-made / made in Germany".4: This one has a few particle mistakes (two wrong particles and a missing one). Try again? By the way, two of those sentences are in です・ます form and the other two in plain form. I'm not sure what you've been asked for but it's probably best to be consistent. ^^

by Momo-taro » Tue 06.07.2011 4:53 am Thanks guys for your replies.Yes, I realised yesterday I'd made a mistake in the first one. She's German language, OMG!! How embarrassing. I'm not too sure about the particle thing in number 4. Particles really confuse me! Is this better? ....彼女はイギリス人の友人に英語の手紙を書きますAnd as for the plain/polite thing, we were supposed to use polite all the way through.

Re: Homework help, please!
by furrykef » Tue 06.07.2011 6:57 pm You can also leave out the first 人: イギリスの友人 (a friend of/from England). But you would need it in イギリス人です。You can also say 英語で手紙を書きます。 -- She writes letters in English. But I'm sure it's fine with の, too, which is like "English letters".EDIT: fixed goof that Hyperworm pointed out below
