それを覚えるのが
by space_bubble » Thu 04.02.2009 10:04 pm My apology for the inaccurate post Subject, but I'm just unable to pinpoint what it is about this sentence that makes me not understand it completely.人に何かあげる時、客に食事を出す時、自分の子供の先生にあった時、そのほかのどういう時に何と行ったらよいかが決まっていて、それを覚えるのが、大事な社会教育だと言ってもよいだろう。I get the real easy part, which is "When you give people something, when you offer a guest a meal, when you've met your own children's teachers,..."It's the rest of the sentence following those first three clauses that is throwing me off. I've read it over and over again, but I just can't seem to come up with a reading I'm completely confident with.My best try is the following:"...what is appropriate to say is determined by other such occasions, and learning when it is appropriate to say them is an important part of (one's) social education." space_bubble

The final 言ってもよいだろう literally means "it's probably OK to say this" but that's just kind of a filler phrase to make the claim sound less blunt.You may know this already, but 行った in this case is おこなった (do) rather than いった (go).

There were a couple items in there I had been clueless about (おこなった was brand new vocabulary for me, and I just flat out failed to recognize the ～てもいい sentence pattern in 言ってもよいだろう). I am writing the information you provided in my notes now, so I don't forget it. I really appreciate those clarifications.

Re: それを覚えるのが

by becki_kanou » Sat 04.04.2009 11:59 pm I'll third that. I thought it was probably a 変換ミス for 言った as well.

Re: それを覚えるのが
by Yudan Taiteki » Sun 04.05.2009 9:38 am Yeah, that makes sense. I was actually going to try explaining why と was used in 何と行ったら but I didn't understand it myself so I assumed it was just some idiom I wasn't familiar with -- I guess I should have figured out it was a 変換ミス.
