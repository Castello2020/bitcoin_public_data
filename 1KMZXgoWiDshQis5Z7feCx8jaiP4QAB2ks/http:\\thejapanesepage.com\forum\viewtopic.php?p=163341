I'm not much of a writer. And I understood it if that's what it meant.Here's another one　Please correct　：）Original: ウィキペディアはオープンコンテントの百科事典です。基本方針に賛同していただけるなら、誰でも記事を編集したり新しく作成したりできます。ガイドブックを読んでから、サンドボックスで練習してみましょう。質問は利用案内でどうぞ。Translation:　Wikipedia is a Free, Open-Content Encyclopedia in which anyone, by agreeing with our basic policy, can edit anyone's articles or newly create their own. Try to practice in the sandbox by reading the guide book. Question usage information is presented.Sorry if it sounds unnatural in english because I can't figure a good way out to rephrase it.I think it's because I'm starting to understand written japanese naturally instead of translating it into English as I read it.

Re: My shot at a translation (corrections please)
by Hyperworm » Wed 02.17.2010 12:43 pm The most important difference (ignoring the fact that you closed the brackets around [Creative Commons Attribute-ShareAlike License] too early - probably just a slip-up) is the "in addition to" and "under (=by using)" bits.The files were already usable under the "GNU Free Documentation License", so the translation shouldn't say that the use of the text is (now) possible - it was always possible.「クリエイティブ・コモンズ 表示-継承 ライセンス」でも利用可能になりましたbecame possible to use them even (in conjunction) with the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License従来の「GNU Free Documentation License」に加えてin addition to the normal GNU Free Documentation License (which they were already available under).(Now someone else's turn )
