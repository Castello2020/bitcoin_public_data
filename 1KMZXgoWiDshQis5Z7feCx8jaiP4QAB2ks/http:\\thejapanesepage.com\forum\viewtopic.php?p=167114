soranai to
by rachxo » Thu 10.21.2010 12:26 pm Hello! I have a question...I came across the sentence そらないと。and am wondering what that means? The full sentence is ひげが伸びできた。そらないと。

by rachxo » Thu 10.21.2010 12:57 pm Oh! Thank you! I always forget that to is short for nakareba naranai ~~~ One more thing...if you are able to, do you think you could help explain this sentence to me?? 好きな人に、交際を断られたり、別れようと言われたりする。Does this mean, I was refused (for a date) by the person I like, ... and the last part I'm stuck on >.<

Re: soranai to
by NileCat » Thu 10.21.2010 1:18 pm No problem, rachxo-san!First, please note that it is written in present tense.In this case, it means the speaker is talking about “something happens to me often” or “tendency” or something like that.Second, this sentence uses 〜たり、〜たり form.One thing, and/or another thing.In this case, s/he is talking that people whom s/he likes (often) 交際を断る and/or 別れようと言う.交際を断る・・・You’re right. (to refuse for a date)別れようと言う・・・「別れよう」と言う (to say “let’s break up”)Now you can make a proper English translation better than I, I guess. NileCat

It tries to combine "Now you have enough information to translate it" and "I'll leave it to you because you can probably do a better English translation than me" into one statement and it doesn't work very well ^^;Perhaps: "Now you have enough to translate it. You can probably express it in English better than I can." ?But there are many other ways to write it.Is it just me or is ～たり～たりする rather "nonchalant" for a sentence like that?I mean I'd expect to see it in a sentence like 「土曜日は、映画を見に行ったり、友達に会ったりする。」For a negative sentence, perhaps 「好きな人に、交際を断られることも、別れようと言われることもよくある」 or something? That particular way of saying it might not be natural but...Using ～たり～たりする seems to me "this is what I do, as a person". It almost feels to me like you could stick a 「趣味は」 in front of it.「趣味は、好きな人に、交際を断られること、そして別れようと言われること」... like feigned nonchalance, and bitter humor. ^^;Or is it more normal than my senses indicate? ^^;

Re: soranai to
by NileCat » Thu 10.21.2010 2:23 pm I know what you mean. And your understanding is absolutely right. The sentence is obviously casual and colloquial. It is not necessarily containing “humor” but it is very natural to sense the “ironical” feeling here!However, this kind of usage is very common especially among young people.The other day, I came across an article that was warning the overuse of “like” among young Americans. Although I’m not the right person to say something about it, I think there exist some kind of “popular words” for young generation in any language.I personally think 〜たり is one of those popular words.あたし、いっつもフラれたりするし、つきあってもすぐケンカしたりするし、やっぱ、あたしって不幸なオンナだったりして。彼氏はいるの？ ＝　彼氏とかいたりなんかするの？Do you feel the 女子高生-ish feeling in it? Well, no offence. I know not all the high school girls talk like this, though!And, thank you for your correction! EDIT:How about this?"Now, it’s time for you to translate it into proper English! I know you can do it much better than me!" NileCat
