In lesson 6...
by Mavira » Mon 05.05.2008 5:09 pm I've gotten a little stuck.It says: 'To deny somebody permission to do something, you can use the te-form plus はいけません.'However, it doesn't specify if that is pronounced 'haikemasen', or 'wa ikemasen'.The sentence is: いいえ、きょかしょを見てはいけません。Thanks in advance,Emma.
