Quick 2級 question
by TheMajor » Sat 09.04.2010 9:19 am My Japanese reading and writing ability sucks so I have decided to get my reading and writing level up and have been working on Kanji like mad recently. I can speak well but have trouble with everything else. Anyways, I am working through the unicom N2 reading book to help with my 読解.I have just finished the warm ups and now I started the real reading and hit a wall. I have checked the dictionary and various places to check words and grammar I don't know but I can't find answer for this one. Here is the sentence:犬がなぜ飼い主に従うかというと、それは犬が飼う主を自分の群れのレーダー犬だと思っているからだとされている。The sentence's meaning is okay (I think) but the last part confuses me, what does it mean? Any help on the meaning or pointing me towards a place where I could find the answer would be great.ThanksMike
