Some Old Yet Simple Kanji
by Mike Cash » Sun 07.25.2010 12:40 am I took this photo of the back of a tombstone in a small private cemetery in rural Nagano Prefecture just especially to share with the Japanese learners here. There are two kanji visible which were formerly in common use (at least in inscriptions) and which are no longer used. You should be able to figure out both their readings and their meanings purely from context if you have studied kanji even a little bit.
Never underestimate my capacity for pettiness.

by phreadom » Sun 07.25.2010 7:56 am I tried to clean the pic up a little Mike, but I'm not sure about some of the lower kanji due to my beginner level not being familiar enough with more than the elementary level kanji.

Hopefully this might make it a little easier for people to read. Please let me know which ones I messed up.

by Hyperworm » Sun 07.25.2010 3:23 pm Spoiler: Kanji for 20 and 30?I think this has come up here in the past actually 20 here is different again to the form I knew of it (廿)...And presumably the one at the top is a variant of 仝? (looks like ユ below instead of エ ...)

by Hektor6766 » Sun 07.25.2010 10:36 pm Considering the context, I'd say the top one is an old form of 命.

Re: Some Old Yet Simple Kanji
by Mike Cash » Mon 07.26.2010 5:31 am Thanks very much, Phreadom. That is an excellent job and I am sure it is much easier for people to make out than the photo. It was in a very difficult spot to try to get any photo of it at all....much less a good one.I believe that I posted a photo containing one of the two kanji earlier this year or perhaps last year. But we get some new people coming in so I thought it wouldn't hurt to give it another go.One of the points I wanted to make with this photo is that sometimes it is possible to figure out the meaning (and sometimes the reading) of kanji one has never seen before. I thought this would be a good sample to provide some learners with an opportunity to experience that for themselves.

I know I saw it on items produced for the funerals of my wife's parents. I doubt that it sees much (if any) use outside the funeral industry, though.
