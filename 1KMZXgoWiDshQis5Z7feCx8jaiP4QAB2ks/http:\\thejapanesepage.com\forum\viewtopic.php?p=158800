listening comprehension
by katafei » Tue 09.29.2009 6:41 am 女：パスポート用の写真とってきたの。男：どれどれ、ふーん、めがねを取ると感じが変わりますね。髪もいつもと違うようだし。。。あ。、後ろで縛ってるんですね。長い髪もこうすると短く見えますね。In the first sentence, the guy is talking about the woman Spoiler: in the picture, in the second sentence, the guy is talking about the woman Spoiler: as she is now.But how do I recognize this and know that picture Spoiler: 1 is the right answer?I thought the right answer was picture Spoiler: 3, as this woman is both wearing glasses and has her hair tight back...?So I'm missing some subtle detail...

I read it as the whole thing talking about the picture. So if you're supposed to pick how she is now, it should be with glasses and hair not tied back...

Re: listening comprehension
by Hyperworm » Tue 09.29.2009 7:33 am It would help if you actually posted the question >_>What are we looking for:the one that shows how she looks now,or the one that shows the passport photo she took?Edit: Ah, sorry, I guess assuming you know for a fact that the answer is definitely 1, I could have inferred that Anyway, Yudan-san is right in his above post... >_>Edit2: Also (just so this post isn't totally useless) I think there's a と missing before 短く見えますね?

by NileCat » Tue 09.29.2009 7:40 am 長い髪もこうすると短く見えますね。The trick in this "test" is not grammar but the context.どれどれ....写真の中....いつもと違う....あ、縛っている....こうすると

It's probably wrong somewhere:女：パスポート用の写真とってきたの。男：どれどれ、ふーん、めがねを取ると感じが変わりますね。髪もいつもと違うようだし。。。あ。、後ろで縛ってるんですね。長い髪もこうすると短く見えますねwoman: I just had my photo taken for my passportman: show me...huh, you look very different with glasses (so, she's wearing glasses in the pic). The hair is also different...ah...your hair is tight at the back, right. Your long hair looks much shorter like that (so, I'm reading it as the hair is thight back in the photo....?)

I believe you will find something by finding my mistakes.Well,well...interesting...you look differnt when you have taken off your glasses.(so, she's not wearing glasses in the pic). The hair also looks different from your usual hair....Oh,(I found the reason)...you tied your hair back (when you took this pic)....your (usual) long hair looks shorter when you do like this.Make sense?

Re: listening comprehension
by katafei » Tue 09.29.2009 8:25 am ah, yes, I understand now! And the womand we're supposed to pick is not the woman as she is in the passport photo, but the womand as she is now:with glasses and hair not tied together.( I could have known, as you're supposed to take off glasses and pull your hair backwards for a passport photo, these days ^^)めがねを取ると = when you have taken off your glassesThanks!

I guess it means woman and is used when you refer to her in portrait, though...
