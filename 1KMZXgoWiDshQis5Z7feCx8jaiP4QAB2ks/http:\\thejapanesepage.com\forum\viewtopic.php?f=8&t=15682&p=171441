そりやもう　by mella » Thu 09.15.2011 5:52 am そりやもうI cannot understand this sentence, maybe it's colloquial or it's a typical expression.

Re: そりやもう　by Hyperworm » Thu 09.15.2011 7:03 am そりゃもう(=それはもう... I believe I explained already about そりゃ)This もう is not the "already" もう, but one that's used to express feeling. It's [1] below (rough translations by me):2	(感) ［1］　ある感情や感動が高まったときに用いられる語。A word used when emotion or appreciation reaches a height.　もう、最高だわ This is just/simply incredible もう、悲しくて悲しくて It's just so sad　もう、ほんとにすごいんだ It really is truly amazing［2］　やや非難・叱責の気持ちをこめていう語。A word imbued with strong feelings of criticism or admonishment.　もう、何度言っても聞かないんだから Gosh, you just don't listen no matter how many times I tell you　↑ (just in case, this だから isn't a simple "because")　ひどいんだから、もう That was really mean, you know!そりゃもう is basically a cut-off sentence of sense [1]. The speaker expresses a depth of emotion or appreciation for something, but it's not expanded on. This can also act as an affirmation of something the speaker was just asked ("oh my, yes; oh, most certainly", etc.)By the way, the dictionary seems to be consistent in separating もう with a comma, but this isn't always the case in actual texts.
