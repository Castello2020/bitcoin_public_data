「うｐ主」の読み方
by Yudan Taiteki » Thu 06.04.2009 6:09 pm How do you pronounce うｐ主, or how would you read it if you've never seen the term before? (The word means "uploader", particularly an uploader of a video to youtube or nicovideo).It's an interesting word because the first part comes from "up" just typed into the IME, sort of like how "ok" is sometimes written as "おｋ" on the Internet. Normally "upload" is アップロード, so the うｐ is clearly from English rather than the usual Japanese word.But it's also interesting because there's not quite a consensus on how the word is read. People sometimes introduce themselves as "うｐ主です" or the like on their videos, so you can see how people read it. Definitely the most popular are うぷぬし and うっぷぬし, but there are a wide variety of other pronunciations such as うぷしゅ, うぴーぬし, うっぴーぬし, and うっぷんぬし. I guess that's what happens when you get a word that is created in a text-based medium combining three different scripts and two languages.

by AJBryant » Thu 06.04.2009 6:56 pm If I just saw it, I'd probably read it as "うピーぬし" -- but I really have no idea. I can't help but think someone somewhere thinks it's アップぬし, with the うｐ literally meant to be read as "up"....Tony

Re: 「うｐ主」の読み方
by Harisenbon » Thu 06.04.2009 7:54 pm I personally would go with either アップぬし or うぷぬし.Looking on the net, the number one hit for it is this link http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1013648675Which means the question has been asked alot, and this is (i believe) the most consensual answer.「うぷぬし」 also, if you search for うぷぬし on google, you get a lot of sites that also contain うｐ主 but if you search for アップぬし or something like that, you don't get any related results.

He was trying to type UP, and.. well, set your keyboard for Japanese input, then type "u p n u s h i" and hit henkan, and you'll get うp主.Tony

Since I'm so good at れあぢんｇ and ｗりちんｇ Japanese, whenever I see lower-case alphabet letters mixed in I assume it's just a language mix-up. I can't count the number of times I've set to work pounding out a web address, only to look up and see ｗｗｗ。てぇじゃぱねせぱげ。こｍ Although I'm still split on ようつべ. I could see that one actually being pronounced as "ヨウツベ" Searching for models and actors in Tokyo. No experience required!

Re: 「うｐ主」の読み方
by Yudan Taiteki » Fri 06.05.2009 7:41 pm I pronounce ようつべ as ようつべ in my head when I see it.うｐ and おｋ are the only words I know that are "keyboard words"; that is, created by typing something directly into the IME with no conversion.

by becki_kanou » Sat 06.06.2009 6:10 am I would've pronounced as アップぬし as well if I hadn't read this thread.I'm assuming ようつべ is youtube?
