Re: わ...違うわで, a few more questions
by Hyperworm » Thu 01.28.2010 7:58 am Plus, given that 強し has basically the same meaning as 強い, and you explicitly stated in the OP that 強い makes no sense in the context, Mike's attempt for つよし was surely the only answer that fit what you actually asked for. ._.(not that the others were necessarily wrong but .-.)

by Frobnitz » Fri 01.29.2010 2:48 am As I've said three times, I've already received sufficient help. I'm not going to feign dissatisfaction with the information I've received to placate one irrational member. If you guys want to continue the thread past its useful life to indulge the man, go ahead, but don't ask me to assist you in doing so. The man demands to be thanked for going apoplectic about others helping out before he could appear and hurl insults; you're not going to appease that thought process by any means you possess.

(see: Philippians 4:7)
Never underestimate my capacity for pettiness.

by AJBryant » Fri 01.29.2010 11:56 am I agree with Mike as well. For one thing, my mantra here is "context is king." For another thing, the first person to be snitty (or snotty, take your pick) was NOT Mike. It was Frobnitz. D'you need a time out to calm down yourself?
