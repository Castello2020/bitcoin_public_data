Haruhi Suzumiya Light Novels
by Breyyne » Thu 10.30.2008 9:23 pm I was told that the Anime "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya" was based of a series of light novels. Can any one confirm this, as it seems like the type of thing I would read in English and would give me an interesting short term goal for my Japanese studies. I know a good amount of anime are based on manga and "Howl's Moving Castle" is based of English novel.

by Breyyne » Thu 10.30.2008 10:10 pm Thank you Yudan-san.Read or die, really, I guess that would make sense and fit the anime's theme. At least what I remember of it.

Re: Haruhi Suzumiya Light Novels
by Hyperworm » Tue 11.11.2008 10:01 am I just finished reading 涼宮ハルヒの消失. Took me four days of intermittent reading to cover its ~250 pages... which is still a long way from native reading speed, but I was quite pleased anyway Despite Haruhi playing a relatively minor role (as you could probably guess from the title ), it's definitely my favourite of the lot so far. Picked up a few new words from it too. According to that Wiki link, the following two books (暴走 and 動揺) are short-story collections of 3 and 5 stories respectively, some of which were already shown in anime format ... a little bit of a shame, because I really liked the fact that 消失 was big enough for its events to connect to themselves everywhere, and connect to earlier Haruhi stories as well, and of course that I hadn't already seen some of it Should still be fun, though 陰謀 is what I'm really looking forward to.These were released like four years ago ... I'm really playing catch-up fun translation snippets | need something translated?BTC@1KMZXgoWiDshQis5Z7feCx8jaiP4QAB2ks
