Social experiement: over<br>
Time taken: six months<br>
Total donations: zero<p>

So, like, that was fun. I'd had a few charities picked out, but they're
going to have to do without I guess.<p>

I'm going to leave those bitcoin/litecoin links up, just in case some
random stranger wants to of their own free will donate anything to poor broke
ME, but somehow I doubt that'll happen.<p>

For what it's worth, here's the lowdown. It's fairly trivial to Google
for "free bitcoin" and collect yourselves some "micro" bitcoins. Basically
you click through some ads in your browser, and they'll send you some real,
actual bitcoin for you to do with as you will. Repeat every day for some
number of weeks, and it slowly adds up. And collectively it COULD have
added up to quite a bit. My own personal 6000-odd micro bitcoins is worth a
grand total of almost five bucks! Woo!<p>

Anyway, the only thing my "experiment" really proved is that absolutely
nobody wants to anonymously trust an unknown kook on the internet with
their virtual money. Zero surprise on my part.<p>


In other news, I've still been getting the occasional request from random
domain "brokers" who are entirely unwilling or unable to do the tiniest
bit of "research" (ie. click through to my site and actually READ anything),
but I'm not really playing that game any more. Either send me a real offer,
or else you're going to fall into my spam bucket.<p>

<p><hr><p>

As a social experiment, I am asking any random strangers to donate
Bitcoin or Litecoin to me:<p>

Any amount will do. Cumulative results will be posted as they come in.
Should any significant amounts actually come in, I will let you know how
they get used and/or donated.<p>

<b>Thursday, November 25, 2010</b><p>

Last night I was walking home from work, minding my own business,
listening to my CBC podcasts.  I only got as far as the bus station
though, when I passed by a couple of guys arguing loudly.  It was the
kind of arguing and yelling that would easily escalate to physical
violence, so I slowed down a bit and paid close attention to them.  The
pair of them both sounded a bit drunk, but I couldn't say whether there
was any alcohol or drugs involved.<p>

I kept going, but took out my earphones, and slowed down to a stop for a
listen once I was around the corner.  As I turned to look, I see
somebody's hand on the ground, palm up.  So great, I think, they're
actually fighting now.  It would have been so easy to walk away, ignore
a couple of drunks.  Or else just stay where I was, not get involved at
all, just call the cops.  But I didn't.  Instead, I think I did the
right thing.  If there were weapons of any kind involved, I would
certainly have done things quite differently, I'm hardly stupid.<p>

Now, I'm hardly a big guy at all.  So all I did, then, was put my
headphones away, and walk slowly and cautiously back.  I saw the two of
them wrestling, one guy on top of the other guy, both face up.  They're
still being loud, and one of them seems to have a girlfriend who is also
yelling at the pair of them to please please stop.  I sized the whole
situation up, realized that neither one <i>really</i> wanted to hurt the
other.  And while they're both being loud and insulting each other, I
can't for the life of me tell what they're actually arguing about.<p>

I should interject here a bit of a description.  The three of them
looked homeless, there were some bags of their belongings nearby I
spotted after it was all over.  Their voices were slightly slurred, but
I couldn't pin it down to alcohol or drugs or some kind of mental health
problem.  The guys were a little scruffy, mustaches.  I don't have as
much to say about the lady, I was mostly paying closer attention to the
men, but she was perhaps a bit cleaner.  It was clear to me they were
all just waiting for the local <i>Out Of The Cold</i> program to open
up, so they could have a warm place to spend the night and have
something decent to eat.<p>

This was all taking place near a wooden bench, situated between the bus
terminal and the police station's parking lot.  It would only have been
about 5:10pm, downtown St. Catharines, so there were still quite a few
people around.  But nobody else was stopping to watch or trying to help,
just me.<p>

So I was standing there about ten feet away, looking down at the men,
one pinning the other to the ground, and I spoke up.  Calmly but firmly,
I simply asked, "Do you need me to phone the police?"  And at that, they
both stopped, a bit startled.  One said yes, the other seemed slightly
more shocked, and he said no.  They both got up off the ground.<p>

When the woman heard me, she seemed to be the most grateful of them.
Her first answer to my question was "Yes!," however she didn't really
want the police to come, she kept pleading with me as I stood there
silently looking on, "They're brothers!"<p>

One thing I knew for certain, was that if all three of them would just
stay quiet, they'd calm down enough, go their separate ways, and they'd
make it through the evening without anybody getting hurt.  Or more hurt,
anyway.  But of course feelings are running high, and it takes quite a
bit more yelling and insulting before that finally happens.  One brother
shows how angry he is by punching a nearby light, but to me I see how
restrained he's really being because he'd rather break his hand on a
pole than hurt his brother.<p>

But they <i>were</i> both calming down, all because of my simple
intervention.  Just having me standing there silently, not walking
away, paying attention.  That, and the given threat that the police
would show up shortly if I chose to make that phone call.<p>

About twenty feet away I spotted a man standing behind a car, talking on
his cell phone.  "Oh good," I think.  Even though things are settling
down, and I was pretty sure nobody was going to get hurt, if I was
misreading the situation then the police would be here shortly anyway.
All I had to do now was stand my ground and watch over them until either
the men could stop insulting each other long enough for one to calm down
and go elsewhere, or until the police finally showed up.<p>

And as luck would have it, calmness won (sort of).  One guy was pushed
down, but he didn't retaliate <i>because I was there</i>.  After pushing
his brother, he walked away, off through the bus terminal.<p>

That left the other brother there with his girlfriend.  I can see his
left wrist is in a cast, and I see all of his bags stashed in the bushes
beside the sidewalk.  There's nothing left for me to do do help now, so
I slipped my last two bus tickets out of my wallet.  I handed one to
her, and one to him.  I give him a last bit of advice, that if his
brother comes back, he should just go across the street to the police
station and they'll help him.  "But he's my brother," and I see the pain
in his eyes.  I know I don't need to give him any kind of lecture about
"tough love", so I just say "Sometimes..." and give a kind of shrug.  I
go to shake his hand, and even though it's his left hand in the cast,
that's the one he offers to me, just his fingers sticking out.  And then
I shake the lady's hand too, and she is more appreciative and thankful.
Her hands are rough like a farmer's.  And with a simple "Good luck" to
them, I head off, back on my way home again.  Checking my watch, it's
about twenty minutes later.<p>

Several minutes later, a pair of police cars speed by, obviously
dispatched to the scene I'd just left.  I debate whether or not to go
back, but decide to just keep heading for home.  Having witnessed
physical violence on both brothers' parts, plus the little act of
vandalism when the light pole broke, and considering that I had
absolutely <i>zero</i> idea what the argument was even about in the
first place, I realized they'd be better off talking to the police on
their own.<p>

On my walk home, I wondered.  Why didn't anybody else stop?  The only
thing it took on my part to help them, really, was to bear witness.  Me
standing there watching was enough for them, even in their current
state of mind, to realize that they'd gotten out of hand and they needed
to stop.  And so they did stop.  But everybody else was too afraid to
get involved.<p>

It's only one month until Christmas.  Keep this story in mind.  When you
see somebody who needs help, treat them with kindness and compassion,
and do what you can to help them.  'Tis the season!<p>

<a href="sjobs.html">An Open Letter to Steve Jobs</a>:<p>

Dear Steve Jobs,<p>

You simply cannot have it both ways. And you cannot expect developers
to take this offensive action on your company's part silently. Specifically,
giving hardworking authors the go-ahead to create 17+ rated apps, and then
ripping the rug out from under them without any warning, this is
unacceptable. It is an outrage!<p>

The iPhone is your toybox, true. You are legally entitled, I imagine, to
create any rules you feel fit and enforce them, but by acting all wishy
washy like this, nobody will want to play with you anymore, no matter how
shiny your toys are.<p>

Some examples of what's apparently still being allowed in the appstore,
and what's been removed:<p>

</ul>

The "<a href="http://appshopper.com/lifestyle/fitmind-sexual-arousal">Fitmind</a>" app is designed specifically to help treat legitimate
medical issues! It is gone, and yet there are still tons of the
crapplications there in the store, still so easy to find!<p>

The iPhone's parental controls do work for apps too, and if I want to filter
out risque apps on my phone it's quite simple to change the setting in my
phone.  I just need to select one option under the Parental Controls, and
then any apps rated as 17+ aren't even visible until I say so again!<p>

But even so, there is this terrible silliness with Apple's rules for app
ratings. If these apps must be rated as 17+ to be approved:<p>

<ul>
    <a href="http://appshopper.com/news/netnewswire">NetNewsWire</a><p>

    <a href="http://appshopper.com/lifestyle/ebay-mobile">eBay</a><p>
</ul>

Then why are these available at the lowest 4+ rating:<p>

<ul>
    <a href="http://appshopper.com/news/mobilerss">MobileRSS</a><p>

    <a href="http://appshopper.com/utilities/1password-pro">1Password</a><p>
</ul>

It just doesn't make consistent sense!<p>

Perhaps the blogosphere has the wrong impression here. If this recent
action on Apple's part is just a first step to help rectify these parental
ratings for apps, then I am all for it! Let non-porn apps (like Safari
replacements) have a less restrictive setting, and risque apps have an
adult-only setting.  Heck, in the forthcoming iPhone OS version 3.2 and/or
4.0, you can change the defaults so that nothing 17+ is allowed unless
enabled (ie. opt-in instead of opt-out). That would potentially annoy
current users, but it would be a sincere gesture on Apple's part that you
are taking the issue of "inappropriate apps" seriously.<p>

In any case, this is a situation where Apple cannot remain silent.<p>

Sincerely,<p>

Darcy Boese<p>

I have used this space in the past to discuss
<a href="http://road.kill.com/olddefault.html#twentythird">youth violence</a>,
in particular relating to videogames and bullying at school.  I've given a
bit of advice to parents and to
<a href="http://road.kill.com/olddefault.html#thirtieth-b">their kids</a>.
And I stand by that earlier advice:  Parents, talk to and <i>listen</i> to
your kids.  Kids, <i>talk</i> to your parents, and if for whatever reason
they are unavailable, find <i>somebody</i> to talk to.  If you need help,
<i>get</i> help.  If somebody around you needs help, <i>help</i> them.<p>

Those posts were written in the wake of the Columbine (and other) killings.
A few students were so emotionally disturbed that they decided to go out
and kill the people they perceived as their tormentors.  A <i>lot</i> of
attention was given in the media about the violent video games they had
been playing, <i>some</i> attention was given about the torment they felt
from the bullies, but very little attention was given about their mental
states.<p>

One of the most common psychiatric disorders in youth is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADHD">ADHD</a>.  Oftentimes when
left untreated, such easily treated conditions can lead to much more serious
disorders such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ODD">ODD</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_Depression">Depression</a>.<p>

Disorders such as these, when left unrecognized or untreated, can be
devastating, both to the sufferer and to those around them.  Feelings of
worthlessness, poor self-control, aggression, <i>these</i> are the things
that lead to violence.  And usually, they are very easy to treat.  Find the
right combination of therapy and medication, and you'll be able to feel
"normal" again.<p>

<a href="http://www.ncys.ca/pages/cmh.html">One in five</a> children needs
this kind of help, and thankfully many of them <i>are</i> getting that
help.  Unfortunately, many are not.  A recent <a href="http://www.unicef.ca/portal/Secure/Community/502/WCM/HELP/take_action/Advocacy/CRCat18/CRC18%20EN%20final.pdf">UNICEF report</a> informs us that
in Canada, mental illness among children has risen, but
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/11/20/unicef-children.html">only
20 per cent</a> are getting treatment.<p>

And so what is a parent to do when their teen just doesn't want to be
helped?  Imagine this not-so-hypothetical scenario:<p>

The teen stops taking all of their medication, saying "it's not working".
The parent is dumbfounded, because they have seen the difference in
behaviour:  while on medication they are stable, and while off medication
they are not.  The teen drops out of school, starts taking drugs, gets
involved in various crimes.  The parent tries every available resource,
including the police, social workers, doctors, but nothing is helping.  And
at the back of the parent's mind all along, "if only he'd take his meds!"<p>

As a parent, you're responsible for the well-being of your children.  That
includes education, food, a home, and their physical and mental health.  If
your children lack any of these basic necessities, then <i>you</i> can be
punished.  And yet, here in a civilized country like Canada that is a
champion of human rights, there are no services available to guarantee
those basic needs are being met, when it is the children themselves who are
the ones refusing to cooperate.<p>

Canada then you can sign our petition.

After I posted my last rant (see below), the number of emails I've
been getting from MySpace mysteriously dropped off.  Oh, a few
accounts being created in my name are still being made, but when I
go to delete them I've been finding that they're already gone.  And
yet I have <i>still</i> not heard a single thing back from MySpace.
Go figyah.<p>

Anyway, a new (small) rant.<p>

<b>Basic Capitalism 101</b><p>

If I have something that you want, you can buy it from me.  If the
amount of money that I'm willing to part with it for is less than or
equal to the amount you're willing to spend on it, you give me the money
and I give you the item, and we're both happy.  But if the amount I'm
asking for is more than you think the item is worth, then you don't buy
it from me.<p>

This is the basic premise for nearly <i>all</i> of our commerce.  Due to
competition between various sellers, if I charge too little then I may
get more customers but I can easily go broke.  If I charge too much then
I may make more profit but I will sell to fewer people and I can still
easily go broke.<p>

So the Walmarts of the world tend to sell "for less" but tend to be
selling items of lesser quality in order to maximize the profit per
item.  All basic capitalism.  When there are lots of sellers and lots of
buyers things tend to balance out pretty nicely, overall.<p>

<b>Advanced Capitalism 203</b><p>

But when there are very few sellers (because the items are scarce, for
example) or when there are very few buyers (because the items are only
useful to a small minority) then you can throw pretty much <i>all</i>
those rules out the window.<p>

If I owned something that was rather rare that only a few people wanted,
then I would be a fool to say "this is the price".  Give me that much or
more, and you can have it.  Try to buy it for less, and I'll just say
"no thanks".  In this situation, I'm most likely to maximize my profit
by holding an auction:  all interested buyers try to buy it at the same
time, and the one who values it the most gets to buy the item.  This is
how rare items such as art is often sold.<p>

Now take for example my domain "kill.com".  Domains are plentiful, but
<i>some</i> domains are much more rare and much more valuable.  Short
common English words were all snapped up very early in the Internet
boom, and despite the bursting of the Internet Bubble a while back,
these domains still hold much of their value.<p>

Now, who in particular would want my domain?  I can think of quite a few
possibilities.  Movie studios.  Anti-gun or anti-game lobbyists.  Maybe
even porn hawkers, although I really <i>really</i> don't want to think
about exactly what kind of porn they'd be hawking.  Heck, I've even got
a kinda cool idea for a movie, a thriller, that would be perfect and
(for Hollywood) rather original too.  But the point is, it's not really
a <i>big</i> market, but those that <i>would</i> want the domain would
also be placing a high value on it too.<p>

But if I were to post a message, "I'm selling my domain for $X" I'm
completely screwing myself.  Somebody who doesn't think it's worth that
much will just go away without talking to me or trying to haggle, and
I'm screwed.  Somebody who thinks it's worth <i>more</i> than that would
just snap it up, and I'm again screwed because I didn't get as much
money as my domain is worth.<p>

So I don't post such a price.  I <i>do</i> indeed have one:  a minimum
price below which I wouldn't dream of giving up my rather valuable
domain.  But I also know that my domain is actually worth more than even
<i>that</i> price.<p>

I can hold onto my domain for the next twenty years, it won't become any
<i>less</i> valuable over time.  If I don't sell it, then I haven't lost
much of anything, and it's one of the coolest geekiest things anybody
can have besides their own name.<p>

In other words, I've got no incentive to go to much of any work selling
this thing, and if you want it you gotta play by <i>my</i> rules.  But
like I said in my disclaimer, I'm not stupid.  Offer me enough money and
I'll have a wistful feeling at my loss, plus a lot of cash.  ;-)<p>

<hr>

If you're here looking for some of my former rants, they're all
<a href="olddefault.html">still around</a>.  But there's really nothing
new to say:  people write in either saying "yay! good website!" or
"boo! terrible website!" in the same percentages as before, but with
nothing new to say.  And people are <i>still</i> offering to buy my
domain for faaaaaar less than it is worth, and I generally just
ignore those completely.<p>

But today, I bring to you a brand new rant.<p>

Dear MySpace,<p>

You are The Suck&trade;<p>

I happen to own a domain, namely "kill.com".  I registered it quite
some time ago, as a play on my nickname "possum".  As "roadkill.com"
was already taken, I realized I could use "road.kill.com" instead,
and so this poor excuse of a website was born.  I don't make a lot
of money (read: none whatsoever), but that's hardly the point.<p>

I <i>do</i> happen to use my domain for email.  Some websites just
don't "get it", so to speak, and require people to register an email
address before, say, they download a program or document.  Since I
<i>already</i> get a freakish amount of spam, I use my domain to
create "throwaway" email addresses.  One address per site, and that
way I can keep track of which ones are selling accounts to spammers,
and which ones <i>actually</i> adhere to their privacy policies.<p>

On the internet, your email address is your identity.  It is your
signature.  It is your only way of proving you are yourself.  In other
words, when somebody is using <i>your</i> email address, it is
basically a case of "identity theft".  They are doing nothing less
than pretending to be <i>you</i>.<p>

Most websites like yours are aware of this problem, and their
solution is very simple.  People can create an account with any
email address they choose, but they <i>cannot</i> use their account
until the email address has been verified.  How is this done?  They
just send one single email, and until the user clicks on a link or
types in a secret code included in that email, their new account
remains inactive.<p>

This benefits <i>everybody</i> involved.  Your marketing databases
are accurate, the users have a working account, and us poor schlebs
that own real, actual domains like "kill.com" don't have to wade
through an additional couple of hundred marketing emails every month
<i>on top of</i> the regular dose of spam.<p>

So do the right thing, MySpace.  Heck, I've already told you this
more than once, but it appears that it the job of "Not Me!" to
read the comments submitted to your website, as I have never even
once gotten a response.  Not even a simple "Thanks for your
interest" form letter.<p>

--Me<p>
