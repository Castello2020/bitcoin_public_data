              <br>
              </b> The number 0 in a dream represents power.&nbsp;&nbsp;A zero

              power of the first number.<br>
              <br>
              Alternatively, zero may reflect nothing or no value.<br>
              <br>
              For example, if you dream 5000 than it represents a change (5) that 
              is (0) is powerful. The number of digits in the number being 4 represents 
              this change being one that is balancing or stabilizing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a><br>

              <br>
              The number 1 in a dream represents beginnings.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you 
              see it in a dream it can mean that something new is starting in 
              the way you think or in your life.<br>
              <br>
              Alternatively, the number 1 can represent confrontation or standing 
              up to something.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a><br>
              <br>
              <b>2</b><br>

              ideas, beliefs or choices struggling with each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;Arguments 
              or trouble accomplishing goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a><br>

              <b>3</b><br>
              <br>
              The number 3 in a dream represents creation or making something

              process or chaos. There may be unpredictability in your life.<br>
              <br>
              Example:&nbsp; A man dreamed of seeing the number 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
              waking life he was noticing himself doing everything he could to 
              promote his website with multiple advertisements at once from different 
              companies in a big storm of promotion just to see what would happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a><br>

              you need four of them to stay balanced or secure.<br>
              <br>
              Example:&nbsp;A man dreamed of being given $400 dollars.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
              waking life a vitamin supplement was recommended to him that helped

              <br>
              <b>14</b><br>
              <br>
              The number 14 in a dream represents confrontation with something 
              balanced or stable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Positively, it may reflect your inability 
              to lose in the face of opposition that wants nothing except your 
              failure.&nbsp;&nbsp;Negatively, 14 represents the feelings about 
              something being impossible to get rid of no matter how hard you 
              try.<br>
              <br>
              Example: A man dreamed of his enemy living in a house that was numbered 
              14.&nbsp;&nbsp;In waking life he couldn't embarrass his enemy no

              In a positive sense it points to problems that go away on their 
              own or good things that begin to happen with no effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;Negatively, 
              15 points to living with problems you didn't want to deal with.&nbsp;&nbsp;Often 
              pointing to arrogance that embarrasses you or a loss of status or

              The number 17 represents facing or confronting purification.&nbsp;&nbsp;This 
              reflects negative situations or negative beliefs that are being 
              forced away without a choice.<br>
              <br>
              You may have no control over a situation that's forcing you to change 
              or confront an issue.&nbsp;It may also represent a threat that forces 
              you to think different. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Negatively, 17 can be a a sign that you are at risk of not doing 
              enough to deal with negative situations or problems before being 
              forced to.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no escape from this process and you 
              can expect to face fears or karmic debt in some manner.<br>
              <br>
              When 17 appears in a dream you should take it as a warning that 
              you need to begin to face negativity in your life like never before. 
              Be proactive. You want to actively stand up to fear, resist desire, 
              and care for and respect other people.&nbsp;&nbsp;Confront problems 
              head on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to do this could result in unhappiness 
              or a loss of power and status.<br>

              The number 17 gains it's meaning from numerology by using 1 and 
              7 to symbolize confronting purification (1+7).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a><br>
