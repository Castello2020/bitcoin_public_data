<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To dream of Satan represents powerful controlling negativity.  Very strong fears, anger, greed, or deviousness that totally controls you.

You may be choosing to permanently suffer by never asking for help.<br/><br/>Alternatively, Satan may reflect your own enjoyment or insatiable need to hurt others.  Feeling good trying to permanently keep someone else away from happiness.<br/><br/>Example: A 16 year-old young boy dreamed of seeing Satan sitting on a throne with dead trees at his sides.  In waking life he was very good-looking and suddenly developed an illness that caused his hair to fall out.  He felt that his life was over and that he would permanently be an ugly loser who would never be happy every again. <br/><br/>Example 2: Giuseppi Tartini dreamed that the Devil came to him in his sleep, sat on the end of his bed, and played the violin for what eventually became the musical piece "The Devil's Trill Sonata."  In this case the Devil playing the music may have reflected Tartini's feelings of total embarrassment that God or "something else" was revealing itself to be behind all his inspiration and musical talent and that Tartini wasn't really as talented as he thought of himself to be. The Devil was then Tartini's feelings about how negative it felt to believe he could never believe in himself being genuinely talented ever again because of the dream.<br/><br/>*Please See <a href='http://www.dreambible.com/search.php?q=Demons'>Demons</a><br/>*Please See <a href='http://www.dreambible.com/search.php?q=Hell'>Hell</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a></font></p>
