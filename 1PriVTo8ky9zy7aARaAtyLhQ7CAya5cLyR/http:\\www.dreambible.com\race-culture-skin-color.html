              of being robbed by a black person symbolizes a choice you or someone 
              else has made to avoid jealousy or embarrassment that is causing 
              a big problem. It may also reflect feelings of loss due to someone 
              else's jealousy.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To see a very 
              muscular black person may symbolize a powerful wish to feel good 
              that is difficult to overcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may have trouble resisting 
              a temptation or overcoming someone else's jealousy of you.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Historically, 
              black people in dreams have been bad omens and often appeared before 
              bad luck or tragedy would strike. This is because they reflect the 
              dreamers careless drive to feel good that prevents them from seeing 
              the danger or risks ahead.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">For a black 
              person to dream of a black person may simply reflect an aspect of 
              their personality where appearance and clothing are more important 
              symbols. Dreaming of people of your own race is not always significant 
              unless other races are present. Facial features, clothing, or the 
              feelings you get from the dream people are more important.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example: A woman 
              dreamed that a black man shot her in the chest.. In real life the 
              woman's daughter died in a car accident and she was grieving over 
              her death when the funeral bill came.&nbsp;&nbsp;The black man who 
              shot her represented her wish to feel good about her daughters death 
              by buying an expensive funeral that she couldn't afford.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
              shot represented the expensive bill being received.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example 2: A 
              woman dreamed of seeing black men that she was very attracted to. 
              In real life she was having difficulty getting the dream job and 
              boyfriend that she wanted. The black men represented her awareness 
              of herself continuing to be hopeful about getting the job and boyfriend 
              even though her chances never got any closer.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of 
              an angry Turkish person may reflect resentment of having cared about

              Ukrainian People<br>
              <br>
              </b>To dream of Ukrainian people represents aspects of the personality 
              that are sensitive about wanting to notice winning. An unwillingness 
              to notice yourself losing if you don't have to. Feelings of deserving 
              to be a winner.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Positively, 
              a Ukrainian person in a dream may reflect an intelligent need to 
              see strong results first. Being unwilling to look stupid, desperate, 
              or having chosen to be a loser. Always thinking that there is something 
              else that can be done to win when problems arise.</font></p>

              a Ukrainian person in a dream may reflect a selfish need to notice

              impatient attitude towards winning. Making jokes or comments about 
              why other people are losers if they don't choose the winning choice.

              White People</b><br>
              <br>
              To dream of white people represents aspects of your personality 
              that are advantaged or have it easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Being jealous of 
              nothing at all. Habits, situations, or problems that can't lose 
              or easily overcome anything with less power. Something about yourself 
              or that you are experiencing that is impossible to lose with.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Positively, white people 
              reflect your inability to fail at something or your ability to easily 
              overcome problems. Some area of your life where you have an advantage 
              or more experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;An area of your life where you were 
              &quot;there first.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear, insecurity, or loss doesn't 
              stop you.&nbsp;Power comes naturally.&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling no jealousy.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Negatively, white people 
              reflect problems that can't be stopped or situations that are too 
              entrenched for you to do anything about. Fear, insecurity, or loss 
              overpowers you. It may also reflect jealousy that never goes away. 
              Feeling that someone has an advantage over you.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may 
              also reflect your insecurity that something is too difficult for 
              you to do as well.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The symbolism is based 
              on the stereotypical perception of white people as having easier 
              lives, more advantages, or being oblivious to poverty.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Example: A young black 
              woman dreamed of a white woman standing near a black man that she 
              liked. In waking life she was shocked to find out that this guy 
              that she liked already had a girlfriend. The white woman in her 
              dream reflected her jealousy and disappointment of being unable 
              to have the guy because his girlfriend already had the advantage 
              of dating him.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a></font></p>
