            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Nightmares are 
              reflections of emotional problems or psychological issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;A 
              indicator of negative thinking patterns, troubling emotions, or 
              bad habits that prevent you from being a more balanced and happier 
              person.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nightmares often point to problems that are effecting 
              you unconsciously.&nbsp;&nbsp;A sign that you need to confront a 
              problem, seek guidance, or try to be more objective.<br>
              <br>
              Although nightmares tend to come and go, the only real way to guarantee 
              they stop completely is to deal with the underlying issues they 
              are trying to address.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear, desire, guilt, jealousy, 
              or attempts to control others are some of the more common problems 
              people face.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without addressing the underlying problems 
              directly your nightmares will remain a problem.<br>
              <br>
              To stop nightmares dead in their tracks it's recommended that you 
              begin to process negativity in your life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand up to 
              fear whenever they feel it, resist desire for attractive people 
              or material things that you don't believe you can ever have, and 
              learn to let go of the past or accept change.&nbsp;&nbsp;An individual 
              must try to respect and understand all people from a logical adult 
              perspective even if you don't like them.&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes 
              forgiving people, taking responsibility for your actions, and apologizing 
              for mistakes you've made. With enough effort the conscience can 
              be cleared, and your nightmares will disappear.<br>
              <br>
              We encourage you to be open-minded, objective, and self-critical 
              to allow yourself to explore the possibility that you have things 
              about you that can be improved or changed for the better.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also 
              consider the possibility that you might need to finally stand up 
              for yourself for first time in a way that you never have before.<br>
              <br>
              The symbols you'll find below are some of the most common symbols 
              you'll find nightmares.<br>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of 
              an alligator represents a situation in your life that you feel is 
              dangerous. Alternatively, an alligator may reflect a powerful fear 
              you have. An alligator may be a sign that you need to confront your 
              fears or speak to someone about your problems. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">If you find

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of

              You possibly have strong insecurities or anxieties about something 
              that is good for you. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example: A man 
              dreamed of alligators following him. In real life he was trying 
              to avoid financial bankruptcy. The alligators represented his sense 
              of danger about his failing finances and inability to cover bills.<br>
              <br>
              Example 2: A man dreamed of being chased by a flying alligator. 
              In waking life he was severely traumatized by a hurricane disaster. 
              The dream most likely reflected the dreamers feelings about the 
              lingering and dangerous possibility of another hurricane occurring.

              pattern or negative situation that is noticeably beyond normal limits. 
              Black most often reflects negative feelings such as fear or behaviors

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Black may show 
              up in dreams for people who are afraid, suicidal, depressed, desperate, 
              doing too many drugs, or having too much sex. An imbalanced mindset, 
              mood, or behavior. It may also reflect your own awareness of yourself

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Black in dreams 
              is often accompanied by the color red. When both colors are combined

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of

              To dream of blood represents energy or vitality. It reflects how

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Positively,

              <b>Rape</b><br>
              <br>
              To dream of rape represents negative life experiences that you are 
              powerless to stop or control. Someone or something is effecting 
              your self-esteem, well-being, or ability to do as you please.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Sex in a dream 
              represents the merging of different aspects of yourself to create 
              life experiences. Rape is then a negative experience that you are 
              unable to stop that's filled with fear, stress, desire for things 
              you can't have, or other negative emotions. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Examples of 
              real life situations that may encourage dreams of rape may be a 
              loss of a promotion to a less qualified person, an unsupportive 
              spouse, or a problem that never seems to improve. People may also 
              dream of rape if they experience unwanted attention from the opposite 
              sex. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">If you see someone 
              raping another person it represents one aspect of your personality 
              forcing itself on another to control your life experience. For example, 
              if a killer raped your mother in a dream it may represent a powerful 
              fear controlling your intuition so that you will never make choices 
              that will help you to face you fear. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">If you were

              Example 3: A woman dreamed of being raped by strangers. In waking

              Red can also represent anger, fighting, meanness, or dishonesty.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The color red 
              is a sign that you are being excessive, immoral, dishonest, or experiencing 
              something unpleasant. Red can also reflect full knowledge that you 
              are doing something that you know is wrong. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The symbolism

              positive areas of your life. A strong need to put yourself first 
              or powerful insecurities that derail a genuine endeavor. Selfishness 
              that corrupts all else. A fear of total failure due to someone else's 
              selfishness. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of 
              riding on the back of a snake represents feelings about something 
              dangerous you are using to scare people away from you. Enjoying 
              making people feel you are dangerous. Feeling that it's easy to 
              scare people with severe losses if they get in your way. Alternatively, 
              it may reflect a feeling of safety you get from being able to make 
              other people feel you are too dangerous. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of 
              a being choked by a snake may represent feelings about a negative

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example: A girl 
              once dreamed of a poisonous snake that seduced her and was impossible 
              to resist. In real life she was dealing with an extremely attractive 
              man that was pursuing her that she didn't trust. The snake reflected 
              her view of this man being a &quot;player&quot; and just telling 
              her whatever she wanted to hear in order to sleep with her. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example 2: A

              she was unable to express herself or do anything that wasn't approved 
              by the community. The white snake reflected her feelings about the 
              strict morality laws of the religious community corrupting all her

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example 4: A

              was resisting revealing her sexual desire for a co-worker out of 
              fear that she'd be fired. The snake reflected her fear of being 
              fired that was preventing her from expressing her feelings. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example 5: A

              In waking life her husband threatened to leave her and not talk 
              to her again. The dark brown snakes reflected her fear of losing 
              her husband that could spoil her family life forever.</font><br>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To see a tiger 
              in your dream, represents an aspect of your personality that has 
              unquestioned power. Issues or people that have total power over 
              you. Tigers often symbolize a problem or powerful fear that you'll

              reflect a powerful misconception you have. A lie or misunderstanding

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Alternatively, 
              a tiger may reflect your own unquestioned authority. Feeling other

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Negatively, 
              a tiger may reflect an unquestioned fear. Running away from problems 
              based on assumptions. Rumors that scare you. Assuming that your 
              enemies have more power than you without question. A lack of critical 
              thinking about something serious you've heard. Feeling that problem 
              is too dangerous to even consider thinking about confronting and 
              choosing to run away from it as a first option. A naive fear you 
              have. Alternatively, it may reflect your own abuse of rumors, other 
              people's inexperience, or others misconceptions about you.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To see a blue

              it's more important than anything else. Negatively, a blue tiger

              in your dream symbolizes an aspect of your personality that is parasitic 
              or selfishly feeds off others. A person or situation that drains 
              you of time, energy, or resources. Either your own selfish need 
              to use others or your projection of other people that are feeding 
              off of you. It could represent either material or emotional parasitism.

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of

              <br>
              To dream of being bitten by a vampire represents feelings about 
              other people using you or feeding off of you and being unable to 
              stop it. If you dream of being bitten by a vampire and turning into

              your honest mindset towards using other people because you were 
              used. A bad experience with a jerk that has converted you into wanting

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Vampires in

              pressure, or ambivalence. You or someone else may be feeding off 
              someone emotionally. Vampires can also reflect an illness that is 
              draining your time and energy. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">A vampire in 
              a dream might be telling you that you need to start being more independent, 
              and relying less on others resources or accomplishments. You need 
              to start caring about people, valuing them, or respecting them. 
              Alternatively, a vampire may reflect a need to stand up to people 
              who are using you. You may need to cut someone off. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of

              of what other people thought that was driving him to avoid any embarrassment 
              at all costs.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example 2: A 
              young girl dreamed of zombies. In waking life she was grounded by 
              parents and felt that they never cared about anything accept never 
              listening to her while making sure she endured her full punishment. 
              The zombies may have reflected her feelings about her parents being 
              blindly motivated to keep her punished.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example 3: A 
              young girl dreamed of zombies. In waking life she was very insecure 
              about her social skills and talking to people. She tended to go 
              along with the crowd as a way to avoid having to reveal her weak 
              social skills.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example 4: A 
              young woman dreamed of a dead zombie being kept alive. In waking 
              life her she was trying to keep a long-term relationship alive even 
              though she felt it was dead. The dead zombie she was trying to keep 
              alive may have reflected her tendency to do whatever her boyfriend 
              told her because she was too attracted to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a></font></p>
