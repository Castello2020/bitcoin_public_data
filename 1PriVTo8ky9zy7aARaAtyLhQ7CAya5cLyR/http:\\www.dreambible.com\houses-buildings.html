              in dreams are usually symbols for a perspective on a situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The

              <b>Apartment Building</b><br>
              <br>
              To dream of an apartment building represents a lack of free will 
              or independence. There are obligations, responsibilities, or commitments 
              that you are forced to be mindful of. Consideration for others wishes 
              may be a priority. You are not free to do as you please. Forced 
              to live with problems or issues that you have no control over.<br>
              <br>
              Example: A man dreamed of being in a strange apartment building. 
              In real life he had a business plan he wanted to release, but couldn't 
              because it required a lot of preparations. The apartment building 
              reflected his perspective on the situation being obligated or tied 
              down to the preparations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a><br>

              <b>Asylum</b><br>
              <br>
              To dream of being in an asylum represents feelings of being imcompetent 
              or unimportant. You may feel ostraciszed, embarassed, or like people 
              have lost all respect for you. You may have made a big mistake that 
              others disapprove of. You may also feel left out, excluded, and 
              ignored.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of 
              being treated by a doctor in an asylum may represent a difficulty 
              changing unhealthy habits or beliefs.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of 
              escaping an asylum may represent feelings about a second chance 
              or a new lease on life. You may have thought up a way to regain 
              respect or restore your reputation.</font></p>

              it is that you don't respect.<br>
              <br>
              Example:&nbsp; A man dreamed of a man being inside his attic.&nbsp;&nbsp;In

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of

              <b>Bar</b><br>
              <br>
              To dream of being at a bar represents areas of your life that you 
              consciously obsessed with or passionate about. You go out of your 
              way to do something a lot, possibly to the point of excess. It may

              Basement</b><br>
              <br>
              To dream of a basement represents your deepest darkest thoughts, 
              emotions,and memories. &nbsp;A basement points to problems that 
              you don't want to deal with or issues that may be very uncomfortable 
              thinking about.&nbsp;&nbsp;A situation or memory that is so negative 
              that you can't forget it or think about anything else.<br>
              <br>
              Alternatively, a basement may reflect the worsening of a problem 
              or trouble that you are overwhelmed by.<br>
              <br>
              A basement is a sign that you may have unresolved issues, or problems 
              that the ego may not allow you to explore without assistance.<br>
              <br>
              Example:&nbsp; A man dreamed of seeing his father fall down the

              <br>
              Example 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;A man dreamed of seeing a girl he liked from

              <b>Bathrooms</b><br>
              <br>
              To dream of a bathroom represents a cleansing process.&nbsp;&nbsp;Confronting 
              issues, negative emotions, or negative life situations.<br>
              <br>
              To dream of dirty bathroom represents difficulties during a cleansing 
              process.&nbsp;&nbsp;A sign that more effort is needed to confront 
              mental and emotional problems or that a current situation is unsupportive 
              of progress.<br>
              <br>
              To dream of cleaning a bathroom represents your attempt to make

              or difficulties that may get in your way as your try to improve 
              yourself.<br>
              <br>
              To dream of not being able to find the bathroom or make it on time 
              represents distractions, pressures, or postponing your own wishes

              <b>Beds</b><br>
              <br>
              To dream of a bed represents an issue you are not interesting in 
              doing anything about. Situations you have chosen to accept, live 
              with, or do nothing about. Making the choice to metaphorically &quot;sleep 
              on it.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Sitting on a 
              bed may be a sign that you are thinking about taking action with 
              a situation you have accepted for too long. It may also reflect 
              hesitance or fear of standing up to a problem.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of 
              an unmade bed may reflect indecision or unfinished progress. A made 
              bed may reflect a final decision or a conclusion to an issue you've 
              done something about. Feeling content that nothing else needs to 
              be done with an issue.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To get out of 
              bed symbolizes an effort to fix a problem, or make a change.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">If you are waking 
              up in a different and/or unknown bed it may reflect a new awareness 
              of yourself. It could also reflect motivation to deal with issues 
              in ways you've never thought of before.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">If you find 
              yourself sitting in someone else's bed then it represents inaction, 
              or acceptance of an issue through a perspective based on whatever 
              qualities stand out the most about that person.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Having sex in 
              a bed symbolizes a positive or enjoyable experience you are having 
              and don't want to change.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of 
              two people in bed together without sex symbolizes two aspects of 
              your personality that are inactive or not doing anything about an 
              issue. Ask yourself what qualities or feelings about the people 
              stand out the most and how those qualities may apply to waking life 
              situations where you are comfortable keeping a situation as it is 
              or feel comfortable not doing anything about a problem.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a></font><br>

              situations where change is occurring and the 9th floor may reflect 
              an ending of some kind. Higher floors may represent higher levels

              <b>Windows</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of 
              a window represents a perspective or insight on current events. 
              Seeing something more clearly. An outlook on a situation. It may 
              also reflect your ability to see ahead. Noticing or feeling what 
              possibilities lay ahead or what's about to happen. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of 
              a broken window represents lost opportunities or never getting to 
              think about the future in a particular way ever again. Not feeling 
              good about the future at all or feeling that an opportunity has 
              been wasted. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of 
              washing a window represents clarifying a distorted issue. Renewed 
              confidence in future possibilities. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of 
              entering a window represents an underhanded or secretive exploitation 
              of an opportunity. It may reflect waking life situations where you 
              are creating your own opportunities or impatiently making something 
              irregular happen. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of 
              looking out a window represents insight into what's happening or 
              your outlook for the future. Seeing ahead or what you feel is going 
              to happen. It may also reflect your hopes for what is about to come. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of 
              someone looking in your window may represent situations that allow 
              people to see what you're really thinking. Others gaining insight 
              into you. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of 
              looking inside a window represent a glimpse of insight, a point 
              of view, or a perspective on a situation or relationship.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of 
              a foggy window represents confusion or uncertain behavior that is 
              making it hard for you to discern or calculate a future outcome.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example: A man 
              dreamed of seeing a beautiful view outside a window. In waking life 
              he was beginning to have a more positive view about healing from 
              a serious injury.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example 2: A 
              woman dreamed of seeing a large penis object while peering inside 
              her sisters bedroom window. In waking life she had gained insight 
              into why her sister's boyfriend was such a jerk.</font></p>
