              Beans in a dream may be a sign that you desire more excitement or

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Alternatively,

              Example:&nbsp;&nbsp;A man dreamed of being offered a bottle of wine.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
              waking life he was taking it easy after finishing a difficult work 
              project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a><br>
              <br>
              <b>Yogurt</b><br>
              <br>
              To dream of yogurt represents feeling good knowing that something 
              is good for you or in your best interest. Learning to embrace change, 
              appropriate behavior, or things that are difficult to accept.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a></font></p>
