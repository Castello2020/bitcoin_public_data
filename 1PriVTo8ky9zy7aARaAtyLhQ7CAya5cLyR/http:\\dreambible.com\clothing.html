              Example:&nbsp; A man dreamed of seeing a woman he liked wearing 
              a pink belt.&nbsp;&nbsp;In real life he was only helping this woman 
              because he sexually lusted after her.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pink belt reflected

              sign that you feel powerless or out of control as you confront problems.<br>
              <br>
              The symbolism is based on water reflecting uncertainty or negative

              the beach.&nbsp;&nbsp;In real life he was confronting a serious 
              health crisis in which he believed he was going to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;The

              this guy was fully aware that she liked him, but she was playing 
              it smart with him. The guy seeing her in her bra reflected her awareness 
              of the guy knowing she liked him while she held back her eagerness 
              to date or be intimate. Showing interest while acting ladylike. 
              Noticing her true feelings on display without wanting to look like 
              a slut. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example 2: A

              respect for herself, but couldn't because everyone started to take 
              the ex-fiancee's side and hate her. The wet bra may have reflected

              <b>Pajamas</b><br>
              <br>
              To dream of pajamas represents a heightened comfort level accepting 
              or ignoring issues in your life. Your personality being comfortable 
              choosing to &quot;sleep&quot; on an issue. An issue where you are 
              consistently and purposely ignoring making a needed change. Willful 
              blindness. Pajamas in the dream may be a sign that you don't want 
              to deal with problems because it feels better not doing so. Noticing 
              you are being stupid on purpose.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Alternatively, 
              pajamas may reflect relationships where someone is pretending they 
              don't like the other person.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of 
              changing into your pajamas represents an issue in your life encourages 
              willful blindness. Doing everything you can to never confront something 
              or see it for what it really is. Feeling that it's easier to pretend 
              you're stupid than to confront an issue.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example: A girl 
              dreamed of changing into her pajamas. In real life she was dealing 
              with a sleazy seductive man who slowly began to break down her will 
              to resist him. Putting on the pajamas reflected her personality 
              changing to slowly enjoying being seduced. Over time she began to 
              pretend she was stupid about the seduction and gave in to it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example 2: A 
              woman dreamed of attending her former lovers wedding in her pajamas. 
              In waking life she was invited her former lover's wedding and was 
              very jealous of it. She had issues lying to herself that her old 
              relationship would be easy to rekindle. The pajamas reflected her 
              personality being comfortable &quot;sleeping&quot; on any possibility 
              of changing her views and moving on.</font><br>

              <br>

              yourself with.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may reflect your concern to maintain 
              a good reputation while interviewing for a job or anxiety about 
              keeping someone you like with a good impression of you.<br>
              <br>
              Men dreaming of girls they want to date in a school girl's uniform

              no danger exists.&nbsp; You may have overlooked how serious something 
              is. <br>
              <br>
              Example:&nbsp; A man dreamed of someone telling him to change his 
              slippers because someone might think he was gay. &nbsp;In waking 
              life he was dealing with the tax department and realized they may

              <br>
              To dream of a tuxedo represents the personality that is totally 
              prepared for something. Being so concerned with something you don't 
              care about anything else. Readiness for a special event or to use 
              your experience. A tuxedo may also reflect cultivated experience 
              and skill. You may have been waiting for something for a long time.<br>

              </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">A tuxedo

              <br>
              To dream of underwear represents your most personal beliefs or wishes. 
              Hidden attitudes and prejudices. Alternatively, underwear represents 
              your personal view towards sex or your sexual attraction to someone 
              else. Something private about yourself that you might be embarrassed 
              for other people to discover about you. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Negatively, 
              underwear in a dream may reflect issues that are too personal to 
              speak about. Anxiety or fear of being embarrassed with your true 
              feelings. Fear of being caught guilty or &quot;red handed.&quot; 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Consider the 
              color of the underwear for additional meaning. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Underwear belonging 
              to the opposite sex often symbolizes self-awareness about sexual 
              interests or desirable experiences you'd like to have. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream that 
              you are in your underwear reflects personal beliefs or wishes that 
              are exposed to others. If you are embarrassed to be in your underwear 
              you may feel self-conscious, embarrassed, or that a situation has 
              created a loss of respect for you. If you are comfortable in your 
              underwear it may represent a lack of concern about how others perceive 
              your most personal beliefs or interests. You may not be bothered 
              by what other people think. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream that 
              you are not wearing any underwear represents a complete lack of 
              inhibition. You or someone else that feels they have nothing to 
              hide. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream that 
              someone else is in their underwear indicates an embarrassing and 
              revealing situation. Alternatively, the dream may means that you 
              are seeing this person for who they really are. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To see dirty 
              or torn underwear represents discomfort in your own skin and feelings 
              of inadequacy. You may be uncomfortable about your sexuality and 
              feeling very self-conscious about something embarrassing. It may 
              also be a sign that you have self-defeating beliefs that overshadow 
              personal goals or interests. Feeling embarrassed about your private 
              thoughts or feelings. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example: A man 
              dreamed of secretly looking in a drawer at the underwear of a girl

              you are undressing represents the shedding of inhibitions. You may 
              be giving up certain beliefs or attitudes. Undressing may also reflect 
              revelation of your true feelings or beliefs to others. You may be

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of

              or that your decisions are influenced.<br>
              <br>
              The reason for this is because hair in dreams symbolizes a person's
