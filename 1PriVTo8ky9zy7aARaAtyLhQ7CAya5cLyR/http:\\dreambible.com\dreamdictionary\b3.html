      <blockquote><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Birdcage</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To dream of a birdcage represents a loss of freedom. You may feel trapped or unable to fully express yourself.  You may desire to do things that you don't believe you can ever do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Birdhouse</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To dream of a birdhouse represents the intention to support freedom or independence.  Enjoying seeing other people be free.  It may also reflect your support of others overcoming or transcending their problems.  Giving others the opportunity or free time to develop themselves.  Enjoying others thriving.  Possibly a symbol for support from family.<br/><br/>To dream of an empty or unused birdhouse may represent feelings about being encouraged to do whatever you want.<br/><br/>Negatively, a birdhouse may represent freedom being given to you by others because they get to use you.  Freedom under insensitive or dangerous conditions.  Terrible or abusive parents that let you do whatever you want as long as they don't have to show you they love you.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Birds</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Birds in dreams are symbols for transcendence and liberation.  Escaping boundaries and limitations. A symbol for progress towards wholeness and harmony. They are your goals, aspirations, and hopes. The type and color of the bird is very important in decoding the meaning (e.g. black birds or vultures are not positive symbols).<br/><br/>To dream of baby birds represents the potential for transcendence and liberation.  Plans or preparation for overcoming something.  Being very careful as you work towards goals that give you freedom.<br/><br/>To see dead or dying birds represent disappointment and failures.  Killing birds may reflect intentionally souring an inspiring idea or someone else's freedom.<br/><br/>To dream of feeding birds represents encouragement, inspiration, or supporting the idea of trying to overcome problems.  Feeding the idea of freedom or transcendence.  Encouraging yourself or believing in yourself.  Alternatively, consider the type of bird you are feeding.  For example, crows and vultures may reflect more negative thinking or behavior being encouraged.<br/><br/>To dream of bird eggs represents goals, aspirations, and hopes that are developing and will take time to be realized.  The opposite is true if the eggs are from a species of bird that isn't positive.<br/><br/>To see a flying bird represents transcendence and liberation. A weight has been lifted off your shoulders and you are experiencing a sense of freedom. <br/><br/>To see a caged bird represents a desire for freedom or liberation.  You feel confined and restricted in some area of your life.<br/><br/>To see a blue colored bird in a dream symbolizes positive transcendence over negativity.  It represents the power of positive thinking, truth, and doing what you know to be right taking a more powerful role.  It is also an indication of purification and resolution to conflicts in your life.<br/><br/>To dream of a white bird represents a wish to transcend or rise above a negative situation that is being renewed.  Finally deciding to escape a bad situation after avoiding it being kept down.  A white bird may also reflect a belief that escaping a bad situation is a good idea.<br/><br/>To dream of a red bird represents freedom or transcendence that you are aware of being negative or dangerous.  Getting your freedom back through violence, fighting, or with no concern for others feelings.  Possibly a reflection of attaining freedom through dishonest means or cheating others to help only yourself escape a restrictive situation.  A red bird may a reflect corrupt attitude about getting ahead of others in business.  A red bird may also show up in the dreams of people experiencing corruption in communist countries that allows one to get more privileges than other people by serving the state.<br/><br/>Example:  A man dreamed of seeing a white bird.  In waking life he felt his life was over, but then had a powerful spiritual experience that made him want to fight his problems and overcome them.<br/><br/>Example 2: A very elderly woman dreamed of enjoying seeing white birds fly around her windows while being very careful not to let the birds out the door.  In waking life she was enjoying thinking about what life would like after death and didn't want to bring the topic up with her family.<br/><br/>Example 3: A young woman dreamed of walking into a kitchen to see a birdcage with the door wide open and bird choosing to stay inside the bird cage.  In waking life she was having problems adjusting to American freedom after having come from a communist country.<br/><br/>*Please See <a href='http://www.dreambible.com/search.php?q=Yellow+Bird'>Yellow Bird</a><br/><br/>Refer to the <a href="http://www.dreambible.com/birds.html">themes section for birds</a> for a more in depth look at bird symbolism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To dream of giving birth represents the beginning of a new situation, relationship, or phase of your life.  It may also reflect new ideas or projects.  A change has occurred in the dreamer's life.

Ask yourself what is new in your life?<br/><br/>Alternatively, dreaming about a birth may reflect an awakening or new era of your life. Graduating to a new level of responsibility.<br/><br/>Negatively, giving birth may reflect the beginning of a new problem or fear.  A negative situation is coming to life.  Feeling powerless to stop yourself from making a situation worse.  Growing pains.<br/><br/>Example:  A woman dreamed of having an unpleasant birth.  In waking life she started to chastise her teenage son for his growing disrespectful behavior and it began to blow up in her face.  The unpleasant birth reflected her feelings about herself graduating to a higher level of motherly responsibility as her son grew into an unpredictable teenager requiring more tough love.<br/><br/>*Please See <a href='http://www.dreambible.com/search.php?q=Baby'>Baby</a><br/>*Please See <a href='http://www.dreambible.com/search.php?q=Pregnant'>Pregnant</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a></font></p>

Something good has happened that is just for you.  You may be getting exactly what you wanted.  A wish may have been realized.<br/><br/>If you see a birthday cake with blood on it may reflect a negative situation that overshadows your good luck.  It may also represent guilt you have with something negative you did to achieve your good fortune.<br/><br/>A pink birthday cake may reflect good fortune that you are obsessed with.

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To dream of a birthmark represents awareness about how unique something about yourself or someone else is.  Feelings about being born to do something.  A life purpose.<br/><br/>Negatively, a birthmark may reflect a problem or burden that you notice only effects you.  Feeling that some area of your life is stained or cursed by fate.<br/><br/>Example: A man dreamed of seeing a pastor with a birthmark on his back who didn't know the birthmark was there.  In waking life the man felt his local pastor didn't respect how special his life purpose was as a leader of the church because the pastor was too concerned with miracles and materialism and not enough with responsible messages about charity and hard work.  The unseen birthmark reflected the man's view of his pastor not being able to see how important his own life's purpose was.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a></font></p>
