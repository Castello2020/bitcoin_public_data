              <br>
              To dream of an albatross represents an aspect of yourself that is 
              noticably overpowering or overshadowing. You or someone else that

              <b>Alligators</b><br>
              <br>
              To dream of an alligator represents a situation in your life that 
              you feel is dangerous. Feeling that a problem has rocked your sense 
              of balance or safety. Feeling shaken by something or struggling 
              to contain a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, an alligator may 
              reflect a powerful fear you have. An alligator may be a sign that 
              you need to put more effort into confronting your fears or speak 
              to someone about your problems.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">An alligator 
              may reflect the danger you feel from a job layoff, argument, or 
              interpersonal problem. It may also reflect the threat of loss or 
              feeling that a crisis may be at hand.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">If you find 
              yourself eating alligator in a dream it represents overcoming a 
              fear or dangerous situation. You are feeling victory, success, and 
              triumph.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of 
              a blue alligator symbolizes a powerful fear of a positive situation. 
              You possibly have strong insecurities or anxieties about something 
              that is good for you.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example: A man 
              dreamed of alligators following him. In real life he was trying 
              to avoid financial bankruptcy. The alligators represented his sense 
              of danger about his failing finances and inability to cover bills.<br>
              <br>
              Example 2: A man dreamed of being chased by a flying alligator. 
              In waking life he was severely traumatized by a hurricane disaster. 
              The dream most likely reflected the dreamers feelings about the 
              lingering and dangerous possibility of another hurricane occurring.

              To dream of anaconda represents feelings of being powerlessly restricted.

              </b>To dream of a bat represents confusion, mixed messages, and

              the complete opposite.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may feel like a promise made

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">A bat may be 
              a sign that are getting involved with something that defies your 
              better judgement. If you are getting signals to be careful it may 
              be best to listen to them. Bats represent your inability to see

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Negatively, 
              the bear reflects possessiveness, an overbearing attitude, or unhealthy 
              loner tendencies. You or someone else that doesn't want to share 
              anything or do anything with anyone else. You want something all 
              to yourself or to monopolize something. A fierce desire to have 
              something all to yourself. Alternatively, a bear may reflect a problem

              impossible.<br>
              <br>
              To dream of being chased by a bear represents may represent an aversion

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example: A young

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example 2: A

              <br>
              To dream of baby birds represents the potential for transcendence

              <br>
              To see dead or dying birds represent disappointment and failures.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              Killing birds may reflect intentionally souring an inspiring idea

              <br>
              To dream of feeding birds represents encouragement, inspiration,

              idea of freedom or transcendence. Encouraging yourself or believing 
              in yourself. Alternatively, consider the type of bird you are feeding. 
              For example, crows and vultures may reflect more negative thinking 
              or behavior being encouraged.<br>
              <br>
              To dream of bird eggs represents goals, aspirations, and hopes that 
              are developing and will take time to be realized.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
              opposite is true if the eggs are from a species of bird that isn't 
              positive.<br>
              <br>
              To see a flying bird represents transcendence and liberation. A 
              weight has been lifted off your shoulders and you are experiencing 
              a sense of freedom. <br>
              <br>
              To see a caged bird represents a desire for freedom or liberation.&nbsp;&nbsp;You 
              feel confined and restricted in some area of your life.<br>
              <br>
              To see a blue colored bird in a dream symbolizes positive transcendence 
              over negativity.&nbsp;It represents the power of positive thinking, 
              truth, and doing what you know to be right taking a more powerful 
              role.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">It 
              is also an indication of purification and resolution to conflicts 
              in your life.<br>
              <br>
              To dream of a white bird represents a wish to transcend or rise 
              above a negative situation that is being renewed. Finally deciding 
              to escape a bad situation after avoiding it being kept down. A white 
              bird may also reflect a belief that escaping a bad situation is 
              a good idea.<br>
              <br>
              To dream of a red bird represents freedom or transcendence that 
              you are aware of being negative or dangerous. Getting your freedom 
              back through violence, fighting, or with no concern for others feelings. 
              Possibly a reflection of attaining freedom through dishonest means 
              or cheating others to help only yourself escape a restrictive situation. 
              A red bird may a reflect corrupt attitude about getting ahead of 
              others in business. A red bird may also show up in the dreams of 
              people experiencing corruption in communist countries that allows 
              one to get more privileges than other people by serving the state.<br>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example: A man 
              dreamed of seeing a white bird. In waking life he felt his life 
              was over, but then had a powerful spiritual experience that made 
              him want to fight his problems and overcome them.<br>
              <br>
              Example 2: A very elderly woman dreamed of enjoying seeing white 
              birds fly around her windows while being very careful not to let 
              the birds out the door. In waking life she was enjoying thinking 
              about what life would like after death and didn't want to bring 
              the topic up with her family.<br>
              <br>
              Example 3: A young woman dreamed of walking into a kitchen to see 
              a birdcage with the door wide open and bird choosing to stay inside 
              the bird cage. In waking life she was having problems adjusting 
              to American freedom after having come from a communist country.

              thinking about something serious you've heard. Feeling that problem 
              is too dangerous to even consider thinking about confronting and 
              choosing to run away from it as a first option. A naive fear you 
              have. Alternatively, it may reflect your own abuse of rumors, other

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of 
              a pack of wolves represents feelings of being isolated, cornered, 
              and vulnerable to being taken from. Having to protect yourself from 
              numerous angles. Alternatively, a pack of wolves may reflect group 
              behavior that is of a organized mob mentality. Positively, a pack 
              of wolves may reflect feelings of brotherhood or sticking up for 
              friends.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">People with 
              serious physical injuries or medical issues that won't go away often 
              dream of wolves attacking them.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example: A once 
              man dreamed that wolves were eating his leg. In real life a medication 
              he required was paralyzing his leg and doctors had no idea how to 
              stop it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example 2: A 
              gay man dreamed of a white wolf walking up to him and hugging him. 
              In waking life he was coming to terms with accepting his homosexuality 
              and the feelings of being isolated that it gave him. He was becoming 
              comfortable with being gay &quot;on his own.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a><br>

              <b>Unicorns</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To dream of 
              a unicorn represents your view of a situation or person being totally 
              innocent, pure, or wonderful. Something that you feel the need to 
              be perfect for.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">A unicorn may 
              also represent something in your life that you feel is too good 
              for you, or a special person that you want to be very careful courting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a><br>
              </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><br>
              <b>Vultures</b><br>
              <br>
              To dream of a vulture represents benefiting from others failures 
              or mistakes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a><br>
              <br>
              <b>Wildebeests</b><br>
              <br>
              To dream of a wildebeest represents an aspect of your personality 
              that is inhospitable or unwelcoming.&nbsp;&nbsp;A person that is 
              aware of you and wants you to go away.&nbsp;&nbsp;A wildebeest may 
              reflect bitterness, hostile jealousy, or resenting someone.<br>
              <br>
              Example:&nbsp;&nbsp;A person once dreamed of a wildebeest.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
              real life a friend of the dreamer had learned that the dreamer betrayed 
              them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The friend grew noticeably bitter about this.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
              wildebeest reflected the hostility and resentment the dreamer felt 
              from their friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a><br>
              <br>
              <b>Zebra</b><br>
              <br>
              To dream about a zebra represents feelings about a person or situation 
              being misleadingly passive or cooperative. Thinking something is 
              a great idea until you get to know it personally. A loss of trust 
              or compliance felt from someone towards you once you get too serious 
              about something with them. The realization that someone you know 
              is hopelessly self-involved after first believing that they shared 
              your ideas. It may also reflect feelings that someone is beautiful 
              and then realizing they are less intelligent or mature than you 
              first thought.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Negatively, 
              a zebra may reflect a person in your life that keeps giving you 
              false ideas about what they are willing to do with you or for you. 
              Someone interesting or &quot;perfect for the part&quot; with potential 
              to fill a role that totally embarrasses you with opposite thinking. 
              Embarrassment or feeling let down that someone will never do the 
              one thing you would like them to. Dashed high expectations.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Example: A young 
              woman dreamed of seeing a zebra. In waking life she had just had 
              a big argument with her boyfriend. The zebra reflected her disappointment 
              with her boyfriend not doing something she got her hopes set on 
              him doing</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a><br>
              <br>
              <b>Zoo</b><br>
              <br>
              To dream of a zoo represents situations where you are noticing negative 
              or primitive behavior in others. You may be near people who are 
              less mature or intelligent than you are. Not wanting to get involved 
              in silly or &quot;stupid&quot; matters. It could also represent 
              exploration of something dangerous while being safe.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Alternatively, 
              a zoo may reflect disbelief at how &quot;crazy&quot; a situation 
              is. You may feel surrounded by chaos or confusion.<br>
              <br>
              Example: A woman dreamed of visiting the zoo. In waking life she 
              was giving her boyfriend a second chance after a fight. The zoo 
              reflected her living arrangements with the &quot;stupud&quot; boyfriend 
              that she didn't feel was really going to change. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><font size="1">TOP</font></a></font></p>
