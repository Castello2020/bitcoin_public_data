Automatic Builds
WARNING: Automatic builds are bleeding edge build of the code, and as such things may not be what you expect. Things will be missing and things will be a bit strange, but it is what the game currently plays as of the latest code revision (or near latest). If you find any crashes or oddities you can contact me at ghostlydeath@gmail.com or drop by OFTC #remood and if I am around I will assist, but if you visit IRC be sure to stick around since I don't look into the channel 24/7. You should also read these overly visible red text warnings. Automated builds are not hosted on remood.org and are on an off-site location.

AVOID DOWNLOADING BETWEEN 1 AM THROUGH 3 AM EASTERN USA TIME, AS THE AUTOMATIC BUILDS ARE PERFORMED AND THE SERVER IS RESET.
IF A FILE IS MISSING (AKA 404) THEN IT HAS YET TO BE BUILT OR HAS FAILED TO BUILD.
