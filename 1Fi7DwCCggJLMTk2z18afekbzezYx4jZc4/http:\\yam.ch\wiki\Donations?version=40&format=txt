= Donations? Why? =
Since 2004, the YAM Development Team accepts donations to support their development on YAM. This was mainly established to fight  against the shrinking motivation and amount of developers actively working on the future of YAM. By supporting our development team with  financial donations we hope to attract other developers and give our developers an additional motivation to work on the future of YAM. To divide the amount of donated money fairly through all developers, we will use the following procedure:

 * On a new official (stable) release, the number of SVN checkins from all developers who were active during that release will be counted.
 * The received money will be substracted by the required fees by PayPal (~4%).
 * The rest of money of the received donations will be splitted by each percent each developer was active during this release.
 * The  developer's money will then afterwards forwarded to each developer's PayPal account.

= How can I donate? =

= Still not convinced? =
You are still not convinced that donations to our project  will be any good? Then please have a look at how YAM has evolved since  its opensource release. We did a tremendous progress in bringing YAM up  to a level where it is compareable to other modern clients like  Thunderbird and KMail.

So if you share the vision of having a  modern, uptodate E-Mail client for your Amiga, then please help us in helping you!
