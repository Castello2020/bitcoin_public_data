It's basically a hybrid pyramid scheme and lottery with the winner selling at- or near the bubble peak.

Bitcoin is a joke. Anonymous digits are not trustworthy as currency. Crypto-currencies invite criminality online and don't work in the real economy. http://alfidicapitalblog.blogspot.com/2013/12/the-serious-disadvantages-...

So the economy has not already been ruined by buffoons w/ the capricious and stupidly designed "Derivatives" which the FED and the SEC still allow? In 08 everyone in the stock market took a bath, after having seen the FED and its minions fritter our capital away on Derivatives, losing $3T and using the Mortgage bubble as a "Red Herring" to evade any accountability! Never mind that the FED has thoroughly monetized the dollar w/ over $6T of monopoly money? Where is the trustworthiness in that?

How to buy Cryptographic currencies like Bitcoin, Litecoins and many of the alternatives that trade on exchanges is explained at www.crypto-coins.org
They do a good job explaining why Bitcoin is valuable and how to obtain through reputable websites.
Have fun and Good Luck!

I doubt anyone would use their time to read this but if anyone is, thank you. The point of this post is to ask for bitcoin donations. I had 10 btc a year back when one only cost $13 & now i'm sitting here regretting the fact that i no longer have any idea where they are. Spent most of them back then on the "deepweb", which i ended up being scammed. If anyone is selfless enough to donate as small as a btc or less i'd really appreciate it. Currently trying to make a couple btc's in hope to buy a Bitcoin Miner, unlike most people nowadays, i'm really mining for the fun of it and spreading the word about bitcoin. I love seeing high number of hashing ( Ghash/s ) hence i need a mining device. Please help, & we will keep on spreading the excitement of bitcoin ! And trade without the pain of banking fees.

Story time!!! Many, many years ago ancient kings utilized a shiny yellow metal for the purpose of decorating stuff. Why, you ask. Probably because it was shiny and yellow (like the sun). Fast forward many, many years and shiny yellow metal is replaced with coins and paper money. But wait a minute why is gold still valuable if it's no longer used as a form of currency. Oh right, because its shiny and yellow. But what happens to old old quarters and 20 dollar bills once their use as a currency is no longer required or allowed. That's right, they're scrapped and recycled because their raw material value is nil in comparison to the value placed upon them by the issuing countries economic performance. A Bit Coin has no raw value and the only value it has is a result of it's use as a currency. The fact that the "Mining Process" exists does nothing but assume that it will remain valuable and require production control to protect against inflation. Problem being its value is based on utility in an emerging industry. What happens when competition enters the market place and a bit coins utility is no longer as valuable. Will each virtual currency have it's own exchange? Far more importantly, while the open source nature of the platform is attractive now. What happens when the big boys bite back. This could very well be the first step towards the privatization of currency. Which begs the question, whats the point in the whole "Mining" process when really at the end of the day the value is entirely service based the minute that first competitor enters the market place. Might as well skip the whole song and dance and start issuing stock certificates as currency. Can you imagine the pandemonium "imoney" will cause!!

When you say a 256-bit number, I think you meant to say that it can be a number between 0 and 2^256, not 0 and 2256 (you're missing the exponentiation operator). An algorithm that returns a digest this small would be useless!

It looks like there is a future for alternative currencies. I have created a neighbourhood skills-share and bartering platform in the UK where peer-to-peer trades are supported by an alternative currency (a Fava) - see http://www.favabank.co.uk
There may be a future role for different types of currencies to be used for different of functions. It might be normal to use one currency for a store of value, and another for neighbourly transactions or a 'sharing economy'.
People will continue to come up with their own innovations while governments lack the imagination, or the will, to rethink the basis on which fiat money is administered...

For whatever rationale that Milton Friedman desired the abolition of the Federal Reserve, he sure got that the crux of the matter right. If the Fed Reserve had been done away with, the world & America would have benefited enormously & we would not have witnessed or suffered from the global meltdown of 2008 or its crushing fall-out.
The only ones who would suffer from this would be the psycopathic & predatory cartels, cabals, conglomerates & big corps, whiose handmaiden the Fed Reserve truly is.

Bitcoins are an intangible present good, they are not a claim nor anyone else´s liability. They are a present economic good just as software or an mp3 file is, but is inherently designed to be scarce.
Bitcoins were specifically designed to serve as medium of exchange, and there are a lot of economists (mainly from the austrian school of economics) that reject bitcoins as money because they don´t have any non monetary value.
Here I write a short post explaining why the non-monetary utility of Bitcoins (or any other currency) is not relevant:

From the SMH (http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/secret-money-abc-virtua...):
"The biggest exchange for buying and selling Bitcoins, MtGox, was also hacked, exposing all users' email addresses and passwords. This sent the value of Bitcoins on MtGox plummeting from more than $US17 to $US0.01."
How's that 'inflation-proof' currency working out for all involved?

BitCoin has so many flaws it's hard to believe it has received so much attention. It's an interesting thought experiment, but it is not a workable currency. For example:
1. It takes a real world commodity (electricity and computer time) and converts it into something which has value only in the minds of BitCoin participants. The same is of course true of minting currency, but the overhead is much less. I've heard this idea described as making something, burning it, and then trading the ash.
2. It heavily favours early adopters. Essentially it is equivalent to saying "I've created a new currency; my friends and I already own the bulk of it: wanna join?"
3. No central authority means no backing. If the Bank of England suddenly refuses to accept Stirling, there massive consequences. If the BitCoin network switches off, users are left with nothing (apart from an electricity bill). 4. It's deflationary...

After Techcrunch reported today that a hacker from Hong Kong hacked Mt. Gov, the Bitcoin took a dent. Is it bad news? At least Bitcoin resembles realworld money. For Dutch readers, more to read on BitCoin at http://onthypen.nl

Interesting article.
I do have one question however, since the software is open source, what happens if I download a different version than everyone else is using. Say for example my version of the software grants me 1 million Bitcoins rather than 50. Obviously this would be a far too easy way for users to cheat the system, so what does the community do to prevent this. Also, if I stay with the original software but most other users switch to a new version, am i not able to use the Bitcoins that I already own in a transaction with a different version of the software?

Indeed quite an interesting idea and it has a potential to undermine a powerful instrument through which nation states exercise national sovereignty. The design of the system is such that it can be killed if a government controls more than half of the network's total number-crunching capacity. I see that as a serious threat to the system. Although US government may have the capacity to mobilize such computing power, it might lack the willingness to do it. But the same cannot be said about the Chinese government. One way that the regime there centralizes power is through its control of the exchange rate. What if too many Chinese start accumulating bitcoins by selling services to the outside world and not using the Yuan?

Meanwhile China's online gaming community trades US$2 billion in virtual currency as of 2008, while current estimates peg it at a US$10 billion a year industry today. This is a great article, but it seems to be focusing on pretty-colored gnats while ignoring the elephant in the room.
