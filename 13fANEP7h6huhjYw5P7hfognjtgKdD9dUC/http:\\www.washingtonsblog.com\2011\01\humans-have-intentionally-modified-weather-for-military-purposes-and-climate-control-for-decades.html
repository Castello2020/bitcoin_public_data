<p>Weather modification is a well-known endeavor.  For example, governments have been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_seeding">seeding clouds</a> for decades to create more rain.</p>
<p>And during warfare to create mud to slow the enemy&#8217;s ability to use roads.</p>
<p>As the Guardian <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2001/sep/24/weather.climatechange">reported</a> in 2001:</p>
<blockquote><p>During the Vietnam war, the Americans launched Project Popeye, a  secret mission to seed the tops of monsoon clouds and trigger phenomenal  downpours that would wash away the Ho Chi Minh Trail used for ferrying  supplies.
<p>For five years Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos were sprayed  during the monsoons, and military intelligence claimed that rainfall  was increased by a third in some places. It only came to an end in March  1971 when [Washington Post] journalist Jack Anderson exposed the project and caused such a  public furor that the UN general assembly approved a universal treaty  banning environmental warfare.   </p>
<p>But the US air force planners  recently came up with new proposals to launch new weather weapons.  Instead of silver-iodide, the idea is to shower fine particles of  heat-absorbing carbon over clouds to trigger localised flooding and bog  down troops and their equipment. Lasers on aircraft would also trigger  lightning onto enemy aircraft, whilst other lasers could be fired at fog  to clear a path over enemy targets on the ground.  </p>
<p>Whether or  not they work, past experiences tell us to be wary of tampering with the  weather. In 1947, meteorologists tried to kill off a dying hurricane  out at sea by seeding the clouds. The following day, the hurricane  suddenly gathered strength, swung round and hit Savannah, Georgia  causing extensive damage. The weather boffins were so rattled by the  disaster it was not until August 1969 that they dared try again.  </p>
<p>When  Hurricane Debbie was 700 miles out at sea, they flew three seeding  missions around its eye, where tropical storms are at their most  intense, but the results were mixed &#8211; with each seeding the hurricane&#8217;s  winds were reduced and each time they picked up again.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, U.S. weather modification efforts during the Vietnam war were revealed as part of the Pentagon Papers.</p>
<p>As the Washington Post <span style="line-height:1.3em;"><a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/99678438.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Jul+2%2C+1972&amp;author=By+Victor+CohnWashington+Post+Staff+Writer&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post%2C+Times+Herald+%281959-1973%29&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=C1&amp;desc=Weather+War%3A+A+Gathering+Storm">reported</a></span> on July 2, 1972:<br />
<blockquote>Indochina &#8211; by the evidence of a long-ignored passage in the Pentagon Papers &#8211; has been a test battleground, the site of purposeful rain-making along the Ho Chi Minh trails.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.) is prominent among members of Congress who believe it has become a reality.  &#8220;There is very little doubt in my mind,&#8221; he says.  Rep. Gilbert Gude (R-Md.) states: &#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that it&#8217;s going on in Vietnam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s no doubt rain-making was used in Laos on the trail,&#8221; says a Senate committee aide wee versed in defense affairs.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It is a &#8220;successful&#8221; pre-1967 use which is documented in the &#8220;senator Gravel&#8221; version of the Pentagon papers.  In late February, 1967, this document discloses the Joint Chiefs of Staff prepared a list of &#8220;alternative strategies&#8221; for President Johnson.</p>
<p>One, titled &#8220;Laos Operations&#8221;,  read:</p>
<p>&#8220;Continue at present plus Operation Pop Eye to reduce trafficability along infiltration routes &#8230; authorization required to implement phase of <span style="font-style:italic;">weather modification process previously successfully tested and evaluated in same area</span>.  (Italics added)</p>
<p>In 1967 &#8212; according to columnist Jack Anderson, who published the first allegation of Indochina rain-making &#8212; U.S. forces started secret Project Intermediary Compatriot &#8220;to hamper enemy logistics&#8221; &#8230; (with) claimed success in creating man-made cloudbursts &#8230; and flooding conditions&#8221; along the Ho Chi Minh trails, &#8220;making them impassable.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Post makes clear that cloud-seeding wasn&#8217;t limited to the Vietnam war theater:<br />
<blockquote>The Defense Department freely reports that it has &#8220;field capacities&#8221; for  making rain. It used them in the Philippines in 1969, in a six-month  &#8220;precipitation augmentation project&#8221; at the Philippines request; in  India in 1967, at a similar invitation; over Okinawa and Midway Islands,  and in June, July and August, 1971, over drought-stricken Texas, at the  urgent request of Gov. Preston Smith.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Navy rain-makers are currently involved in two long-range California programs &#8212; one over the Pacific off Santa Barbara, an attempt to increase rainfall over a national forest; the other over the Central Sierras to try to increase the snow-pack for electric utilities that depend on water power.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2008, the Denver Post <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_9019726">noted</a> the enormous scope of weather modification projects:<br />
<blockquote>Scientists are monitoring more than 150 weather-modification projects in 40 countries, including at least 60 in the Western United States. The projects include wringing additional snow out of clouds for California hydropower and easing droughts in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>Most of the current research on this inexact science is being conducted abroad &#8230;.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2005, the Boston Globe <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2005/07/03/dont_like_the_weather_change_it/">provided</a> an account of the early discovery of silver iodide as a tool for modifying weather:<br />
<blockquote> In  1946, over Mount Greylock in western Massachusetts, a General  Electric   research chemist named Vincent Schaefer scattered three  pounds of  crushed dry  ice out of an airplane into a cloud and set off a  snow  flurry. It was the  world&#8217;s first successful cloud seeding-later  that  year, the meteorologist  Bernard Vonnegut (brother to the novelist)   discovered that silver iodide smoke  had a similar effect-and weather   modification emerged from the realm of con  men and eccentrics. Most   meteorologists remained skeptical, but by 1951, 10  percent of the   United States was under commercial cloud seeding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Intervention   in  atmospheric and climatic matters on any desired scale&#8221; was only  decades   away, predicted John von Neumann, the mathematician who helped  invent  and  began programming the first electronic computers to model  the  weather.    Over the next 30 years, the federal government spent   hundreds of millions  of dollars on projects all over the country to   increase precipitation, to  mitigate hailstorms (an age-old enemy of   farmers), and, most successfully, to  clear the fog from around   airports. Perhaps the era&#8217;s most ambitious endeavor  was Project   Stormfury, which sent up airplanes to seed the eye walls of  hurricanes   with silver iodide to weaken the winds before landfall.</p></blockquote>
<p>(And see <a href="http://alum.mit.edu/news/WhatMatters/Archive/200906/">this discussion</a> by an MIT scientist regarding the use of weather modification to mitigate hurricane damage.)</p>
<p>Moreover, the Post points out that &#8211; even in 1972 &#8211; weather modification has been tested for other applications as well:<br />
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Among patterns that can be predictably&#8221; be modified [Robert M. White,  the current chief of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  ] said, are: cold fog (which can be cleared from airfields) ; cumulus  clouds (most common in the tropics &#8212; &#8220;In Florida,&#8221;, White said, &#8220;we  have been able almost at will to make them grow explosively&#8221;);  orographic clouds (moist air moving up over mountains &#8212; &#8220;At the right  temperature you can begin thinking of milking them for water&#8221;) and  hailstorms (which can often be suppressed, according to recent claims by  the Russians, who fire silver iodide into them from rockets and  artillery).</div>
</blockquote>
<p>And &#8211; as the Post notes &#8211; even in 1972, the government was studying the affect of weather modification on climate:<br />
<blockquote>ARPA Director Stephen J. Lukasik told the Senate Appropriations Committee in March: &#8220;Since it now appears highly probable that major world powers have the ability to create modifications of climate that might be seriously detrimental to the security of this country, Nile Blue [a computer simulation] was established in FY 70 to achieve a US capability to (1) evaluate all consequences of of a variety of possible actions &#8230; (2) detect trends in in the global circulation which foretell changes &#8230; and (3) determine if possible , means to counter potentially deleterious climatic changes &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What this means,&#8221; Lukasik explains, &#8220;is learning how much you have to tickle the atmosphere to perturb the earth&#8217;s climate.  I guess we&#8217;d call it a threat assessment.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Post also quoted high-level scientists warning that enemies could modify weather as a direct form of warfare, for example, by flooding coastal areas where one&#8217;s enemy resided.</p>
<p>Now, weather modification is so mainstream that <span style="line-height:1.3em;">the <a href="http://wn.com/Chinese_Government_Creates_First_Snowstorm_with_Silver_Iodide_CloudSeeding%21">Chinese government</a> and the  </span><a href="http://www.license.state.tx.us/weather/summary.htm"><span style="line-height:1.3em;">State of Texas</span></a><span style="line-height:1.3em;"> openly discuss their cloud-seeding programs.</span><span style="line-height:1.3em;"></p>
<p>And U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas </span><span style="line-height:1.3em;"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050825052613/http://hutchison.senate.gov/speec379.htm">introduced</a></span><span style="line-height:1.3em;"> </span><span style="line-height:1.3em;">the Weather Modification Research And Technology Transfer Authorization  Act in 2004, saying:<br />
<blockquote>Weather    modification is the general term that refers to any human attempt to    alter the weather&#8230;.  These efforts have been used in the U.S.  for   more than 50 years to reduce crop and property damage, optimize  useable   precipitation during growing seasons and lessen the impact of    periodic, often severe droughts.</p>
<p>The weather modification    projects in Texas and other States in the U.S. are much more than well    considered responses to drought. They are trying to use the latest    technological developments in the science to chemically squeeze more    precipitation out of clouds. Moisture that is needed to replenish    fresh-water supplies in aquifers and reservoirs.</p></blockquote>
<p></span><span style="line-height:1.3em;">(The bill apparently didn&#8217;t pass)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s even a <a href="http://www.weathermodification.org/journal.htm">Journal of Weather Modification</a> (here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.weathermodification.org/downloads/22-INDEXALL_1to36_2005.pdf">peek inside</a>).</span></p>
<p><u>The Technology Has Advanced Far Beyond Seeding Clouds With Silver Iodide</u></p>
<p>The technology has advanced a long way since the early 1970s.</p>
<p>For example, the Telegraph <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/unitedarabemirates/8236350/Abu-Dhabi-weather-project-creates-man-made-rainstorms.html">reported</a> yesterday that Abu Dhabi &#8216;creates man-made rainstorms&#8217; by  &#8220;using giant ionisers, shaped like giant lampshades, to generate    fields of negatively charged particles, which create cloud formation.&#8221;   &#8220;There are many applications,&#8221; Professor Hartmut Grassl, a former institute director, is <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1343470/Have-scientists-discovered-create-downpours-desert.html" target="_hplink">quoted </a>by the<em> Daily Mail</em> as saying. &#8220;One is getting water into a dry area. Maybe this is a most important point for mankind.&#8221;</p>
<p>And former <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cohen">secretary of defense</a> William Cohen <a href="http://www.fas.org/news/usa/1997/04/bmd970429d.htm">told</a> a conference on terrorism on April 28, 1997 that people can:<br />
<blockquote>Alter the climate &#8230; remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves.</p></blockquote>
<p><u>The Use of Sulfur Dioxide to Affect Climate</u>?</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.3em;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Wigley">Tom Wigley</a>  &#8211;  </span><span style="line-height:1.3em;">senior scientist at the  National Center for  Atmospheric Research and </span><span style="line-height:1.3em;">former director of the Climatic Research Unit at the University of  East Anglia and current &#8211; has <a href="http://www.ucar.edu/news/releases/2006/injections.shtml">proposed</a> releasing sulfur dioxide in the upper atmosphere to reflect sunlight and reduce warming.  And see <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/314/5798/452">this</a>.</p>

<p></span><u>More History &#8230; and Complicated Issues to Consider for the Future</u></p>
<p>The above-described Boston Globe article pointed to the complexity of the issues involved in weather modification:<br />
<blockquote>In 2003 the National Academy of Sciences recommended  &#8220;a  coordinated  national program&#8221; to &#8220;conduct a sustained research effort&#8221;  into   weather modification.</p>
<p>Politicians in Western and Southwestern  states are  funding attempts to tickle more moisture out of the clouds &#8230;.</p>
<p>Last  fall, a meteorologist named Ross Hoffman suggested in  Scientific   American that a network of microwave-beaming satellites  could literally  take  the wind out of hurricanes.</p>
<p>In some of the driest  parts  of Mexico, a  Bedford-based company called Ionogenics is testing a   rainmaking apparatus that  uses an array of steel poles to ionize the   air.</p>
<p>China, a country with  widespread cloud seeding, has  announced  plans to engineer clear weather in  Beijing for the 2008  Olympics.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, deepening concern over the possibly  cataclysmic effects of   climate change has spurred a number of recent  proposals, some sketched  out in  considerable detail, to engineer a  measure of counteractive  cooling. John  Latham, an atmospheric  physicist at the National Center  for Atmospheric  Research in Boulder,  Colo., has proposed increasing the  reflectivity of the  cloud cover by  stirring up water vapor from the  ocean with a fleet of giant   egg-beater-like turbines.</p>
<p>A few years ago, a  team led by the  late Edward  Teller suggested creating a similar effect  by launching a  million tons of tiny  aluminum balloons into the  atmosphere.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As  our ability to comprehend the weather improves and as  the threat of   climate change looms larger, some scientists are ready to  brave the   uncertainty and tangled ethics of tinkering with the skies. .  . .</p>
<p>The  US  military, unsurprisingly, was intrigued by the possibility of a   godlike  meteorological arsenal. According to Spencer Weart, a physicist  and   historian of science at the American Institute of Physics, the  thinking  in the  Defense Department was &#8220;maybe we&#8217;ll give the Russians a  real  Cold War, or  maybe they&#8217;ll give us one, so we should be ready.&#8221;   Pentagon money funded much  of the era&#8217;s climate research, helping to   create the weather models we now use  in forecasting. War gamers dreamed   up climatological warfare scenarios like  laying down a blanket of fog   over an airfield or visiting drought upon an  enemy&#8217;s breadbasket.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>But  the grandest climate  engineering schemes came from the Soviet Union.  The most Promethean  among them was a late 1950s proposal to dam the  Bering  Strait and, by  pumping water from the Arctic Ocean into the  Pacific, draw warm  water  northward from the Atlantic to melt the polar  ice pack, making the   Arctic Ocean navigable and warming Siberia. The  leading Soviet  climatologist,  Mikhail I. Budyko, cautioned against it,  arguing that  the ultimate effects  were too difficult to predict  (though he himself  had played with the idea of  warming the Arctic by  covering it in soot  to decrease its reflectivity). John  F. Kennedy, as  a presidential  candidate, suggested the United States look into   collaborating on the  project. While the two countries continued  desultory discussions of the  Bering  Strait plan into the 1970s, the  American government was by then  losing  interest in the whole field of  weather modification.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In  1972, a government  cloud-seeding run in South Dakota was followed  by a violent  deluge,  and more than 200 people were killed in the  ensuing flood.   Meteorologists disagreed over whether seeding was to  blame, but the  incident  became an ominous symbol for those who saw  weather modifiers  as latter-day  Pandoras. . . .    Boyle&#8217;s caution may  be merited, but  scientists are better equipped today to  understand and  manipulate the  weather than they were 30 years ago.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Some  scientists and engineers, such as Daniel Schrag, director of  Harvard&#8217;s   Laboratory for Geochemical Oceanography, point out that, in  light of the   planet&#8217;s growing thirst and rising temperature, even  Soviet-scale  climate  modification is attracting real consideration.  Boyle, who spoke  at a joint  MIT-Cambridge University conference on the  topic last year,  readily concedes,  &#8220;There are very prominent, serious  scientists who  are considering these  things.&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A 1996 Air Force report   entitled &#8220;Weather as a Force Multiplier:  Owning the Weather in 2025,&#8221;  argued  that &#8220;the tremendous military  capabilities that could result  from this field  are ignored at our own  peril.&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Even purely peaceful  aims would lead to a cascade of seemingly zero-sum   conflicts. In the  US, cloud seeding has set off several lawsuits in  which, for  example,  downwind farmers have accused a cloud-seeding  neighbor of &#8220;stealing&#8221;   their rain. Such issues only grow in complexity  along with the scale.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>According to Joe  Kaplinsky, a technology analyst in London,  &#8220;To  raise these things  before the technology has really gotten off the  ground is  to deprive us  of the potential benefits of any technology,  because any  technology  can be misused.&#8221;    &#8220;Of course some people will  benefit and some people  will lose,&#8221; Kaplinsky  says, &#8220;but there are  social mechanisms for  solving disagreements, either  through  compensation or through  democratic debate.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height:1.3em;"><a href="http://csat.au.af.mil/2025/volume3/vol3ch15.pdf">Here is</a>  a copy of the Air Force study &#8220;Weather as a Force Multiplier: Owning the Weather in 2025&#8243;.</span></p>
<p>The American Institute of Physics &#8211; the organization mentioned in the Boston Globe article &#8211;   <a href="http://www.aip.org/history/climate/RainMake.htm">provides</a> an interesting overview of the history of weather modification:
<p align="justify"></p>
<blockquote><p align="justify">From 1945 into the 1970s, much  effort went into studies of weather modification. American entrepreneurs  tried cloud-seeding to enhance local rainfall, Russian scientists  offered fabulous schemes of planetary engineering, and military agencies  secretly explored &#8220;climatological warfare.&#8221; </p>
<p align="justify">***</p>
<p align="justify">In the mid 1970s &#8230; Research turned instead to controversial &#8220;geoengineering&#8221;  schemes for interventions that might restrain global warming if it  started to become unbearable. </p>
<p>  ***
<p align="justify">At the close of the Second World War, a few American  scientists brought up a troublesome idea. If it were true, as some  claimed, that humans were inadvertently changing their local weather by  cutting down forests and emitting pollution, why not try to modify the  weather on purpose? For generations there had been proposals for  rainmaking, based on folklore like the story that cannonades from big  battles brought rain. </p>
<p align="justify">Now top experts began to take the question seriously&#8230;. At the end of 1945 a brilliant  mathematician, John von Neumann, called other leading scientists to a  meeting in Princeton, where they agreed that modifying weather  deliberately might be possible. They expected that could make a great  difference in the next war. Soviet harvests, for example, might be  ruined by creating a drought. Some scientists suspected that alongside  the race with the Soviet Union for ever more terrible nuclear weapons,  they were entering an equally fateful race to control the weather. As the Cold War got underway, U.S. military agencies devoted  significant funds to research on what came to be called &#8220;climatological  warfare.&#8221; </p>
<p align="justify">***</p>
<p> In  1953 a President&#8217;s Advisory Committee on Weather Control was established  to pursue the idea. In 1958, the U.S. Congress acted directly to fund  expanded rainmaking research. Large-scale experimentation was also  underway, less openly, in the Soviet Union.
<p align="justify">Military agencies in the U.S. (and presumably in the  Soviet Union) supported research not only on cloud seeding but on other  ways that injecting materials into the atmosphere might alter weather.  Although much of this was buried in secrecy, the public learned that  climatological warfare might become possible. In a 1955 Fortune magazine  article, von Neumann himself explained that &#8220;Microscopic layers of  colored matter spread on an icy surface, or in the atmosphere above one,  could inhibit the reflection-radiation process, melt the ice, and  change the local climate.&#8221; The effects could be far-reaching, even  world-wide. &#8220;What power over our environment, over all nature, is  implied!&#8221; he exclaimed. Von Neumann foresaw &#8220;forms of climatic warfare  as yet unimagined,&#8221; perhaps more dangerous than nuclear war itself. He  hoped it would force humanity to take a new, global approach to its  political problems. </p>
<p align="justify">***</p>
<p align="justify">Around 1956, Soviet engineers began to speculate that they  might be able to throw a dam across the Bering Strait and pump water  from the Arctic Ocean into the Pacific. This would draw warm water up  from the Atlantic. Their aim was to eliminate the ice pack, make the  Arctic Ocean navigable, and warm up Siberia. The idea attracted some  notice in the United States — presidential candidate John F. Kennedy  remarked that the idea was worth exploring as a joint project with the  Soviets, and the discussion continued into the 1970s.</p>
<p align="justify">***</p>
<p align="justify">Beginning around 1961, Budyko and other  scientists speculated about how humanity might alter the global climate  by strewing dark dust or soot across the Arctic snow and ice. The soot  would lower the albedo (reflection of sunlight), and the air would get  warmer. Spreading so much dust year after year would be prohibitively  expensive. But according to a well-known theory, warmer air should melt  some snow and sea-ice and thus expose the dark underlying soil and  ocean water, which would absorb sunlight and bring on more warming. So  once dust destroyed the reflective cover, it might not re-form.  </p>
<p align="justify">***</p>
<p align="justify">A 1972 U.S. government  rain-making operation in South Dakota was followed by a disastrous  flood, and came under attack in a class-action lawsuit.</p>
<p align="justify">***</p>
<p align="justify">Already  back in 1965, a Presidential advisory panel had suggested that if  greenhouse effect warming by carbon dioxide gas ever became a problem,  the government might take countervailing steps. The panel did not  consider curbing the use of fossil fuels. They had in mind  geoengineering schemes — spreading something across the ocean waters to  reflect more sunlight, perhaps, or sowing particles high in the  atmosphere to encourage the formation of reflective clouds. Some  back-of-the-envelope arithmetic suggested such steps were feasible, and  indeed could cost less than many government programs. In 1974,  Budyko calculated that if global warming ever became a serious threat,  we could counter it with just a few airplane flights a day in the  stratosphere, burning sulfur to make aerosols that would reflect  sunlight away.  </p>
<p align="justify">For a few years in the early 1970s, new evidence and  arguments led many scientists to suspect that the greatest climate risk  was not warming, but cooling. A new ice age seemed to be approaching as  part of the natural glacial cycle, perhaps hastened by human pollution  that blocked sunlight. Technological optimists suggested ways to counter  this threat too. We might spread soot from cargo aircraft to darken the  Arctic snows, or even shatter the Arctic ice pack with &#8220;clean&#8221;  thermonuclear explosions. [For background, see <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/12/scientists-considered-pouring-soot-over.html">this</a> and <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/12/obamas-current-science-advisor-warned.html">this</a>.] </p>
<p align="justify">***</p>
<p align="justify"> The bitter fighting among communities over cloud-seeding  would be as nothing compared with conflicts over attempts to engineer  global climate. Moreover, as Budyko and Western scientists alike warned,  scientists could not predict the consequences of such engineering  efforts. We might forestall global warming only to find we had triggered  a new ice age. </p>
<p align="justify">Such worries revived the U.S. military&#8217;s interest in  artificial climate change on a global scale. A group at the RAND  corporation, a defense think tank near Los Angeles, had been working  with a computer climate model that originated at the University of  California, Los Angeles.</p>
<p align="justify">***</p>
<p align="justify">The RAND group had to scramble to find support  elsewhere. They turned to the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the  Department of Defense.</p>
<p align="justify">***</p>
<p align="justify">When a National Academy of Sciences  panel convened in 1991 to catalog the options, the members got into a  long and serious debate over whether to include the grand  &#8220;geoengineering&#8221; ideas. Might hopes of a future fix just encourage  people to avoid the work of restricting greenhouse gas emissions? The  panel reluctantly voted to include every idea, so that preparations  could start in case the climate deteriorated so badly that radical steps  would be the lesser evil. Their fundamental problem was the one that  had bedeviled climate science from the start — if you pushed on this  intricate system, nobody could say for sure what the final consequences  might be.</p>

<p> <u>What About Contrails?</u></p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency <a href="http://www.epa.gov/oms/regs/nonroad/aviation/contrails.pdf">notes</a> in a report entitled &#8220;Aircraft Contrails Factsheet&#8221;:<br />
<blockquote>Persistent contrails can last for hours while growing to several kilometers in width and 200 to 400 meters in height.</p>

<p>Persistent contrails are of interest to scientists because they increase the cloudiness of the atmosphere. The increase happens in two ways. First, persistent contrails are line-shaped clouds that would not have formed in the atmosphere without the passage of an aircraft. Secondly, <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">persistent contrails often evolve and spread into extensive cirrus cloud cover that is indistinguishable from naturally occurring cloudiness </span>(See Figure 3). At present, it is unknown how much of this more extensive cloudiness would have occurred without the passage of an aircraft. Not enough is known about how natural clouds form in the atmosphere to answer this question. Changes in cloudiness are important because clouds help control the temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere. Changes in cloudiness resulting from human activities are important because they might contribute to long-term changes in the Earth’s climate. Many other human activities also have the potential of contributing to climate change. Our climate involves important parameters such as air temperature, weather patterns, and rainfall. Changes in climate may have important impacts on natural resources and human health. Contrails’ possible climate effects are one component of aviation’s expected overall climate effect.</p>

<p>Persistent line-shaped contrails are estimated to cover, on average, about 0.1 percent of the Earth’s surface &#8230;.</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="line-height:1.3em;">And CNN <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2002-08-07/tech/contrails.climate_1_contrails-cirrus-clouds-david-travis?_s=PM:TECH">reported</a> in 2002:<br /></span>
</p>
<blockquote><p>The thin wisps of condensation that trail jet airliners have a  <span style="font-weight:bold;">significant influence on the climate</span>, according to scientists who  studied U.S. skies during a rare interruption in national air traffic  after the September 11 terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>During the three-day  commercial flight hiatus, when the artificial clouds known as contrails  all but disappeared, the variations in high and low temperatures  increased by 1.1 degrees Celsius (<span style="font-weight:bold;">2 degrees Fahrenheit</span>) each day, said  meteorological researchers.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>&#8220;I think what we&#8217;ve shown are that contrails are capable of affecting  temperatures,&#8221; said lead scientist David Travis of the University of  Wisconsin, Whitewater. &#8220;Which direction, in terms of net heating or  cooling, is still up in the air.&#8221;</p>
<p>In many ways, contrails behave  in the same manner as cirrus clouds, thin high-altitude floaters that  block out solar energy from above and trap in heat below.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>With air traffic growing and contrails becoming more prevalent, the  natural variation will further decline and could disrupt regional  ecosystems, some scientists speculate.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In  some ways, contrails differ from their natural brethren. Cirrus clouds  let less heat out than in overall, producing a net increase in the  Earth&#8217;s temperatures, according to climate scientists. With contrail  clouds, they said they are not so sure.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold;">Contrails are denser and  block sunlight much more than natural cirrus clouds</span>,&#8221; said Travis, who  with colleagues reported the findings this week in the journal Nature.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold;">And  contrails are much more prevalent when the sun is out</span>,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When  this is factored in, there is a possibility that they offset global  warming, and this is what we are trying to determine now.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height:1.3em;">It is clear that persistent jet contrails can affect weather and climate.  I have no idea whether persistent jet contrails are an unintentional affect of airplanes interacting with the environment, or an intentional attempt to affect the weather.</p>
<p>The articles quoted in the first part of this essay provide support for the possibility that at least some of the affects might be intentional.   And as </span>a 2008 international workshop on weather modification <span style="line-height:1.3em;"><a href="http://www.weathermod.org/international_workshop.htm">noted</a>:<br /></span><br />
<blockquote>It has been well established that successful implementation of Cloud  Seeding resulting in precipitation enhancement has significant positive  beneficial impact in managing the issue of global warming and climate  change&#8230;.</p></blockquote>
<p>German television network <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTL_Television">RTL</a> purportedly <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiUMfsR28SM&amp;feature=player_embedded">alleges</a>  that the German government has admitted testing persistent jet  contrails for military purposes &#8211; as a high-tech form of &#8220;chaff&#8221; to  disrupt enemy radar.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.3em;">The EPA attributes formation of persistent  jet contrails to altitude and humidity, as well as trace impurities  such as sulfur contained in jet fuel.  </span>On the other hand, some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okB-489l6MI&amp;feature=player_embedded">claim</a> that very high concentrations of chemicals like barium and sulfur have  been found in groundwater after the incidence of persistent jet  contrails increased.</p>
<p>But whether or not persistent jet contrails are intentionally being created to affect climate or for military purposes or are an unintentional byproduct of flying a modern airplane is beyond the scope of this essay.
