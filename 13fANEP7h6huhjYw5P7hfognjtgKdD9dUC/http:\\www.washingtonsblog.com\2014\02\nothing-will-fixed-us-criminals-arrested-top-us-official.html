<p>No, there are too many links.  It must be Carl Herman with another plea for tax increases and another serial spew concerning casting the 1% out of the temple of his socialist God, the most good for the most people, Utilitarianism as it was invented by John Stuart Mill and Jeremy Bentham in the Nineteenth Century.  Utilitarianism didn&#8217;t really catch on because people are inherently greedy, not cooperative, but it&#8217;s been a favorite of street corner proselytizing nut-cases for a hundred years.</p>
<p>Carl Herman is laboring under the obsessive compulsion delusion, that he was sent to earth like a messiah of sorts, a role he relishes, to wake the sleeping masses and spawn a socialist revolution that will elevate his fellow fruitcake freedom fighters, a handful of wack-job public banking clowns that advocate giving money-printing presses for every government agency to fund a new Utilitarian Utopia called Hyperinflationville.  The most people need more money!  So, they want to print it!</p>
<p>Here Carl again quotes his favorite &#8220;top US official&#8221;, none other than the too often flailing, Paul Craig Roberts, the one-time Assistant Secretary of the US Treasury for -one year- under President Ronald Reagan more than thirty years ago in the early Eighties.  Roberts didn&#8217;t last very long in public service under Reagan, because he was seen as being just a bit too fringe, emotionally unstable and prone to proselytizing like&#8230;  The other nut-job Carl Herman most apt to quote, Ellen Brown?</p>
<p>Carl, I think if you put Paul Craig Roberts in a room with Ellen Brown, there would be virtually no agreement, and likely a wild, hair-pulling cat-fight that would scare enough people and create such a confusion, people would die in the rushing to get away.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry, Carl Herman.  Quoting Paul Craig Roberts, headlined in this article as a &#8220;top US Official&#8221; is simply nothing other than another one of your stinking lies.</p>

<p>“people are inherently greedy, not cooperative”</p>
<p>Really? Because you feel inherently greedy, are you threatened by the prospect of cooperation on these article topics so you attack them? And when you’re in a grocery store or wherever, you really see people who don’t want cooperation in basic areas like preventing war-murders, bank looting, and media complicit liars to allow them?</p>
<p>How about this instead: stand for cooperative competition. Do you really want to attack those of us working for justice in basic areas of cooperation?</p>

Cooperators endorse gun control that would disarm them, and automobile insurance laws that require the poor people to pay for insurance in case they run into some rich guy&#8217;s Mercedes Benz.  I mean why should a rich guy have to carry insurance to cover his extravagant lifestyle choices as he cruises down the road in a snowstorm doing eighty in his Benz?</p>
<p>Cooperators are so stupid, the greedy people that urge them on, pass legislation to dismember them and devour their sweetbread brains out of their thick skulls.  In hospitals, the rich drink the blood of the poor for profit and then send them home with a prescription for dope that will keep them addiction slaves to the pharmaceutical industry for the rest of their lives&#8230;</p>
<p>Yes, the rich get richer.  They do so by urging on and instilling the cooperators with asinine beliefs, like the belief in global warming, and like the belief in clean safe nuclear energy, whether it comes from a  death-breathing GE fission machine, or a similarly polluting Thorium reactor infrastructure.</p>
<p>Those who stand for cooperation are liars and frauds.  They&#8217;re people like Carl who teaches school (along with a lot of pedophile perverts who expend great effort getting certified to get close to the kids) while advocating the overthrow the government because government is corrupt.  Carl is part and parcel of the corrupt government.</p>
<p>Does Carl ever come here and decry the travesty of education?  No.  Carl is a socialist.  Carl comes here to lie to every0one by telling them, Paul Craig Roberts is &#8220;top US official&#8221; when Roberts was a -one year- Assistance Secretary of the Treasury more than thirty years ago.  Like Obama, Carl wants to inflate away all wealth.  And Carl thinks your kids are his kids to do with as he pleases, mostly because you&#8217;re not fit to be a parent, though you&#8217;re certainly fit enough to take the blame for the decline in education nationwide. </p>
<p>You didn&#8217;t go to Harvard like teach-Carl&#8230;  What a fucking laugh.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, inflating away wealth doesn&#8217;t work, Carl.  The wealthy just get richer, because they are just as greedy as Carl, whose greedy plans haven&#8217;t been thought through far enough to realize they self-defeat his wealth redistribution plans.</p>
<p>Haven&#8217;t you noticed, Carl?  There are some very rich people in communist China now.  They got rich, and they will stay rich, because they are greedy.  They are not cooperative at all, not even in a communist country.</p>
<p>So you see, Carl, you cannot succeed in anything you attempt, except that you will succeed in making the rich that much richer by trying to inflate away wealth, and you will make them that much more greedy too.</p>
<p>You lied to everyone here again today, Carl.  Paul Craig Roberts is not a &#8220;high US official&#8221;.   He&#8217;s an estranged fruitcake blog writer, just like you and Ellen Brown.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-95167" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>You are just being silly, Carl.  How much difference does it make, if I think the wars are legal?  Jurisprudence isn&#8217;t democratic.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll tell you what, Carl.  It seems you have got a bunch of posters on your side.  They&#8217;re not eloquent people.  They&#8217;re not even clever people.  They&#8217;re just followers of yours on the blog, people willing to come to your side and diss the poster known as Tonto.  Some have gone so far as to say, that I&#8217;ve ruined the blog.  Okay, fine.</p>
<p>If that is what you want, just followers, then ask me to leave, and not come back.</p>
<p>And do it because you&#8217;re angry that I have called you out on naming Paul Craig Roberts to be a &#8220;top US official&#8221;.  I am calling you a liar, straight up.  I am further saying you tacitly lie every time you post an article by stretching everything that you write to mold to your sickening ideological bent, an ideological bent I think is not only dangerous, but incredibly selfish.</p>
<p>Paul Craig Roberts is not a top US official, and he never was.  And your argument based on your claim that Paul Craig Roberts is a top US official is nothing short of a fraud.</p>
<p>If I am disturbing what the purpose of GB blog is by calling you are a liar and an ideological scoundrel, when you are so obviously caught in the act of it, then ask me to leave.  I&#8217;m no follower.  In fact, I find exactly the same fault I find with you and your posts with a lot of online blogs.  They&#8217;re all full of crap and lies.  I take the time to post here, because of the feint pretense that what is going on here is about finding something of the truth of matters.  I know quite a bit about how truth is discovered.  And you, Carl Herman, are clearly not on the path of it.  You don&#8217;t even try to present the truth, Carl Herman.</p>
<p>So, if you want to protect your followers from what I have to say, then be man enough to ask me to leave and not come back, with no conditions.  I&#8217;ve said it before, and I&#8217;ll stick by it.  All you have to do is ask me to leave.</p>
<p>Otherwise, YOU owe everyone here an apology for lying to them about how Paul Craig Roberts is a top US official.  He is not, and he never was a top US official.  Roberts appointment as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury was almost immediately seen as a mistke by the Reagan Administration, and Roberts has been a fringe figure in US politics ever since.  He is not a top US official.  Paul Craig Roberts for the last thirty years has been a fringe political writer/blogger with no connection to the US government whatsoever.</p>
<p>Your choice, Carl.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll answer your question about the legality of the wars by saying, there is no legal framework for determining the legality of war outside the Hague, which is a corrupt institution with no rational sense of justice whatsoever.  There is no platform of jurisprudence anywhere on the planet that is not corrupt, and you know that.  People like you who twist the facts are completely aware of how reality works, and how nothing is just or unjust in a legal sense.  The law is a lever, only.  It&#8217;s all a fraud.  And everything takes a different meaning depending on who is applying for a sanctioned meaning, and when they are applying for some sanctioned meaning.</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t come back with some mealy-mouthed crap about how I sometimes contribute meaningfully to the blog.  You&#8217;ll not coach me, you socialist jackal.</p>
<p>Either apologize for the lie, or ask me to leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Top&#8221; is an opinion that nobody lies about because this is not in the domain of objective fact. Have your opinion, and then argue about opinions if you want. Education, that you seem to attack, has a central purpose to discern between opinion and objective fact. </p>
<p>You appear to enjoy character attacks more than addressing issues. Those serious about the issues will point out the distraction you are, because we live in a world of &#8220;leaders&#8221; using similar attacks that need to be distinguished. And yes, all of we professionals know we&#8217;d never tolerate your presence in a serious setting when you reject factual discussion to attack personalities and distract.</p>
<p>So, nah, tonto. I don&#8217;t apologize for an opinion describing Paul&#8217;s office as &#8220;top.&#8221; You are free to stay or go, that&#8217;s your choice.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-95136" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The one thing that i remember the most clearly over the<br />
past 40 years of my school days at Brandeis University in 1970&#8242;s are my<br />
student adviser&#8217;s words that when he was growing up that his grand<br />
parents and parents used the term &#8220;‘goyishe kup,’&#8221; meaning that the<br />
&#8220;Non-Jews are Stupid&#8221;<br />
Later in life I learned that the exact translation of &#8220;GOYISHE KUP&#8221; means that the &#8220;Cattle are STUPID&#8221;..<br />
I<br />
 remember him recalling what his father told him when he was growing up<br />
 in Eastern Europe. One of them being that when his father was in high<br />
school he and a group of friends would skip school early on Fridays and<br />
go over to his friend&#8217;s father&#8217;s butcher shop. That they would buy at<br />
cost any cows , that had not been butchered by the end of the day on<br />
Friday before the start of Shabat . They would take the cow home and<br />
wash it and then the boys would procede to &#8220;beat the udders of the cows<br />
so that they would swell up and turn pink&#8221; so as to sell them to the<br />
&#8220;GOYISHE KUP&#8221; as milk producing cows.<br />
The part that I remember<br />
him asking me if the East Europeans are so &#8220;naive, so gullible and so<br />
stupid&#8221; to buy an old &#8220;non milk producing cows&#8221; from a bunch of young Jewish<br />
 Boys.<br />
So re-thinking of it now I agree with the Jewish saying that<br />
the &#8220;GOYISHE KUP&#8221; are indeed&#8221; Stupid&#8221; as they believe that a Bunch of<br />
Arab Moslem Kids who were not able to Fly a Cessna Airplane took it upon<br />
 themselves to FLY a Jumbo 747 and outwitted the US Militaryand Civilian<br />
 authorities. The &#8220;Jewish Lightning Insurance Scam&#8221; of the 1960&#8242;s is<br />
still alive and well has been put to good use by Larry Silverstein in<br />
putting 15 million down and comming out with 7 billion dollars for<br />
buidings that no one wanted to buy because it would have cost a billion<br />
dollars to remove the asbestos from.  Then on top of that the people in<br />
America actually believe that they actually decide who is elected<br />
President or for that that actual VOTE is really counted and makes a<br />
difference in deciding who represents them in the White House and<br />
congress.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-95163" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Well, while I entirely agree that those who&#8217;ve been in office and have flouted the rule of law &#8211; including using Presidential autocracy to attack otherwise non-combatant nations &#8211; should be arrested and tried for treason, I don&#8217;t agree with the patently Marxist Apparatchik tone in Mr Herman&#8217;s post. It&#8217;s just as politically one-sided and egregious in its attitude and motivation, and is patently just as lacking in the rule of law in its clear incitement to use political power to harass and incarcerate those not adhering to a particular ideology. I was my office in the WTC on 9/11 from 8am, and no, the building wasn&#8217;t laced with demolition charges that people had been walking about avoiding bumping into in the days before the attack &#8211; despite what the loons would have you believe. So yes, I understand the reason troops went into Afghanistan looking for Osama after he announced that he&#8217;d done it. But, I wouldn&#8217;t have sent troops to Iraq even though Hussein admitted he went out of his way to make the world&#8217;s intelligence agencies believe he had horrific weapons because, as it proved to be, I thought it was a scare tactic to stop the Iranians attacking him first &#8211; he was a fool, because convincing us was what was required to convince the Iranians as well, only we weren&#8217;t afraid to take him on and after we kicked him out of Kuwait he should have realized that. Stupid, stupid, move, and infuriating that our leaders ran behind the smoke screen and took advantage of it. But what we&#8217;re all missing is far more serious, and its an indictment even more strongly leveled at the current administration : For thirty years our Presidents are increasingly acting like the late Consuls of Rome, coming dangerously close to those of Gaius Julius Caesar in their autocratic nullification of Congress. We are perhaps closer today to a President crossing The Rubicon, marching the army on the people, than at any time since Lincoln. Dysfunction in the House and Senate has its roots in the increasingly autocratic behavior of the long serving &#8211; and self serving &#8211; professional political incumbents, especially, as with Rome, those claiming to be Populares politicians. We lack Plebiscite capability to stop them, we lack Plebiscite capability to properly assert our will over those who pretend to represent us without listening to a word we say once the election is over, and we lack Plebiscite capability to properly enfranchise our true wishes. There was much to hate about the Confederacy, but there were several features of their constitution which are far superior to the dictatorial direction which this, the 2nd American Republic, has taken since the assertion of oligarchic industrialist control of Congress behind the screen of civil war: The elimination of gut-and-replace as an end-run around the prohibition of the Senate from pending money; the prohibition of non-germane amendments to bills; the requirement that a bill be only about its titular objective &#8211; all of which eliminate hidden pork barrel deals and spending, the misuse of public funds, and the exposure of both activities and agenda of those holding power, all sources of corruption of dysfunction in today&#8217;s Congress. Yes, Mr Herman is right, until the criminals are brought to trial, there will be noting fixed, but that goes as much for the likes of Clinton, Pelosi, Obama, and Reid as it does the Republican&#8217;s he&#8217;s pointing veiled fingers at. They&#8217;d all the treasonous in the eyes of those who wrote the Declaration, and they&#8217;d all be labelled as Benedict Arnold was. We don&#8217;t need another revolution. We don&#8217;t need a Marxist uprising at the goading of lunatic Commissars &#8211; we need the rule of law, and that knife cuts two ways.</p>

Any moron who has sat through US History in grade school can see that. The people of the United States of America are the US Armed Services. Their participation in the armed services is beholden to a higher calling, namely, the oath they take. In other words, Carl is phishing for enemies of the state!</p>
<p>Here is the only way for the people to take back a government run by the banking cartels et.al.:</p>
<p>              This the oath taken by enlisted military personnel:</p>
<p>I, _____, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support<br />
                  and defend the Constitution of the United States against all<br />
                  enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and<br />
                  allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the<br />
                  President of the United States and the orders of the officers<br />
                  appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform<br />
                  Code of Military Justice. So help me God.</p>
<p>This is the oath taken by officers:</p>
<p>I (insert name), having been appointed a (insert rank) in the U.S. Army under the conditions<br />
indicated in this document, do accept such appointment and do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter, so help me God. </p>
<p>See the differences? Enlisted military personnel must follow the lawful orders of the President AND their officers. Officers are NOT obligated to follow any order from the President. In fact, the oaths are designed to take down any President, for that matter, all three branches, if the US Constitution is violated grievously and with malice. There it is in plain English. Military officers are the firewall between all enemies against the United States.</p>
<p>That said, the JCOS should initiate a &#8220;Seven Days in May&#8221; campaign against the unlawful civilian government any time such scenarios are the only method to preserve and protect the US Constitution. The wording of the oath&#8217;s allow  the lawful arrests of the Executive, Legislative, and the Judicial branches of our government in any constitutional crisis such as we have today. I would suggest evidence to convict in a military tribunal is abundant.</p>

I submit our Judicial Branch has ruled unlawfully, our Executive Branch has acted unlawfully, our Legislative Branch has acted unlawfully. General George Washington having foreseen this articulated the Oath of Commission for his officers to allow them to act lawfully against said unlawful acts. The time is now. With the Executive Branch firing flag officers, with base closures/realignments, with our defense capabilities subject to draconian budget cuts, with our naval fleet anchored in Asia in the face of the enemy, the US Constitution&#8217;s very existence depends on General Washington&#8217;s commissioned officers. Agreed.</p>

<p>They&#8217;ve been lied to, and manipulated to kill and be killed. They, above all, have the right and authority to arrest these obvious War Criminals. </p>
<p>The crimes are just as serious in ~100 areas of other attacks upon the people. A breakthrough in one huge area will open truth/justice in all.</p>

There is alot of work ahead of us if we ever expect to restore the rule of law, our economy &amp; so forth. The military would have to assist us in doing these things to a certain extent by protecting our borders for one thing. The idea that we can peacefully fix anything is not even a possibility. All of the people above I mentioned, those in the groups mentioned are enemies of us/the Constitution &amp; don&#8217;t tell me not all cops are bad, that&#8217;s not even the truth. This isn&#8217;t about good or bad cop or judge or anything like that. It&#8217;s about the truth, justice &amp; liberty. If you know the facts and understand them for what they&#8217;re, then you&#8217;ll know why people like me say what we say when it comes to the tyrannical govt and the police state that&#8217;s in front of us.</p>
