<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>“The next Fourth Turning is due to begin shortly after the new millennium, midway through the Oh-Oh decade. Around the year 2005, a sudden spark will catalyze a Crisis mood. Remnants of the old social order will disintegrate. Political and economic trust will implode. Real hardship will beset the land, with severe distress that could involve questions of class, race, nation and empire. The very survival of the nation will feel at stake. Sometime before the year 2025, America will pass through a great gate in history, commensurate with the American Revolution, Civil War, and twin emergencies of the Great Depression and World War II.” –</em><strong> Strauss &amp; Howe</strong> <em>–</em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0767900464?tag=thebur01-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0767900464&amp;adid=0VTFPQQFCAV7FYWEMDZT&amp;"><strong>The Fourth Turning</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Strauss &amp; Howe wrote these words in 1997. They had predicted the arrival of another Crisis in this time frame in their previous book <em><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007BGOASO/ref=as_li_tf_til?tag=thebur01-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B007BGOASO&amp;adid=008JCAX7V7268R3C5QPX">Generations</a></strong></em>, written in 1990. This wasn’t guesswork on their part. They understood the dynamics of how generations interact and how the mood of the country shifts every twenty or so years based upon the generational alignment that occurs as predictably as the turning of the seasons. The last generation that lived through the entire previous Crisis from 1929 through 1946 has virtually died off. This always signals the onset of the next Fourth Turning. The housing bubble and its ultimate implosion created the spark for the current Crisis that began in September 2008, with the near meltdown of the worldwide financial system. Just as the stock market crash of 1929, the election of Lincoln in 1860, and the Boston Tea Party in 1773 catalyzed a dramatic mood change in the country, the Wall Street created financial collapse in 2008 has ushered in a twenty year period of agony, suffering, war and ultimately the annihilation of the existing social order.</p>
<p>We have experienced the American High (Spring) from 1946 until 1964, witnessing America’s ascendancy as a global superpower. We survived the turbulent Consciousness Revolution Awakening (Summer) from 1964 until 1984, as Vietnam era protests morphed into yuppie era greed. The Long Boom/Culture Wars Unraveling (Fall) lasted from Reagan’s Morning in America in 1984 until the 2008 Wall Street/Federal Reserve spawned crash. The pessimism built to a crescendo as worry about rising violence and incivility, widening wealth inequality, and the splitting of the national consensus into extremes on the left and right, led the country into a winter of discontent. The Global Financial Crisis (Winter) has arrived in full fury and is likely to last until the late 2020’s. It will be an era of upheaval, financial turbulence, economic collapse, war, and the complete redefinition of society, as the existing corrupt status quo is swept away in the fury of powerful hurricane winds of change. History is cyclical and we’ve entered the most dangerous season, when the choices we make as a nation will have profound long lasting implications to the lives of future unborn generations.</p>
<p>The linear thinkers and so called progressives who believe that history charges relentlessly forward and human ingenuity overcomes all obstacles as the world becomes progressively richer, advanced, and humane ignore the lessons of history that have been re-written every 80 to 100 years for centuries. Generational theory is so simple that even an Ivy League intellectual economist, corrupt congressman, or CNBC anchor bimbo could grasp the basic concept. The four turnings in the ongoing cycle of history match a long human life. There is a reason we forget the lessons of the past. Those who remember the lessons die off after 80 years. The linear thinking status quo keep predicting an improving economy based upon their beliefs that the next fifteen years will proceed in a similar fashion to the last fifteen years. They refuse to acknowledge we’ve entered a new era that cannot be reversed to a previous point in time. Once you’ve experienced the harsh bitter winds of the Winter, you have to deal with months of depressing darkness, harsh conditions, and stormy weather before experiencing the return of the warm breezes of Spring. The tranquil days of autumn are long gone. This dynamic can be clearly visualized by comparing our economic situation in 2007, prior to entering this Fourth Turning, to our economic situation today:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">End of Unraveling in 2007 versus fourth year of Crisis in 2012</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.6%; 146 million people, or 63% of the working age population, were employed; and 78 million Americans were not in the labor force. Today, after three years of “recovery”, the unemployment rate is 7.9%; 143 million people, or 58.8% of the working age population are employed; and 88 million Americans are not in the labor force.<strong></strong></li>
<li>Real median household income was $55,039 in 2007. It has fallen by 8.2% to $50,502 today.<strong></strong></li>
<li>BLS reported inflation has risen by 12% since 2007. True inflation has risen at twice that rate.<strong></strong></li>
<li>Median net worth in 2007 was $126,400. By 2010 it had fallen to $77,300, a 39% drop in three years. As of today, it may be a few thousand dollars higher as stock prices have risen and home prices have stopped falling.<strong></strong></li>
<li>In 2007 there were 5.7 million existing homes sold at a median price of $218,900. Today there are 4.3 million existing homes being sold at a median price of $183,900. Over 1 million of these home sales are foreclosures or short sales, as 30% of all the homes with a mortgage in the country owe more than their house is worth.<strong></strong></li>
<li>Federal government spending in 2007 was $2.73 trillion. Federal government spending today is $3.8 trillion, a 39% increase in five years. GDP in 2007 was $14.2 trillion. Today GDP is $15.8 trillion, an 11% increase in five years. Approximately 25% of the GDP increase is due to increased government spending.<strong></strong></li>
<li>Government entitlement transfers totaled $1.7 trillion in 2007. Today they total $2.4 trillion, a 41% increase in five years. Interest income paid to senior citizens and savers totaled $1.25 trillion in 2007. Today interest income totals $985 billion, a 21% decrease in five years. Wall Street bankers needed the money to pay themselves bonuses, so Ben Bernanke obliged.<strong></strong></li>
<li>The annual deficit in 2007 totaled $161 billion. Today, the annual deficit is $1.1 trillion. We add $3 billion per day to the national debt as a gift to unborn generations.<strong></strong></li>
<li>The national debt in 2007 was $9 trillion. Today the national debt is $16.3 trillion, an 81% increase in five years. The national debt will reach $20 trillion during the next presidential term. Normalization of interest rates to 2007 levels would result in annual interest expense of $1 trillion, or 40% of current government revenues. <strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There is nothing normal about our current economic situation. The unfunded liabilities at the Federal, State and local levels of government accumulate to over $200 trillion. Do the facts detailed above lead you to believe we can return to pre-2007 normal in the near future, or ever? Not only has the economic situation of the country deteriorated enormously, the very culprits who created the disaster are more powerful than they were before the global catastrophe caused by their criminal risk taking. The largest Wall Street banks control 74% of all the deposits in the country, up from 66% in 2007, and double the levels from the mid-1990’s. These bastions of capitalism wield all of the power in this country, dictating who wins elections, who writes the laws, and who benefits from the distribution of wealth. Only in a corrupt, crony-capitalist, citadel of kleptocracy could the perpetrators of the greatest theft of national wealth in the history of mankind be rewarded with taxpayer financed bailouts, the ability to borrow an unlimited amount of fiat currency at 0% from a Central Bank they control, write the new banking regulations and be applauded by their corporate mainstream media for becoming even Too Bigger to Fail. This Fourth Turning will ultimately come down to a clash between the people and the Wall Street filth.</p>

<p>Those in power today are using their ample wealth and control over the legal, economic and political systems to pretend that an epic crisis does not beckon at our doorstep. Propaganda and media spin cannot avert the brutally hard choices that must be made over the next fifteen years. The existing system is unsustainable. It can either be changed by choice or after a complete collapse. We haven’t reached the point of regeneracy yet when civic purpose begins to strengthen. The outcome of this presidential election will determine the next phase of this Crisis. Strauss &amp; Howe described the normal course of a crisis in 1997:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>“A CRISIS arises in response to sudden threats that previously would have been ignored or deferred, but which are now perceived as dire. Great worldly perils boil off the clutter and complexity of life, leaving behind one simple imperative: The society must prevail. This requires a solid public consensus, aggressive institutions, and personal sacrifice. People support new efforts to wield public authority, whose perceived successes soon justify more of the same. Government governs, community obstacles are removed, and laws and customs that resisted change for decades are swiftly shunted aside. A grim preoccupation with civic peril causes spiritual curiosity to decline. Public order tightens, private risk-taking abates, and crime and substance abuse decline. Families strengthen, gender distinctions widen, and child-rearing reaches a smothering degree of protection and structure. The young focus their energy on worldly achievements, leaving values in the hands of the old. Wars are fought with fury and for maximum result.” </em>- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0767900464?tag=thebur01-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0767900464&amp;adid=0VTFPQQFCAV7FYWEMDZT&amp;"><strong>The Fourth Turning</strong></a><strong> – Strauss &amp; Howe</strong></p>
<p>Clearly this country has not reached a common consensus and is split 50%/50% on most important issues. Debates about the role of government are waged with vitriolic passion, but the reality is that, as in past Fourth Turnings, the government has already assumed a greater level of power and control over our lives. The majority believe that government can protect them, provide for them, and pay their way. This is a delusion which will be revealed as fraudulent and mathematically impossible. The incompetent government preparation prior to Superstorm Sandy and the dysfunctional, bureaucratic and painfully slow response afterward are opening the eyes of many people. The decisions which are yet to be made are what kind of society shall we be and who will be required to sacrifice to achieve a positive outcome at the end of this Crisis. Turnings are driven by a mood change in the country and the constellation of generations at that point in time. The generations are now aligned as they always are during a Crisis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boomers entering elderhood</li>
<li>Gen-Xers entering midlife</li>
<li>Millennials entering young adulthood</li>
<li>Homelanders entering childhood</li>
</ul>
<p>History does not repeat but it does rhyme, because of the cyclical nature of human experience. The specific events that drive this Crisis are unknowable, but the generational response to these events can be predicted with uncanny accuracy. Each generation will play its assigned role during this Crisis. The current generational configuration will propel events and create a feedback loop that will change the course of human history on a scale consistent with the Depression/World War II, the Civil War and the American Revolution.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>“What will propel these events? As the saeculum turns, each of today’s generations will enter a new phase of life, producing a Crisis constellation of Boomer elders, midlife 13ers, young adult Millennials, and children from the new Silent Generation. As each archetype asserts its new social role, American society will reach its peak of potency. The natural order givers will be elder Prophets, the natural order takers young Heroes. The no-nonsense bosses will be midlife Nomads, the sensitive souls the child Artists. No archetypal constellation can match the gravitational of this one – nor its power to congeal the natural dynamic of human history into new civic purposes. And none can match its potential power to condense countless arguments, anxieties, cynicisms, and pessimisms into one apocalyptic storm.” </em>- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0767900464?tag=thebur01-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0767900464&amp;adid=0VTFPQQFCAV7FYWEMDZT&amp;"><strong>The Fourth Turning</strong></a><strong> – Strauss &amp; Howe</strong></p>
<p>The mood of the country continues to blacken. A simmering anger boils beneath the surface of an everyday façade of normalcy. The middle class majority is being squeezed in a vice, with the rich powerful plutocrats on Wall Street and in Washington DC stealing their hard earned net worth through financial scams, the gutting of our industrial base and a tax system designed to benefit those who write the laws on one side and the parasitic willfully ignorant underclass that is sustained only through the extraction of taxes from the working middle class on the other side. Our society has become a hunger games tournament, with the few benefitting while the many scramble to survive. The stench of class warfare is in the air. The generational resentment and rage is palatable as the Millenial generation has taken on a trillion dollars of student loan debt at the behest of the Federal government, Wall Street and older generations, only to graduate into a jobless economy. The generational contract has been broken, as the older generations will not or cannot leave the workforce due to their own financial missteps. Younger generations are being denied entry level positions, even as the older generations expect them to fund their retirements and healthcare. This presidential election will only exacerbate the anger, disappointment, bitterness and fury among the populace, no matter who wins.</p>
<h2><strong>Prophets &amp; Nomads</strong></h2>
<p>Can generational theory predict who will win the presidential election? Probably not, but based upon historical precedent, during times of Crisis the country usually turns to a Prophet generation leader who provides a new vision and summons the moral authority to lead. This leader may not have the right vision or have the backing of the entire population, but he is not afraid to take bold action. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was despised by many, but he boldly led the country during the last Crisis. Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 election with only 39.8% of the popular vote, but he unflinchingly did whatever he thought was necessary to achieve victory and preserve the union. Prophet leaders like Samuel Adams and Benjamin Franklin offered the sense of moral urgency required to sustain the American Revolution. Strauss &amp; Howe give a historical perspective on Prophet generations.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>“Prophet</em><em> generations are born <em>after a great war or other crisis</em></em><em>,</em><em> during a time of rejuvenated community life and consensus around a new societal order. Prophets grow up as the increasingly indulged children of this post-crisis era, come of age as narcissistic young crusaders of a spiritual awakening, cultivate principle as moralistic mid-lifers, and emerge as wise elders guiding another historical crisis. By virtue of this location in history, such generations tend to be remembered for their coming-of-age passion and their principled elder stewardship. Their principle endowments are often in the domain of <em>vision, values</em></em><em>,</em><em> and <em>religion</em>. Their best-known historical leaders include John Winthrop, William Berkeley, Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin, James Polk, Abraham Lincoln, Herbert Hoover, and Franklin Roosevelt. These were principled moralists, summoners of human sacrifice, and wagers of righteous wars.

<p>Barack Obama was born in 1961. According to the Strauss &amp; Howe generational distinctions, this makes him an early Gen-Xer. His life story matches that of the Nomad archetype. His chaotic early life, confused upbringing by an array of elders, frenetic alienated early adulthood as a community organizer, and his rise to power through his public speaking talent and pragmatic ability to achieve his agenda is a blueprint for a Nomad. Mitt Romney was born in 1947 and grew up during the American High. His childhood was idyllic and privileged. His moral Mormon youth as a missionary eventually devolved into his yuppie “greed is good” career at Bain Capital acquiring companies, making them more efficient (firing Americans &amp; hiring Asians), and spinning them off, while siphoning millions in fees. He has tried to convince Americans to vote for him, based upon his business acumen and moral lifestyle, as the cure for what ails America. With the continued downward spiral of societal mood, record low trust in Congress and 60% of Americans thinking the country is on the wrong track, the odds should favor the Prophet candidate. The 40% of Americans who think the country is on the right track are a tribute to our awful government run public education system or are smoking crack.</p>
<p>The Barack Obama presidency has many similarities to the one-term presidencies of Herbert Hoover and James Buchanan. Both men were overwhelmed by rapidly deteriorating events, an inability to understand the true nature of the Crisis, and failure to inspire the American people to rally behind a common cause. Both men drifted off into obscurity and are overwhelmingly acknowledged as two of the least successful presidents. The men who succeeded them are ranked by historians at the top of the list, even though they are both despised by more libertarian minded citizens as proponents of big government solutions and control. Libertarians will not be happy with developments over the next fifteen years. This Crisis is an era in which America’s corrupt social order will be torn down and reconstructed from the ground as a reaction to the unsustainable financial pyramid scheme which is an existential threat to the nation’s very survival. Civic authority will revive, cultural manifestation will find a community resolution, and citizens will begin to associate themselves as adherents of a larger cluster.<em>   </em></p>
<p>Barack Obama has fallen short as a Crisis leader, just as Buchanan and Hoover fell short. Buchanan also tried to maintain the status quo and not address the key issues of the day – secession and slavery. His handling of the financial Panic of 1857 led to annual deficits that exceeded 13% of GDP during his entire presidency. His legacy is one of failure and hesitation. Hoover was a technocrat with an engineering background who failed to recognize the extent of the suffering by the American people during the early stages of the Great Depression. It is a false storyline that he did not attempt to use the power of the Federal government to address the economic crisis. Federal spending increased by over 20% during his term and he was running a deficit when Roosevelt assumed power. Hoover was an activist president who began the public works programs that FDR expanded and dramatically increased taxes on the rich and corporations in 1932.</p>
<p>Obama inherited a plunging economic situation and proceeded to make choices that will make this Crisis far worse than it needed to be. He has failed miserably in addressing the core elements of this Crisis that were foreseen by Strauss and Howe over a decade before the initial spark in 2008. Debt, civic decay, rising wealth inequality due to the rise of our plutocracy, and global disorder are the underlying basis for this Crisis. Obama’s response was to run record deficits driving the national debt skyward, failing to address the unfunded entitlement liabilities that loom on the horizon, bowing down before the Wall Street mobsters and paying their ransom demands, layering on more complexity and unfunded healthcare liabilities to an already teetering government system, and extending our policing the world foreign policy at a cost of $1 trillion per year. A Crisis requires a bold leader who makes tough choices and leads. Obama has proven to not be that leader. Based on historical precedent and the rapidly deteriorating mood of the country, it would be logical for the country to select Romney, a Prophet generation leader.</p>
<h2><strong>No Escape   </strong></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>“Don’t think you can escape the Fourth Turning the way you might today distance yourself from news, national politics, or even taxes you don’t feel like paying. History warns that a Crisis will reshape the basic social and economic environment that you now take for granted. The Fourth Turning necessitates the death and rebirth of the social order. It is the ultimate rite of passage for an entire people, requiring a luminal state of sheer chaos whose nature and duration no one can predict in advance.” </em><strong>– Strauss &amp; Howe -</strong><em><strong> </strong></em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0767900464?tag=thebur01-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0767900464&amp;adid=0VTFPQQFCAV7FYWEMDZT&amp;"><strong>The Fourth Turning</strong></a></p>
<p>No matter who wins the election, there will be no turning back. It isn’t Morning in America anymore. It is more like Midnight in America on a bitterly cold dark February night as the gale force winds begin to gust, foretelling the approach of an epic winter blizzard. There are no easy solutions. The opportunity to alleviate the impact of this Crisis was during the late 1990’s and early 2000’s, and we made all the wrong choices. Now we will pay the price. An era of depression and violence will be ushered in by an economic calamity that will make 2008 look like a minor blip. The next president will still be presiding over a country divided 50%/50%, with little or no common ground on most of the key issues that must be confronted. But, as we’ve seen in previous Crisis periods, bold leadership and history making decisions did not require consensus or even majority support. Only 10% of the colonial population drove the American Revolution. Lincoln was despised by half the country and not exactly loved by everyone in the North. FDR’s popular support progressively declined during his four terms in office. It is the Fourth Turning events, not the nation, which elevates the person to the apex of power. The regeneracy of the nation will occur during the next presidential term.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>“Soon after the catalyst, a national election will produce a sweeping political realignment, as one faction or coalition capitalizes on a new public demand for decisive action. Republicans, Democrats, or perhaps a new party will decisively win the long partisan tug of war. This new regime will enthrone itself for the duration of the Crisis. Regardless of its ideology, that new leadership will assert public authority and demand private sacrifice. Regardless of its ideology, that new leadership will assert public authority and demand private sacrifice. Where leaders had once been inclined to alleviate societal pressures, they will now aggravate them to command the nation’s attention. The regeneracy will be solidly under way.” </em><strong>– Strauss &amp; Howe -</strong><em><strong> </strong></em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0767900464?tag=thebur01-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0767900464&amp;adid=0VTFPQQFCAV7FYWEMDZT&amp;"><strong>The Fourth Turning</strong></a></p>
<p>The Millenial generation is coming of age faced with the burdens of $1 trillion of student loan debt, a stagnant job market clogged by the Boomer generation that can’t afford to retire because they never got around to saving, ever increasing taxes to fund the promises made to their elders by politicians, and an unfunded entitlement liability of $100 trillion for healthcare and pension benefits they will never see. The mathematical impossibility of sustaining our economic system is absolute. It will require courage, sacrifice, fortitude and a dramatic shift of our egocentric selfish culture to a culture of sustainability and caring about future generations. We’ve made many bad choices over the last few decades. Choices matter. These are the times that will try men’s souls. The choices we make as a nation over the next few years will determine whether this Fourth Turning ends in a renewal of our founding principles or tragedy. Glory or ruin – the choice is ours.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>“Thus might the next Fourth Turning end in apocalypse – or glory. The nation could be ruined, its democracy destroyed, and millions of people scattered or killed. Or America could enter a new golden age, triumphantly applying shared values to improve the human condition. The rhythms of history do not reveal the outcome of the coming Crisis; all they suggest is the timing and dimension.” </em><strong>– Strauss &amp; Howe -</strong><em><strong> </strong></em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0767900464?tag=thebur01-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0767900464&amp;adid=0VTFPQQFCAV7FYWEMDZT&amp;"><strong>The Fourth Turning</strong></a></p>
<p>The next stage of this Crisis is likely to be ignited by a downward spiral of societal trust caused by the next financial implosion, which is certain to occur. A world built upon debt, false promises, interconnected webs of deceitful derivatives, fiat currency backed only by the promises of lying politicians and captured central bankers, and a diminishing supply of easy to access natural resources, is hopelessly dependent upon the willful ignorance of the masses. As long as people want to be lied to rather than facing the truth, those in power can maintain the status quo. Once the jarring realization of reality overwhelms the propaganda and lies of the oligarchs, the battle for middle earth will begin. What will trigger the next phase of this Crisis? No one knows for sure, but based on the fault lines already evident, these are a possibility:</p>
<ul>
<li>The inevitable breakup of the European Union with the consequences of massive bank defaults in Europe triggering worldwide bank defaults as the interconnected trillions of derivatives are lit like a string of firecrackers.</li>
<li>A sudden Greece like surge in interest rates on Japanese bonds results in a collapse of their debt ridden economic system, with reverberations throughout the world.</li>
<li>The Middle East tinderbox explodes as Israel attacks Iran and the law of unintended consequences takes hold. Alliances and treaties would draw Turkey into war with Syria and Iran. Russia and China could side against the U.S. Iran and their vassals would unleash terrorist attacks and disruption of Middle Eastern oil would drive prices over $200 per barrel, crushing the American economy.</li>
<li>A showdown on the debt ceiling and/or fiscal cliff results in a stock market crash, derailing the pitiful fledgling recovery created by Ben Bernanke’s QE to infinity measures.</li>
<li>A tipping point is reached with regards to the amount of debt that can be accumulated by our Federal, State and Local governments. A cascade of defaults could lead to a loss of faith in the U.S. dollar and a surge in interest rates. The defaults and increased interest on the national debt could lead to mass depression or in a worst case scenario – hyperinflation.</li>
<li>A large terrorist attack in one or more American cities would cause chaos, panic and fear, leading to more government control over our daily lives. This could trigger a counter response by those fed up with an overbearing government presence.</li>
<li>A catastrophic natural disaster or series of natural disasters would reveal the fragile nature of our just in time economic system. A breakdown of our logistical and infrastructure systems would lead to chaos and mass hysteria as the citizens who believed their government leaders would keep them safe, secure, warm, and fed realized it was all a sham. Their leaders were in it for the power and riches, not looking out for the best interests of the common folk.</li>
</ul>
<p>No one knows for sure what will trigger the next leg down during this Crisis, but I can guarantee you that things will not be getting better in the near future. Don’t believe the mainstream media or politicians who tell us life in the good old U.S. of A will be back to normal in the near future. And those who predict a long slow gentle decline of the American Empire that can be managed by the oligarchs are badly mistaken. That is not how things roll in a Fourth Turning. Transformative change, chaos, desperate measures, and total war will propel our nation through this cataclysmic saeculum and a positive outcome is not assured. An armed conflict &#8211; class war, sectional war, religious war, or war for oil – will be waged at some point and fought to the finish. Fourth Turning wars do not end inconclusively. Each Fourth Turning war has resulted in greater destruction and more horrendous numbers of human casualties. The trials and tribulations that await this nation over the next fifteen years will challenge every living generation to play their roles and bravely confront the tasks needed to reach a new High, just as their ancestors did.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>“History offers no guarantees. Obviously, things could go horribly wrong – the possibilities ranging from a nuclear exchange to incurable plagues, from terrorist anarchy to high-tech dictatorship. We should not assume that Providence will always exempt our nation from the irreversible tragedies that have overtaken so many others: not just temporary hardship, but debasement and total ruin. Losing in the next Fourth Turning could mean something incomparably worse. It could mean a lasting defeat from which our national innocence – perhaps even our nation – might never recover.” </em><strong>– Strauss &amp; Howe -</strong><em><strong> </strong></em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0767900464?tag=thebur01-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0767900464&amp;adid=0VTFPQQFCAV7FYWEMDZT&amp;"><strong>The Fourth Turning</strong></a></p>
<p>For those who doubt generational theory and believe history is a linear path of human progress, I would point to the last week of chaos, disarray, government dysfunction, and misery of those who didn’t prepare for Superstorm Sandy, as a prelude to the worst of this Crisis. The lack of preparation by government officials and citizens, death, destruction, panic, anger, helplessness and realization of how fragile our system has become is a perfect analogy to our preparation for this Fourth Turning. The brittleness of our infrastructure and lack of redundancy in our systems has left us vulnerable to any large storm. Building mansions yards from a dangerous unpredictable sea is akin to allowing Wall Street bankers to create interconnected financial derivatives which will ultimately result in a great worldwide flood that will obliterate billions of wealth. Going decades without upgrading our power grid, transportation systems, or storm protection is akin to allowing our unfunded entitlement liabilities to accumulate to such an extreme level that it will be impossible to honor and the coming storm will swamp those depending on those promises. The lack of foresight by citizens in having food, water, and backup sources of power and heat in case of an emergency is akin to the millions of people that have lived the good life in debt up to their eyeballs while never saving for a rainy day or their retirement. When the rainy day arrives they panic and demand to be saved by an inept bureaucratic government.</p>
<p>Winter has arrived. The gathering storm is about to strike. Are you prepared?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>“Reflect on what happens when a terrible winter blizzard strikes. You hear the weather warning but probably fail to act on it. The sky darkens. Then the storm hits with full fury, and the air is a howling whiteness. One by one, your links to the machine age break down. Electricity flickers out, cutting off the TV. Batteries fade, cutting off the radio. Phones go dead. Roads become impossible, and cars get stuck. Food supplies dwindle. Day to day vestiges of modern civilization – bank machines, mutual funds, mass retailers, computers, satellites, airplanes, governments – all recede into irrelevance. Picture yourself and your loved ones in the midst of a howling blizzard that lasts several years. Think about what you would need, who could help you, and why your fate might matter to anybody other than yourself. That is how to plan for a saecular winter. Don’t think you can escape the Fourth Turning. History warns that a Crisis will reshape the basic social and economic environment that you now take for granted.” – </em><strong>Strauss &amp; Howe</strong><em> </em><strong><em>- </em></strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0767900464?tag=thebur01-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0767900464&amp;adid=0VTFPQQFCAV7FYWEMDZT&amp;"><strong>The Fourth Turning</strong></a></p>

You&#8217;re wrong; &#8220;Obama&#8221; (if that&#8217;s even his real name) was &#8220;overwhelmed&#8221; by nothing. And an &#8220;inability to understand&#8221;? LOL! What nonsense! Obama is a PUPPET. Puppets don&#8217;t try to &#8220;understand&#8221; anything; rather, they take orders. Obama was hand picked by our Jewish ruling elite to advance their PNAC agenda. Just like Bush before him, Obama is just another mindless, soulless, empty vessel, who sold his soul to his Masters for a taste of power.<br />
Lastly, of course, things are &#8220;deteriorating&#8221;&#8230;because that&#8217;s the very nature of evil. It destroys everything around it, eventually including itself.</p>

<p>All these &#8220;truths&#8221; you proclaim, whether true or not, would be machinations of the zionist israeli <i>government</i>, not crimes committed by all jewish people everywhere, many of whom oppose what their <i>rulers</i> are doing; as many americans are opposed to the actions of theirs.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Absolute certainty is a privilege of uneducated minds and fanatics&#8221;</i><b>C.J. Keyser</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to get involved in a vitriolic debacle over a matter of semantics. The actions of the zionist government of israel are not undertaken because all <i>&#8220;jewish&#8221;</i> people demand it, any more than is the case of the fascist american <i>&#8220;government&#8221;</i> and the people of america.</p>
<p>While any given society bears a certain degree of responsibility for the crimes committed by an <i>&#8220;elected&#8221;</i> government, which consist of a small minority of psychopaths, an entire culture, society or ethnic group should not be condemned for them.</p>
<p>Frankly, I think all religions are abominations which have contributed excessively to every manner of carnage for millennia. As with all hierarchic systems, it always seems to come down to psychopaths being able to manipulate <i>&#8220;normal&#8221;</i> people into submission to tyrannical rule.</p>

Usually people will grab one questionable detail of your presentation and make an issue of that and disregard the rest.</p>
<p>Richard, I liked your quotes very much&#8230; They do reflect what those wise Hellenes (they were not called Greeks at that time) said 2500 years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.&#8221;  -Aristotle<br />
Can we extend it to say:<br />
It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought contrary to its beliefs.</p>
<p>Paraphrased: &#8220;the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.&#8221; &#8211; F. Scott Fitzgerald (Fitzgerald read Aristotle!!!)</p>
<p>We also have:<br />
“Complacent ignorance is the most lethal sickness of<br />
the soul.” –Plato</p>
<p>&#8220;When a man finds a conclusion agreeable, he accepts it without argument, but when he finds it disagreeable, he will bring against it all the forces of logic and reason.&#8221;  -Thucydides</p>
<p>Paraphrased: &#8220;The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion  draws all things else to support and agree with it” &#8211; Francis Bacon (Bacon read Thucydides!!!)<br />
And one more paraphrasing: &#8220;We are all capable of believing things which we know to be untrue, and then, when we are finally proved wrong, impudently twisting the facts so as to show that we were right.&#8221; — George Orwell</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always been rather fascinated with Plato, though I haven&#8217;t yet studied him at great length or depth, I do have many of his works in my &#8220;reference library&#8221;; over 8 gigs of pdf books, speeches, essays and assorted government documents.</p>
<p>One wonders how someone can possess such wisdom on the one hand and yet be an advocate of the most extreme forms of tyranny, even being an early advocate of eugenics long before the concept was even named.</p>

Remarkable how Keyser and Wilson quotes fundamentally convey the same concepts as Aristotle and others.. For that reason I use the name Aristotle Lives<br />
 Plato was extremely intelligent of course and a great observer. He was an elitist and of believed that society should be steered by the excellent&#8230; He did not seem to have much consideration for humanity as a whole as other philosophers did&#8230; I have not read much of him as I am inclined in another more humanitarian direction. Machiavelli was very much like Plato in many ways&#8230; maybe not as bright as Plato but very cunning. </p>

The problem is Jewish supremacism and the race war &#8211; for control of the world &#8211; that the Jewish collective has launched against the non-Jewish balance of humanity. Second &#8220;Zionism&#8221; is merely the latest Jewish &#8220;ism&#8221;. (An &#8220;ism&#8221; that wouldn&#8217;t have actually gotten anywhere if the majority of Jews did not put tribal loyalty above all else). And as far as &#8220;Israel&#8221; being the problem: Jews were being collectively thrown out of almost every country in Europe long before there was an &#8220;Israel&#8221;. And read what Benjamin Freedman has to say about Jewish machinations in the U.S.; once again, long before &#8220;Israel&#8221;.</p>
<p>Lastly, I&#8217;m still waiting for you to prove me wrong by giving me JUST ONE EXAMPLE of a prominent Jew publicly telling the truth about any of the major Jew lies helping to destroy our world.</p>

<p>I agree with you with the fact that Judaism has a tendency to put itself above others and compensate the discrimination with a superiority complex which is leading us to this mess.</p>
<p>But not all Jews are like that and you can find examples in Desert Peace, in Jewish Voice for Peace, in the intent messages of peace exchanged between Jews in Israel and  Iranians, demonstrations by Jews in favor of rescuing whatever is left for the Paletinians before the &#8221; Beasts&#8221; take it all&#8230; You just need to look where your inclination does not take you. Read the Thucydides quote in my first reply to Posner please.</p>
<p>Finally, let me tell you I am a Greek who was brought up in the American educational system and learned to love America&#8230; but being an outsider i can may be see things in a different perspective than you. </p>
<p>Considet that the US is immersed in an imperialistic binge with more than 1000 military bases all over the world to defend &#8220;our best interest&#8221;. Consider that after WWII the US has invaded and intervened militarily in over 50 countries and killed millions of people. That it went into Iraq to &#8220;liberate Irqui people from a tyrant&#8221; it had put in place itself, with no provocation with WMD lies, and peppered the country with Depleted Uranium and killed 1.500.000 people (U of Johns Hopkins data) half women and children and installed a new puppet there.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as I coincide with yo on the issue that some Jews are like the devil, you must consider that what the US is doing now is much much more atrocious than what Israel and the Zionists are being accused of. And I will even grant to you that the Jewish Lobby and PNAC are Jews influencing US policy and responsible of much of those American CRIMES.. </p>
<p>But the punch line is: Are all Americans guilty and purposely doing the modern holocaust, drone assassinations, starving people by embargoes and the list could fill pages&#8230; According to your reasoning they are&#8230;.. simply by using your analogy of Guilt by Passivity &#8230;If your proposition is &#8220;All Jews are guilty&#8221; then if you are consistent &#8220;All Americans are guilty..So what are you going to do besides focus the crime in one place, Israel,  and turn a blind eye to the other place, your own USA (assuming you are American) ? Myabe you could suggest that the fixing of thins must star in one´s own home?</p>
<p>I hope you can read this with an open mind.</p>

However, judging by the excerpts and the thrust of this article, the entire theory is based upon the historical cycles of <i>individual</i> nations, regions or empires and applies to the rise and fall of such entities.</p>
<p>What makes the current historical cycle, which is now at its end, different from all its predecessors is its truly global nature. <i>Whatever</i> the catastrophic outcome may be, it will not be confined to america, france, germany, greece or any single nation or region. It will be the first truly global holocaust, spreading this metaphorical winter storm to every corner of the globe.</p>
<p>There is another significant difference in this cycle, which is only hinted at in passing by this article, and that is the worldwide impact of the runaway climate change triggered by global warming and the attendant global state shift that is now underway.</p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s not as if all the rest of the world will be able to sit back and complacently observe the collapse of <i>the american empire</i> like we did that of the former <i>soviet union</i>. This time, it&#8217;s every nation on the planet going down in flames.</p>
<p>Just my opinion.</p>

<p>I read the Fourth Turning, oh, 7 years ago and if I remember correctly that is addressed.  If you look at the last 3 turnings in America (WWII, Cicil War, Revolution), you&#8217;ll notice the last one was decidedly a bit larger than America itself.  Although the cultures had been on their own track for Fourth Turnings, WWI leading to WWII had a great impact on &#8220;lining them up&#8221;.  Not perfectly, not permanently, but the war landing on top of you can help trigger a crisis.</p>
<p>Since then, the world has been advancing somewhat in lock-step with America&#8217;s cycle.  Due to America&#8217;s outsized influence as the empire-du-jour or simply the scale of WWII I don&#8217;t know, but our cycle has spread globally.  Again, not perfectly or permanently, but there is a tighter correlation than ever before.</p>
<p>Read the book though, it is excellent (as a good mental workout if not believed fully.)</p>

<p>Your observation regarding the global spread of &#8220;our cycle&#8221; is an apt one. It&#8217;s a simple progression from the end of WWII, through the burgeoning of monetary capitalism to its metastasizing into the global cancer it is today.</p>
<p>And yes, america&#8217;s status as <i>world superpower</i>, combined with an exponential growth in technology has reduced the world to a single unit; a source of real wealth to be exploited for the enrichment of those few who have somehow convinced the rest of us that the false wealth of <i>&#8220;money&#8221;</i> is, in and of itself, the most precious of commodities.</p>

<p>The Source of Romney’s Lying<br />
By Robert Parry</p>
<p>But what has attracted very little media attention is the question: why does Romney lie?</p>
<p>There have been some suggestions that Romney’s mendacity is an outgrowth of his business experience as a corporate takeover artist who tells investors and other stakeholders pretty much anything to close a deal. But that misses the reality of the business world where a reputation as a chronic liar can be lethal to long-term success.</p>
<p>No, Romney’s lying — most recently revealed in his false claim about General Motors and Chrysler shifting U.S. auto jobs to China — appears connected to something deeper in his personality, psyche or life experience.</p>
<p>more</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>And, if ABC and others will confirm Veterans Today&#8217;s reports, then Romney has a lot to lie about. And, the story has an UPDATE:</p>

<p>Romney Leaks: Drugs, Blood Diamonds and a Cuban Mistress (Updated)</p>
<p>FBI, CIA and Foreign Intelligence Agencies “Leak” Romney Files<br />
(See Addendum for updated critical material)</p>
<p>by  Gordon Duff,  Senior Editor</p>
<p>snip</p>
<p>South Africa is my “turf” also.</p>
<p>“Tony” as he called himself was working with a US law firm and was tasked with investing $120 billion in drug profits, maybe from Afghanistan, in South Africa.  He told our representatives he was looking for mining properties worth more than $200 million each.</p>
<p>“Tony” met, not just with us, but with dozens of other groups in South Africa.  Tony is, what we call in the spy business, “burned.” Tony’s group works with UNITA, a terrorist organization, sometimes supported by North Korea, Israel, the US and China.  The former Angolan revolutionary organization is now “for hire,” and “terrorism on demand” with a reach that covers a dozen nations.</p>
<p>    Their task, as South African intelligence indicates, is to buy up South Africa and take over the rest of Southern Africa through running terrorist groups out of the DRC or Democratic Republic of the Congo.  On their list is Kenya and other nations. </p>
<p>Their method of operation is to finance themselves with blood diamonds, sent through agents to Tel Aviv, money to be handled by Bain Capital/Romney, then to China where arms are purchased and shipped to terrorists in Africa, “Al Qaeda, Boko Harum and UNITA.</p>
<p>The details of the deal were set up a month ago.  Currently, UNITA is having difficulty coming up with their end, the $1.2 billion a year in diamonds they promised.</p>
<p>    On the Israeli end, Romney, while traveling there with Las Vegas casino boss, Sheldon Adelson, met with diamond traders at what was supposed to be a/an (illegal) fundraiser. </p>
<p>    It was something else, putting together one link in the diamonds, terrorism, money, narcotics trade which, working with Bain, the Bush family, Mormon groups in the CIA and the Mossad, meant to take over all of Africa.  </p>
<p>snip</p>
<p>Documents contain names of undercover agents, witnesses, those who put their lives at risk to keep drugs out of the US.  Redaction is going on and we will publish what we can.</p>
<p>NAFTA makes much more sense to me now, why the border has been kept open through several presidencies, how we lost much of the nation and our government to drug cash.</p>
<p>Similarly, our policies in Africa now make sense, the terrorism spreading across the continent, and even Webster Tarpley’s statements about the Mormon Mafia that runs the CIA and FBI.</p>

<p>The Most Lied About Election in American History</p>
<p>—<br />
by Gordon Duff, Senior Editor<br />
—</p>
<p>It began when the Republican nomination was stolen. Ron Paul won in a landslide. Thus far, 25 grand juries have been seated to deal with felony charges tied to crimes in rigging both the GOP primaries and convention.</p>
<p>Legal groups across the US are, finally, challenging overt the overt corruption of America’s “two party dictatorship.”</p>
<p>Even with a flawed constitution, there is nothing that supports this system, nothing that supports how congress is run and certainly, what constitution we have should have protected us from rule by foreign corporations, more specifically, organized crime packaged as “foreign corporations” that the Supreme Court’s “Citizens United” blasphemy has saddled us with.</p>
<p>    Over the past few days, with my delightfully tapped phone (all calls say “US Government” on them), those still working for what is legitimate of that government have been calling. I am told I am the only journalist that isn’t either “brain dead” or “bought” or “scared to death.”</p>
<p>The volume of information held, the types of information, the mass of it, is mind boggling, even for me.</p>
<p>snip</p>
<p>The story we are going to look at today has to be painted with broad strokes. It starts with the Reagan administration but not with Reagan himself.</p>
<p>Those of us who worked for Reagan, and I have a group of friends and coworkers who were his direct advisors or who worked in military and intelligence positions, saw the change.</p>
<p>There were a series of scandals, all “erased by the sands of time,” such as “Iran/Contra” or “BCCI.” All are forgotten. What wasn’t seen was how the CIA was subverted by members of the Executive Branch, we are talking the Vice President, along with key members of the Pentagon and Congress.</p>
<p>America had long been saddled with foreign rule. It began well before 1913 when Woodrow Wilson pushed through the Federal Reserve Act, written on Jekyll Island by a banking cabal, a law meant to enslave America through manufactured economic disasters, war and debt.</p>
<p>Without the Federal Reserve, there would have been no World Wars, the truth goes that far.</p>
<p>    This is why we have Mitt Romney instead of Ron Paul. Romney represents the European banking consortium and organized crime. His purpose is to unravel the roadblocks put in place by Obama, few and weak as they are due to our flawed system of “bought” government, and put us back into historical perspective.</p>
<p>    This means a world war, more prisons, looted banks, all wealth shipped overseas and the eventual descent of America into third world status, depopulated, deindustrialized and enslaved.<br />
____________________________________</p>
<p>This is what I have been told, what sits in his files, FBI, intelligence agencies, what can be proven, can be shown, what has been presented to every agency chief, every court, the leaders of congress, all have seen the files.</p>
<p>    Romney and friends, turning dollars into ???? – but how, really ??</p>
<p>The story began, “Romney left Bain Capital in 1999 when Cartel head, Raul Salinas, his partner, was sentenced to 50 years in prison. Salinas said, ‘If my story gets out, the governments of the world will tremble.’</p>
<p>Romney was terrified, walked away from Bain’s secret overseas holdings, well over $1 trillion dollars, not the $66 billion claimed, and flew to Cuba to meet his mistress, Maria Perez Andropov (Russian intelligence agent) and for an audience with Castro.</p>
<p>We have records of his flight, photographs from Cuba, we have recordings of conversations there….”</p>
<p>    I have hours of these debriefings, in “cloud” storage, now sitting with several intelligence agencies where I have good friends. The story first broke here, proof to a number of agencies that I could be trusted, then the deluge of even more information began.</p>
<p>Let’s get back to this in a bit. We need more background.</p>
<p>Vietnam was “in the rear view mirror” and its lessons. We aren’t talking about real learning, that war is useless, that humans deserve decency and a chance for life and freedom. What Vietnam taught Washington was that “waste is profit” and that the real business of government is narcotics.</p>
<p>What had, since the 1940′s, been the dalliance of a few powerful banking and shipping families, those who later grew fat on the civil war, the “Robber Barons” who became the war profiteers of World War I, they were the beginning.</p>
<p>There were others, this is where the Romney family comes in. Mormon history is largely secret, two wars against the United States, wars over polygamy, over the “Kingdom of Deseret” and its withdrawal from the United States.</p>
<p>The Romney family were citizens of that “kingdom” and had their US citizenship formally withdrawn in 1872 by the Edmunds Act.</p>
<p>They became federal fugitives, fled America and stayed out of the country for 26 years, citizens of Mexico. No “returning” Romney family member was repatriated as an American citizen, all remained Mexican citizens, some returning to Mexico.</p>
<p>    During their time there, they formed alliances with ruling families, with bandits, with forces opposed to the United States and its seizure of American land. Mormons who fled to Mexico had become a “5th column” when they returned and remained tied to Mexico.</p>
<p>Thus, when the briefing continued, it didn’t run immediately to Carlos Salinas, the former Mexican President who ran their drug cartels, the Harvard and lifelong companion Mitt Romney, according to “surveillance records,” but to the father.</p>
<p>It was George Romney, the “poor kid” who claims to have nearly starved during the depression who went from “rags to riches” in months during the 1930s, from grocery clerk to running an auto company to eventually, during World War II, managing the entire auto industry.</p>
<p>The tapes say that it was dad, along with drug dealers, gangsters, El Salvador, Mexico, Panama, Columbia, that funded Bain.</p>
<p>It was dad, George Romney, former President of American Motors, former Governor of Michigan, former Secretary of Health and Human Services that had been running a vast multi-national criminal empire.</p>
<p>I had no idea and I had met him. Then came the warning:</p>
<p>    “When we tried to explain this, the web of hedge funds, of ‘limited partnerships,’ of railroads, shipping companies, even the largest retail chain in the world, how they were involved, how Mitt Romney is the largest casino operator in the world, all done through layers of partnerships, no one wanted to take on anything this powerful.”</p>
<p>    “One of the keys is the Texas Pacific Group, funding 254 companies. Another is GE Capital, originating as a Mexican bank that laundered drug profits, grown into one of the largest companies in America by ‘Jack Welch’ and then destroyed through a ‘pump and dump’ costing American investors billions, crushing many pension funds and impoverishing tens of thousands or more.”</p>
<p>The list of major American corporations, many “giants” was endless. No wonder prosecutors, press and, of course, elected officials were overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Those listed as representing organized crime make up groups responsible for 50% of political donations in the US and this doesn’t count the estimated $4 billion in drug profits brought in through phony front corporation or the money collected during overseas campaign funding drives, trips to Israel and Britain.</p>
<p>Of course, collecting campaign funds overseas is a felony.</p>
<p>In 1997, Norman Grigg produced a prophetic article on NAFTA that included the following:</p>
<p>    According to former DEA agent Phil Jordan, the tidal wave of narcotics flooding the southwest border is an ineluctable product of the NAFTA agreement, which — as the agency predicted in a 1993 intelligence report — has proven to be “a deal made in narco heaven.”</p>

<p>Press TV: US military planned mutiny on the Bounty to topple Obama</p>
<p>October 31st, 2012 | Posted by Gordon Duff</p>
<p>Admiral Gaouette was part of a group of military officers who have<br />
been under suspicion for planning a “Seven Days in May” type overthrow<br />
of the US government if President Obama is re-elected.</p>
<p>“His [Romney's] real intent is to occupy Iraq and attack Iran. In the<br />
 process, America intends on “neutralizing” the nuclear capability of<br />
Pakistan. This is the plan, it is known, not just in the Department of<br />
Defense, but by all intelligence agencies, the plotters have all been<br />
recognized, are all under surveillance and they have not been very<br />
careful.”</p>
<p>The Obama administration has had American military, both on domestic<br />
and foreign bases on high alert since October 1. However, there has been<br />
 no known terrorist enemy threatening the US. The enemy is called<br />
“domestic” but its origins are far from American.</p>
<p>Today, Rear Admiral Charles M. Gaouette was “fired” from his command<br />
of one of the three carrier battle groups back to Bremerton, Washington<br />
to face an investigation.</p>
<p>It is impossible to adequately state how unusual this is and how serious.</p>
<p>The Navy was clear that the charges had nothing to do with his<br />
personal conduct, no rape or sexual misconduct, no stolen money, no drug<br />
 use, the things that usually bring down careers in the Navy, that and<br />
crashing ships into each other.</p>
<p>Gaouette was sent back because the Secretary of Defense found him<br />
unfit for command, sent him across the world in the middle of one of the<br />
 largest combat exercises in history, one both timed prior to an<br />
election and one at a critical location, near the Straits of Hormuz in<br />
the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>Gaouette commanded nearly one third of the Naval and air combat forces in the region.</p>
<p>The decision was made based on a conversation with the Secretary of<br />
Defense who, at the end of the talk, believed Gaouette was part of a<br />
group of military officers who have been under suspicion for planning a<br />
“Seven Days in May” type overthrow of the US government if President<br />
Obama is re-elected.</p>
<p>This is not conjecture, dozens of key officers face firing, hundreds<br />
are under investigation, all with direct ties to extremist elements in<br />
the Republican Party and the Israeli lobby.</p>
<p>Reports received are sourced at the highest levels of the Pentagon<br />
and indicate that the administration has been aware of these plans for<br />
months. It is not just the Obama administration. This happened before.</p>
<p>snip</p>
<p>Step one – Benghazi</p>
<p>Those involved in the plot, those outside the military, are those who<br />
 are spreading “conspiracy theory” rumors about US complicity or<br />
malfeasance in the handling of the murder of the US ambassador to Libya,<br />
 Chris Stephens.</p>
<p>Today, CIA Director, General Petraeus clearly stated that the CIA had<br />
 received no requests for help. A month ago, the State Department also<br />
made it clear, the attack was military, well coordinated and that no<br />
forces were available capable of making a difference.</p>
<p>In fact, the “conspiracy theorists,” those attempting to use their<br />
wild theories in order to implement an “October Surprise” are directly<br />
aligned with those who planned and executed the attack.</p>
<p>snip</p>
<p>This is the role of the controlled press in terror operations, providing “deception and cover.”</p>

<p>Romney, Landslide Loser Refuses Timely Concession</p>
<p>GOP Retains Control in the House, Dems Sweep Senate</p>
<p>—</p>
<p> …by  Gordon Duff,  Senior Editor</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>America does some really dumb things but running an organized crime<br />
boss for president, and a bumbling wimp of one at that, this had gone<br />
too far.</p>
<p>What we can tell you is that the senior active and retired<br />
intelligence and top law enforcement and DOJ professionals, the drug<br />
enforcement officers, they are the ones that beat Romney, not the Obama<br />
campaign.</p>
<p>They wouldn’t allow Romney to turn America into something even worse than the seemingly hopeless mess we have now and moved.</p>
<p>Probably the worst scam in the entire election was the accusations<br />
made by a few stooges, some former military, sold out to organized<br />
crime, that accused the president of murdering an ambassador in order to<br />
 try to lose the election.</p>
<p>Add to that a phony corporate media who never attempted to dig out<br />
who paid for ex-CIA Rev. Terry Jones’ all day Muslim rant webcast that<br />
cost millions of dollars.</p>
<p>This was a smoking gun that the whole thing was the expected October<br />
surprise, and took us only a day to find out who all was involved. Data<br />
mining is a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>These stories need to be kept and whenever one of these phony<br />
military fatass types tries to cash in, they need to be shut down.<br />
Veterans Today’s archives are backed up on proxy servers off shore and<br />
can never be ‘disappeared’, hacked or firebombed.</p>
<p>Then we have Hannity, Dick Morris, George Will, Newt, and, don’t<br />
forget poor Sheldon “Kiss of Death” Adelson who thought he bought five<br />
states for Romney and got none.</p>
<p>Then we can see how well the Israel lobby did, New York is solidly<br />
Obama and, as of this writing, Florida is in play, a state that was<br />
supposed to be solid Romney territory with his Cuban connections.</p>
<p>Oops, we forget.  Romney got burned for his Castro meetings.</p>
<p>The other upside is that the Israel lobby is now where it belongs,<br />
toothless, its massive influx of illegal cash into race after race and<br />
voters in almost ever case went the other way.</p>
<p>Cuba, the recent revelations, burned Romney more than we suspected.<br />
We ran the story, pushed to do so at the last minute but didn’t think it<br />
 would get solid distribution.</p>
<p>We were wrong.  We simply published, others put it in the hands of<br />
key political figures and squashed Romney’s backing in several key<br />
political and ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Our intel friends were busy in more areas also.</p>
<p>They leaked Romney’s ties to blood diamonds, money laundering, his ties to Castro and the cartels in Mexico and Columbia.</p>
<p>They even leaked his mistress, a Russian/Cuban spy name Maria Perez Andropov.</p>
<p>A few days before the election, what may actually be the best we<br />
have, a flawed lot I admit, but including key members of our military,<br />
moved on Romney and Netanyahu and, and, and…</p>
<p>snip</p>
<p>We can no longer accept the government under these circumstances, the<br />
 money in politics, the rule by special interest, the war for profit and<br />
 the imposed third world slavery that the American people are expecting<br />
their grandchildren to face.</p>
<p>Obama doesn’t get off the hook. He is now free to do all those thing he promised.</p>
<p>snip</p>
<p>The fun followup will be the wild conspiracy mongering that has<br />
already begun on Fox News, claiming ACORN and the Black Panthers rigged<br />
the election.</p>
<p>It is a reasonable estimate, not without some backing, that 5 million<br />
 votes were flipped to Romney through software hacking, ballot box<br />
stuffing and simply destroying ballots.</p>
<p>He still lost big.</p>
<p>snip</p>
<p>…here…despite the fact we are the largest active veterans group and,<br />
by miles the most politically effective, we continue to be minimized.</p>
<p>    Veterans don’t need cigarettes, booze and bingo.  Americans don’t<br />
 need a police state.  If government doesn’t want to hear the unpleasant<br />
 truth, it can change or we will find a way of removing it.  We didn’t<br />
take down the criminal cabal around Romney and his Bush associates by<br />

fund raising.</p>
<p>We had Americans with us. Again, my thanks to all that stood with us<br />
at VT, numbers I would never have imagined.  I am humbled. Please post<br />
all election conspiracy theories in the comment section.</p>

<p>Karl Rove Loses Election After Being Checkmated By Cyber Sleuths?</p>
<p>Last month, we offered a million dollar reward for information<br />
leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone who rigged a federal<br />
election on November 6th.  We urged computer experts to contact us with<br />
information about any election manipulation of the tabulation results.</p>
<p>We Received A Letter</p>
<p>On November 12th, we received a letter from “The Protectors,”<br />
apparently a group of white hat cyber sleuths, mentioning our reward and<br />
 stating that two months ago, they began monitoring the “digital traffic<br />
 of one Karl Rove, a disrespecter of the Rule of Law, knowing that he<br />
claimed to be Kingmaker while grifting vast wealth from barons who<br />
gladly handed him gold to anoint another King while looking the other<br />
way.”</p>
<p>“The Protectors” said that they had identified the digital structure<br />
of Rove’s operation and of ORCA, a Republican get out the vote software<br />
application.  After finding open “doors” in the systems, they created a<br />
“password protected firewall” called “The Great Oz,” and installed it on<br />
 servers that Rove planned to use on election night to re-route and<br />
change election results “from three states.” </p>
<p>The letter indicated that “ORCA Killer” was launched at 10am EST and<br />
“The Great Oz” at 8pm EST on November 6th. “The Protectors” watched as<br />
ORCA crashed and failed throughout Election Day.  They watched as Rove’s<br />
 computer techs tried 105 times to penetrate “The Great Oz” using<br />
different means and passwords. </p>
<p>snip</p>
<p>At VR, we have spent the past decade exposing flaws in the election<br />
process, especially the use of electronic voting, secret software and<br />
cyber attacks on tabulation systems.  Princeton computer scientists,<br />
Argonne Laboratories experts,  GOP insiders, and even the CIA  have<br />
shown that electronic election manipulation is both possible and<br />
occurring.</p>
<p>snip</p>
<p>We hope that those cyber sleuths will provide that evidence to the FBI, post it publicly or send it to us to do so.</p>
<p>snip</p>
<p>As far as lessons learned, we are hopeful that those who have been<br />
skeptical and opposed to greater security in elections will now get on<br />
board in a bipartisan manner to, as President Obama said, “fix” the<br />
broken election system.  </p>

<p>Anonymous Saved The Election? (TEXT)</p>
<p>						Posted by<br />
							Nathaniel Downes						</p>
<p>While some might consider this a random letter, or a jump to claim<br />
responsibility, if you step back and study the letter carefully a very<br />
clear message comes out.</p>
<p>They cite specific numbers. They state precisely how many tunnels are<br />
 there. They cite how many passwords were attempted. But, there are key<br />
words which look innocent but, to a computer engineer, are very much a<br />
trigger.</p>
<p>These phrases are (our emphasis):</p>
<p>We noticed these tunnels were strategically placed to allow for<br />
tunnel rats to race to the sewer servers from three different states.</p>
<p>Now, to a normal person a rat is just that: a furry animal or a slang<br />
 term for a scoundrel. But to a computer person, a rat is something<br />
radically different, a r.a.t. hack. The Remote Administration Tool hack<br />
is a method of remotely accessing a machine as if it were local. Using<br />
such a hack, you would have full access to the machine, at a level<br />
someone physically at the machine may not have. A “sewer server” is a<br />
term used to denote a hack over a secured tunnel, known as a Secured<br />
SHell (SSH), using a form of encryption designed to make it appear to be<br />
 innocent background traffic.</p>
<p>This is not some general discussion, making claims in order to claim.<br />
 They have released clear and specific details on what exactly was done,<br />
 information which the people behind Orca can verify. Even more telling,<br />
 however, is the name the group used for their denial of service attack:</p>
<p>The Great Oz</p>
<p>“Oz” refers to the land in the classic movie, The Wizard of Oz; more<br />
currently, it refers to the television show Oz, which is about a prison.<br />
 And the actions the group took was to attempt to hack the election into<br />
 jail, locking it away. It broke, absolutely. We reported on the </p>
<p>failures of Orca and its public face earlier. What Anonymous is claiming<br />
 is that Orca’s public face was a farce, a lie. It was not to coordinate<br />
 poll challengers so much as to steal the election.</p>
<p>more<br />

<p>Anonymous, Karl Rove and 2012 Election Fix?</p>
<p>Thom Hartmann and Sam Sacks</p>
<p>If this is true, then the implications are enormous and could take<br />
down the entire Republican Party and finally wake Americans up to the<br />
fact that our privatized vote system is shockingly flawed and insecure. </p>

<p>Anonymous Claims It Stopped Karl Rove From Hacking The Election By Hacking ORCA, We Think</p>

<p>Coup and counter-coup in Washington</p>
<p>Webster G. Tarpley and Press TV</p>
<p>ORCA: Why the Pro-Romney Vote Fraud Did Not Materialize</p>
<p>Tagg Romney and his associates, many of them investors in Bain<br />
Capital, had notoriously bought control of voting machines in almost a<br />
score of states, including Ohio. What frustrated the design to steal the<br />
 election? Perhaps this operation was disrupted and aborted by<br />
investigations conveniently timed and targeting some of the main<br />
pro-Romney intelligence and military figures in the rogue network.</p>
<p>The answer may also be related to the apparent failure of ORCA,<br />
Romney’s data-mining and data management operation, which was supposed<br />
to help GOP volunteers get out the vote, but which may have possessed<br />
additional and more sinister dimensions. But, as David Gewirtz of ZDNet<br />
wrote on November 13, ORCA “got harpooned. ORCA beached. It flopped. It<br />
died in the sun. It failed oh-so-bad.” And with it failed the hope of<br />
Romney’s backers that they could seize the White House.</p>

<p>What REALLY happened in Ohio on Election Night</p>
<p>Cliff Arnebeck and Bob Fitrakis are the two Ohio attorneys who<br />
deposed Mike Connell, and who have otherwise been working to expose Karl<br />
 Rove’s election thievery since 2004.</p>
<p>From Cliff:</p>
<p>Some hackers/spooks hacked Romney’s computers, which<br />
crippled his election day get out the vote activity. However I fail to<br />
see how this relates to Rove’s meltdown on Fox News that night.</p>
<p>A successful hack of the Romney campaign computers would have<br />
affected all of the operation, would have been illegal, and would have<br />
been known to Rove early on election day.  So, it does not explain<br />
Rove’s dramatic disconnect over Fox’s calling Ohio for Obama at the 11<br />
PM (EST) news hour.</p>
<p>The hack we discovered was limited to Ohio.  Its use was coming from<br />
Bob Urosevich  the same guy who personally delivered a malicious patch<br />
in Georgia 2002 which flipped the votes and outcome in their governor<br />
and US Senate races.  Our exposure of the problem in court through one<br />
of the top cyber security experts in the world (so certified by NSA)<br />
occurred at about 3:15 PM on election day. </p>
<p>Urosevich would have been informed that the fix had been exposed and<br />
that an Ohio judge with jurisdiction had expressed willingness to adopt<br />
the corrective action recommended by our expert. He and the one<br />
operative who would have been positioned pull the trigger, instead nixed<br />
 the operation.  Neither of them would have been so foolish as to<br />
contact Rove to inform him that the Ohio fix was off.  Rove’s<br />
communications were surely being monitored by law enforcement<br />
authorities.</p>
<p>Thus, Rove’s mistaken rant over Ohio being prematurely called for Obama.</p>

I can&#8217;t disagree with the loathing heaped on Obama, it&#8217;s pretty accurate.  But the thrust of this entire article seems to be that the old status quo must be swept away before a new order can be erected.  Obama is a tool of the elite status quo in America, but Mitt Romney IS the elite status quo.  At best, this election presents us with a choice between a frying pan and the fire.</p>
<p>I suspect the true point for this &#8220;leader&#8221; would be 2016 (if it is a Presidential Candidate, that could one of the corrupted institutions swept aside no?) The status quo battle has not been joined in full, only skirmishes along the edges (Occupy, Tea Party.)  Our nameless grey generals have not yet appeared to stop the Redcoats on their march through the city, giving hope and spark to any sort of real resistance.  Corporations still run amok unopposed in the halls of power, the FED continues to print away the Nation&#8217;s fortunes over the ignorant heads of the populace.  </p>
<p>As bad as it is, it is going to get worse.  The leader you are looking for isn&#8217;t here yet, or is not yet ready to take the stage.  Obama isn&#8217;t it, Romney isn&#8217;t it either.</p>
