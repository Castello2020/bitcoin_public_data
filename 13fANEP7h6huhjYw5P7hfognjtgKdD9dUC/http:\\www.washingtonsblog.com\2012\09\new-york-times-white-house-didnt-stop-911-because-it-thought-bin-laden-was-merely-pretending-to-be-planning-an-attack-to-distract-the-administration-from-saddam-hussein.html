<h3 style="color: #000099;">Neoconservatives Ignored CIA Because They Had Other Priorities</h3>
<p>It has been thoroughly documented that <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2008/04/911-was-foreseeable.html">9/11 was entirely foreseeable</a> &#8230; including <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/06/al-qaeda-flying-planes-into-the-world-trade-center-and-pentagon-was-foreseeable.html">Al Qaeda&#8217;s plans to fly planes into the World Trade Center and Pentagon</a>.</p>
<p>It has been extensively documented that the White House decided to invade Iraq <em><a title="before 9/11" href="http://crooksandliars.com/karoli/new-documents-show-bush-administration-plan" target="_blank">before 9/11</a></em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Former CIA director George Tenet said that the White House <a title="wanted to invade Iraq long before 9/11, and inserted “crap” in its justifications for invading Iraq." href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/27/AR2007042700550.html?nav=most_emailed" target="_blank">wanted to invade Iraq long before 9/11, and inserted “crap” in its justifications for invading Iraq.</a> Former Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill – who sat on the National Security Council – also <a title="says" href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/01/10/oneill.bush/" target="_blank">says</a> that Bush planned the Iraq war before 9/11. Top British officials <a title="say" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/nov/24/iraq-war-chilcot-inquiry" target="_blank">say</a> that the U.S. discussed Iraq regime change even before Bush took office. And in 2000, Cheney <a title="said" href="http://www.cato.org/dispatch/10-06-00d.html" target="_blank">said</a> a Bush administration might “have to take military action to forcibly remove Saddam from power.” And <a title="see this" href="http://www.aolnews.com/2011/02/08/donald-rumsfeld-files-reveal-pre-9-11-focus-on-iraq/" target="_blank">see this</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cheney made Iraqi’s oil fields a national security priority <a title="before 9/11" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2008/07/did-cheney-and-the-oil-bigs-plan-the-iraq-war-before-911.html">before 9/11</a>. And the Sunday Herald <a title="reported" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030402124132/http://www.sundayherald.com/28224" target="_blank">reported</a>: “Five months before September 11, the US advocated using force against Iraq … to secure control of its oil.” (remember that <a title="Alan   Greenspan" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110715222651/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article2461214.ece" target="_blank">Alan Greenspan</a>, <a title="John   McCain" href="http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/05/02/974014.aspx" target="_blank">John McCain</a>, <a title="George   W.

</ul>
<p>(Indeed, neoconservatives planned regime change <a title="Neoconservatives Planned Regime Change Throughout the Middle East and North Africa 20 Years Ago ?" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/11/neoconservatives-planned-regime-change-throughout-the-middle-east-and-northern-africa-20-years-ago.html" rel="next">throughout the Middle East and North Africa 20 years ago</a>; sorry, Obama fans, the neoliberals are <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/08/obama-is-implementing-plans-for-war-throughout-the-middle-east-created-10-years-ago-by-the-neocons.html">not very different</a>).</p>
<p>Right after 9/11, Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld <a title="accused Iraq of having a hand in the attacks" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/04/5-hours-after-911-attacks-rumsfeld-said.html">accused Iraq of having a hand in the attacks</a>. People may not remember now, but – at the time – the supposed Saddam-9/11 link <a title="the Saddam-911 link was at least as important in many people’s minds as a reason to invade Iraq" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0314/p02s01-woiq.html" target="_blank">was at least as important a justification for the Iraq war as the alleged weapons of mass destruction</a>.</p>
<p>Bush and Cheney then launched a <em>systematic program of torture</em> in an attempt to create <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/07/u-s-drugged-detainees-to-obtain-false-confessions.html">false evidence &#8211; through false confessions &#8211; of a link between Iraq and 9/11</a>.  The torture techniques used were <a title="Communist techniques specifically designed to produce false confessions" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/05/u-s-government-used-communist-torture-techniques-specifically-designed-to-produce-false-confessions.html"><em>Communist</em> techniques <em>specifically designed</em> to produce false<em></em> confessions</a>.</p>
<p>This claim that Iraq is linked to 9/11 has since been debunked by the <a title="9/11 Commission" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5223932/ns/us_news-security/t/panel-sees-no-link-between-iraq-al-qaida/" target="_blank">9/11 Commission</a>, top government officials, and even – long after they alleged such a link – <a title="Bush" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/sep/12/september11.usa2" target="_blank">Bush</a> and <a title="Cheney" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/06/how-important-is-cheneys-admission-that-there-was-never-any-evidence-linking-iraq-and-911.html">Cheney</a> themselves.</p>
<p>The 9/11 Commission found that the White House and its Defense Department <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/08/911-criminal-incompetence-and-ass-covering-by-the-bush-administration.html">obstructed justice in numerous ways</a> to deflect blame for 9/11.</p>
<p>Today, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/opinion/the-bush-white-house-was-deaf-to-9-11-warnings.html?_r=1">New York Times adds</a> a bizarre new wrinkle to this story:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have read excerpts from many of [the still-classified Presidential Daily Briefs] &#8230; and come to an inescapable conclusion: the administration’s reaction to what Mr. Bush was told in the weeks before that infamous briefing reflected significantly more negligence than has been disclosed. In other words, the Aug. 6 document, for all of the controversy it provoked, is not nearly as shocking as the briefs that came before it. The direct warnings to Mr. Bush about the possibility of a Qaeda attack began in the spring of 2001. By May 1, <em> <strong> <em> </em></strong></em>the Central Intelligence Agency told the White House of a report that “a group presently in the United States” was planning a terrorist operation. Weeks later, on June 22<em>,</em> the daily brief reported that Qaeda strikes could be “imminent,” although intelligence suggested the time frame was flexible.</p>
<p>But some in the administration considered the warning to be just bluster. An intelligence official and a member of the Bush administration both told me in interviews that <strong>the neoconservative leaders who had recently assumed power at the Pentagon were warning the White House that the C.I.A. had been fooled; according to this theory, Bin Laden was merely pretending to be planning an attack to distract the administration from Saddam Hussein, whom the neoconservatives saw as a greater threat</strong>.<strong> <em> <em> </em></em></strong>Intelligence officials, these sources said, protested that the idea of Bin Laden, an Islamic fundamentalist, conspiring with Mr. Hussein, an Iraqi secularist, was ridiculous, but the neoconservatives’ suspicions were nevertheless carrying the day.</p>
<p>In response, the C.I.A. prepared an analysis that all but pleaded with the White House to accept that the danger from Bin Laden was real.</p>
<p>“The U.S. is not the target of a disinformation campaign by Usama Bin Laden,” the daily brief of June 29 read, using the government’s transliteration of Bin Laden’s first name. Going on for more than a page, the document recited much of the evidence &#8230;.</p>
<p>And the C.I.A. repeated the warnings in the briefs that followed.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Yet, the White House failed to take significant action. <strong>Officials at the Counterterrorism Center of the C.I.A. grew apoplectic</strong>. On July 9, at a meeting of the counterterrorism group, one official suggested that the staff <strong>put in for a transfer so that somebody else would be responsible when the attack took place</strong>, two people who were there told me in interviews. The suggestion was batted down, they said, because there would be no time to train anyone else.</p></blockquote>

The Phrase &#8220;official story&#8221; absolutely works hand in hand with the phrase &#8220;conpiracy theory&#8221;. &#8220;Conspiracy theory&#8221; is simply the description of a story NOT told by &#8220;officials&#8221; &amp; media. </p>

<p>Lies Bushco Told About 911<br />
by Len Hart, The Existentialist Cowboy</p>
<p>On the topic of 911, we &#8211;the people &#8211;have won NO battles. Even worse &#8211;chances that we will ever win a battle for truth over bullshit, justice over obstructions of justice shrink with each passing day.</p>
<p>That is true despite the fact that the Bush conspiracy theory of 911 &#8211;a conspiracy theory of some 19 Arab &#8216;tursts&#8217; &#8211;is easily proven to be BS on its face. In short -NOTHING said by Bush about 911 was true. Here&#8217;s a very, very short list of 911 anomolies anyone of which brings down the whole rotten edifice&#8230;</p>
<p>    NO airliner crashed at the alleged site in PA. Flight 93, we were expected to believe, managed to bury itself upon impact. It&#8217;s a convenient lie designed to cover up the fact that no airliner wreckage was ever visible at the alleged &#8216;crash&#8217; site. The myths and lies can be put to rest with a simple excavation which is sure to turn up nothing because there is not now nor was there ever any wreckage at the Pentagon that was traceable to any airliner whatsoever. .</p>
<p>    WTC 7 was &#8216;pulled&#8217;. Silverstein himself said so and every demolition expert in the world knows that that is, indeed, the case. The building had been prepped.</p>
<p>    The laws of the CONSERVATON OF MATTER and ENERGY were not repealed. See any phsycist at M.I.T. to confirm that; ERGO &#8211;no airliner struck the PENTAGON and no wreckage traceable to an airliner WAS EVER recovered.</p>
<p>    KEROSENE &#8211;jet fuel is kerosene &#8211;will NEVER burn hot enough to melt or weaken steel. In addition, THERMITE was found and confirmed by experts and published in peer-reviewed papers.</p>
<p>    The BBC interviewed several &#8216;said&#8217; hijackers though they were said by Bush partisans to have died in the attacks. Dead men don&#8217;t give interviews. Another fatal flaw in the official conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>    . American Airlines is the source for information that AA Flights 11 (North Tower) and 77 (Pentagon) did not fly on 911. </p>
<p>My approach is the A. Conan Doyle approach&#8230;</p>
<p>    When you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains, however implausible, must be the truth!</p>
<p>The Bush &#8216;theory&#8217; is the only &#8216;conspiracy&#8217; theory of 911 that meets the definition of the term &#8211;conspiracy &#8211;most precisely.</p>
<p>Bush&#8217;s critics, however, rarely advance a theory at all. They are most often labeled &#8216;conspiracy theorists&#8217; for merely shooting holes in the Bush conspiracy theory. But for reasons unknown to me, millions have a mental blind spot that prevents or short-circuits rational dialogue about 911.</p>
<p>Also see: AA Exposes Bush&#8217;s &#8216;Big Lie&#8217;: Flight 11 DID NOT FLY on 911!</p>

<p>In case &#8220;webring&#8221; site comes up before Len&#8217;s site loads. Or, if you immediately hit the stop loading icon at end of address line, you can stay on Len&#8217;s website. Somebody ought to tell Len this.</p>

AA Exposes Bush&#8217;s &#8216;Big Lie&#8217;: Flight 11 DID NOT FLY on 911!<br />
by Len Hart, The Existentialist Cowboy</p>
<p>American Airlines is the source for information that AA Flights 11 (North Tower) and 77 (Pentagon) did not fly on 911. If neither flew on 911, the Bush &#8216;theory&#8217; is a lie. If the Bush &#8216;theory&#8217; is a lie, there remains only one explanation and that is: 911 was an inside job given a green-light by Bush himself.</p>
<p>These flights are critical to the the government&#8217;s crumbling cover up! Conan Doyle, the brilliant creator of the character Sherlock Holmes, said: &#8220;When you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains however implausible must be the truth!&#8221; Bush&#8217;s official conspiracy theory of 911 is not only impossible, it&#8217;s absurd and insulting to intelligent people!</p>
<p>The Bush Conspiracy Theory is impossible! And it is a Lie</p>
<p>There is, then, probable cause to indict Bush and his co-conspirators for the crimes of mass murder and high treason. See: U. S. Codes, Title 18, Section 2441. That includes every statement made by Bush.</p>
<p>WikiScanner discovered that it was American Airlines itself which changed their Wikipedia entry to state that Flights 11 and 77 did not fly on 9/11. The original entry was as follows:</p>
<p>    Two American Airlines aircraft were hijacked and crashed during the September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack: American Airlines Flight 77 (a Boeing 757) and American Airlines Flight 11 (a Boeing 767).</p>
<p>New entry [as of the date of this article] is as follows and includes the bolded text below:</p>
<p>    Two American Airlines aircraft were hijacked and crashed during the September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack: Flight 77 (a Boeing 757) and Flight 11 (a Boeing 767).</p>
<p>    Although these flights were daily departures before and a month after September 11, 2001. Neither flight 11 nor 77 were scheduled on September 11, 2001. The records kept by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (www.bts.gov/gis/) do not list either flight that day.</p>
<p>    &#8211;Wikipedia</p>
<p>To make the point: the source for these changes is American Airlines by making changes to Wikipedia. The &#8216;story&#8217; is not about Wiki. The story is about a fact that is consistent with the observed fact that 1) no wreckage traceable to any airliner was ever recovered at the Pentagon. That the flight was not scheduled AND 2) that no wreckage traceable to the flight was ever found nor revealed by Bushco.</p>
<p>Instead, Bushco ordered the felony destruction of evidence i.e, wreckage that most certainly would have been verified and traced &#8211;not to an airliner but to a U.S. Global Hawk!</p>
<p>The ONLY rotor that was documented despite Bush&#8217;s crime of felony destruction of evidence is evidence in itself that it was NOT an airliner that struck the Pentagon.</p>
<p>The story is about how &#8216;corrections&#8217; to the official story originated with and from inside AA.</p>
<p>The story is about the fact that the evidence that Flights 11 and 77 were not flying on 911 comes from American Airlines itself. Just as no wreckage traceable to any 757 was ever recovered from the Pentagon, there is, likewise, no indisputable or official record that the flight &#8211;mothballed for some six months &#8211;was ever put back into service. And, if it had been, the burden of proof is upon Bushco and his league of liars to SHOW ME THE WRECKAGE!!!!</p>
<p>    According to a Freedom of Information Act reply from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), the last known pre-9/11 flights for three of the four aircraft involved in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 took place in December, 2000, nine months before the attacks, while no pre-9/11 final flight information was provided for American Airlines flight 77 (N644AA).</p>
<p>    However, a discovered searchable online BTS database produces the following search results for three of the four 9/11 aircraft on September 10, 2001:</p>
<p>    AA 11 departs San Francisco (SFO): AA 09/10/2001 0198 (flight number) N334AA (tail number) BOS (destination) 22:04 (wheels-off time)</p>
<p>    UA 175 departs San Francisco (SFO): UA 09/10/2001 0170 (flight number) N612UA (tail number) BOS (destination) 13:44 (wheels-off time)</p>
<p>    UA 93 departs San Francisco (SFO): UA 09/10/2001 0078 (flight number) N591UA (tail number) EWR (destination) 23:15 (wheels-off time)<br />
    &#8211;911 Blogger, UPDATE: U.S. BTS FOIA Records For 9/11 Planes Differ From BTS Online Database [The records were obtained by Adrian Monaghan]</p>
<p>The question is raised: how do we know who made the changes to Wiki? Everyone logged on to the internet does so from an IP address. In this case, the IP is that of American Airlines. It&#8217;s traceable.</p>
<p>My own WHOIS lookup as well as my Google search of the IP address proves conclusively that the change originated from American Airlines itself. That is consistent with the fact that no wreckage traceable to any 757 was ever recovered. If it had been, you can bet that the Bush administration would have put every scrap on parade. They didn&#8217;t!</p>
<p>Therefore, the Bush theory of 911 is a deliberate lie.</p>
<p>My look up returned the following:</p>

<p>In previous articles, I pointed out the fact that mere scraps that were found lying around on the Pentagon lawn where quickly gathered by white shirted geeks. It was the only wreckage of any kind that was found on the Pentagon lawn. It included ONE engine compressor rotor! It was about one-third the diameter of two much larger compressor rotors that would have been left behind had a 757, indeed, ANY airliner crashed the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Last time I checked, the GOP had not managed to repeal the laws of physics, in this case, the law of the conservation of matter and energy. Simply, the wreckage found at the Pentagon when gathered would have weighed several tons; in other words, it would have weighed as much as a 757 minus passengers and fuel. Instead &#8211;the only wreckage gathered was carted off on the shoulders of four or five white-shirted, skinny geeks! Several tons? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>Bottom line: NO WRECKAGE TRACEABLE TO A 757 was EVER found at the Pentagon. I do not believe that the laws of the conservation of matter and energy [See: conservation of matter and energy, M.I.T.] were repealed by Bush however much he might have wanted to do so.</p>
<p>SHOW ME THE WRECKAGE and TRACE IT TO A 757!!</p>
<p>We can expect a gang of crooks and liars to cover up their own misdeeds but to cover-up the work of an &#8216;alleged&#8217; gang of terrorists only makes them look guilty. It makes them look guilty because the only remaining alternative is that Bushco is motivated to destroy evidence. Only those who are guilty of crimes are thus motivated. In this case, only Bushco is motivated to 1) lie about 911 2) order the destruction of evidence as he, in fact, did with respect to the Pentagon and the towers in New York; 3) try to intimidate those questioning the official lie by branding them traitors and/or subversives.</p>
<p>One of Many Fatal Holes in the Bush Official Conspiracy Theory</p>
<p>The many lies (many referenced in previous EC articles; see links below) are probable cause to begin a Federal Grand Jury investigation of George W. Bush&#8217;s role in 911. Bush should be compelled by subpoena and Federal Marshals to testify under oath before an independent Federal Grand Jury. The AA revelations demand it!</p>
<p>911 did not happen as we have been told.</p>
<p>Bushco&#8217;s &#8216;official conspiracies theory&#8217; of 911 is full of holes. Flights 11 and 77 are essential ingredients in the &#8216;official conspiracy theory&#8217; of 911. That AA claims that neither 11 nor 77 were in the air that day sinks Bush&#8217;s theory. Clearly &#8211;the official theory is a lie, an intentional cover-up. Cover-ups imply guilt! Otherwise &#8211;what is there to cover up? The official &#8216;lie&#8217; goes like this:</p>
<p>    At 8:20, Flight 11 stopped transmitting its transponder signal, and veered northward and departed dramatically from the westward heading of its planned route. The controllers concluded that the plane had probably been hijacked. 4 5 At 8:24, the following transmission was reportedly received from Flight 11: We have some planes. Just stay quiet and you&#8217;ll be okay .. we are returning to the airport</p>
<p>    ..Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If you try to make any moves, you&#8217;ll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet. Nobody move please we are going back to the airport .. don&#8217;t try to make any stupid moves. 6<br />
    Neither of the pilots pressed the distress call button. At 8:28 controllers reportedly watched the plane make a 100-degree turn toward the south. 7 Presumably, Flight 11 continued south along the Hudson River until it reached the World Trade Center, though documentation of this is sparse given the lack of public information.<br />
    According to NORAD&#8217;s September 18 timeline, the FAA did not notify NORAD of the signs that Flight 11 was hijacked until 8:40, 25 minutes after the first signs of trouble. 8 </p>
<p>    &#8211;Flight 11, The First Jet Commandeered on September 11th, 911 Research </p>
<p>Simply: if AA Flight 11 was not in the air, it could not have struck the towers; ergo: the Bush theory is false!</p>
<p>The house of cards collapses.</p>
<p>Assertions that Flight 11 struck the North Tower that are utterly baseless! If neither Flight 11 mor 77 was in the air that day, the Bush administration&#8217;s version of events must be utterly discarded.</p>
<p>If flights 11 or 77 did not fly on 911, officialdom must come up with another explanation to explain the the events of 911.</p>
<p>No wreckage traceable to a 757 was ever found at the Pentagon.</p>
<p>One would not expect to find wreckage of a flight never flown. What is significant with respect to the changes to Wiki, with respect to BTS/NTSB records is that the burden of proof is now placed upon Bushco to prove its theory. Bush et al should be compelled to prove the official theory &#8211;or face charges resulting from the probable cause that Bush himself and high ranking members of his administration participated in the crimes of mass murder and high treason!<br />
Photos of an engine rotor appear to depict an engine used in the Global Hawk, a payload carrying missile that was, according to Britain&#8217;s International Television News, flown from the US to Australia completely by remote control. &#8220;A robot plane has made aviation history by becoming the first unmanned aircraft to fly across the Pacific Ocean.&#8221;<br />
Britain&#8217;s ITN continued:</p>
<p>    &#8220;The Global Hawk, a jet-powered aircraft with a wingspan equivalent to a Boeing 737, flew from Edwards Air Force Base in California and landed late on Monday at the Royal Australian Air Force base at Edinburgh, in South Australia state&#8230; It flies along a pre-programmed flight path, but a pilot monitors the aircraft during its flight via a sensor suite which provides infra-red and visual images.&#8221;</p>
<p>ITN quoted Australian Global Hawk manager Rod Smith: &#8220;The aircraft essentially flies itself, right from takeoff, right through to landing, and even taxiing off the runway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;The Missile that Struck this Building&#8217; &#8211;Don Rumsfeld</p>
<p>The Global Hawk is a much better candidate for what Rumsfeld called &#8216;&#8230;the missile that struck this building&#8217; than a 757. Here&#8217;s what you need to know about the Pentagon.</p>
<p>    Only minutes after the strike, [see pic above] there is no sign of an airliner at all!!<br />
    No wreckage traceable to a 757 was ever recovered.<br />
    Only ONE engine rotor (seen in photos) was recovered! This rotor is about one third the diameter of a 757 rotor, i.e about the size of a U.S. Global Hawk rotor.<br />
    A 757 has two rotors, each of which are nearly three times the size of the SINGLE rotor located at the Pentagon. Again &#8211;only one rotor was found in Pentagon debris.<br />
    Engine rotors are made of a Steel/Titanium alloy to withstand high temps inside jet engines and would have been found had they been there.<br />
    Flight 77 could not and did not crash into the Pentagon. That may be because Flt 77 had been mothballed and had not flown for some 6 months and that&#8217;s according to airline records.</p>
<p>No Arabs Were on Board 77</p>
<p>If no Arabs were on board Flight 77, Bush&#8217;s theory must be trashed! There is not only no evidence to support the theory that Arab terrorists hijacked 77, there is every reason to believe that none of ever got on board. There are no Arabs on the only Pentagon &#8216;evidence&#8217; that is admissible in court: the &#8216;Official Autopsy Report&#8217; of Pentagon victims.</p>
<p>The autopsy report was released to Dr. Olmsted in response to his FOIA request. In a &#8216;neat&#8217; cover-up, a 911 memorial lists all victims of whatever it was that crashed into the Pentagon. At the same time, 77 victims were said to have been buried at Arlington National Cemetery. All are Pentagon employees! Where, then, are the passengers buried? I would be very surprised to learn that there were passengers on a flight that cannot be proven to have existed.</p>
<p>Whatever crashed into the Pentagon was described by a witnesses as looking like a &#8216;hump-backed whale&#8217;. Rumsfeld himself called it a missile: Below: a US Global Hawk painted to look like an AA airliner. It is both a &#8216;missile&#8217; and it also has a hump back! It &#8216;fills the bill&#8217;.</p>
<p>The photo below does not purport to be the craft that would ultimately crash into the Pentagon. It merely demonstrates how easily such a &#8216;paint job&#8217; could dupe those who are 1) not experts on aircraft 2) saw it only for a second or less as it scooted across the Pentagon lawn as NO 757 could possibly have done 3) were, in any case, caught off guard.<br />
Recognizing lies for what they are is a part of the process of growing up! America, it is time to grow up! It is time to confront this heinous pack of lies! It is time to insist that the Obama administration begin a REAL investigation of 911.</p>
<p>It is time to insist that a Federal Grand Jury investigate every count of high treason, mass murder and domestic terrorism that was perpetrated upon the people of the U.S. by the Bush administration, his collaborators in the Pentagon, K-Street, the Congress and the leadership of the Republican party, Marvin Bush&#8217;s &#8216;Securacom&#8217;, Larry Silverstein who ordered WTC 7 be &#8216;pulled&#8217;, General Myers, Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney and, of course, George W. Bush who was, at the time, the &#8216;Commander-in-Chief&#8217; and ultimately responsible for the orders given the US military to &#8216;stand down&#8217;.</p>
<p>    By Donald Rumsfeld&#8217;s own admission, he was unaware of any threats to the Pentagon &#8212; the building where he was located during the September 11th attacks &#8212; until an aircraft crashed into the side of it, and he ran out &#8220;into the smoke&#8221; to see if it might be a &#8220;A bomb? I had no idea.&#8221; (ABC News This Week, Interview 9/16/01).</p>
<p>    Well, that&#8217;s a pretty tall tale by any standard. The New York Times reported that by 8:13am, the FAA was aware of the first hijacking out of Boston. The Pentagon explosion, which Donald Rumsfeld claimed he had &#8220;no idea,&#8221; did not occur until approximately 9:37am, nearly an hour and a half later, this after two of the tallest buildings in the world were devastated. Note that a plane hijacked out of Boston can reach Washington D.C. as easily as it can reach New York City.</p>
<p>    It was widely reported that Pentagon personnel were indeed aware of the threats to their security, and they took security measures on that morning. But not the &#8220;Secretary of Defense.&#8221; Why should the man charged with defending the United States of America concern himself with hijacked aircraft?</p>
<p>    There is a set of procedures for responding to hijackings. In particular, these procedures were changed on June 1, 2001 while Rumsfeld was in power as our Secretary of Defense, in a document called: &#8220;CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF INSTRUCTION, J-3 CJCSI 3610.01A&#8221;</p>
<p>The video asks: &#8220;Was 911 a Conspiracy?&#8221; That is not the question. Even Bushco claims that it was a conspiracy &#8211;a conspiracy of 19 Arab Hijackers who could not possibly have pulled it off. It&#8217;s a stupid theory; without the shock and awe campaign, no one would have believed it.</p>
<p>The questions, rather, are which conspiracy and who were the conspirators? It was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#8217;s character Sherlock Holmes who said that when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains however improbable MUST be the truth!</p>
<p>There has been a spate of fallacious comments of the form: &#8220;&#8230;uh&#8230;what happened the passengers, dude?&#8221;. A few points:</p>
<p>    the &#8216;question&#8217; is, in fact, an implied statement and ASSUMES there were flights! It assumes there were passengers! If there were &#8211;in fact &#8211;passengers one would have expected to have found their names on the official autopsy report. One would have expected to find in the public records the time and location of their burials.<br />
    But &#8211;alas &#8211;there are NO Arab names whatsoever on the ONLY official/admissible scrap of evidence to have survived the Bush cover-up of 911! That would be the official autopsy report! There is simply no evidence of any passengers, no evidence that any flight alleged by Bush to have crashed in either NY or the Pentagon flew at all on that fateful day! In a court, it would be said that any statement with respect to &#8216;passengers&#8217; that &#8216;it assumes facts NOT in evidence&#8217;!<br />
    Absence of evidence is not evidence! It is certainly not evidence in support of anything, let alone Bush&#8217;s idiotic, fallacious and pernicious lie! The &#8216;absence of bodies&#8217; is not evidence of a crash of any sort; only the presence of bodies traceable to the alleged flights would have been evidence in support of Bush. Alas &#8211;there were none! Ergo: Bush lied! This &#8216;theory&#8217; is bunk and bullshit!</p>
<p>The only available evidence, moreover, disproves the Bushco conspiracy theory of 911. There is no evidence whatsoever that there were &#8211;at any time &#8211;any Arabs of any sort (terrorist or otherwise) on board Flight 77, a flight for which there is no evidence whatsoever. Even the Washington Post is on record having reported that Hani Hanjour could not have been on board; he did NOT have a ticket. Skinny Hanjour is said to have been very slight, perhaps less than a hundred pounds. Are we to believe he over-powered people at the gate? In any case, there is simply no evidence of that, nor was it reported, nor is it credible.</p>
<p>Also &#8211;among the flight information released to an professional pilots association NTSB data that proves that the cockpit door was NEVER opened during the flight. Are we to believe that Hanjour managed to walk through a closed door into the cockpit? Was he sooo skinny he was able to slide under a close cockpit door. Really! The Bush theory is not merely impossible, it&#8217;s increasingly absurd, stupid and amateurish. Anyone &#8216;duped&#8217; by this B_______ should be ashamed of themselves.</p>
<p>    The AFIP suggest these numbers; 189 killed, 125 worked at the Pentagon and 64 were &#8220;passengers&#8221; on the plane. The AA list only had 56 and the list just obtained has 58. They did not explain how they were able to tell &#8220;victims&#8221; bodies from &#8220;hijacker&#8221; bodies. In fact, from the beginning NO explanation has been given for the extra five suggested in news reports except that the FBI showed us the pictures to make up the difference, and that makes it so.</p>
<p>    Now, being the trusting sort, I figured that the government would want to quickly dispel any rumors so we could get on with the chore of kicking Osama/Sadaam&#8217;s butt (weren&#8217;t these originally two different people?). It seemed simple to me. . .produce the names of all the bodies identified by the AFIP and compare it with the publicized list of passengers. So, I sent a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the AFIP and asked for an expedited response, because we were getting ready to send our boys to war on the pretext that Osama/Saddam had done the deed. Fourteen months later, a few US soldiers dead, many Iraqi civilians pushing up daisies, and I finally get the list. Believe me that they weren&#8217;t a bit happy to give it up, and I really have no idea why they choose now to release it.</p>
<p>    foia-10003.jpg</p>
<p>    No Arabs wound up on the morgue slab; however, three ADDITIONAL people not listed by American Airlines sneaked in. I have seen no explanation for these extras. I did American the opportunity to &#8220;revise&#8221; their original list, but they have not responded. The new names are: Robert Ploger, Zandra Ploger, and Sandra Teague. The AFIP claims that the only &#8220;passenger&#8221; body that they were not able to identify is the toddler, Dana Falkenberg, whose parents and young sister are on the list of those identified. The satanic masterminds behind this caper may be feeling pretty smug about the perfect crime, but they have left a raft of clues tying these unfortunates together.</p>
<p>    &#8211;Thomas R. Olmsted, M.D., Autopsy: No Arabs on Flight 77</p>
<p>Worth repeating and in summary:</p>
<p>    &#8230;the last known pre-9/11 flights for three of the four aircraft involved in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 took place in December, 2000, nine months before the attacks.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t wish to belabor the point but it must be made clear that unaccounted for passengers is among the biggest holes in Bush&#8217;s cover story, Bush&#8217;s big, treasonous lie.</p>
<p>If Bush cannot explain the absence of airliner wreckage or the alleged &#8216;missing passengers&#8217;, then his official theory must be discounted. It was Conan Doyle&#8217;s character, Sherlock Holmes, who said: &#8220;When you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains, however implausible, must be the truth!&#8221; But, of course, finding, learning, revealing the truth was never on the Bushco agenda. Seizing unjustifiable war powers was!</p>
<p>The burden of proof is upon anyone believing and/or asserting that the alleged flights existed. A mass movement of Americans to include members of Congress should have insisted insisted that a Federal Prosecutor put Bush on the witness stand in front of a federal grand jury where the following question would be put to him: &#8216;what was the fate of the passengers on flights 77 and 11?&#8217;</p>
<p>It would be very interesting to learn how he might escape the experience without being indicted for:</p>
<p>        PERJURY<br />
        OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE<br />
        MASS MURDER</p>
<p>Concerning possible charges of &#8216;high treason&#8217; against Bush: was it not Bush who declared that we were at war? Was it not Bush and his shills who insisted that the US attack, invasion and occupation of Iraq was in response to an &#8216;attack&#8217; upon the US? Have not Bush partisans insisted, from the &#8216;gitgo&#8217; that the U.S. attack, invasion and occupation of Iraq was part and parcel of the US &#8216;war on terrorism&#8217;? That being the case, Bush&#8217;s complicity in the events of 911 are most certainly acts of betrayal against a sovereign in a time of war and, therefore, high treason.</p>
<p>Among a growing number of links back to this article is this excellent expose of the Flight 77 fraud:</p>
<p>    According to the official story, AA Flight 77, a Boeing 757, took off from Dulles Airport in northern Virginia at 8:10 a.m. bound for Los Angeles, with between 50 and 58 passengers. It flew west for about 45 minutes, making a curious detour to the north, west and south, before turning around and flying for another 45 minutes back to Washington. Why hijackers would allow a jet which they planned to crash into a target in Washington to fly for 45 minutes away from its target is not explained. Why did they not commandeer the plane ten minutes after takeoff when the plane was only ten minutes flying time from its intended target? The official story ignores this question, as it does all other questions.</p>
<p>    As reported by the New York Times (International Herald Tribune, 2001-10-17, p.8), as AA 77 approached the Pentagon it executed a 270-degree 7,000-foot descent over Washington while flying at 500 mph. It approached the Pentagon on a horizontal trajectory so low that it clipped the power lines across the street then (so the story goes) it smashed into an outer wall of the Pentagon.</p>
<p>    We were told (and, of course, expected to believe without question) that this maneuver was executed by an Arab pilot, Hani Hanjour, who in August 2001 was judged by the chief flight instructor at Bowie&#8217;s Maryland Freeway Airport as not having the piloting skills required to fly a Cessna 172 solo. (Is there something fishy here?)</p>
<p>    In contrast to the attention given to the collapse of the Twin Towers, the attack on the Pentagon received little attention until in February 2002 a French website (by Thierry Meyssan) appeared which reproduced images obtained from U.S. Army websites: Hunt the Boeing! These images cast doubt upon the official story that the Pentagon was hit by a Boeing 757 jetliner. For example, here is a picture of the Pentagon crash site taken about two hours after the impact, with the fire still burning. Can you see any remains of the approximately 100 tons of metal (including engines, wings, and tail section) which makes up a Boeing 757? &#8230;</p>
<p>    &#8211;Pentagon Official Story Hoax</p>
<p>The FBI doesn&#8217;t believe the &#8216;official conspiracy theory&#8217; of 911. Why should you?</p>
<p>The FBI has admitted, officially, that it cannot find any &#8216;evidence&#8217; or documentation to support popular myths that some four airliners were hijacked by terrorists and used as weapons on 911. Moreover, the FBI itself admits that &#8220;&#8230; no records would have been generated responsive to plaintiffs request for documents.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, even the FBI concedes that there is no admissible, no official evidence to support Bush&#8217;s lies about 911. Their investigation, says the FBI, was based upon the never questioned assumption that the said flights had been hijacked. The key word in the FBI statement is: ASSUMPTION. The FBI is overly polite. &#8216;Assumption&#8217; by Bushco is unacceptable! But a better description of Bush and company is &#8216;bald-faced lie&#8217; purpose of which was two-fold: 1) obstruct justice 2) protect the guilty and prevent their prosecution for the crimes of high treason and mass murder!</p>
<p>The Co-chairs of the 911 Commission don&#8217;t believe the official theory; why should you?</p>

<p> Lies Bushco Told About 911<br />
by Len Hart, The Existentialist Cowboy</p>
<p>On the topic of 911, we &#8211;the people &#8211;have won NO battles. Even worse &#8211;chances that we will ever win a battle for truth over bullshit, justice over obstructions of justice shrink with each passing day.</p>
<p>That is true despite the fact that the Bush conspiracy theory of 911 &#8211;a conspiracy theory of some 19 Arab &#8216;tursts&#8217; &#8211;is easily proven to be BS on its face. In short -NOTHING said by Bush about 911 was true. Here&#8217;s a very, very short list of 911 anomolies anyone of which brings down the whole rotten edifice&#8230;</p>
<p>    NO airliner crashed at the alleged site in PA. Flight 93, we were expected to believe, managed to bury itself upon impact. It&#8217;s a convenient lie designed to cover up the fact that no airliner wreckage was ever visible at the alleged &#8216;crash&#8217; site. The myths and lies can be put to rest with a simple excavation which is sure to turn up nothing because there is not now nor was there ever any wreckage at the Pentagon that was traceable to any airliner whatsoever. .</p>
<p>    WTC 7 was &#8216;pulled&#8217;. Silverstein himself said so and every demolition expert in the world knows that that is, indeed, the case. The building had been prepped.</p>
<p>    The laws of the CONSERVATON OF MATTER and ENERGY were not repealed. See any phsycist at M.I.T. to confirm that; ERGO &#8211;no airliner struck the PENTAGON and no wreckage traceable to an airliner WAS EVER recovered.</p>
<p>    KEROSENE &#8211;jet fuel is kerosene &#8211;will NEVER burn hot enough to melt or weaken steel. In addition, THERMITE was found and confirmed by experts and published in peer-reviewed papers.</p>
<p>    The BBC interviewed several &#8216;said&#8217; hijackers though they were said by Bush partisans to have died in the attacks. Dead men don&#8217;t give interviews. Another fatal flaw in the official conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>    . American Airlines is the source for information that AA Flights 11 (North Tower) and 77 (Pentagon) did not fly on 911. </p>
<p>My approach is the A. Conan Doyle approach&#8230;</p>
<p>    When you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains, however implausible, must be the truth!</p>
<p>The Bush &#8216;theory&#8217; is the only &#8216;conspiracy&#8217; theory of 911 that meets the definition of the term &#8211;conspiracy &#8211;most precisely.</p>
<p>Bush&#8217;s critics, however, rarely advance a theory at all. They are most often labeled &#8216;conspiracy theorists&#8217; for merely shooting holes in the Bush conspiracy theory. But for reasons unknown to me, millions have a mental blind spot that prevents or short-circuits rational dialogue about 911.</p>

<p>The Bush &#8216;theory&#8217; is the only &#8216;conspiracy&#8217; theory of 911 that meets the definition of the term &#8211;conspiracy &#8211;most precisely.</p>
<p>Bush&#8217;s critics, however, rarely advance a theory at all. They are most often labeled &#8216;conspiracy theorists&#8217; for merely shooting holes in the Bush conspiracy theory. But for reasons unknown to me, millions have a mental blind spot that prevents or short-circuits rational dialogue about 911.</p>

<p>Robert Parry, An American journalist and author says: “In the neocon (mostly Zionist Jews) world view, “regime change” in Iraq would be the great “game changer,” setting in motion the toppling of hostile governments in Syria and Iran – and ultimately enabling Israel to dictate surrender terms to its close-in adversaries, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza“.</p>
<p>Paul Craig Roberts says: “The 9/11 “investigation” that finally took place was a political one run from the White House. One member of the commission resigned, declaring the investigation to be a farce, and both co-chairman and the legal counsel of the 9/11 Commission distanced themselves from their report with statements that the 9/11 Commission was “set up to fail,” that resources were withheld from the commission, that representatives of the US military lied to the commission and that the commission considered referring the false testimony for criminal prosecution&#8221;.</p>

I&#8217;ve tried to find it online, but none of the clips on the CBS website include the relevant section of the interview. The relevant portion is shown on tonight&#8217;s episode of The Young Turks on Current (though he doesn&#8217;t highlight the insanity of this comment). This episode isn&#8217;t online yet, so I can&#8217;t provide a link, but I imagine it will be online soon.</p>
<p>On CBS This Morning today, Eichenwald said “…the neoconservatives at the Pentagon, as the CIA was coming in saying ‘AQ is going to attack’, said ‘oh, pfft, this is just a false flag operation; bin Laden is just trying to take our eye off of the real threat, Iraq”.</p>
<p>Clearly similar to a quote in the NYT OpEd bolded above, but with the addition of one key phrase (can you guess which one)? If called on it, I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll say he misspoke. What could he possibly have meant otherwise, and how can &#8220;false flag&#8221; be a word you accidentally use? Even if you ignore that he ever said that and just go by the NYT OpEd, he&#8217;s still saying that it was widely believed in the Pentagon that OBL was working on some kind of fake attack. Why did the Pentagon have this information and the CIA didn&#8217;t, what was the nature of this information, and is this something the public and the commission have been aware of? That is, did the 9/11 commission know about this fake plan? Personally, I don&#8217;t know, so if these questions have been answered I&#8217;m happy to shut my yap. But literally all discussion I&#8217;ve read on this today (besides here) has focused only on the pre-attack warnings to Bush.</p>

<p>&#8220;The President of the Italian Supreme Court, Fernando Imposimato, has reportedly called for a criminal investigation into the tragic attacks on September 11, 2001 and even went as far as to draw connections between historical “false flag” incidents such as those organized by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Italy as part of Operation Gladio (which some claim has reared its ugly head once more).</p>
<p>In a quite vitriolic letter published by the Journal of 9/11 Studies, Imposimato pulls no punches, opening the letter with the searing statement, “The 9/11 attacks were a global state terror operation permitted by the administration of the USA, which had foreknowledge of the operation yet remained intentionally unresponsive in order to make war against Afghanistan and Iraq.”</p>

<p>AA Exposes Bush&#8217;s &#8216;Big Lie&#8217;:  Flight 11 DID NOT FLY on 911!</p>
<p>by Len Hart, The Existentialist Cowboy</p>
<p>American Airlines is the source for information that AA Flights 11<br />
(North Tower) and  77 (Pentagon) did not fly on 911. If neither flew on<br />
911, the Bush &#8216;theory&#8217; is a lie. If the Bush &#8216;theory&#8217; is a lie, there<br />
remains only one explanation and that is: 911 was an inside job given a<br />
green-light by Bush himself.</p>

In June 28, 2001, Osama was found within his secret hideout, not by the FBI or CIA, but by a CNN reporter and his camera crew, and conducted an interview. They interviewed him and left. Then on June 29, 2001, the CIA warn the White House of an imminent terrorist attack by Osama Bin Laden? CIA can&#8217;t find him, yet a CNN reporter and his camera crew can? Absolute bullshit.</p>
<p>How long will it take for people to realize 9/11 was an inside job?</p>
