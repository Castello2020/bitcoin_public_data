<h3 style="color: #000099;">Yes, The Big Banks DO Care If We Move Our Money</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/11/local-governments-churches-community-groups-prominent-business-men-and-others-are-all-divesting-from-big-corrupt-banks.html">650,000 customers moved $4.5 billion dollars</a> out of the big banks and into smaller banks and credit unions in the last month.</p>
<p>But there is a myth making the rounds that the big banks don&#8217;t really <span style="font-style: italic;">care </span>if we move our money. For example, one line of reasoning is that no matter how many people move their money, the Fed and Treasury will just bail out the giants again.</p>
<p>But many anecdotes show that the too big to fails do, in fact, care.</p>
<p>Initially, of course, if the big banks really didn&#8217;t care, they wouldn&#8217;t have <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/10/big-banks-refuse-to-let-people-close-accounts.html">prevented protesters from closing their accounts</a>.</p>
<p>NBC <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45176720/ns/local_news-los_angeles_ca">notes</a> that &#8211; in response to inquiries regarding how many people have moved their money &#8211; Bank of America refused to provide figures, and instead sent the following defensive email:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Bank of America continues to be a great place for customers to manage their everyday finances and achieve their savings goals,&#8221; [Colleen Haggerty, a spokeswoman for Bank of America's Southern California operations] said in an email. &#8220;We offer customers more choice and convenience, including industry-leading fraud protection, access to thousands of banking centers and ATMs, and the best online and mobile banking, which allow customers to bank on their terms 24/7.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>A writer <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/11/04/1033303/-The-bank-said-Youll-be-back?via=sidebar">noted</a> at Daily Kos:</p>
<blockquote><p>At Wells Fargo, my sister walked up to the teller and politely asked to close her account. The teller said, &#8220;No problem.&#8221; She pulled up her account and saw the balance and told her that due to the amount she had to speak with the branch manager. The branch manager came out. He was probably 30 years old and was very arrogant. He asked my sister why she wanted to close her account and my sister told him she thought Wells Fargo was part of the problem with the economy. He went thru some talking points about why she shouldn&#8217;t move her money, but my sister didn&#8217;t back down. When he asked her where she was going she told him that she would be banking at the North Carolina State Employees Credit Union. She isn&#8217;t a state employee, but anyone can join if you are related to a state employee. It turns out her husband is. Anyway, the bankster told her &#8220;You&#8217;ll be back. Credit unions can&#8217;t provide the services you need.&#8221; We&#8217;ll see about that. She withdrew over $200k from Wells Fargo.</p>
<p>Next we went to Bank of America. I closed my last account with hardly any questions asked. Of course, I had taken most of my money out so there wasn&#8217;t much left to take. My sister on the other hand had a large balance in multiple accounts. They actually refused to cut her a check for the full amounts. They only gave her 1/3 of her money and told her she&#8217;d have to come back to withdraw the rest. They claimed they were only allowed to make checks for a certain amount, and that they had no authority to cut additional checks on the same day. Stupid BofA. She had her check in hand and politely told off the branch manager when he told her she had to come back another day or two to withdraw the rest.</p>
<p>At BofA, we weren&#8217;t the only ones closing accounts. There was a line of people. Most had small accounts because they weren&#8217;t even being challenged, but she actually had to wait in line to speak with a branch manager.</p>
<p>At SunTrust, the branch manager went off his rocker. He just kept asking her &#8220;is there anything I can do or anything I can say to change your mind?&#8221; He asked probably twenty times. He even offered to have the market executive meet with her and hear out her concerns. She told him she wasn&#8217;t interested. He really looked nervous about it.</p></blockquote>
<p>And a writer at Daily Bail <a href="http://dailybail.com/home/move-your-money-bank-of-america-branch-manager-begs-customer.html">pointed out</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I went in, asked to speak with a banker and was seated in an office. When the young associate came in and asked the purpose of my visit, I handed her my ATM card and requested that she tell me the balance. When she did, I then asked for a cashiers check in that amount. That&#8217;s when things got wonky. She froze, stumbled over her words and asked why I needed that amount (It was not a small sum). This gave me an opportunity to explain that although I personally would not be affected by their new fees I know plenty of friends and family that would feel the pain. In solidarity with them, I wished to close the account and move on. She unwittingly suggested that if I just use my debit card once a month then there would be no fee. That was good for a belly laugh from me, then I again requested the balance to be issued to me in the form of a cashier&#8217;s check. She then told me that there would be a $10 fee for this service. Another laugh. I guess it didn&#8217;t sink in when I told her that I was fee adverse. There was an easy work-around anyway &#8211; I requested the cash. That finished my time with this associate banker as the amount I was requesting was &#8220;well past&#8221; her daily limit for withdrawals. I asked if there would be an issue with securing the cash and she said &#8220;I honestly don&#8217;t know if we have that here&#8221; and walked out to get the branch manager.</p>
<p>The manager was pleasant enough and very direct. After introducing herself she flat out asked &#8220;What can we do to change your mind?&#8221; &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to see you go&#8221; she emphasized. This opened a door for me to further explain my decision to leave the bank and why I was doing it. Amazingly, it did not fall on deaf ears. She indicated that understood where I was coming from and actually showed genuine surprise at some of the facts I provided her about the less than consumer friendly policies and machinations of her employer. She did make some feeble counter-arguments and repeatedly asked me if I would change my mind (with a hint of desperation!). I stood firm and by the end of our conversation she asked if I would be willing to put it all in writing so she could send it up the chain.</p>
<p><strong>She shared that management is nervous, they are seeing money leaking out of the bank and realize that they have made mistakes&#8230;. They are also aware of the growing momentum behind the November 5th move your money movement</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p><strong>Management is aware that people are angry (how could they not be!) and have put an ear to the ground</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hundreds of similar stories are being told all over America.</p>
<p>Even though the government may <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/10/the-only-way-to-save-the-economy-break-up-the-giant-insolvent-banks.html">keep throwing money at the dinosaurs</a>, the <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/09/will-the-basel-iii-bank-regulations-change-anything.html">Basel regulations </a>do have <span style="font-style: italic;">some </span>capital requirements, and so the big banks need to bring in <span style="font-style: italic;">some </span>actual deposits to fund their <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/01/less-than-a-tenth-of-bank-of-americas-assets-comes-from-traditional-banking-deposits.html">casino gambling</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, if too many depositors leave, the illusion that the big banks are serving the American public will be burst, and a critical mass of consciousness will occur, so that the banks&#8217; unquestioned control over the American political and financial systems will start to be questioned.</p>
<p>So moving our money is an effective step towards <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/11/real-capitalists-move-our-money.html">reclaiming America</a>.</p>

If you want US manufacturing to come back.  Start buying local at every occasion.  It&#8217;s hard to do.  But, if you think of money as energy.  Going to a big box store  creates a direct economic short that sucks the money out of your community.  At a Ma and Pa, the money stays in your place.  America, keep up the good work!!!

When the banks begin laying off their employees, I would love to begin speaking with any of these people individually to discuss viability in bringing claims against their former employers under Section 922 of the Dodd-Frank Act for any acts of corruption which these former employees may have specific knowledge.  These types of claims can be submitted anonymously if the party is represented by an attorney.  The claimant will share in a substantial percentage of any penalties assessed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against the financial institution.   It is time to hold this sector of business responsible for their misdeeds.  I&#8217;m happy to see people beginning to take ownership of their country&#8217;s destiny rather than leaving decisions to be made largely for the benefit of those who are buying off the politicians in this country.</p>

<p>However, there are consequences to this beyond a branch manager or CFO&#8217;s bonus check and everyone would be well advised to remember this.</p>

If you reread these stories above you will notice that between two people there were 5 different bank accounts. I have three accounts myself and most of the people I know carry accounts with at least two different banks.<br />
650 thousand accounts (as claimed by OWS the actual number is less) closed at two accounts per person is .001%. At one account per person that jumps to .002% That&#8217;s as paltry as it gets.</p>

You need to look at how many customers each bank has. So  BofA has some where around 20 million customers, so if 600,000 accounts were closed (and I know the 600,000 is not all BOFA customers) then that would be what..about 3-4% closure rate in one month (also you need to look at the time period). </p>

I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around [the banks] will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.<br />

<p>I would like to point out that credit unions aren&#8217;t necessarily all sweetness and light.  They can engage in the same sort of fee-ism that the banks do, so be warned.  Pick your credit union carefully, and be ready to walk when they start acting like a bank.</p>

<p>When this movement begins to understand that it all comes back to the elected persons, then we&#8217;ll get somewhere&#8230;take the Loan Modification Plan that Obama put into place &#8211; He claimed it would help 7 &#8211; 9 million homeowners keep their homes &#8211; how many did it actually help?  About 949 thousand&#8230;.</p>
<p>He got a huge political &#8220;bounce&#8221; out of it &#8211; showing that he &#8220;cared&#8221; about the little people (after he helped draft the 2000 page monstrosity that was TARP and the second stimulus) and then he and all the others who felt real good about what they&#8217;d done to forgot all about it.  In the end, it was symbolic and did little to nothing to impact the foreclosure and turning upside down of the housing market.  </p>
<p>Same with all the hoopla over the Student Loan Executive Orders &#8211; how many people have actually had help with their student loan payments?  Not enough to be a drop in the bucket&#8230;why?  Because those loans had to be originated in 2008&#8230;..everyone who had graduated during the great loss of jobs was out of luck &#8211; couldn&#8217;t find work and couldn&#8217;t get their loan restructured&#8230;.those who took out loans in 2008?  Most of them are STILL in college.</p>
<p>When the American Public wakes up to these kinds of things and stop just looking at the words of their elected officials and instead &#8211; looks at the RESULTS of their actions, then we&#8217;ll begin to make a real change.  It is not limited to one political party&#8230;&#8230;..</p>

If you have a large,long term CD and depend on it for income, you could see your nice interest rate drop to a fraction of a per cent.  Make sure of the safety of your bank.  Don&#8217;t just chase higher yields. Some of the highest  yields are from banks desperately trying to raise capital.</p>

Then, when you try to cash a check written on their bank, they treat you like a Bank Robber.

The banks have access to money from the FED at ridiculously low rates, but are still holding off on making loans to even very successful small businesses, because they want to influence the next election cycle.<br />
This is reason enough to put them outa business if possible.<br />
Even though the banks can get cheap money from the FED, it does not carry the multyplier effect that deposits from sources other than the central bank. These banks &#8220;TBTF&#8221; now make more money off the stock market, than loans.<br />
So get your money out of them and put it into a local S&amp;L.</p>

<p>Wake up people !!, the Central Bank (Federal Reserve)that loans the government money at interest is a private corporation, and your income tax dollars go directly into the Banksters pockets in the form of interest on the National debt. It is also the creator of money out of thin air (fractional reserve system ) It is time for everyone, and I do mean everyone to stop paying the INCOME TAX!!<br />
Abolish the Federal Reserve and get the banksters out of the government and into prison where they belong. Eliminate the collection arm of the Federal Reserve, the IRS, and create a truly free country again!!</p>

They thought we were that clueless and wouldn&#8217;t find out what they were really. I just awoke from the sleep I was in. I&#8217;m paying off most of my debt from money in savings and now I am going to transfer from a fed bank to a local bank. I am going to spread the word and hopefully some friends and family make the same choice. I started to see what was really going on once I found out our constitution was falling apart! That serves them right for messing with our freedom.</p>
