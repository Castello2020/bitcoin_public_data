<h3 style="color: #000099;">Anyone Who Says the Government Only Spies On Potential Bad Guys Is Sadly Uninformed</h3>
<p>Even now &#8211; after all of the revelations by Edward Snowden and other whistleblowers &#8211; spying apologists say that the reports are &#8220;exaggerated&#8221; or &#8220;overblown&#8221;, and that the government only spies on potential bad guys.</p>
<p>In reality, the government is spying on everyone&#8217;s digital and old-fashioned communications.</p>
<p>For example, the government is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/us/monitoring-of-snail-mail.html?_r=2&amp;">photographing the outside information on every piece of snail mail</a>.</p>
<p>The government is spying on you through your phone &#8230; and may even <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/06/the-single-most-important-step-to-protect-yourself-from-government-spying.html">remotely turn on your camera and microphone when your phone is off</a>.</p>
<p>As one example, the NSA has <a title="inserted its code into Android’s operating system … bugging three-quarters of the world’s smartphones" href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-07-03/security-enhanced-android-nsa-edition#r=nav-fs" target="_blank">inserted its code into Android’s operating system … bugging <em>three-quarters of the world’s smartphones</em></a>.  Google &#8211; or the NSA &#8211; can <a title="apparently remotely turn on your phone’s camera and recorder" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-android-app-camera-security-2013-5" target="_blank">remotely turn on your phone’s camera and recorder</a> at any time.</p>
<p>Cell towers <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/thats-no-phone.-thats-my-tracker" target="_blank">track where your phone is</a> at any moment, and the major cell carriers, including Verizon and AT&amp;T, responded to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/09/us/cell-carriers-see-uptick-in-requests-to-aid-surveillance.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">at least 1.3 million law enforcement requests</a> for cell phone locations and other data in 2011. (And &#8211; given that your smartphone <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703983704576277101723453610.html">routinely sends your location information</a> back to Apple or Google &#8211; it would be child&#8217;s play for the government to track your location that way.) Your <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704123204576283580249161342.html">iPhone</a>, or <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/adriankingsleyhughes/2012/10/03/how-your-android-smartphone-could-be-used-to-spy-on-you/">other brand of smartphone</a> is spying on <a href="http://us.gizmodo.com/5863849/your-android-phone-is-secretly-recording-everything-you-do">virtually everything you do</a> (ProPublica notes: &#8220;<a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/thats-no-phone.-thats-my-tracker">That’s No Phone. That’s My Tracker</a>&#8220;). Remember, that might be happening <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130723/12395923907/even-powering-down-cell-phone-cant-keep-nsa-tracking-its-location.shtml">even when your phone is turned off</a>.</p>
<p>The government might be spying on you <a title="Permalink to Is the Government Spying On You Through Your Own Computer’s Webcam Or Microphone?" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/06/is-the-government-spying-on-you-through-your-own-webcam-or-microphone.html" rel="bookmark">through your <em>computer’s</em> webcam or microphone</a>. The government might also be spying on you through the &#8220;smart meter&#8221; <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/06/is-your-smart-meter-spying-on-you.html">on your own home</a>.</p>
<p>The FBI wants a <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/06/now-fbi-wants-back-door-to-all-software/">backdoor to <em>all</em> software.</a>  But <a href="http://www.heise.de/mediadaten/english.shtml">leading</a> European computer publication Heise said in 1999 that the NSA had <em>already</em> built a backdoor into <em><a href="http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/5/5263/1.html">all Windows software</a></em>.</p>
<p>Microsoft has <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data">long worked hand-in-hand with the NSA</a> and FBI so that encryption doesn&#8217;t block the government&#8217;s ability to spy on users of Skype, Outlook, Hotmail and other Microsoft services.</p>
<p>And Microsoft informs intelligence agencies of with information about bugs in its popular software <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-14/u-s-agencies-said-to-swap-data-with-thousands-of-firms.html">before it publicly releases a fix</a>, so that information can be used by the government to access computers. (Software vulnerabilities are also <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/world/europe/nations-buying-as-hackers-sell-computer-flaws.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">sold</a> to the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203611404577044192607407780.html">highest bidder</a>.)</p>
<p>A top expert in the ‘microprocessors’ or ‘chips’ inside every computer &#8211; having helped start two semiconductor companies and a supercomputer firm &#8211; also <a href="http://www.afr.com/p/technology/intel_chips_could_be_nsa_key_to_ymrhS1HS1633gCWKt5tFtI">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>He would be “surprised” if the US National Security Agency was not embedding “back doors” inside chips produced by Intel and AMD, two of the world’s largest semiconductor firms, giving them the possibility to access and control machines.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[The expert] said when he learned the NSA had secured “<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data" target="_blank">pre-encryption stage</a>” access to Microsoft’s email products via the PRISM leaks, he recognised that “pretty much all our computers have a way for the NSA to get inside their hardware” before a user can even think about applying encryption or other defensive measures.</p></blockquote>
<p>Leading security experts say that the NSA might have put a backdoor in all <a href="http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2007/11/securitymatters_1115">encryption standards years ago</a>. &#8230; meaning that the NSA could easily hack into all encrypted communications.  And the NSA hacks into <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/security/privacy/nsa-surveillance-can-penetrate-vpns/240159261">encrypted &#8220;VPN&#8221; connections</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black boxes&#8221; are currently installed in between <a href="http://www.courierpress.com/news/2012/dec/09/black-box-recorders-snitch-on-motorists-starts/">90%</a> and <a href="http://www.edmunds.com/car-technology/car-black-box-recorders-capture-crash-data.html">96%</a> of all new cars. And starting in 2014, <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/obama-bypasses-congress-mandate-black-boxes-all-cars-beginning-14">all new cars</a> will include black boxes that can track your location.</p>
<p>License plate readers <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/driving-somewhere-theres-govt-record-140052644.html">mounted on police cars</a> allow police to gather <a href="http://cironline.org/reports/license-plate-readers-let-police-collect-millions-records-drivers-4883">millions of records on drivers</a> &#8230; including <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443995604578004723603576296.html">photos of them in their cars</a>.</p>
<p>If you have a microphone in your car, that might also open you up to snoopers. As CNET <a title="points out" href="http://news.cnet.com/2100-1029_3-6140191.html" target="_blank">points out</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Surreptitious activation of built-in microphones by the FBI has been done before. A <a title="Court to FBI: No spying on in-car computers -- 2003-11-19T12:07:00Z" href="http://news.cnet.com/Court-to-FBI-No-spying-on-in-car-computers/2100-1029_3-5109435.html" target="_blank">2003 lawsuit</a> revealed that the FBI was able to surreptitiously turn on the built-in microphones in automotive systems like General Motors’ OnStar to snoop on passengers’ conversations.</p>
<p>When FBI agents remotely activated the system and were listening in, passengers in the vehicle could not tell that their conversations were being monitored.</p></blockquote>
<p>A security expert and former NSA software developer says that hackers can <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/06/17/uk-surveilance-hackers-idUKBRE95G10620130617">access <em>private</em> surveillance cameras</a>. Given that the NSA apparently <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/trapwire-everything-you-need-to-know-2012-8">already monitors public cameras</a> using <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBWN7qi9C9E">facial recognition software</a>, and that the FBI is building a system which will <a href="http://rt.com/usa/epic-surveillance-ngi-fbi-645/">track &#8220;public and <em>private</em> surveillance cameras around the country&#8221;</a>, we can assume that government agencies might already be hacking into private surveillance cameras.</p>
<p>The CIA <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/03/petraeus-tv-remote/">wants to spy on you through your dishwasher</a> and other &#8220;smart&#8221; appliances. As Slate <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/03/19/smart_appliances_could_help_cia_spy_says_petraeus_.html">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>Watch out: the CIA may soon be spying on you—through your beloved, intelligent household appliances, <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/03/petraeus-tv-remote/">according to Wired</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In early March, at a meeting for the CIA’s venture capital firm In-Q-Tel, CIA Director David Petraeus reportedly noted that “smart appliances” connected to the Internet could someday be used by the CIA to track individuals. If your grocery-list-generating refrigerator knows when you’re home, the CIA could, too, by using geo-location data from your wired appliances, <a href="http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/thinking-tech/cia-well-spy-on-you-through-your-refrigerator/10717">according to SmartPlanet</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>“The current ‘Internet of PCs’ will move, of course, toward an ‘Internet of Things’—of devices of all types—50 to 100 billion of which will be connected to the Internet by 2020,” <a href="https://www.cia.gov/news-information/speeches-testimony/2012-speeches-testimony/in-q-tel-summit-remarks.html">Petraeus said in his speech</a>. He continued:</p>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote><p>Items of interest will be located, identified, monitored, and remotely controlled through technologies such as radio-frequency identification, sensor networks, tiny embedded servers, and energy harvesters—all connected to the next-generation Internet using abundant, low cost, and high-power computing—the latter now going to cloud computing, in many areas greater and greater supercomputing, and, ultimately, heading to quantum computing.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p>***</p>
<p>ITworld’s Kevin Fogarty thinks that J. Edgar Hoover, were he still with us, would “<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/252057/cia_eager_to_enlist_inanimate_internet_spies.html">die of jealousy</a>” upon hearing about the tools soon to be at Petraeus’ disposal.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>And they’re probably bluffing and exaggerating, but the Department of Homeland Security claims they will soon be able to know your adrenaline level, what you ate for breakfast and what you’re thinking … <a title="from 164 feet away" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/07/government-will-soon-be-able-to-know-your-adrenaline-level-what-you-ate-your-breakfast-and-what-youre-thinking-from-164-feet-away.html">from 164 feet away</a>. (In addition, people will probably soon be <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110527/full/news.2011.323.html">swallowing tracking devices for medical purposes</a>)</p>
<p>The government is <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2134464#.UdmlDW1GR8U">allegedly</a> <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2012/04/department-of-defense-neuroscience-bioethics-brains-law">scanning</a> prisoners&#8217; brains without their consent at Guantanamo.

<p>The government is currently testing systems for use in public spaces which can screen for &#8220;pre-crime&#8221;. As Nature <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110527/full/news.2011.323.html">reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like a lie detector, FAST measures a variety of physiological indicators, ranging from heart rate to the steadiness of a person&#8217;s gaze, to judge a subject&#8217;s state of mind. But there are major differences from the polygraph. FAST relies on non-contact sensors, so it can measure indicators as someone walks through a corridor at an airport, and it does not depend on active questioning of the subject.</p></blockquote>
<p>CBS News <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/10/07/tech/cnettechnews/main20117207.shtml">points out</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>FAST is designed to track and monitor, among other inputs, body movements, voice pitch changes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_%28linguistics%29">prosody</a> changes (alterations in the rhythm and intonation of speech), eye movements, body heat changes, and breathing patterns. Occupation and age are also considered. A government source told CNET that blink rate and pupil variation are measured too.</p>
<p>A field test of FAST has been conducted in at least one undisclosed location in the northeast. &#8220;It is not an airport, but it is a large venue that is a suitable substitute for an operational setting,&#8221; DHS spokesman John Verrico <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110527/full/news.2011.323.html">told</a> Nature.com in May.</p>
<p>Although DHS has publicly suggested that FAST could be used at airport checkpoints&#8211;the Transportation Security Administration is part of the department, after all&#8211;the government appears to have grander ambitions. One internal DHS document (<a href="http://epic.org/privacy/fastinstallation.pdf">PDF</a>) also obtained by EPIC through the Freedom of Information Act says a mobile version of FAST &#8220;could be used at security checkpoints such as border crossings or at large public events such as sporting events or conventions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The risk of false positives is very real. As Computer World <a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/18388/homeland_security_testing_mind_reading_terrorist_pre_crime_detectors">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tom Ormerod, a psychologist in the Investigative Expertise Unit at Lancaster University, UK, told <em>Nature</em>, &#8220;Even having an iris scan or fingerprint read at immigration is enough to raise the heart rate of most legitimate travelers.&#8221; Other critics have been concerned about &#8220;false positives.&#8221; For example, some travelers might have some of the physical responses that are supposedly signs of mal-intent if they were about to be groped by TSA agents in airport security.</p></blockquote>
<p>Various &#8220;pre-crime&#8221; sensing devices have <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2154861/U-S-surveillance-cameras-use-eyes-pre-crimes-detecting-suspicious-behaviour-alerting-guards.html">already been deployed</a> in public spaces in the U.S.</p>
<p>The government has also worked on <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/06/the-next-nsa-spying-shoe-to-drop-artificial-intelligence.html">artificial intelligence for &#8220;pre-crime&#8221; detection on the Web</a>. And given that programs which can <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerdooley/2013/06/19/nsa-emotions/">figure out your emotions</a> are being developed using your webcam, every change in facial expression could be tracked.</p>
<p>According to the NSA&#8217;s former director of global digital data &#8211; William Binney &#8211; the NSA&#8217;s new data storage center in Utah will have so much storage capacity <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/06/10/190160772/amid-data-controversy-nsa-builds-its-biggest-data-farm">that</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;They would have plenty of space &#8230; to store at least something on the order of <strong>100 years worth of the worldwide communications</strong>, phones and emails and stuff like that,&#8221; Binney asserts, &#8220;<strong>and then have plenty of space left over to do any kind of parallel processing to try to break codes</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[But the NSA isn't stopping there.] Despite its capacity, the Utah center does not satisfy NSA&#8217;s data demands. Last month, the agency broke ground on its next data farm at its headquarters at Ft. Meade, Md. But that facility will be only two-thirds the size of the mega-complex in Utah.</p></blockquote>

<p>The administration is building a facility in a valley south of Salt Lake City that will have the capacity to store massive amounts of records – a facility that former agency whistleblowers say has no logical purpose if it’s not going to be a vault holding years of phone and Internet data.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Thomas Drake, a former NSA senior executive who challenged the data collection for several years, said the agency’s intent seems obvious.</p>
<p>“One hundred million phone records?” he asked in an interview. “Why would they want that each and every day? Of course they’re storing it.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Lending credence to his worries, The Guardian’s latest report quoted a document in which Alexander purportedly remarked during a 2008 visit to an NSA intercept station in Britain: “Why can’t we collect all the signals all the time?”</p>

<p>One former U.S. security consultant, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect his connections to government agencies, told McClatchy he has seen agency-installed switches across the country that draw data from the cables.</p>

The agency has new authority to keep data about innocent U.S. citizens for up to five years, and to analyze it for suspicious patterns of behavior. Previously, both were prohibited. Data about Americans &#8220;reasonably believed to constitute terrorism information&#8221; may be permanently retained.</p>
<p>The changes also allow databases of U.S. civilian information to be given to foreign governments for analysis of their own. In effect, U.S. and foreign governments would be using the information to look for clues that people might commit future crimes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s breathtaking&#8221; in its scope, said a former senior administration official familiar with the White House debate.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8230;.Thanks to the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency, which had lobbied for the provision, TIA didn&#8217;t die—it metastasized.

<p>Many police departments are also using drones to spy on us. As the Hill <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/265693-police-drone-use-prompts-privacy-concerns">reported</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>At least 13 state and local police agencies around the country have used drones in the field or in training, according to the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, an industry trade group. The Federal Aviation Administration has predicted that by the end of the decade, 30,000 commercial and government drones could be flying over U.S. skies.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>&#8220;Drones should only be used if subject to a powerful framework that regulates their use in order to avoid abuse and invasions of privacy,&#8221; Chris Calabrese, a legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said during a congressional forum in Texas last month.</p>
<p>He argued police should only fly drones over private property if they have a warrant, information collected with drones should be promptly destroyed when it&#8217;s no longer needed and domestic drones should not carry any weapons.</p>
<p>He argued that drones pose a more serious threat to privacy than helicopters because they are cheaper to use and can hover in the sky for longer periods of time.</p>
<p>A congressional report earlier this year predicted that drones could soon be equipped with technologies to identify faces or track people based on their height, age, gender and skin color.</p></blockquote>
<p>The military is paying for the development of drones with <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/09/drones-never-forget-a-face/">facial recognition software which &#8220;remember&#8221; people&#8217;s faces &#8230; and read &#8220;malintent&#8221;</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Transit authorities in cities across the country are quietly installing microphone-enabled surveillance systems on public buses that would give them the ability to record and store private conversations….</p>
<p>The systems are being installed in San Francisco, Baltimore, and other cities with funding from the Department of Homeland Security in some cases ….</p>
<p>The IP audio-video systems can be <a title="accessed remotely via a built-in web server" href="https://t5_sites_static.s3.amazonaws.com/schipul-safetyvision/media/files/product/fe76a0de/SVC-2200-Spec-Sheet.pdf" target="_blank">accessed remotely via a built-in web server</a> (.pdf), and can be combined with GPS data to track the movement of buses and passengers throughout the city.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The systems use cables or WiFi to <strong>pair audio conversations with camera images in order to produce synchronous recordings. Audio and video can be monitored in real-time</strong>, but are also stored onboard in blackbox-like devices, generally for 30 days, for later retrieval. Four to six cameras with mics are generally installed throughout a bus, including one near the driver and one on the exterior of the bus.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Privacy and security expert Ashkan Soltani told the Daily that the audio could easily be coupled with facial recognition systems or audio recognition technology to identify passengers caught on the recordings.</p></blockquote>

<li>As a result of this claimed authority, individuals who are far away from the border, American citizens traveling from one place in America to another, are being stopped and harassed in ways that our Constitution does not permit.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Border Patrol has been setting up checkpoints inland — on highways in states such as California, Texas and Arizona, and at ferry terminals in Washington State. Typically, the agents ask drivers and passengers about their citizenship. Unfortunately, our courts so far have permitted these kinds of checkpoints – legally speaking, they are “administrative” stops that are permitted only for the specific purpose of protecting the nation’s borders. They cannot become general drug-search or other law enforcement efforts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>However, these stops by Border Patrol agents are not remaining confined to that border security purpose. On the roads of California and elsewhere in the nation – places far removed from the actual border – agents are stopping, interrogating, and searching Americans on an everyday basis with absolutely no suspicion of wrongdoing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The bottom line is that the extraordinary authorities that the government possesses at the border are spilling into regular American streets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Computer World <a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/privacy/21805/2-out-every-3-americans-lost-fourth-amendment-protections-dhs">reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Border agents don’t need probable cause and they don’t need a stinking warrant since they don’t need to prove any reasonable suspicion first. Nor, sadly, do two out of three people have First Amendment protection; it is as if DHS has voided those Constitutional amendments and protections they provide to nearly 200 million Americans.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Don’t be silly by thinking this means only if you are physically trying to cross the international border. As we saw when discussing the DEA using license plate readers and data-mining to <a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/20209/aclu_dea_tracks_americans_movements_plans_to_data_mine_license_plate_records">track Americans movements</a>, the U.S. “border” stretches out 100 miles beyond the true border. Godfather Politics <a href="http://godfatherpolitics.com/9446/dhs-nullifies-fourth-amendment-rights-of-millions-of-americans/">added</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But wait, it gets even better! If you live anywhere in Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey or Rhode Island, DHS says the search zones encompass the entire state.</p></blockquote>
<p>Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have a “longstanding constitutional and statutory authority permitting suspicionless and warrantless searches of merchandise at the border and its functional equivalent.” This applies to electronic devices, according to the recent CLCR “Border Searches of Electronic Devices” executive summary [<a href="http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/crcl-border-search-impact-assessment_01-29-13_1.pdf">PDF</a>]:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Fourth Amendment</strong></p>
<p>The overall authority to conduct border searches without suspicion or warrant is clear and longstanding, and courts have not treated searches of electronic devices any differently than searches of other objects. We conclude that CBP’s and ICE’s current border search policies comply with the Fourth Amendment. We also conclude that imposing a requirement that officers have reasonable suspicion in order to conduct a border search of an electronic device would be operationally harmful without concomitant civil rights/civil liberties benefits. However, we do think that recording more information about why searches are performed would help managers and leadership supervise the use of border search authority, and this is what we recommended; CBP has agreed and has implemented this change beginning in FY2012.***</p></blockquote>
<p>The ACLU said, Wait one darn minute! Hello, what happened to the Constitution? Where is the rest of CLCR report on the “policy of combing through and sometimes confiscating travelers’ laptops, cell phones, and other electronic devices—even when there is no suspicion of wrongdoing?” DHS maintains it is not violating our constitutional rights, so the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-and-liberty-immigrants-rights-national-security/aclu-files-foia-request-unreleased">ACLU said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If it’s true that our rights are safe and that DHS is doing all the things it needs to do to safeguard them, then why won’t it show us the results of its assessment? And why would it be legitimate to keep a report about the impact of a policy on the public’s rights hidden from the very public being affected?</p></blockquote>
<p>***</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/the-constitution-repealed-in-ten-states-89864/">Christian Post wrote</a>, “Your constitutional rights have been repealed in ten states. No, this isn&#8217;t a joke. It is not exaggeration or hyperbole. If you are in ten states in the United States, your some of your rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights have been made null and void.”</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-and-liberty-immigrants-rights-national-security/aclu-files-foia-request-unreleased">ACLU filed</a> a Freedom of Information Act request for the entire DHS report about suspicionless and warrantless “border” searches of electronic devices. ACLU attorney Catherine Crump said “We hope to establish that the Department of Homeland Security can’t simply assert that its practices are legitimate without showing us the evidence, and to make it clear that the government’s own analyses of how our fundamental rights apply to new technologies should be openly accessible to the public for review and debate.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the EFF has <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/05/border-search-answers">tips</a> to protect yourself and your devices against border searches. If you think you know all about it, then you might try testing your knowledge with a <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/border-search-quiz">defending privacy at the U.S. border quiz</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wired <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/04/border-agents-c/">pointed out</a> in 2008 that the courts have routinely upheld such constitution-free zones:</p>
<blockquote><p>Federal agents at the border do not need any reason to search through travelers’ laptops, cell phones or digital cameras for evidence of crimes, a federal appeals court ruled Monday, extending the government’s power to look through belongings like suitcases at the border to electronics.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the government, finding that the so-called border exception to the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable searches applied not just to suitcases and papers, but also to electronics.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Travelers should be aware that anything on their mobile devices can be searched by government agents, who may also seize the devices and keep them for weeks or months. When in doubt, think about whether online storage or encryption might be tools you should use to prevent the feds from rummaging through your journal, your company’s confidential business plans or naked pictures of you and your-of-age partner in adult fun.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.aclunc.org/issues/technology/blog/the_privacy_of_your_laptop_at_international_borders.shtml">International airports are treated as &#8220;borders&#8221;</a>, exempt for Fourth Amendment protections.  As such, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_airports_by_country#North_America"><em>145</em> airports</a> should be added to the map above.</p>
<p>Do you still believe that the government is only spying on bad guys in &#8220;targeted&#8221; searches?</p>

<p> NSA indeed built code in Android but there is no backdoor because Android is completely open-source.</p>
