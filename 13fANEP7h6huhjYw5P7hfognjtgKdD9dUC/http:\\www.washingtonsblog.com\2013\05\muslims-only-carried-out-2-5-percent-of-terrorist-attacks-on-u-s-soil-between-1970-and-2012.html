<h3 style="color: #000099;">Terrorism Is a Real Threat &#8230; But the Threat to the U.S. from Muslim Terrorists Has Been Exaggerated</h3>
<p>An FBI report shows that only a small percentage of terrorist attacks carried out on U.S. soil <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terrorism-2002-2005/terror02_05#terror_05sum">between 1980 and 2005</a> were perpetrated by Muslims.</p>
<p>Princeton University&#8217;s Loon Watch compiled the <a href="http://www.loonwatch.com/2010/01/not-all-terrorists-are-muslims/">following chart</a> from the FBI&#8217;s data (as explained below, this chart is over-simplified &#8230; and somewhat inaccurate):</p>
<p><center><img class="aligncenter" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.loonwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/piechart2.jpg?resize=491%2C491" alt="Terrorist Attacks on U.S. Soil by Group, From 1980 to 2005, According to FBI Database" /><small>Terrorist Attacks on U.S. Soil by Group, From 1980 to 2005, According to FBI Database</small></center></p>
<blockquote><p>According to this data, there were more Jewish acts of terrorism within the United States than Islamic (7% vs 6%).  These radical Jews committed acts of terrorism in the name of their religion.  These were not terrorists who happened to be Jews; rather, they were extremist Jews who committed acts of terrorism based on their religious passions, just like Al-Qaeda and company.</p></blockquote>
<p>(The chart is misleading in several ways. For example, it labels &#8220;Extreme Left Wing Groups&#8221; and &#8220;Communists&#8221;, but not &#8220;Extreme Right Wing Groups&#8221; or &#8220;Fascists&#8221;. It should have either discarded <em>all</em> partisan labels, or included labels for <em>both</em> ends of the spectrum.  In addition, &#8220;Latinos&#8221; is misleading, as Loonwatch is actually referring to Puerto Rican separatist groups, Cuban exile groups and the like.  However, as shown below, many of the basic concepts are correct.)</p>
<p>U.S. News and World Report <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/press-past/2013/02/26/the-1993-world-trade-center-bombing-a-new-threat-emerges">noted</a> in February of this year:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of the more than 300 American deaths from political violence and mass shootings since 9/11, only 33 have come at the hands of Muslim-Americans, according to the <a href="http://tcths.sanford.duke.edu/documents/Kurzman_Muslim-American_Terrorism_final2013.pdf">Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security</a>. The Muslim-American suspects or perpetrators in these or other attempted attacks fit no demographic profile—only 51 of more than 200 are of Arabic ethnicity. In 2012, all but one of the nine Muslim-American terrorism plots uncovered were halted in early stages. That one, an attempted bombing of a Social Security office in Arizona, caused no casualties.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wired <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/02/american-muslim-terrorism/">reported</a> the same month:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since 9/11, [Charles Kurzman, Professor of Sociology at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, writing for the Triangle Center on Terrorism and National Security] and his team tallies, 33 Americans have died as a result of terrorism launched by their Muslim neighbors. During that period, 180,000 Americans were murdered for reasons unrelated to terrorism. In just the past year, the <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/12/gun-control/">mass shootings that have captivated America’s attention</a> killed 66 Americans, “twice as many fatalities as from Muslim-American terrorism in all 11 years since 9/11,” notes Kurzman’s team.</p>
<p>Law enforcement, including “informants and undercover agents,” were involved in “almost all of the Muslim-American terrorism plots uncovered in 2012,” the Triangle team finds. That’s in keeping with the FBI’s recent practice of using undercover or double agents to encourage would-be terrorists to act on their violent desires and arresting them when they do — a practice critics say comes perilously close to entrapment. A difference in 2012 observed by Triangle: with the exception of the Arizona attack, all the alleged plots involving U.S. Muslims were “discovered and disrupted at an early stage,” while in the past three years, law enforcement often observed the incubating terror initiatives “after weapons or explosives had already been gathered.”</p>
<p>The sample of Muslim Americans turning to terror is “vanishingly small,” Kurzman tells Danger Room. Measuring the U.S. Muslim population is a famously inexact science, since census data don’t track religion, but rather “country of origin,” which researchers attempt to use as a proxy. There are somewhere between 1.7 million and seven million American Muslims, by most estimates, and Kurzman says he operates off a model that presumes the lower end, a bit over 2 million. That’s less a rate of involvement in terrorism of less than 10 per million, down from a 2003 high of 40 per million, as detailed in the chart above.</p>
<p>Yet the scrutiny by law enforcement and homeland security on American Muslims has not similarly abated. The FBI tracks “geomaps” of areas where Muslims live and work, regardless of their involvement in any crime. The Patriot Act and other post-9/11 restrictions on government surveillance remain in place. The Department of Homeland Security just celebrated its 10th anniversary. In 2011, President Obama ordered the entire federal national-security apparatus to get rid of counterterrorism training material that <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/11/obama-islamophobia-review/">instructed agents to focus on Islam itself</a>, rather than specific terrorist groups.</p>
<p>Kurzman doesn’t deny that law enforcement plays a role in disrupting and deterring homegrown U.S. Muslim terrorism. His research holds it out as a possible explanation for the decline. But he remains surprised by the disconnect between the scale of the terrorism problem and the scale — and expense — of the government’s response.</p>
<p>“Until public opinion starts to recognize the scale of the problem has been lower than we feared, my sense is that public officials are not going to change their policies,” Kurzman says. “Counterterrorism policies have involved surveillance — not just of Muslim-Americans, but of all Americans, and the fear of terrorism has justified intrusions on American privacy and civil liberties all over the internet and other aspects of our lives. I think the implications here are not just for how we treat a religious minority in the U.S., but also how we treat the rights &amp; liberties of everyone.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/02/constitution.html">We agree</a>. And so do <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/04/multiple-polls-americans-are-more-afraid-of-the-government-than-terrorists.html">most Americans</a>. Indeed &#8211; as we&#8217;ve previously documented &#8211; you’re more likely to die from <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/04/statistics-you-are-not-going-to-be-killed-by-terrorists.html">brain-eating parasites, alcoholism, obesity, medical errors, risky sexual behavior or just about anything</a> <em>other than</em> terrorism.</p>
<p>Kurzman told the Young Turks in February that Islamic terrorism <a href="http://current.com/shows/the-young-turks/videos/islamic-terrorism-doesnt-even-count-for-1-percent-of-the-180000-murders-in-the-us-since-the-september-11-attack">&#8220;doesn’t even count for 1 percent&#8221; of the 180,000 murders in the US since 9/11</a>.</p>
<p>While the Boston marathon bombings were horrific, a top terrorism expert says that the Boston attack was <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/terror-expert-boston-attack-more-columbine-more-than-911-these-are-murderers-not-terrorists/">more like Columbine than 9/11, and that the bombers are &#8220;murderers not terrorists&#8221;</a>.  The <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map?page=2">overwhelming majority of mass shootings were by non-Muslims</a>.  (This is <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/07/bill-oreilly-is-right-its-unfair-to-call-the-norwegian-mass-murderer-a-christian-and-its-also-unfair-to-call-arab-terrorists-muslims.html">true in Europe</a>, as well as in the U.S.)</p>
<p>However you classify them &#8211; murder or terrorism &#8211; the Boston bombings occurred <em>after</em> all of the statistical analysis set forth above. Moreover, different groups have different agendas about how to classify the perpetrators  (For example, <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/04/25/mother-jones-right-wing">liberal Mother Jones and conservative Breitbart</a> disagree on how many of the perpetrators of terror attacks can  properly be classified as right wing extremists.)</p>
<p>So we decided to look at the most current statistics for <em>ourselves</em>, to do an objective numerical count not driven by any agenda.</p>
<p>Specifically, we reviewed all of the terrorist attacks on U.S. soil as documented by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START). (2012). Global Terrorism Database, as retrieved from <a class="smarterwiki-linkify" href="http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd">http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd</a>.</p>
<p>The START Global Terrorism Database <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/about/">spans from 1970 through 2012 (and will be updated from year-to-year)</a>, and &#8211; as of this writing &#8211; includes 104,000 terrorist incidents.  As such, it is the most comprehensive open-source database open to the public.</p>
<p>We <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/">counted up</a> the number of terrorist attacks carried out by Muslims.  We excluded attacks by groups which are obviously not Muslims, such as the Ku Klux Klan, Medellin Drug Cartel, Irish Republican Army, Anti-Castro Group, Mormon extremists, Vietnamese Organization to Exterminate Communists and Restore the Nation, Jewish Defense League, May 19 Communist Order, Chicano Liberation Front, Jewish Armed Resistance, American Indian Movement, Gay Liberation Front, Aryan Nation, Jewish Action Movement, National Front for the Liberation of Cuba, or Fourth Reich Skinheads.</p>
<p>We counted attacks by Al Qaeda, the Taliban, Black American Moslems, or anyone who even remotely <em>sounded</em> Muslim &#8230; for example anyone from Palestine, Lebanon or any other Arab or Muslim country, or any name including anything sounding remotely Arabic or Indonesian (like &#8220;Al&#8221; anything or &#8220;Jamaat&#8221; anything).</p>
<p>If we weren&#8217;t sure what the person&#8217;s affiliation was, we looked up the name of the group to determine whether it could in any way be connected to Muslims.</p>
<p>Based on our review of the approximately <strong>2,400</strong> terrorist attacks on U.S. soil contained within the START database, we determined that approximately <strong>60</strong> were carried out by Muslims.</p>
<p>In other words, approximately <em><strong><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=60+is+what+percent+of+2%2C400%3F">2.5%</a> </strong></em><em><strong></strong></em>of all terrorist attacks on U.S. soil between 1970 and 2012 were carried out by Muslims.*  This is a tiny proportion of all attacks.</p>
<p>(We determined that approximately 118 of the terror attacks &#8211; or <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=118+is+what+percent+of+2%2C400%3F">4.9%</a> &#8211; were carried out by Jewish groups such as Jewish Armed Resistance, the Jewish Defense League, Jewish Action Movement, United Jewish Underground and Thunder of Zion. This is <em>almost twice</em> the percentage of Islamic attacks within the United States.  In addition, there were approximately 168 attacks &#8211; or <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=168+is+what+percent+of+2%2C400%3F">7%</a> &#8211; by anti-abortion activists, who tend to be Christian. Fuerzas Armadas de Liberacion Nacional  &#8211; a Puerto Rican paramilitary organization -  carried out more than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuerzas_Armadas_de_Liberaci%C3%B3n_Nacional_Puertorrique%C3%B1a">120</a> bomb attacks on U.S. targets between 1974 and 1983, and there were some 41 attacks by Cuban exiles, and a number of attacks by other Latin American groups. If we look at worldwide attacks &#8211; instead of just attacks on U.S. soil &#8211; <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/04/the-u-s-is-engaged-in-a-muslim-religious-war-on-the-side-of-the-muslim-jihadis.html">Sunni Muslims</a> are the main perpetrators of terrorism.  However: <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/04/the-u-s-is-engaged-in-a-muslim-religious-war-on-the-side-of-the-muslim-jihadis.html">1. Muslims are also the main victims of terror attacks worldwide; and 2. the U.S. backs the most radical types of Sunnis over more moderate Muslims and Arab secularists</a>.)</p>
<p>Moreover, another study undertaken by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism &#8211; called &#8221;Profiles of Perpetrators of Terrorism in the United States&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/start/announcements/announcement.asp?id=483">found</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Between 1970 and 2011, <strong>32 percent of the perpetrator groups were motivated by ethnonationalist/separatist agendas, 28 percent were motivated by single issues, such as animal rights or opposition to war, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">seven</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">percent</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">were</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">motivated</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">religious</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">beliefs</span></strong>. In addition, 11 percent of the perpetrator groups were classified as extreme right-wing, and 22 percent were categorized as extreme left-wing.</p>
<p>Preliminary findings from PPT-US data between 1970 and 2011 also illustrate a distinct shift in the dominant ideologies of these terrorist groups over time, with the proportion of emerging ethnonationalist/separatist terrorist groups declining and the proportion of religious terrorist groups increasing. However, while terrorist groups with religious ideologies represent 40 percent of all emergent groups from 2000-2011 (two out of five), they only account for seven percent of groups over time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Similarly, a third study by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism Religion found that <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/start/announcements/announcement.asp?id=318">religion alone is <em>not</em> a key factor</a> in determining which terrorists want to use weapons of mass destruction:</p>
<blockquote><p>The available empirical data show that there is not a significant relationship between terrorist organizations’ pursuit of CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear) weapons and the mere possession of a religious ideology, according to a new quantitative study by START researchers Victor Asal, Gary Ackerman and Karl Rethemeyer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, Muslims are not more likely than other groups to want to use WMDs.</p>
<p>* The Boston marathon bombing was not included in this analysis, as START has not yet updated its database to include 2013 terrorist attacks.  3 people died in the Boston attack.  While tragic, we are confident that non-Musliims killed more than 3 during this same period.</p>
<p>We are not experts in terrorism analysis.  We would therefore defer to people like Kurzman on the exact number.  However, every quantitative analysis of terrorism in the U.S. we have read shows that the percent of terror attacks carried out by Muslims is far less than 10%.</p>
<p>Postscript: State-sponsored terrorism is beyond the scope of this discussion, and was not included in our statistical analysis.  Specifically, the following arguments are beyond the scope of this discussion, as we are focusing solely on non-state terrorism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arguments by  University of Michigan Professor <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2013/04/terrorism-other-religions.html">Juan Cole</a> that deaths from 20th century wars could be labeled Christian <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2013/04/terrorism-other-religions.html">terrorism</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Arguments that our recent use of <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/05/torture-is-a-form-of-terrorism.html">torture</a> and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/us-drones-strikes-target-rescuers-pakistan">double tap drone strikes</a> are terrorism</li>

<p>A qualitative analysis (eg. number of people killed in all terrorist attacks) suggests that 93.8% of all murders by terrorist attack were committed by Muslim terrorists between 1980 and 2005.</p>
<p>As of 2007, the US Muslim population was 0.6%. Projected from 0.6% of the population to to committing 93.8% of the deaths suggest that Muslims are 156 times more likely to commit an act of terrorism where someone is killed.</p>

Secondly I suggest you read Leviticus , it suggests rape, stoning etc for the chosen of God to carry out against the unbelievers, in fact stoning unbelievers to death is actually mentioned seventeen times in the old testament for a variety of sins.<br />
Secondly child marriage is not mentioned in the Quran, however we do not need to delve to deep into the Talmud to find a passage on it in sanhedrin 55b &#8221; A jew may marry a three year old girl&#8221;<br />
Also sorry to correct you again but Abohodah Zarah is in the Talmud, I suggest you look at the Jewish website about the Talmud Come and hear which confirms that it is part of the Talmud , so just keep spinning your lies.<br />
In fact my demented friend you will find that when a prominent Rabbi in Israel wrote a book called the Kings Torah in which he stated Arab babies should be killed, he justified his musings by citing the Talmud and what is says about Gentiles.<br />
The persecution of Jews in europe actually began in the 12th century when the then pope innocent the fourth called the Talmud the work of the devil due to its cursings against Jesus and gentiles.<br />

For your edification, I have printed an item from the<br />
Female Genital Mutilation<br />
Tuesday, 17 April 2007 15:42 Circe </p>
<p>Ms Hassan, ICV (Age 4/4/07) claims Female Genital Mutilation – particularly removal of or damage to the clitoris, has nothing to do with Islam.  This view is echoed among the politically correct including agencies involved in stopping FGM, and, while it will be admirable if this lie does help to stop the practice, it is still a lie.  It would be far better to confront and denounce the text so that it cannot be used again.<br />
Clitoridectomy is not mentioned in the Koran but is endorsed by Mohammad and his companions in several hadiths and in Islamic law.<br />
 In Reliance of the Traveller, a classical manual of Islamic sacred law in Arabic with facing English text, commentary and appendices edited and translated by Nuh Ha Mim Keller (1994) re &#8216;circumcision&#8217; we find the Arabic actually says :</p>
<p>&#8220;Circumcision is obligatory (for every male and female) by cutting off the piece of skin on the glans of the penis of the male,<br />
but circumcision of the female is by cutting out the clitoris (this is called Hufaad). &#8221;<br />
(Note the English version is falsely translated as &#8216;prepuce &#8216; of the clitoris!!)</p>
<p>The Arabic word bazr does not mean &#8220;prepuce of the clitoris&#8221;, it means the clitoris itself (cf. the entry in the Arabic-English Dictionary). The deceptive translation by Nuh Hah Mim Keller, made for Western consumption, obscures the Shafi’i law, given by ‘Umdat al-Salik, that circumcision of girls by excision of the clitoris is mandatory. This particular form of female circumcision is widely practiced in Egypt, where the Shafi’i school of Sunni law is followed.  Note a comment by Sheikh &#8216;Abd al-Wakil Durubi in the English &#8216;version&#8217; notes &#8220;Hanbalis hold that circumcision of women is not obligatory but sunna, while Hanafis consider it a mere courtesy to the husband.</p>
<p>This is supported by several hadiths:<br />
1)  Abu-Dawud   Book 41, No.  5251:   Narrated Umm Atiyyah al-Ansariyyah:    A woman used to perform circumcision in Medina.  The prophet (peace be upon him) said to her:  Do not cut severely as that is better for a woman and more desirable for a husband.<br />
(Note:  The powerful Mohammad did NOT stop the procedure yet he did stop the Arab practise of adoption when he wished to marry his adopted son&#8217;s wife Zainab, regarded as incest by the Arabs because adopted sons were held as sons!)<br />
2)  The are many hadiths across several sets that refer to the need for ghusl when the &#8216;two circumcised organs come in contact&#8217;<br />
a)  Muslim  book 3 No. 684:<br />
Abu Musa reported: There cropped up a difference of opinion between a group of Muhajirs ….He (Abu Musa, the narrator) said: I got up (and went) to &#8216;A&#8217;isha and sought her permission and it was granted, and I said to her: 0 Mother, or Mother of the Faithful, I want to ask you about a matter on which I feel shy. She said: Don&#8217;t feel shy of asking me about a thing which you can ask your mother, who gave you birth, for I am too your mother. Upon this I said: What makes a bath obligatory for a person? She replied: You have come across one well informed! The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: When anyone sits amidst four parts (of the woman) and the circumcised parts touch each other a bath becomes obligatory.<br />
b) Maliks Muwatta Book 2:  Section: Obligation to Do Ghusl when the Two Circumcised Parts Meet<br />
Book 2, Number 2.19.73:   Yahya related to me from Malik from Ibn Shihab from Said ibn al-Musayyab that Umar ibn al-Khattab and Uthman ibn Affan and A&#8217;isha, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to say, &#8220;When the circumcised part touches the circumcised part, ghusl is obligatory.&#8221;<br />
Repeated in various forms from Aisha in  Book 2, Number 2.19.74,  75, 77 :<br />
c) Maliks Muwatta Book 20   No.  20.46.161 &#8212;very long, all about penalties for contact between a male and female during hajj – and those circumcised parts again!<br />
Above hadiths from USC.EDU suggest that &#8216;circumcision&#8217; of females was normal for Muslims.<br />
3) a)  Hadith in the Musnad by Ahmed Ibn Hanbal, where Shaddad Ibn Aws reports that the prophet said:<br />
      &#8220;Cicumcision is a sunnah for Men, MAKRUMAH for women&#8221;<br />
(MAKRUMAH can be translated as &#8220;noble deed&#8221; or &#8220;honorable&#8221;) cited in answering-Islam.org<br />
b) another quotation from the Prophet &#8220;Circumcision is a sunna for men and a sign of respect for women&#8221;. (Hadith of Abu al-Malih,  Abu Dawud)   cited in Muhammad Salim al-Awwa (article Female Circumcision Neither a Sunna, nor a sign of respect. )<br />
4)  another hadith attributed to Abdullah ibn Umar where the women of al-Ansar were addressed endorsing female circumcision ..( hadith attributed to Abdullah ibn Umar quoted by Abu Nain and others) also cited by Muhammad Salim al-Awwa, who uses the usual claim that transmission is weak, to discount any hadith that shocks the west.<br />
 The hadith are held in great reverence next to the Koran in the Islamic world and serve as the theoretical basis for Islamic law.    The hadith are essential to understanding the Koran and underpin day to day life.  The sunni hadiths were all compiled 200+ years after Mohammad&#8217;s death.  The hadiths were subjected to a thorough examination/refining at the end of the 19th century yet those referring to female &#8216;circumcision&#8217; (FGM) remain.<br />
Many Islamic practices and the basis for many laws are found in the hadiths eg stoning, killing apostates, child marriage.  All the ceremonies of the Hajj were old pagan ceremonies and are only described in hadiths does the fact that they:<br />
a) existed before Islam or<br />
b) are only in hadiths mean that they are NOT part of Islam?<br />
Note:<br />
Muslims choose their words carefully claiming FGM is not &#8216;mandated&#8217; and hide its endorsement in hadiths and law.<br />
The vast majority of FGM is carried out by Muslims spread across many cultures invaded by Arab Muslims eg parts of Africa (it&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t practiced in the southern states), across the middle-east (particularly southern part of Arabian Peninsular, Persian Gulf eg Yemen, Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates listed by some as having FGM), into India (practiced by Daubi Bohra Muslims) and Asia (Malaysia, Indonesia) (WHO reports and others) .<br />
FGM may be more widespread in the middle-east than believed.  &#8220;Academics widely regard FGM as an African disease. But information from Iraqi Kurdistan raises the possibility that the problem is more prevalent in the Middle East than previously believed, and that FGM is far more tied into religion than many Western academics and activists admit.  In early 2003, WADI, a German nongovernmental organization (NGO) focusing on women&#8217;s issues, found that close to 60 percent of Kurdish women questioned had undergone genital circumcision.  Nearly every woman in the survey declared FGM to be a &#8220;normal&#8221; practice… Others stress the religious necessity of FGM…   Islamic scholars disagree on FGM.  But the conclusion that FGM is not a problem of Islamic practice is simply wrong as long as a large number of clerics accept or demand it… Many academics and NGO workers in the region find it objectionable to criticize the predominant Muslim or Arab cultures.  But there are indications that FGM might be widespread in the Arab Middle East; the rate is known to be 90 percent or more in Egypt.&#8221;    By Thomas von der Osten-Sacken and Thomas Uwer are, respectively, managing director and a board member of WADI. This commentary was based on an article in the winter edition of the Middle East Quarterly.  Originally published February 12, 2007<br />
Muslims claim FGM is against Islamic text that says you cannot cut/alter the body but male circumcision is obligatory!<br />
In 2001, Christians attacked in the Maluku islands, Indonesia and surrounds were killed or forced on pain of death to convert to Islam.  Christian babies through to old women were genitally mutilated (clitoridectomy) often with knives from their own kitchens! Will we blame Indonesia&#8217;s Buddhist/Hindu background or the Islamic takeover of Indonesia? (Christina&#8217;s Story;  Sydney Morning Herald 27/12001;  Conversion crusade rends the Spice Islands  The Age 27/1/2001) Across Indonesia, hospitals offer circumcision of baby girls with fears that even more tissue is cut away using the new instruments often resulting in full excision of the clitoris!  Assalaam Foundation treasurer Syarief Hamid, claims that while religion was the main reason for circumcisions, he says there are also health reasons. &#8220;I understand that a girl who is not circumcised would not have clean genitals after she urinates and sometimes that can cause cervical cancer,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The religious view is, if you are not circumcised you won&#8217;t have clean genitals after you urinate. If then you pray, your prayer won&#8217;t be legal.&#8221; The practitioners who came from the local hospital always cut a piece off the clitoris, he says.  Masitoh Chusnan, from the women&#8217;s wing of Muhammadiyah, one of Indonesia&#8217;s two biggest Muslim organisations, says the circumcision of girls is regarded in Islam as an honourable practice. &#8220;The Hadith did not say it&#8217;s obligatory, but it is recommended to have it done,&#8221; she says. &#8220;There is the Prophet&#8217;s words saying girls must be circumcised but you should not cut too much.&#8221; !!  (SMH 13/1/04)<br />
Clitoridectomy may have existed pre-Islam but that doesn&#8217;t mean it wasn&#8217;t incorporated into and spread by Islam.<br />
Although practiced by a small % of Christians and some animists and others in Arab invaded parts of Africa (7th century), this doesn&#8217;t discount the association with Islam or make others equally culpable.   Islamic culture was forced onto others.<br />
Neither Jesus, nor Christian text (Bible) supports FGM which is practised at far lower levels by African Christians than Muslims in both Muslim or non-Muslim majority countries (WHO figures reported in 1995).  According to Amnesty, many Christian practitioners are Muslim converts to Christianity which attempts to stop the practice but sometimes turns a blind eye towards converts!  More recent PC figures on FGM don&#8217;t distinguish religious groups and just list the country!<br />
The fact that not every Muslim practices FGM doesn&#8217;t discount its association with Islam.<br />
Relativists pretend removal of the prepuce in the male which leaves a fully functional, sensitive penis is equivalent to clitoridectomy in females which is equivalent to cutting off the penis or partial cutting/damage to the clitoris which is like cutting/destroying the glans/head of the penis!!<br />
FGM follows the spread of Islam even into the west.  It does NOT follow the spread of Christianity/Buddhism/Hinduism etc!  Most western countries have laws that prohibit FGM but it still goes on and according to WHO/UNICEF is growing thanks to immigration and concerns of parents to keep control of daughters in western societies!  No doubt we will soon be told it&#8217;s part of our &#8216;culture&#8217; and nothing to do with Islam!<br />
FGM is practiced in Australia:  Pamela Bone (who also thought clitoridectomy wasn&#8217;t part of Islamic law!) referred to an interview with Sheik Fehmi al-Imam of the Preston Mosque where she asked him about clitoridectomy and he replied:<br />
&#8220;You probably don&#8217;t need it but women in hot countries do&#8221;!!! (Melbourne   Age 21/7/01 p7)</p>
<p>Abc.net.au (11/5/06) and News.com.au note that over 50 females have been treated/year in Sydney hospitals following FGM.  Some girls are sent overseas for the procedure but others are mutilated here.<br />
Egypt:  An example of the dual playing to western views and adhering to Islamic ones:<br />
There have been a few fatwas (published opinions by Muslim religious scholars. They are non-binding in law)<br />
for/against FGM but the reality is that many Muslims believe it is &#8216;beneficial&#8217; and &#8216;meritorious&#8217; if not obligatory.<br />
a) 29/1/1981: The Great Sheikh of Al-Azhar (the most famous University of the Islamic World) stated that parents must follow the lessons of Mohammed and not listen to medical authorities because the latter often change their minds. Parents must do their duty and have their daughters circumcised.  (Clitoridectomy in Egypt)<br />
b) TARGET, a German human rights group, sponsored a conference on FGM in Cairo, Egypt. Muslim scholars from many nations attended. At the conclusion of the conference on 24/11/2006- they issued statements against FGM but, is this just to please the west?  Would FGM continue as it has for 1400 years if not for the west?<br />
An official ban on female circumcision enacted in 1996 remains ineffective in stopping FGM.  </p>
<p>MEMRI  Middle-east Research Institute:  Inquiry and Analysis Series &#8211; No. 152November 7, 2003 No.152 examines Muslim views on FGM.   Many influential Muslims continue to endorse it and refer to the hadiths cited above and Islamic traditions.  They claim circumcising a girl brings modesty, honor, and emotional balance and prevents AIDS, depravity  and prostitution.   Clitoridectomy stops &#8216;unnatural&#8217; sexual pleasure in girls and makes them clean!  Several claim the west, in trying to stop FGM, is really trying to spread immoral values in the Islamic world and destroy the Muslim family –and contradict Islamic law!<br />
Sheikh Yussef Al-Qaradhawi, one of Sunni Islam&#8217;s most influential clerics and a spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood favors partial circumcision for women as a moderate, just, and reasonable solution best suited to reality. ..In a Fatwa on this issue, he wrote, &#8220;Anyone who thinks that circumcision is the best way to protect his daughters should do it… I support this, particularly in the period in which we live. ….</p>
<p>On 12/2/2007 Al-Arabiya TV aired  &#8216;Al-Azhar University Scholars Argue over the Legitimacy of Female Circumcision Practiced in Egypt.&#8217;  The debate was between Egyptian Al-Azhar University scholars Sheikh Muhammad Al-Mussayar and Sheikh Mahmoud Ashur   The exerts are interesting because they acknowledge the hadiths related to FGM -Muhammad Al-Mussayar: notes &#8220;All the jurisprudents, since the advent of Islam and for 14 centuries or more, are in consensus that female circumcision is permitted by Islam. But they were divided with regard to its status in shari&#8217;a. Some said that female circumcision is required by shari&#8217;a, just like male circumcision. Some said this is the mainstream practice, while others said it is a noble act. But throughout the history of Islam, nobody has ever said that performing female circumcision is a crime. There has been a religious ruling on this for 14 centuries.&#8221;   &#8220;First of all, there are reliable hadiths in Al-Bukhari and Al-Muslim which support female circumcision. The Prophet Muhammad said: &#8216;If a circumcised woman and man have intercourse, they must undergo ablution.&#8217; Unreliable hadiths do not cancel out the reliable ones. We have unreliable hadiths regarding prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage. Should we abolish prayer and charity just because some hadiths are unreliable?..&#8221;Female circumcision is no less valid just because it was practiced in Pharaonic times and in the Jahiliya.  Islam accepted some customs, which were harmonious with human nature, and rejected others, which contradicted human nature.&#8221; (reported by MEMRI.org  27/2/2007 and <a href="http://fgmnetwork.org" rel="nofollow">http://fgmnetwork.org</a>)<br />
FGM is very much a Muslim problem.  Are Muslims ignorant of their hadiths and law that supports FGM or is their false claim that is has nothing to do with Islam taqiyya  -lying to the west to protect and promote Islam?<br />

Lol you zionists love to cut and paste, so funny to rile you guys up and sit back as the same drivel pours forth, you remind so much of the Talmudic scholars who also have a tendency to dribble from the corners of their mouths in rabid anger much like yourself.<br />

And when those on the Christian Right (the few very that exist) that try to murder abortion doctors; they get punished to the highest degree. Most Christians don&#8217;t go around beheading infidels, gays, women in mini-skirts and so on and so forth. Can&#8217;t say the same for those Muslims living under Sharia Law! The difference, if you can listen to Aayan Hirsi Ali&#8217;s arguments is that Christianity and Judaism have undergone a modern Renaissance and have evolved constantly over the past few decades and centuries. We no longer believe it is right to keep slaves, bash gays, punish or torture &#8220;witches&#8221; and adulterers. We have a separation of church and state and base our punishments on civil law; not some holy book. That is where Islam is behind; they want to force Islam on their people (though the Islamist apologists claim there is &#8220;no compulsion in religion&#8221;; which is bulls*it!) and Christian minorities, atheists, those that question Islam. Anyone in an Islamic country who dares question Islam will be threatened with death. Any Muslim who disagrees is either a lunatic in denial or just a plain lunatic. Oh, as for child brides? They still marry young girls in many parts of the Middle East and Asia. That is illegal in the West. You can deny it all you want, but Islam encourages pedophilia.</p>

Who cares if Christians or Jews killed (or have passages in their texts that are violent or promote violence and depravity), forced converted, maimed, tortured millions over the centuries. That&#8217;s in the past and the mainstream churches, including past Popes, have all asked for forgiveness and renounced their past crimes because truly, it was all unbiblical. Even slavery was denounced and segregation ended in this country in the last 150 years. Women given the vote; need I say more? Progress my Muslim friends&#8230; progress. It is something your faith does not want or seem to want because it is anti-Koran and unIslamic to give women, gays, atheists, Christian converts basic human rights and freedom of expression.  </p>
<p>No Christian in any Western nation advocates beheading gays or adulterers but prayers for them. They may try to legislate their morality or vote in their Christian beliefs BUT there is a separation of church and state that we value and uphold; something Muslims do not and neither want as it is unIslamic. I am a gay atheist, but I&#8217;d rather live in a Western Christian majority nation than any Islamic nation; that&#8217;s for sure! That alone should tell you Muslims something about freedom and how your faith is not peaceful or democratic but hateful and backward.</p>

<p>Yes, we&#8217;ve somewhat managed to reduce the power of those religious nuts, but that doesn&#8217;t stop them from continuing to try to roll things back to being what they consider Biblical.</p>

Firstly, why is americans in iraq, pakistan, afganistan never counted in the murders that you americans have committed in their soil. THEY are terrorists for going into iraq like greedy bastards in the name of trying to make &#8220;peace&#8221; so they can just get oil. Its not only America but in the process has killed thousands of innocent people through drone attacks, its other countries who do that too, yet they are never called terrorists. Americans have killed millions also, and i am not gonna lie and say these islamic extremists have not commited terrorist attacks. THEY DID commits attacks that is against the laws of the Quran. I know Jihad is mentioned in the Quran, but that is only necessary when an induvidual forces you to convert, THATS when you fight for your religion. All these terrorists say they are muslim, jewish, catholic but they are not if they are commiting these crimes. And calling muslims pedophiles shows how short minded you are. All these rapists and pedophiles in America are majority chirstan, but you don;t see us nagging you about it.they are just PSYCOPATHS and thats it. so stop freakin fighting, every group has made mistakes and every group has done good stuff. So get over yourselves and move on. Why do ya&#8217;ll gotta be haters all the time.</p>

First. <a href="http://www.loonwatch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.loonwatch.com</a> which created this chart has nothing to do with Princeton University except using definition of &#8220;Loon&#8221;. </p>
<p>Second, the statistics used  <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terrorism-2002-2005/terror02_05#terror_05sum" rel="nofollow">http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terrorism-2002-2005/terror02_05#terror_05sum</a> count as act of terrorism not only homicide attempts but burglary, vandalism, damage or destruction of property; shooting (in the wall of the building), throwing low-yield explosive or incendiary devices into property. Most of JDL acts were against property&#8211;usually of USSR. And happened 20&#8211;30 years ago. Many groups listed in 1980-2005 summary disappeared without leaving successors.</p>
<p>Third, not all acts of terror are in database—only those which were classified by FBI as such. 2002 LA airport was not originally classified as an act of terror—and FBI reclassified it only after public outrage.</p>
<p>Summary: this article is a very sloppy attempt to obfuscate the simple fact that Islamic terrorism is a main threat to North America.</p>

So, before you make stupid comments I suggest you do some solid research on Islam and perhaps read the Quran to get an idea of what Islam really is. </p>
<p>Oh, and I can also make generalized statements. &#8216;All the Jews are responsible  for the treatment of the Palestinian people (IDF soldiers sexually abusing children and women), illegal settlements and stealing of land&#8217;.

I think what you&#8217;re referring to tho&#8217; is murder, even in the eyes of the new head of Planned Parenthood, Dr. Gossett.    So are you saying you&#8217;d like me to be murdered, Kit?</p>

I actually haven&#8217;t heard about how Jewish doctors get Christians to have abortions.  Margaret Sanger, the woman who founded Planned Parenthood (who just appointed Dr. Kermit Gosnell as its new president) was trying to exterminate Black and poor people.  A real left wing pride sort of thing.  I wonder why Jews would have so few abortions?  Could it be that when they get pregnant, they mostly mean to?  And I thought that Christians were rallying AGAINST abortions.<br />
I&#8217;m hopeful that you&#8217;ll enlighten me.</p>

We did not come here escaping religious persecution, nor did we come on slave ships or ocean liners, we are natives.  We are very much like the Palestinian people, we have been invaded, lines of tribes and families forever destroyed our continent has been broken up by invisible lines yet we are told that we are the aliens.  Our dna is the same with all indigenous people of this continent.</p>
<p>My heart breaks for all the indigenous people who are told that they do not belong, Hawaii, Australia, the continent of the Americas natives are disrespected and history shows they were destroyed.</p>
<p>Mike Rivero and Alex Jones could care less for any peoples that has been made alien in their own ancestral land.  Though Mike heart bleeds for the Hawaiians well Mike what about us?</p>
<p>I hope when this nation falls that the Jews who are not loyal to this Republic are put out.  I hope that people would realize the wrongs and right the wrongs that has befallen the natives of their respective country.</p>
<p>I hope we can get rid of the nuclear plants, that we shut down the war machines.  I hope that good people rid this nation of the EVIL that claim to be Americans and replace them with good, honest native people who are more than willing to work to make life better for all.</p>
<p>Like Ice T said, when you occupy a country illegally then you have to have arms&#8230;but if we could respect the original people then turn to them to rebuild then our planet together we all could heal. </p>

<p>I hate all the anti-Hispanic immigrating talk coming from white Americans. It is not the fault of Mexicans that the USA conquered land from Mexico and thus put a border through their ancestral land. If anything the Mexicans should be complaining about Anglo squatters on land that should be, and was, theirs!</p>

<p>Worth noting.<br />
Any and all Jewish groups ceased being active in 1986.  29 years ago.  By comparison, while this report claims that the danger from Islamist groups is being over-exaggerated (based on the frequency of attacks between 1971 and 2005 &#8211; without labeling that fact), it ignores the FBI report itself which notes the increasing presence of Islamist groups in terror, both in the US and (very importantly) on American citizens in foreign locations.  </p>

<p>1. The &#8220;Global War on Terror&#8221; began after 9/11. To make statistical data on terrorism that is relevant to today, but begining you data in 1980 is stupid. To then cut that data off in 2005 is also stupid (although presumably that is when the data itself was compiled). </p>
<p>2. This chart is a chart of successful attacks on the US by actual attack numbers. That means an attack that resulted in one death is treated numerically the same as 9/11 itself. </p>
<p>3. The chart is of successful attacks, but there is relevant information missing. How much of the FBI&#8217;s resources are currently dedicated to tracking, arresting, stopping, etc. Islamic terrorists? How many Islamic terrorists have been stopped before they could carry out an attack (If they were stopped then they don&#8217;t make it into the data used for this chart). If you have 90% of your counterterrorism personnel looking at Muslim terrorists then it makes sense that said group would have fewer successful attacks. This is particularly relevant for any data from before the Global War on Terror. Pre 9/11 if there weren&#8217;t many counterterrorism personnel then it would make sense that there would be a greater number of successful attacks in that time period.</p>

The chart itself is clearly attempting to make the claim that Islamic terrorists are not the leading terrorists in the world. To begin the chart prior to 911 is simply intellectually dishonest. If I were to make a chart about alcohol sales related violence and make the chart from 1910-1925 and then claim that there is very little violence related to the selling of booze it would be a highly intellectually dishonest claim because it would ignore the passing of prohibition and the organized crime that followed. If the chart began on 911 and went to 2010 or a reasonably close proximity thereafter and then showed that Islam wasn&#8217;t the leading terrorists I would say they have a point.</p>

Fascism is just a way to do communism while tricking people into thinking they have capitalism.  It&#8217;s perfect because all the ills that come from it can be blamed on evil capitalists and the government can get more power every time it screws up the economy with its fascist policies.  Actually, there is no left and right.  There are only statists and anti-statists.  Communists, fascists, democrats, republicans, socialists are all just statists.</p>

It is written in the Quran Slay the unbelievers wherever you find them(2:191, Make war on the infidels living in your neighborhood (9:123), When opportunity arises, kill the infidels wherever you catch them (9:5, Kill the Jews and the Christians if they do not convert to Islam or refuse to pay Jizya tax (9:29), Any religion other than Islam is not acceptable (3:85), The Jews and the Christians are perverts; fight them (9:30), Maim and crucify the infidels if they criticize Islam. (5:33),<br />
The infidels are unclean; do not let them into a mosque (9:28),  Punish the unbelievers with garments of fire, hooked iron rods, boiling water; melt their skin and bellies (22:19), Do not hanker for peace with the infidels; behead them when you catch them (47:4), The unbelievers are stupid; urge the Muslims to fight them (8:65), Muslims must not take the infidels as friends (3:28), Terrorize and behead those who believe in scriptures other than the Qur’an (8:12), Muslims must muster all weapons to terrorize the infidels (8:60). All those verses are from the Quran.</p>
<p>The Qur’an certainly proclaims that when the time is appropriate, Muslims must use force to convert the unbelievers to Islam. For the non-Muslims, the alternative to this is to pay the humiliating protection money (Jizya tax) or be killed (by beheading, of course). A militarily dominant Islam, without doubt, precludes the peaceful co-existence with the unbelievers if the Muslims have to abide strictly by the unalterable stipulations of the Qur’an. That is why we see very few “moderate”<br />
muslims coming out and speaking against the violence. There is so much<br />
overwhelming evidence stacked against them not able to be “moderate”<br />
because of the fundamental belief’s of Islam.</p>

<p>Kill People Who Don&#8217;t Listen to Priests</p>
<p>    Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the LORD your God must be put to death. Such evil must be purged from Israel.  (Deuteronomy 17:12 NLT)</p>
<p>Kill Witches</p>
<p>    You should not let a sorceress live.  (Exodus 22:17 NAB)</p>
<p>Kill Homosexuals</p>
<p>    &#8220;If a man lies with a male as with a women, both of them shall be put to death for their abominable deed; they have forfeited their lives.&#8221; (Leviticus 20:13 NAB)</p>
<p>Kill Fortunetellers</p>
<p>    A man or a woman who acts as a medium or fortuneteller shall be put to death by stoning; they have no one but themselves to blame for their death.  (Leviticus 20:27 NAB)</p>
<p>Death for Hitting Dad or Mom</p>
<p>    Whoever strikes his father or mother shall be put to death.  (Exodus 21:15 NAB)</p>
<p>Death for Cursing Parents</p>
<p>1) If one curses his father or mother, his lamp will go out at the coming of darkness.  (Proverbs 20:20 NAB)</p>
<p>    2) All who curse their father or mother must be put to death.  They are guilty of a capital offense.  (Leviticus 20:9 NLT)</p>
<p>Death for Adultery</p>
<p>    If a man commits adultery with another man&#8217;s wife, both the man and the woman must be put to death.  (Leviticus 20:10 NLT)</p>
<p>Death for Fornication </p>
<p>    A priest&#8217;s daughter who loses her honor by committing fornication and thereby dishonors her father also, shall be burned to death.  (Leviticus 21:9 NAB)</p>
<p>Death to Followers of Other Religions </p>
<p>    Whoever sacrifices to any god, except the Lord alone, shall be doomed.  (Exodus 22:19 NAB)</p>
<p>Kill Nonbelievers</p>
<p>    They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul; and everyone who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, was to be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.  (2 Chronicles 15:12-13 NAB)</p>
<p>Kill False Prophets</p>
<p>    If a man still prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall say to him, &#8220;You shall not live, because you have spoken a lie in the name of the Lord.&#8221;  When he prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall thrust him through.<br />
(Zechariah 13:3 NAB)</p>
<p>Kill the Entire Town if One Person Worships Another God</p>
<p>    Suppose you hear in one of the towns the LORD your God is giving you that some worthless rabble among you have led their fellow citizens astray by encouraging them to worship foreign gods.  In such cases, you must examine the facts carefully.  If you find it is true and can prove that such a detestable act has occurred among you, you must attack that town and completely destroy all its inhabitants, as well as all the livestock.  Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the street and burn it.  Put the entire town to the torch as a burnt offering to the LORD your God.  That town must remain a ruin forever; it may never be rebuilt.  Keep none of the plunder that has been set apart for destruction.  Then the LORD will turn from his fierce anger and be merciful to you.  He will have compassion on you and make you a great nation, just as he solemnly promised your ancestors.  &#8220;The LORD your God will be merciful only if you obey him and keep all the commands I am giving you today, doing what is pleasing to him.&#8221;  (Deuteronomy 13:13-19 NLT)</p>
<p>Kill Women Who Are Not Virgins On Their Wedding Night</p>
<p>    But if this charge is true (that she wasn&#8217;t a virgin on her wedding night), and evidence of the girls virginity is not found, they shall bring the girl to the entrance of her fathers house and there her townsman shall stone her to death, because she committed a crime against Israel by her unchasteness in her father&#8217;s house.  Thus shall you purge the evil from your midst.  (Deuteronomy  22:20-21 NAB)</p>
<p>Kill Followers of Other Religions.</p>
<p>    1) If your own full brother, or your son or daughter, or your beloved wife, or you intimate friend, entices you secretly to serve other gods, whom you and your fathers have not known, gods of any other nations, near at hand or far away, from one end of the earth to the other: do not yield to him or listen to him, nor look with pity upon him, to spare or shield him, but kill him.  Your hand shall be the first raised to slay him; the rest of the people shall join in with you.  You shall stone him to death, because he sought to lead you astray from the Lord, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that place of slavery.  And all Israel, hearing of this, shall fear and never do such evil as this in your midst.<br />
(Deuteronomy 13:7-12 NAB)</p>
<p>    2) Suppose a man or woman among you, in one of your towns that the LORD your God is giving you, has done evil in the sight of the LORD your God and has violated the covenant by serving other gods or by worshiping the sun, the moon, or any of the forces of heaven, which I have strictly forbidden.  When you hear about it, investigate the matter thoroughly. If it is true that this detestable thing has been done in Israel, then that man or woman must be taken to the gates of the town and stoned to death.  (Deuteronomy 17:2-5 NLT)</p>
<p>Shall I go on?</p>

There&#8217;s a better chance you&#8217;ll die from an allergic reaction to a bee sting ( no breakdowns on the bee&#8217;s nationality or religious identity are available &#8211; however addiction to honey seems to be involved ) or peanuts. Children seem to fall victim to Terrorist Televisions suicidal falls from tall furniture. Captured Televisions that survived these falls were water boarded but, they refused to name the organizations they were with. Markings on these sets implicate the following terrorist affiliations:</p>
<p>Sons of liberty New York chapter<br />
Rhodesian Cocks of Africa<br />
Jewish Vigilante Army<br />
Syrian- Armenian-Moldavian-Salafist Uber-Nutter Gang<br />
Tai Opiated Stick Hash Insane Bukkake Anarchists</p>
<p>to name just a few of these child murdering boxes of crap.</p>
<p>Saint Adam Lanza&#8217;s Pancake Breakfast seems to be the only event these terror cells have in common all though screwing virgins seems to be a common motivator amongst male terrorists&#8230;well&#8230;actually&#8230;males that are not terrorists as well&#8230;although males that are not terrorists seem to not be overly concerned about the level of virginity involved.</p>
<p>Overall, it can be said with confidence, that several trillion dollars spent on the bogus &#8220;War on Terror&#8221; has been a huge flop and media executives are in talks discussing new propaganda programming for the fall season.</p>

The filthy cultists have quite a foothold in France,in fact lets ask, how is France enjoying their 8-10% Muslim population? Females walking around with black KKK style sheets covering their bodies, French neighborhoods that are no longer safe to walk through because they are infested with filthy Muslims, Muslims living as parasites off French social or health services, how&#8217;s all that going? </p>
<p>Are you enjoying your Muslim population who HATE your country and are only there in an effort to someday drive French people out and make it an Islamic state? Once again, as we hear every few decades, the French need help from her allies. These filthy Muslim pigs molest children, leach from your French government and dispose you because you are infidels. </p>
<p>Whoever wrote this article is talking out of their ass! The only other attack from foreign nationals on america was the japs, and how well did that work out for them? You can try to water down your statistics by including gang murders or other bullshit but the fact is that these filthy sub human scum dispose the west yet they infest the west and the world has had about enough of their behavior. </p>
<p>Do you want to see REAL terrorist statistics? Go to THERELIGIONOFPEACE DOT COM. There you can get accurate information which proves the writer of this blog is either a filthy Muslim, or a brain dead Frenchman. I challenge you to look at that info and do an article which accurately reflects the threat that this cult poses to humanity as a whole. Humanity and Islam have NOTHING in common. Islam is a self serving cult where you can go to beat your wife, practice pedophile activities while hiding behind sharia laws and blame the rest of the world for your problems. It&#8217;s a sickness, a disease, and the hate spreading cult that it is will leave a shell of what once was France if you don&#8217;t face facts, FAST!</p>

It includes &#8220;vandalism&#8221; and &#8220;arson&#8221; &#8211; attacks with no human casualties in the list of &#8220;Terrorist attacks&#8221;. Also attacks on foreign soil against Americans, as well as thwarted terrorist attacks are not included. Finally because it does not present a picture of &#8220;extent of casualties and devastation&#8221; caused by these attacks (such as ones on 9/11 and Boston bombings) it creates a very distorted picture. Truth of the matter is &#8211; Islamic Terrorism is still the biggest threat to the World Peace.</p>

attacks and fatalities for the third consecutive year,” the report says.<br />
  “More than 5,700 incidents were attributed to Sunni extremists,<br />
accounting for nearly 56 percent of all attacks and about 70 percent of<br />
 all fatalities.”</p>
<p>The report says that in 2011, a total of 10,283 terrorism attacks<br />
across the world killed 12,533 people. Terrorism also is blamed for<br />
25,903 injuries and 5,554 kidnappings.</p>
<p>According to NCTC, of the 12,533 terrorism-related deaths worldwide,<br />
 8,886 were perpetrated by “Sunni extremists,” 1,926 by<br />
“secular/political/anarchist” groups, 1,519 by “unknown” factions, 170<br />
by a category described as “other”, and 77 by “Neo-Nazi/Fascist/White<br />

Watch as the self-deceived Zionists savagely attack their mortal goyam enemies while the hallucinating Islamists and Christians mirror that very same atrocious, white-hot blinding hate as closely they can, with the only goal in mind being to exceed it if possible. Watch as hate, in its purest, most pungent form (bickering over religious myth) is slapped back &amp; forth between its delusionals as if it were the ball in a championship ping-pong tournament, the verbal vileness escalating with every serve.</p>
<p>Thank you, religion of Abraham, for providing two millennia of rich &amp; fertile ground for abject hate to flourish and proliferate, infecting even the occasional atheist/non-believer as an illustration of how powerfully parasitic mere words cobbled together by early century desert dwelling donkey riders can actually be.</p>
