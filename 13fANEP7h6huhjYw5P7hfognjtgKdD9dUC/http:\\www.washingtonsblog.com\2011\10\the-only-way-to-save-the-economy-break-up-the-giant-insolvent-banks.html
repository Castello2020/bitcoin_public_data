						<h3 style="color: #000099;">The Government Created the Giant Banks</h3>
<p>As MIT economics professor and former IMF chief economist Simon Johnson <a title="points out" href="http://baselinescenario.com/2009/10/13/diana-farrell-and-the-white-house-theory-of-bank-size/" target="_blank">points out</a>, the official White House position is that:</p>
<blockquote><p>(1) <span style="font-weight: bold;">The government </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">created </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">the mega-giants, and they are not the product of free market competition</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>(2) The White House needs to “regulate and oversee them”, even though it is clear that the government has no real plans to regulate or oversee the banking behemoths</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>(3) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Giant banks are good for the econom</span>y</p></blockquote>
<p>This is false &#8230; giant banks are <span style="font-style: italic;">incredibly destructive </span>for the economy.</p>

<p>In addition, many top economists and financial experts, including Bank of Israel Governor <a title="Stanley Fischer" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=aUTh4YMmI6QE" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Stanley Fischer</a> – who was Ben Bernanke’s thesis adviser at MIT – say that – <span>at the very least</span> – the size of the financial giants should be limited.</p>
<p>Even the Bank of International Settlements – the <a title="“Central Banks’ Central Bank”" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/08/the-banks-own-the-fed-and-the-central-banks-own-bis.html">“Central Banks’ Central Bank”</a> – has slammed too big to fail. As <a title="summarized" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/947cfe24-64d7-11de-a13f-00144feabdc0.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">summarized</a> by the Financial Times:</p>
<blockquote><p>The report was particularly scathing in its assessment of governments’ attempts to clean up their banks. “The reluctance of officials to quickly clean up the banks, many of which are now owned in large part by governments, may well delay recovery,” it said, adding that government interventions had ingrained the belief that some banks were too big or too interconnected to fail.</p>
<p>This was dangerous because it reinforced the risks of moral hazard which might lead to an even bigger financial crisis in future.</p></blockquote>
<p>And as I <a title="noted" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2008/12/the-central-banks-central-bank-says-bailouts-putting-nations-at-risk-as-confirmed-by-higher-credit-default-swap-spreads.html">noted</a> in December 2008, the big banks are the major reason why sovereign debt has become a crisis:</p>
<blockquote><p><em></em>BIS points out in a new <a title="report" href="http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt0812.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> that the bank rescue packages have transferred significant risks onto government balance sheets, which is reflected in the corresponding widening of sovereign credit default swaps:</p>
<blockquote><p>The scope and magnitude of the bank rescue packages also meant that significant risks had been transferred onto government balance sheets. This was particularly apparent in the market for CDS referencing sovereigns involved either in large individual bank rescues or in broad-based support packages for the financial sector, including the United States. While such CDS were thinly traded prior to the announced rescue packages, spreads widened suddenly on increased demand for credit protection, while corresponding financial sector spreads tightened.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, by assuming huge portions of the risk from banks trading in toxic derivatives, and by spending trillions that they don’t have, central banks have put their countries at risk from default.</p></blockquote>
<p>Similarly, a study of 124 banking crises by the International Monetary Fund <a title="found" href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2008/wp08224.pdf" target="_blank">found</a> that propping banks which are only pretending to be solvent hurts the economy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Existing empirical research has shown that providing assistance to banks and their borrowers can be <span style="font-weight: bold;">counterproductive</span>, resulting in increased losses to banks, which often <span style="font-style: italic;">abuse forbearance to take unproductive risks at government expense</span>. The typical result of forbearance is a deeper hole in the net worth of banks, <span style="font-weight: bold;">crippling tax burdens to finance bank bailouts<span style="font-weight: bold;">, </span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">and even more severe credit supply contraction and economic decline than would have occurred in the absence of forbearance. </span></p>
<p>Cross-country analysis to date also shows that accommodative policy measures (such as substantial liquidity support, explicit government guarantee on financial institutions’ liabilities and forbearance from prudential regulations) tend to be <span style="font-weight: bold;">fiscally costly </span>and that these particular policies do not necessarily accelerate the speed of economic recovery.</p>
<p>***</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>All too often, central banks privilege stability over cost in the heat of the containment phase: if so, they may <span style="font-weight: bold;">too liberally extend loans to an illiquid bank which is almost certain to prove insolvent anyway</span>. Also, closure of a nonviable bank is often delayed for too long, even when there are clear signs of insolvency (Lindgren, 2003). Since bank closures face many obstacles, there is a tendency to rely instead on blanket government guarantees which, if the government’s fiscal and political position makes them credible, can work albeit at the <span style="font-weight: bold;">cost of placing the burden on the budget</span>, typically squeezing future provision of needed public services.</p></blockquote>

<p>Fortune <a title="pointed out" href="http://money.cnn.com/2009/02/03/news/small.banks.fortune/index.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reports</a> that smaller banks are stepping in to fill the lending void left by the giant banks’ current hesitancy to make loans. Indeed, the article points out that the only reason that smaller banks haven’t been able to expand and thrive is that the too-big-to-fails have decreased competition:</p>
<blockquote><p>Growth for the nation’s smaller banks represents a reversal of trends from the last twenty years, when the biggest banks got much bigger and many of the smallest players were gobbled up or driven under…</p>
<p>As big banks struggle to find a way forward and rising loan losses threaten to punish poorly run banks of all sizes, smaller but well capitalized institutions have a long-awaited chance to expand.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>As big banks struggle, community banks are stepping in to offer loans and lines of credit to small business owners…</p>
<p>At a congressional hearing on small business and the economic recovery earlier this month, economist Paul Merski, of the Independent Community Bankers of America, a Washington (D.C.) trade group, told lawmakers that community banks make 20% of all small-business loans, even though they represent only about 12% of all bank assets. Furthermore, he said that about 50% of all small-business loans under $100,000 are made by community banks…</p>
<p>Indeed, for the past two years, small-business lending among community banks has grown at a faster rate than from larger institutions, according to Aite Group, a Boston banking consultancy. “Community banks are quickly taking on more market share not only from the top five banks but from some of the regional banks,” says Christine Barry, Aite’s research director. “They are focusing more attention on small businesses than before. They are seeing revenue opportunities and deploying the right solutions in place to serve these customers.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Fed Governor Daniel K. Tarullo <a title="said" href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20090615a.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The importance of traditional financial intermediation services, and hence of the smaller banks that typically specialize in providing those services, tends to increase during times of financial stress. Indeed, the crisis has highlighted the important continuing role of community banks…</p>
<p>For example, while the number of credit unions has declined by 42 percent since 1989, credit union deposits have more than quadrupled, and credit unions have increased their share of national deposits from 4.7 percent to 8.5 percent. In addition, some credit unions have shifted from the traditional membership based on a common interest to membership that encompasses anyone who lives or works within one or more local banking markets. In the last few years, some credit unions have also moved beyond their traditional focus on consumer services to provide services to small businesses, increasing the extent to which they compete with community banks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thomas M. Hoenig <a title="said" href="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/document-preview.aspx?doc_id=31069553" target="_blank">pointed out</a> in a speech at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce summit in Washington:</p>
<blockquote><p>During the recent financial crisis, losses quickly depleted the capital of these large, over-leveraged companies. As expected, these firms were rescued using government funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The result was an immediate reduction in lending to Main Street, as the financial institutions tried to rebuild their capital. Although these institutions have raised substantial amounts of new capital, much of it has been used to repay the TARP funds instead of supporting new lending.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
</span></p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, Hoenig pointed out:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2009, 45 percent of banks with assets under $1 billion increased their business lending.</p></blockquote>
<p>45% is about <em>45% more</em>than the amount of increased lending by the too big to fails.</p>
<p>Indeed, some very smart people say that the big banks aren’t really focusing as much on the lending business as smaller banks.</p>
<p>Specifically since Glass-Steagall was repealed in 1999, the giant banks have made much of their money in trading assets, securities, derivatives and other speculative bets, the banks’ own paper and securities, and in other money-making activities which have nothing to do with traditional depository functions.</p>
<p>Now that the economy has crashed, the big banks are making very few loans to consumers or small businesses because they <span>still</span> have trillions in bad derivatives gambling debts to pay off, and so they are only loaning to the biggest players and those who don’t really need credit in the first place. See <a title="this" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/07/banks-still-not-lending.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this</a> and <a title="this." href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2008/10/banks-admit-theyll-keep-on-hoarding-cash.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this.</a></p>
<p>So we don’t really <span>need </span>these giant gamblers. We don’t really <span>need </span><a title="JP Morgan, Citi, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/07/96-of-credit-derivative-risk-held-by-5.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">JP Morgan, Citi, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley</a>. What we need are <span>dedicated lenders</span>.</p>
<p>The Fortune article discussed above points out that the banking giants are not necessarily more efficient than smaller banks:</p>
<blockquote><p>The largest banks often don’t show the greatest efficiency. This now seems unsurprising given the deep problems that the biggest institutions have faced over the past year.</p>
<p>“They actually experience diseconomies of scale,” Narter wrote of the biggest banks. “There are so many large autonomous divisions of the bank that the complexity of connecting them overwhelms the advantage of size.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And Governor Tarullo points out some of the benefits of small community banks over the giant banks:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many community banks have thrived, in large part because their local presence and personal interactions give them an advantage in meeting the financial needs of many households, small businesses, and agricultural firms. Their business model is based on an important economic explanation of the role of financial intermediaries–to develop and apply expertise that allows a lender to make better judgments about the creditworthiness of potential borrowers than could be made by a potential lender with less information about the borrowers.</p>
<p>A small, but growing, body of research suggests that the financial services provided by large banks are less-than-perfect substitutes for those provided by community banks.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is simply not true that we need the mega-banks. In fact, as many top economists and financial analysts have said, the “too big to fails” are actually stifling competition from smaller lenders and credit unions, and dragging the entire economy down into a black hole.</p>

<p>In addition, Richard Alford – former New York Fed economist, trading floor economist and strategist – <a title="showed" href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/04/alford-why-dismantling-too-big-to-fail-firms-makes-economic-sense.html" target="_blank">showed</a> that banks that get too big benefit from “information asymmetry” which disrupts the free market.</p>
<p>Nobel prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz <a title="noted" href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/2009/09/17/exclusive-nobel-winner-joseph-stiglitz-predicts-recessions-end/" target="_blank">noted</a> in September that giants like Goldman are using their size to manipulate the market:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The main problem that Goldman raises is a question of size: ‘too big to fail.’ In some markets, they have a significant fraction of trades. Why is that important? They trade both on their proprietary desk and on behalf of customers. When you do that and you have a significant fraction of all trades, you have a lot of information.”</p>
<p>Further, he says, “That raises the potential of conflicts of interest, problems of front-running, using that inside information for your proprietary desk. And that’s why the Volcker report came out and said that we need to restrict the kinds of activity that these large institutions have. If you’re going to trade on behalf of others, if you’re going to be a commercial bank, you can’t engage in certain kinds of risk-taking behavior.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The giants (especially Goldman Sachs) have also used high-frequency program trading which not only <a title="distorted the markets" href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/paul-wilmott-high-frequency-trading-may-increasingly-destabilize-market" target="_blank">distorted the markets</a> – making up more than 70% of stock trades – but which also let the program trading giants take a sneak peak at what the real (aka “human”) traders are buying and selling, and then trade on the insider information. See <a title="this" href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/whoa-glitch-hft" target="_blank">this</a>, <a title="this" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/07/corporate-media-spotlights-distortion-of-market-by-high-frequency-trading.html">this</a>, <a class="broken_link" title="this" href="http://www.zerohedge.com/taxonomy_vtn/term/8356" target="_blank">this</a>, <a title="this" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/07/what-is-high-frequency-trading-and-how.html">this</a> and <a title="this" href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=18809" target="_blank">this</a>. (This is <a title="frontrunning" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_running" target="_blank">frontrunning</a>, which is illegal; but it is a lot bigger than garden variety frontrunning, because the program traders are not only trading based on inside knowledge of what their <span style="font-style: italic;">own clients </span>are doing, they are also trading based on knowledge of what <span style="font-style: italic;">all other traders </span>are doing).</p>
<p>Goldman also <a title="admitted" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/07/goldman-sachs-admits-its-software-can.html">admitted</a> that its proprietary trading program can “manipulate the markets in unfair ways”. The giant banks have also allegedly used their <a title="Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=SLE&amp;q=%22counterparty+risk+management+policy+group%22&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=g3" target="_blank">Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group</a> (CRMPG) to exchange secret information and formulate coordinated mutually beneficial actions, all with the <a title="government’s blessings" href="http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/bank/hba57791.000/hba57791_0f.htm" target="_blank">government’s blessings</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, a handful of giants doing it, it can manipulate the entire economy in ways which are not good for the American citizen.</p>

<h3 style="color: #000099;">The Failure to Break Up the Big Banks Is Dooming Us to a Derivatives Depression</h3>
<p>All independent experts agree that unless we rein in derivatives, will have another &#8211; bigger &#8211; financial crisis.</p>
<p>But the big banks are preventing derivatives from being tamed.</p>
<p>We have also pointed out that derivatives are still <a title="very dangerous" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/09/credit-default-swaps-are-still.html">very dangerous</a> for the economy, that the derivatives “reform” legislation previously passed has probably actually <a style="font-style: italic;" title="weakened" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/10/senator-cantwell-congress-weakening.html">weakened</a> existing regulations, and the legislation was “<a title="probably written by JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/11/new-derivatives-legislation-was.html">probably written by JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs</a>“.</p>
<p>As I <a title="noted" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/04/%E2%80%9Cwe-are-in-a-cabal-five-or-six-players-own-the-regulatory-apparatus-everybody-is-afraid-to-regulate-them.html">noted</a> last year:</p>
<blockquote><p>Harold Bradley – who oversees almost $2 billion in assets as chief investment officer at the Kauffman Foundation – <a title="told" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62T5RD20100331" target="_blank">told</a> the Reuters Global Exchanges and Trading Summit in New York that a cabal is preventing swap derivatives from being forced onto clearing exchanges:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no incentive from the moneyed interests in either Washington or New York to change it…</p>
<p>I believe we are in a cabal. There are five or six players only who are engaged and dominant in this marketplace and apparently they own the regulatory apparatus. Everybody is afraid to regulate them.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s bad enough.</p>
<p>But Bob Litan of the Brookings Institute wrote a <a title="paper" href="http://www.brookings.edu/%7E/media/Files/rc/papers/2010/0407_derivatives_litan/0407_derivatives_litan.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> (here’s a <a title="summary" href="http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/0407_derivatives_litan.aspx" target="_blank">summary</a>) showing that – even if <span style="font-style: italic;">real</span> derivatives legislation is ever passed – the 5 <a title="big derivatives players" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/07/96-of-credit-derivative-risk-held-by-5.html">big derivatives players</a> will <span style="font-style: italic;">still </span>prevent any real change. James Kwak <a title="notes " href="http://baselinescenario.com/2010/04/14/the-derivatives-dealers%e2%80%99-club/" target="_blank">notes </a>that Litan is no radical, but has previously written in defense in financial “innovation”.</p>
<p>Here’s a good <a title="summary" href="http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2010/04/12/bob-litan-on-derivatives-reform-1-failure-even-with-a-win/" target="_blank">summary</a> from Rortybomb, showing that this is yet another reason to break up the too big to fails:</p>
<blockquote><p>Litan is worried about the “Dealer’s Club” of the major derivatives players. I particularly like this paper as the best introduction to the current oligarchy that takes place in the very profitable over-the-counter derivatives trading market and credit default swap market. [Litton says]:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have written this essay primarily to call attention to the main impediments to meaningful reform: the private actors who now control the trading of derivatives and all key elements of the infrastructure of derivatives trading, the major dealer banks. The importance of this “Derivatives Dealers’ Club” cannot be overstated. All end-users who want derivatives products, CDS in particular, must transact with dealer banks…I will argue that the major dealer banks have strong financial incentives and the ability to delay or impede changes from the status quo — <em>even if the legislative reforms that are now being widely discussed are adopted</em> — that would make the CDS and eventually other derivatives markets safer and more transparent for all concerned…</p>
<p>Here, of course, I refer to the major derivatives dealers – the top 5 dealer-banks that control virtually all of the dealer-to-dealer trades in CDS, together with a few others that participate with the top 5 in other institutions important to the derivatives market. <strong>Collectively, these institutions have the ability and incentive, if not counteracted by policy intervention, to delay, distort or impede clearing, exchange trading and transparency</strong>…</p>
<p>Market-makers make the most profit, however, as long as they can operate as much in the dark as is possible – so that customers don’t know the true going prices, only the dealers do. This opacity allows the dealers to keep spreads high…</p>
<p>In combination, these various market institutions – relating to standardization, clearing and pricing – have incentives not to rock the boat, and not to accelerate the kinds of changes that would make the derivatives market safer and more transparent. <strong>The common element among all of these institutions is strong participation, if not significant ownership, by the major dealers.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So Bob Litan is waving a giant red flag that the top dealer-banks that control the CDS market can more or less, through a variety of means he lays out convincingly in the paper, derail or significantly slow down CDS reform after the fact if it passes.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>If you thought we’d at least get our arms around credit default swap reform from a financial reform bill, you should read this report from Litan as a giant warning flag. In case you weren’t sure if you’ve heard anyone directly lay out the case on how the market and political concentration in the United States banking sector hurts consumers and increases systemic risk through both political pressures and anticompetitive levels of control of the institutions of the market, now you have. It’s not Matt Taibbi, but it’s much further away from a “everything is actually fine and the Treasury is in control of reform” reassurance. Which should scare you, and give you yet another good reason for size caps for the major banks.</p></blockquote>

This pattern is so well known among scholars that it has a name: “regulatory capture.” This effect can be due to the political influence of the industry on its regulators; or to the fact that the regulators spend so much time with their charges that they come to accept their world view; or to the prospect of lucrative private-sector jobs when regulators retire or resign.</p></blockquote>

</ul>
<p>But there is an even more interesting reason . . .</p>
<p>The number one reason the TBTF’s aren’t being broken up is [drumroll] . . . the ‘ole 80′s playbook is being used.</p>
<p>As the New York Times <a title="wrote" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/business/worldbusiness/13iht-13insolvent.20163493.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wrote</a> in February:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the 1980s, during the height of the Latin American debt crisis, the total risk to the nine money-center banks in New York was estimated at more than three times the capital of those banks. The regulators, analysts say, did not force the banks to value those loans at the fire-sale prices of the moment, helping to avert a disaster in the banking system.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the nine biggest banks were all insolvent in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Indeed, Richard C. Koo – former economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and doctoral fellow with the Fed’s Board of Governors, and now chief economist for Nomura – <a title="confirmed" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/10/the-largest-u-s-banks-have-repeatedly-gone-bankrupt-due-to-wild-speculation-the-fed-blessed-the-speculation-then-helped-cover-up-the-bankruptcies.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> this fact last year in a speech to the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies. Specifically, Koo said that -after the Latin American crisis hit in 1982 – the New York Fed concluded that <span>7 out of 8</span> money center banks were actually “underwater” and “bankrupt”, but that the Fed hid that fact from the American people.</p>
<p>So the government’s failure to break up the insolvent giants – even though virtually all independent experts say that is the only way to save the economy, and even though there is <span>no good reason</span> <span>not</span> to break them up – is nothing new.</p>
<p>William K. Black’s statement that <a title="the government’s " href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/04/senior-sl-regulator-says-government-engaging-in-massive-cover-up-of-economic-crisis-%e2%80%9cthe-entire-strategy-is-to-keep-people-from-getting-the-facts%e2%80%9d.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the government’s </a><span><a title="entire strategy" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/04/senior-sl-regulator-says-government-engaging-in-massive-cover-up-of-economic-crisis-%e2%80%9cthe-entire-strategy-is-to-keep-people-from-getting-the-facts%e2%80%9d.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">entire strategy</a> </span>now – as in the S&amp;L crisis – is to <span>cover up how bad things are</span> (“the entire strategy is to keep people from getting the facts”) makes a lot more sense.</p>

<p>Despite frosty relations with the titans of Wall Street, President Obama has still managed to raise far more money this year from the financial and banking sector than Mitt Romney or any other Republican presidential candidate, according to new fundraising data.</p>
<p>Obama’s key advantage over the GOP field is the ability to collect bigger checks because he raises money for both his own campaign committee and for the Democratic National Committee, which will aid in his reelection effort.</p>
<p>As a result, Obama has brought in more money from employees of banks, hedge funds and other financial service companies than all of the GOP candidates combined, according to a Washington Post analysis of contribution data. The numbers show that Obama retains a persistent reservoir of support among Democratic financiers who have backed him since he was an underdog presidential candidate four years ago…</p>
<p>Channeling ‘Occupy’ anger</p>
<p>Obama’s ties to Wall Street donors could complicate Democratic plans to paint Republicans as puppets of the financial industry, particularly in light of the Occupy Wall Street protests that have gone global over the past week.</p>
<p>In response to the protests, the Obama campaign and other Democrats have stepped up their attacks on Romney and other Republicans for their opposition to Wall Street regulations.</p>
<p>One top banking executive who raises money for Obama, discussing fundraising efforts on the condition of anonymity, said reports of disaffection with the president “are exaggerated and overblown.” He said a strong contingent of financiers in New York, Chicago and California remains supportive of Obama and his economic policies, even as some have turned on him.</p>
<p>But, this donor added, “it probably helps from a political perspective if he’s not seen as a Wall Street guy.” …</p>

Until we control our own currency and make sure it is backed with a precious metal (which makes it actual money and not simply a fiat currency that can be manipulated by the governing body) where the market controls the worth and not a handful of politicians and bankers with agenda which creates debt, we will go through the huge bubbles and crashes that a fiat currency brings and an eventual currency collapse. Currency collapses have happened time after time and no fiat currency has ever lasted over about 40 years.

<p>Here&#8217;s how we easily Reform Wall Street: WE take away their powers &#8220;Once Again.&#8221; &#8211;And I feel one of the best ways to help get this accomplished is a Million People March to Capitol Hill! &#8211;And in Every City that Day!</p>
<p>How to do it right? First, we need to have Specific Demands; such as, &#8220;Congress, we are here because we want you to REINSTATE the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 <a href="http://law.jrank.org/pages/7165/Glass-Steagall-Act.html" rel="nofollow">http://law.jrank.org/pages/7165/Glass-Steagall-Act.html</a> which was created to help save our country from the Great Depression by preventing investment companies, banks, and insurance companies from merging and becoming large brokerage firms&#8211;instead of just being Banks and Insurance Companies&#8211;Congress why can&#8217;t you learn a history lesson from 1929? The current system doesn&#8217;t work, except for the 1%, twice again now.  Btw, why did most of you vote for the major repeal of G-S Act in 1999? Shattering The Glass-Steagall Act: <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2008/09/19/shattering-the-glass-steagall-act" rel="nofollow">http://www.counterpunch.org/2008/09/19/shattering-the-glass-steagall-act</a> (2nd story here).</p>
<p>How did we all come to this conclusion? We looked back to 1999 to where it all began with Senator Phil Gramm who helped create &#8220;legal&#8221; gambling casinos for our banks: CNN&#8217;s The 10 Most Responsible for Economy Collapse: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKQOxr2wBZQ&#038;feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKQOxr2wBZQ&#038;feature=related</a></p>
<p>Furthermore Congress, we also want you to CHANGE the Commodities Future Modernization Act of 2000 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Modernization_Act_of_2000" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Modernization_Act_of_2000</a>  BACK to where it was before 2000, which has since deregulated energy markets and consequently allowed for such scams as The Enron Loophole; whereas in the early 2000&#8242;s Enron Corp. was charging 250 bucks plus for a kilowatt hour&#8230;They went to jail for this. But, the Enron loophole is still not completely closed; for example, allowing speculators to resell barrels of oil over and over again before it reaches the gas station owner. It&#8217;s basically legal gambling at our expense. What were those lawmakers thinking then? What are you thinking now? With all due respect, either do the right thing, or you&#8217;re part of the 1%.&#8221;</p>
<p>So why are oil prices high? The Enron Loophole is not Completely Closed. What is The Enron Loophole?</p>

<p>Former Head of U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Professor Michael Greenberger, speaks to Congress in 2008 on the high price of oil&#8211;and he&#8217;s not happy about Energy Deregulations, especially The Loopholes: </p>

<p>Although, the 2008 Farm Bill and 2010 Dodd-Frank Act <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/2011/rpt/2011-R-0290.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cga.ct.gov/2011/rpt/2011-R-0290.htm</a> supposedly Closed The Enron Loophole; but, most experts say that both didn&#8217;t go far enough! In the other words, The Loophole is still Open! Which seems to affect us all every time we hear a oil shortage story&#8230;(love to get Michael Greenberger to help us bring back our old Commodities Futures Act!)</p>
<p>Public Citizen Takes on WS&#8217;s Greed: <a href="http://www.citizen.org/Page.aspx?pid=2554" rel="nofollow">http://www.citizen.org/Page.aspx?pid=2554</a></p>
<p>Back to G-S Act: Rolling Stones&#8217;s Journalist Matt Taibbi&#8211;Truth about Goldman Sachs&#8211;How they have Cornered the Markets&#8211;Basically, The Enron Loophole and the Shattering of Glass-Steagall Act in 1999. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waL5UxScgUw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waL5UxScgUw</a> </p>
<p>What happened when some in Congress tried to SAVE the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999? <a href="http://www.occasionalplanet.org/2010/10/07/glass-steagall-one-democratic-senator-who-got-it-right/" rel="nofollow">http://www.occasionalplanet.org/2010/10/07/glass-steagall-one-democratic-senator-who-got-it-right/</a> And when some tried to REINSTATE The Glass-Steagall Act in 2009? (cut to the chase&#8211;it was blocked by both parties from coming-up for a vote on the Senate Floor) : <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&#038;sid=aQfRyxBZs5uc" rel="nofollow">http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&#038;sid=aQfRyxBZs5uc</a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get focused and bring back the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933; they got it right 1933, so we don&#8217;t need to REINVENT the wheel, because bringing this Act back will help create an even playing field once again&#8230;and let&#8217;s Finally Close The Enron Loophole, which allowed Enron to charge what they wanted for energy; they went to jail for this; but no one Completely Closed the Loophole, why? Re-Election Monies from the Big Brokerage Firms! The Writing is on the Wall. </p>
<p>Next, let&#8217;s get Organized and Reinstate these Critical Financial Reforms with a Million People March to Capitol Hill! And in Every City! And considering we need a Strong Central Focus/Goal, maybe call it: </p>
<p>&#8220;The Million People March to Capital Hill to Reinstate The Glass-Steagall Act and to Finally Close The Enron Loophole.&#8221;</p>
<p>That will get their Attention!</p>
<p>And how about holding the March on this Date? June 16, 2012, the 79th Year Anniversary  of the Enactment of the Glass-Steagall Act. (great idea paulg4!) </p>
<p>And besides being symbolic, that will get their Attention Now!</p>
<p>I feel this needs to be the OWS&#8217;s first BIG Victory (as name implies)&#8211;And with all due respect, I feel you owe it to the WS Protestors to Get Something Done That They Can Really Be Proud Of&#8211;And There is Nothing Bigger Than Bringing Back The G-S Act and Closing These Loopholes!</p>
