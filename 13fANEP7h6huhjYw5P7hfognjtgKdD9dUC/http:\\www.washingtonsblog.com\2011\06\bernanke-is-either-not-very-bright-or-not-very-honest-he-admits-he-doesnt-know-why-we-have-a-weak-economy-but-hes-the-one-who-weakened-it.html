<p>In &#8220;Bernanke Admits He’s Clueless On Economy’s Soft Patch&#8221;, Forbes blogger Agustino Fontevecchia <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/afontevecchia/2011/06/22/bernanke-admits-hes-clueless-on-economys-soft-patch/">notes</a>:</p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>Brutally honest, Bernanke admitted that he had no clue what was  actually causing the current fragility in the U.S. economic recovery.   While the <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/afontevecchia/2011/06/22/fomc-statement-ahead-of-bernanke-says-nothing-new/">FOMC statement assigned blame outside of the U.S.</a>,  pointing at Japan along with rising food and oil prices, Bernanke was  put on the spot by a reporter who noted the inconsistency behind that  explanation and a lowering of long term forecasts.  Bernanke took the  hit, admitting only some of the factors were temporary and that he  didn’t know exactly what was causing the slowdown, but that it would  persist.  “Growth,” said Bernanke, “will return into 2012.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Specifically, Bernanke said today:</p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>We don&#8217;t have a precise read on why this slower pace of growth is persisting. </p></blockquote>
<p>Well, it is obvious to anyone who has been paying attention what&#8217;s causing the slow down, and if Mr. Bernanke doesn&#8217;t know, he should be fired.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve repeatedly <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/12/questions-for-bernankes-senate.html">explained</a> since 2008, all independent economists and financial experts know why the economy is weak &#8230; and <span style="font-style:italic;">everything </span>the Fed has been doing has been weakening it.<span style="font-style:italic;"></span></p>
<p><span id="mDocumentText_ctl00_mTextDisplay" class="DocumentBody"><u>High-Level  Fed Officials Slam Bernanke</u></span></p>
<p><span id="mDocumentText_ctl00_mTextDisplay" class="DocumentBody"></span>Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123629999083146775.html">conceded</a>   that the government&#8217;s actions &#8220;will reduce [companies'] incentive to  be  careful in the future.&#8221; In other words, he&#8217;s admitting that the   government&#8217;s actions will encourage financial companies to make even <span style="font-style:italic;">riskier</span> gambles in the future.</p>
<p>Kansas  City Fed President and veteran Fed official Thomas Hoenig <a href="http://www.kansascityfed.org/speechbio/hoenigPDF/Omaha.03.06.09.pdf">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Too big has failed&#8230;.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The   sequence of [the government's] actions, unfortunately, has added to   market uncertainty. Investors are understandably watching to see which   institutions will receive public money and survive as wards of the   state&#8230;</p>
<p>Any financial crisis leaves a stream of losses among the   various participants, and these losses must ultimately be borne by   someone. To start the resolution process, management responsible for the   problems must be replaced and the losses identified and taken. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Until  these actions are taken, there is  little chance to restore market  confidence and get credit markets  flowing. It is not a question of  avoiding these losses, but one of how  soon we will take them and get on  to the process of recovery</span>&#8230;.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Many  of the [government's current policy  revolves around the idea of] &#8220;too  big to fail&#8221; &#8230;. History, however,  may show us a different experience</span>.  When examining previous  financial crises, both in other countries as  well as the United States,  large institutions have been allowed to  fail. Banking authorities have  been successful in placing new and more  responsible managers and  directions in charge and then reprivatizing  them. <span style="font-weight:bold;">There is also evidence suggesting  that  countries that have tried to avoid taking such steps have been  much  slower to recover, and the ultimate cost to taxpayers has been  larger</span>&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>  The current head of the Philadelphia fed bank, Charles Plosser, <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/Fault-lines-emerge-Fed/story.aspx?guid=%7BF11875CE-A72F-4DFE-86ED-07A420EBB1CF%7D&amp;print=true&amp;dist=printMidSection">disagrees</a>  with Bernanke&#8217;s strategy of the endless printing-press and  ever-increasing fed balance sheet:<br />
<blockquote>
<div class="p">Plosser   urged the Fed to &#8220;proceed with caution&#8221; with the new policy. Others   outside the Fed are much more strident and want plans in place   immediately to reverse it. They believe an inflation storm is already in   train.<span style="font-size:78%;">***</span></p>
<p>Bernanke argued   that focusing on the size of the balance sheet misses the point,  arguing  the Fed&#8217;s various asset purchase programs are not easily  summarized in a  single number. </p></div>
<div class="p">But  Plosser said that the growth of the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet was a key  metric.           </div>
<div class="p">&#8220;It is not appropriate to ignore quantitative metrics in this  new policy environment,&#8221; Plosser said&#8230;</div>
<p>
<div class="p">Plosser  is bringing the spotlight right back to the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet.</p>
</div>
<div class="p">  &#8220;The size of the  balance sheet does offer a possible nominal anchor  for monitoring the  volume of our liquidity provisions,&#8221; Plosser said.</div>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="post-title entry-title"> </h3>
<p>The  former head of the  Fed&#8217;s Open Market Operations says the bailout might  make things worse.  Specifically, the former head of the Fed&#8217;s open  market operation &#8211; the  key Fed agency which has been loaning hundreds  of billions of dollars to  Wall Street companies and banks &#8211; was <a href="http://bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aFzDKV89fQ0g&amp;refer=home">quoted</a>  in Bloomberg as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Every  time you tinker with  this delicate system even small changes can  create big ripples,&#8221; said  Dino Kos, former head of the New York Fed&#8217;s  open-market operations . . .  &#8220;This is the impossible situation they are  in. <span>The risks are that  the government&#8217;s $700 billion purchase of assets</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> <span style="font-style:italic;">disturbs  markets even more</span></span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> And William Poole, who  recently left his post as president of the St. Louis Fed, is essentially  <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/Fault-lines-emerge-Fed/story.aspx?guid=%7BF11875CE-A72F-4DFE-86ED-07A420EBB1CF%7D&amp;print=true&amp;dist=printMidSection">calling</a>  Bernanke a communist:
<div class="p">               </div>
<blockquote><div class="p">Poole said he was very concerned that the Fed could simply  lend money to anyone, without constraint.</p>
</div>
<div style="font-weight:bold;" class="p">  In the  Soviet Union and Eastern Europe during the Cold War era,  economies were  inefficient because they had a soft-budget constraint.  If a firm got  into trouble, the banking system would give them more  money, Poole said.</p>
</div>
<div class="p"><span style="font-weight:bold;">               The current situation at the  Fed seems eerily similar, he said.</span></p>
</div>
<p> &#8220;What is  discipline &#8211; where are the hard choices &#8211; when does Fed say our  resources are exhausted?&#8221; Poole asked.</p></blockquote>
<p>  But the strongest  criticism may be from the former Vice President of  Dallas Federal  Reserve, who said that the failure of the government to  provide more  information about the bailout could signal corruption. As  ABC <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/Economy/story?id=6225744&amp;page=1">writes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Gerald   O&#8217;Driscoll, a former vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of   Dallas and a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think   tank, said he worried that the failure of the government to provide more   information about its rescue spending could signal corruption.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nontransparency   in government programs is always associated with corruption in other   countries, so I don&#8217;t see why it wouldn&#8217;t be here,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>  Of course, former Fed chairman Paul Volcker has also <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=volcker+criticizes+bernanke&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">strongly  criticized</a> current Fed policies.<span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span></span>

<p><u>Global  Agencies Slam Bernanke<br /></u></p>
</p>
<p>The  Bank of  International Settlements (BIS) &#8211; called &#8220;the central banks&#8217;  central  bank&#8221; &#8211; has slammed the Fed for blowing bubbles and then &#8220;using  gimmicks  and palliatives&#8221; which &#8220;will only make things worse&#8221;.</p>
<p>As the  Telegraph <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/2811081/BIS-warns-of-Great-Depression-dangers-from-credit-spree.html">wrote</a>  in June 2007:</p>
<blockquote><p>The  Bank for International Settlements,  the world&#8217;s most prestigious  financial body, has warned that years of  loose monetary policy has  fuelled a dangerous credit bubble, leaving the  global economy more  vulnerable to another 1930s-style slump than  generally understood&#8230;</p>
<p>The  BIS, the ultimate bank of central  bankers, pointed to a confluence a  worrying signs, citing mass issuance  of new-fangled credit instruments,  soaring levels of household debt,  extreme appetite for risk shown by  investors, and entrenched imbalances  in the world currency system&#8230;</p>
<p>The bank said it was far from  clear whether the US would be able to shrug off the consequences of its  latest imbalances &#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sooner or later the credit  cycle will turn and default rates will begin to rise,&#8221; said the bank.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A  year later, in June 2008,  the Telegraph <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2792450/BIS-slams-central-banks-warns-of-worse-crunch-to-come.html">wrote</a>:</p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>A  year ago, the Bank for  International Settlements startled the  financial world by warning that  we might soon face challenges last seen  during the onset of the Great  Depression. This has proved  frighteningly accurate&#8230;</p>
<p>[BIS  economist] Dr White says the US sub-prime crisis was the &#8220;trigger&#8221;, not  the cause of the disaster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed,  BIS  slammed the Fed and other central banks for blowing the bubble,  failing  to regulate the shadow banking system, and then using gimmicks  which  will only make things worse. As the 2008 Telegraph article notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>In   a pointed attack on the US Federal Reserve, it said central banks  would  not find it easy to &#8220;clean up&#8221; once property bubbles have  burst&#8230;</p>
<p>Nor  does it exonerate the watchdogs. &#8220;How could such a  huge shadow banking  system emerge without provoking clear statements of  official concern?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The  fundamental cause of today&#8217;s emerging  problems was excessive and  imprudent credit growth over a long period.  Policy interest rates in the  advanced industrial countries have been  unusually low,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Fed and fellow central  banks instinctively cut rates lower  with each cycle to avoid facing the  pain. The effect has been to put  off the day of reckoning&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Should  governments feel it necessary  to take direct actions to alleviate debt  burdens, it is crucial that  they understand one thing beforehand. If  asset prices are  unrealistically high, they must fall. If savings rates  are  unrealistically low, they must rise. If debts cannot be serviced,  they  must be written off.</p>
<p>&#8220;To deny this through the use of  gimmicks and palliatives will only make things worse in the end,&#8221; he  said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In  other words, BIS slammed the easy credit  policy of the Fed and other  central banks, and the failure to regulate  the shadow banking system.</p>
<p>More  dramatically, BIS slammed &#8220;the  use of gimmicks and palliatives&#8221;, and  said that anything other than (1)  letting asset prices fall to their  true market value, (2) increasing  savings rates, and (3) forcing  companies to write off bad debts &#8220;will  only make things worse&#8221;.</p>
<p>But  Bernanke and the other central  bankers (as well as Treasury and the  Council of Economic Advisors and  Barney Frank and Chris Dodd and the  others in control of American and  British and French and Japanese and  German and virtually every other  country&#8217;s economic policy) ignored  BIS&#8217; advice in 2007 and 2008, and  they are <span style="font-style:italic;">still </span>ignoring it  today.</p>
<p>Instead,  they are doing everything they can to (2) prop  up asset prices by  trying to blow a new bubble by giving banks  trillions, (2) re-write  accounting and reporting rules to let the big  banks and other giants  keep bad debts on their books (or in sivs or  other &#8220;second sets of  books&#8221;) and to hide the fact that they <span style="font-style:italic;">are </span>bad debts,  and (3) encourage  consumers to spend spend spend!</p>
<p>&#8220;The  world&#8217;s most prestigious  financial body&#8221;, &#8220;the ultimate bank of  central bankers&#8221; has condemned  Bernanke and all of the other G-8  central banks, and stripped bare their  false claims that the crash  wasn&#8217;t their fault or that they are <span style="font-style:italic;">now </span>doing the right thing to turn the  economy around.</p>
<p>As Spiegel <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,635051,00.html">wrote</a>  in July 2009:<br />
<blockquote>White   and his team of experts observed the real estate bubble developing in   the United States. They criticized the increasingly impenetrable   securitization business, vehemently pointed out the perils of risky   loans and provided evidence of the lack of credibility of the rating   agencies. In their view, the reason for the lack of restraint in the   financial markets was that there was simply too much cheap money   available on the market&#8230;</p>
<p>As far back as 2003, White implored   central bankers to rethink their strategies, noting that instability in   the financial markets had triggered inflation, the &#8220;villain&#8221; in the   global economy&#8230;</p>
<p>In the restrained world of central bankers, it  would have been difficult for White to express himself more clearly&#8230;</p>
<p>It   was probably the biggest failure of the world&#8217;s central bankers since   the founding of the BIS in 1930. They knew everything and did nothing.   Their gigantic machinery of analysis kept spitting out new scenarios of   doom, but they might as well have been transmitted directly into   space&#8230;
<p>In their report, the BIS experts derisively described the   techniques of rating agencies like Moody&#8217;s and Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s as   &#8220;relatively crude&#8221; and noted that &#8220;some caution is in order in relation   to the reliability of the results.&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>In January 2005, the  BIS&#8217;s  Committee on the Global Financial System sounded the alarm once  again,  noting that the risks associated with structured financial  products were  not being &#8220;fully appreciated by market participants.&#8221;  Extreme market  events, the experts argued, could &#8220;have unanticipated  systemic  consequences.&#8221;</p>
<p>They also cautioned against putting too  much faith  in the rating agencies, which suffered from a fatal flaw.  Because the  rating agencies were being paid by the companies they  rated, the  committee argued, there was a risk that they might rate some  companies  too highly and be reluctant to lower the ratings of others  that should  have been downgraded. </p>
<p>These comments show that <span style="font-weight:bold;">the  central bankers knew exactly what was  going on, a full two-and-a-half  years before the big bang. All the  ingredients of the looming disaster  had been neatly laid out on the  table in front of them: defective  rating agencies, loans repackaged to  the point of being unrecognizable,  dubious practices of American  mortgage lenders, the risks of  low-interest policies. But no action was  taken. Meanwhile, the Fed  continued to raise interest rates in nothing  more than tiny  increments&#8230;</span></p>
<p>The Fed chairman was not even  impressed by a  letter the Mortgage Insurance Companies of America  (MICA), a trade  association of US mortgage providers, sent to the Fed on  Sept. 23,  2005. In the letter, MICA warned that it was &#8220;very concerned&#8221;  about  some of the risky lending practices being applied in the US real  estate  market. The experts even speculated that the Fed might be  operating on  the basis of incorrect data. Despite a sharp increase in  mortgages  being approved for low-income borrowers, most banks were  reporting to  the Fed that they had not lowered their lending standards.  According to  a study MICA cited entitled &#8220;This Powder Keg Is Going to  Blow,&#8221; there  was no secondary market for these &#8220;nuclear mortgages.&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>William  White and his Basel team were dumbstruck. <span style="font-weight:bold;">The  central bankers were simply ignoring their warnings. Didn&#8217;t  they  understand what they were being told? Or was it that they simply  didn&#8217;t  want to understand?</span></p>

<p style="font-style:italic;"><span style="font-weight:bold;"></span></p>
<p>The head of the  World Bank also <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125409936849345249.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTWhatsNewsCollection">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Central  banks [including the Fed] failed to address risks  building in the new  economy. They seemingly mastered product price  inflation in the 1980s,  but most <span style="font-weight:bold;">decided  that asset price bubbles were difficult to identify and to restrain  with monetary policy</span>. They <span style="font-weight:bold;">argued  that damage to the &#8216;real economy&#8217; </span>of jobs, production, savings,  and consumption <span style="font-weight:bold;">could be contained once  bubbles burst, through aggressive easing of interest rates</span>. They  turned out to be wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="mDocumentText_ctl00_mTextDisplay" class="DocumentBody">
<p>A study of 124 banking crises by the International Monetary Fund <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2008/wp08224.pdf">found</a> that propping banks which are only pretending to be solvent hurts the economy:</p>
<p></span><br />
<blockquote>
<p>Existing  empirical research has shown that providing assistance to banks  and  their borrowers can be <span style="font-weight:bold;">counterproductive</span>, resulting in increased  losses  to banks, which often <span style="font-style:italic;">abuse forbearance to take unproductive  risks at government expense</span>. The typical result of forbearance is a  deeper hole in the net worth of banks, <span style="font-weight:bold;">crippling tax burdens to finance  bank bailouts<span style="font-weight:bold;">, </span></span><span style="font-weight:bold;">and even more severe credit supply contraction and  economic decline than would have occurred in the absence of forbearance. </span></p>
<p>Cross-country    analysis to date also shows that accommodative policy  measures (such    as substantial liquidity support, explicit government  guarantee on    financial institutions’ liabilities and forbearance from  prudential    regulations) tend to be <span style="font-weight:bold;">fiscally costly </span>and that these  particular policies do not necessarily accelerate the speed of economic  recovery.</p>
<p>***</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>All too often, central banks privilege stability over cost  in the heat of the containment phase: if so, they may <span style="font-weight:bold;">too liberally  extend loans to an illiquid bank which is almost certain to prove  insolvent anyway</span>.    Also, closure of a nonviable bank is often delayed for  too long,  even   when there are clear signs of insolvency (Lindgren,  2003). Since  bank   closures face many obstacles, there is a tendency to  rely  instead on   blanket government guarantees which, if the government’s   fiscal and   political position makes them credible, can work albeit at   the <span style="font-weight:bold;">cost of placing the burden on the budget</span>, typically squeezing future  provision of needed public services.</p></blockquote>
<p><span>By failing to break up the giant banks, governments are forced to take counter-productive emergency measures (</span><span>see <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/05/the-bailout-of-big-american-banks-has-cost-trillions-more-than-weve-been-told.html">this</a> and <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/12/fed-data-shows-foreign-banks-huge-beneficiaries-of-emergency-lending-programs-hedge-funds-mcdonald%e2%80%99s-harley-davidson-and-others-also-bailed-out.html">this</a></span><span>) </span><span> to try to cover up their insolvency. Those measures</span><span> drain the life blood out of the <span style="font-style:italic;">real </span>economy &#8230; destroying national economie</span><span id="mDocumentText_ctl00_mTextDisplay" class="DocumentBody"><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>s.</p>
<p>Indeed, instead of directly helping the American people, the government threw <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/01/government-says-no-to-helping-states.html">trillions</a> at the giant banks (including <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/04/bernanke-provided-billions-in-loans-to-gaddafi.html">foreign banks</a>; and see <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/11/its-not-the-great-recession-its-the-great-bank-robbery.html">this</a>)    . The big banks have &#8211; in turn &#8211; used a lot of that money to  speculate   in commodities, including food and other items which are now  driving  up  the price of consumer necessities [as well as stocks].   Instead of  using the money to hire  Americans, they&#8217;re <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704821704576270783611823972.html">hiring abroad</a> (and <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/pay-your-taxes-these-10-companies-didnt-23839-1303137082-19.jpg">getting tax refunds</a> from the government).<br /></span><span></span><span id="mDocumentText_ctl00_mTextDisplay" class="DocumentBody">
<p><u>Economists  Slam Bernanke</u></p>
<p></span> Stephen   Roach (former chief economist for Morgan Stanley, and now director of   Morgan Stanley Asia) is one of the most influential and respected   American economists.  Roach told Charlie Rose recently that we have had   terrible Federal Reserve policy for the past 12 years under Greenspan   and Bernanke, that they concocted hair-brained theories (for example,   that we should let the boom and bust cycle occur, but then &#8220;clean up the   mess&#8221; once things fall apart), and that we really need to reform the   Fed.<span id="mDocumentText_ctl00_mTextDisplay" class="DocumentBody"></span>
<p><span id="mDocumentText_ctl00_mTextDisplay" class="DocumentBody">Specifically, here&#8217;s the </span><span id="mDocumentText_ctl00_mTextDisplay" class="DocumentBody"><a href="http://www.charlierose.com/download/transcript/10683">must-read</a></span><span id="mDocumentText_ctl00_mTextDisplay" class="DocumentBody"> portion of  the interview:<br /></span></p>
<blockquote><p>STEPHEN  ROACH: And what’s missing in the  debate that drives me nuts is going  back to the very function of central  banking that’s at the core of our  financial system. Do we have the  right model for the Fed to go forward?  And, you know, I think we’ve  minimized the role that the custodians,  the stewards of our financial<br />system,  the Federal Reserve, played in  leading to this crisis and in making  sure that we will never have this  again. I think we’ve had horrible  central banking in the United States  for the past dozen of years. I  mean, we elevate our central bankers,  we probably .</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:   From Greenspan to Bernanke.</p>
<p>STEPHEN ROACH:  Yeah.</p>
<p>CHARLIE  ROSE:  Both.</p>
<p>STEPHEN ROACH:  We call them maestro, and, you  know, we make them<br />sound larger than life.  And, you know, and the  fact is, they condoned<br />policies that took us from one bubble to  another.  They failed to live up<br />to their regulatory responsibility  granted them by law.  They concocted new<br />theories to explain why  these things could go on forever, and they harbored<br />the belief,  mistakenly in my view, that monetary policy is too big and<br />blunt an  instrument, and so you just bring it in to clean up the mess<br />afterwards  rather than prevent a mess ahead of time.  Well, look at the<br />mess  we’re in right now.  We need a different approach here.  We really do.</p></blockquote>
<p>  Leading economist Anna Schwartz, co-author of the leading book on the  Great Depression with Milton Friedman, <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2008/10/the-problem-was-never-liquidity-but-insolvency-and-we-should-let-insolvent-banks-fail.html">told</a>  the Wall Street journal that <span style="font-weight:bold;">the Fed&#8217;s  entire strategy in dealing with the financial crisis is wrong</span>.  Specifically, the Fed is treating it as a <span style="font-style:italic;">liquidity </span>problem, when it is really an <span style="font-style:italic;">insolvency </span>crisis.
<p>Moreover,  prominent Wall Street economist Henry Kaufman <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSTRE53G4M420090417">says</a>  that the Federal Reserve is primarily to blame for the financial  crisis:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I  am convinced that the misbehavior of some  would have been much rarer  &#8212; and far less damaging to our economy &#8212; if  the Federal Reserve and,  to a lesser extent, other supervisory  authorities, had measured up to  their responsibilities &#8230;</p>
<p>Kaufman  directly criticized former  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan for  not using his position to  dissuade big banks and others from taking big  risks.</p>
<p>   <span id="midArticle_7"></span>
<p>&#8220;Alan  Greenspan  spoke about irrational exuberance only as a theoretical  concept, not as a  warning to the market to curb excessive behavior,&#8221;  Kaufman said. &#8220;It is  difficult to believe that recourse to moral  suasion by a Fed chairman  would be ineffective.&#8221;</p>
<p>   <span id="midArticle_8"></span>
<p>Partly   because the Fed did not strongly oppose the repeal in 1999 of the   Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, more large financial conglomerates   that were &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; have formed, Kaufman said, citing a factor   that has made the global credit crisis especially acute.</p>
<p>   <span id="midArticle_9"></span>
<p>&#8220;Financial  conglomerates have  become more and more opaque, especially about their  massive  off-balance-sheet activities,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The Fed failed to  rein in the  problem.&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much of the recent extreme financial  behavior is  rooted in faulty monetary policies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Poor  policies encourage  excessive risk taking.&#8221;</p>

<p> Economist Marc Faber <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/08/marc-faber-slams-central-banks.html">says</a>   that central bankers are money printers who create bubbles, and that   the system would be much better now if the Fed hadn&#8217;t intervened.   Specifically, Faber says that &#8211; if the Fed hadn&#8217;t intervened &#8211; the   system would be cleaned out, the system would be healthier because debt   load and burden on taxpayers would be reduced.</p>
<p>Economist Jane  D&#8217;Arista has <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/03/the-fed-has-failed-by-its-own-terms.html">shown</a>   that the Fed has failed miserably at its main task: providing a   &#8220;counter-cyclical&#8221; influence (that is, taking the punch bowl away before   the party gets too wild).
<p>The Fed has also <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/26/AR2009092602706.html">failed  miserably</a> in its role as regulator of banks and their affiliates.  As well-known economist James Galbraith <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/10/galbraith-fed-is-unlawfully-withholding.html">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The  Federal Reserve has never been an effective regulator  for the  straightforward reason that it is dominated by economists and  bankers  and not by dedicated skeptics who make bank regulation a  full-time  profession.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="mDocumentText_ctl00_mTextDisplay" class="DocumentBody"><u>Unemployment<span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></p>
<p></span></span></u></span>The  Federal Reserve is mandated by law to maximize employment.  The relevant  statute <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section2a.htm">states</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open   Market Committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and   credit aggregates commensurate with the economy&#8217;s long run potential to   increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of <span style="font-style:italic;">maximum employment</span>, stable prices,  and moderate long-term interest rates.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the Fed has apparently decided to <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/04/has-the-fed-decided-to-fight-inflation-instead-of-unemployment.html">fight inflation instead of unemployment</a>.</p>
<p>No wonder we&#8217;re suffering <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/06/unemployment-during-the-great-depression-has-been-overstated-and-current-unemployment-understated-weve-now-got-depression-level-unemployment.html">depression-level unemployment</a>.</p>
<p><span id="mDocumentText_ctl00_mTextDisplay" class="DocumentBody"><u>Leverage<span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"></p>
<p></span></span></u>The Fed <i>says</i>  that we should reduce leverage, but is doing everything in its power to  <span style="font-style:italic;">increase </span>leverage.</p>
<p>Specifically,  </span>the New York Federal published a <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr382.html">report</a>  in 2009 entitled &#8220;The Shadow Banking System: Implications for Financial  Regulation&#8221;.
<p>One of the main conclusions of the report is that  leverage undermines financial stability:</p>
<blockquote><p>Securitization   was intended as a way to transfer credit risk to those better able to   absorb losses, but instead it increased the fragility of the entire   financial system by allowing banks and other intermediaries to “leverage   up” by buying one another’s securities. In the new, post-crisis   financial system, the role of securitization will likely be held in   check by more stringent financial regulation and by the recognition that   it is important to prevent excessive leverage and maturity mismatch,   both of which can undermine financial stability.</p></blockquote>
<p>And as a  former economist at the New York Fed, Richard Alford, <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2009/11/dudley-and-the-missing-lessons-of-the-financial-crisis.html">wrote</a>  recently:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Friday, William Dudley, President of  FRBNY, gave <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2009/dud091113.html">an  excellent presentation</a>  on the financial crisis. The speech was a  logically-structured,  tightly-reasoned, and succinct retrospective of  the crisis. It took one  step back from the details and proved a very  useful financial  sector-wide perspective. The speech should be read by  everyone with an  interest in the crisis. It highlights the often  overlooked role of  leverage and maturity mismatches even as its stated  purpose was  examining the role of liquidity. </p>
<p> While most analysts  attributed  the crisis to either specific instruments, or elements of the   de-regulation, or policy action, <span style="font-weight:bold;">Dudley  correctly identified the causes of the crisis as the excessive use of  leverage</span>  and maturity mismatches embedded in financial activities  carried out  off the balance sheets of the traditional banking system.  The body of  the speech opens with: “..<span style="font-weight:bold;">this  crisis was caused by the rapid growth of the so-called shadow banking  system</span> over the past few decades and its remarkable collapse over  the past two years.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In  fact, every independent  economist has said that too much leverage was  one of the main causes of  the current economic crisis.</p>
<p>Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco  President Janet Yellen <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=alJ9TOiV1erY&amp;pos=4">said</a>   recently that it’s “far from clear” whether the Fed should use  interest  rates to stem a surge in financial leverage, and urged further  research  into the issue.“Higher rates than called for based on purely   macroeconomic conditions may help forestall a potentially damaging   buildup of leverage and an asset-price boom”.
<p>And yet, the Fed has been and continues to be one the <span style="font-style:italic;">biggest enablers </span>for  increased  leverage. As anyone who has looked at Mr. Bernanke and  Geithner&#8217;s  actions will tell you, many of the government&#8217;s programs are  aimed at  trying to re-start <a href="http://cmlj.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/extract/4/4/462">securitization</a>  and the &#8220;shadow banking system&#8221;, and to prop up asset prices for  highly-leveraged financial products.</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Bernanke <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20090224a.htm">said</a>  in February 2009:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight:bold;">In an  effort to restart securitization markets</span>  to support the extension  of credit to consumers and small businesses,  we joined with the  Treasury to announce the Term Asset-Backed  Securities Loan Facility  (TALF). </p></blockquote>
<p>And he <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/09/25/chairman_bernankes_remarks_at_cbc_conference_98470.html">said</a>  it again in September 2009:<br />
<blockquote>The  Term Asset-Backed Securities  Loan Facility, or TALF &#8230; has helped  restart the securitization markets  for various types of consumer and  small business credit. Securitization  markets are an important source  of credit, and their virtual shutdown  during the crisis has reduced  credit availability for many borrowers.</p></blockquote>
<p><span>As I noted in 2009, the economy is not getting better because government&#8217;s policies are <a href="http://georgewashington2.blogspot.com/2009/03/why-patient-is-not-getting-better.html">strengthening the parasite and killing the patient</a>.</p>
<p><u>Fraud</u></span><span style="font-style:italic;"><br /></span><span id="articleText"></span><span id="articleText"></span><br />Two fundamental <span id="articleText">causes of the Great Depression, and of our current economic problems, are fraud and inequality.</p>
<p></span><span id="articleText">Fraud was <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/10/fraud-caused-great-depression-and-this.html">one of the main causes</a> of the Great Depression </span><span id="articleText">and of our current economic problems</span><span id="articleText">, but the Federal Reserve has done <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/10/fraud-caused-great-depression-and-this.html"><span style="font-style:italic;">nothing</span>  to rein in fraud today</a></span><span id="articleText">.</p>
<p>Indeed, despite the Fed&#8217;s </span>responsibility to prevent certain types of fraud, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/26/AR2009092602706.html">it adopted a &#8220;see no evil&#8221; policy and winked at it</a>.  (Bernanke&#8217;s predecessor as Fed chair, Alan Greenspan, adopted the non-sensical position that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/04/fraud-finally-makes-news.html">fraud could <span style="font-style:italic;">never</span> happen</a>, so the Fed shouldn&#8217;t police for it).</p>
<p>The New York Federal Reserve Bank &#8211; then run by current Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner &#8211; also helped to cover up fraud.  As senior S&amp;L prosecutor and professor of economics and law William  Black <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/04/bush-and-obama-administrations-both.html">points out</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Mr.  Geithner, as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York   since  October 2003, was one of those senior regulators who failed to   take any  effective regulatory action to prevent the crisis, but instead   covered  up its depth.<a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/04/fraud-finally-makes-news.html"></a></p></blockquote>
<p><span><u>Inequality</u></span><span style="font-style:italic;"><br /></span><br /><span id="articleText">Inequality was another major cause of the 1930s Depression and today&#8217;s lousy economy, but the Fed has done nothing to even things out.  Indeed, inequality is <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/12/extreme-inequality-helped-cause-both.html">currently <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">worse</span> than during the Depression</a></span>.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Fed has given <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/01/government-says-no-to-helping-states.html">trillions to the biggest banks, and virtually nothing to main street</a>.   This  has gone to Wall Street bonuses and made the big banks&#8217; executives richer, but the rest of us poorer (and it <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/08/quantitative-easing-wont-help-the-economy-but-will-just-create-another-wave-of-mergers-and-acquisitions.html">hasn&#8217;t help the economy</a>).</p>
<p><span><u>Bottom Line</u></span><span style="font-style:italic;"><br /></span><br />The reason for the weak economy is obvious to anyone paying attention.</p>

From:  The Americans</p>
<p>Dear Everyone,</p>
<p>Well we&#8217;ve certainly had our hands full.  In addition to Barack, we have been dealing with Timmy over at Treasury and Bennie at the Federal Reserve. These boys have been getting into a lot mischief and  have come up with a plan they call QE2.  They&#8217;ve been trying to sink our economy with it.  We are not amused but we do concede they have a three ring circus going on.  We call it &#8211;Tots &amp; A Teen</p>
<p>If you think the United States Government has treated you badly, wait until we tell you what they have done to us.  But don’t worry, everything is under control.  We have them right where we want them, in the spotlight.  Public office is the perfect place for a problem child.  It&#8217;s easy to keep an eye on &#8216;em. </p>
<p>They need to learn a lesson, and therefore we are unveiling our own plan for the economy.  It&#8217;s titled Oh Say Can You See.  We want to see this economy turn around so it&#8217;s time for the boys to reverse the steps they have taken to, ahem: move it forward.  And we are ready to see them jump though a few hoops.  We invite you to sit back and enjoy the show.  As far as we&#8217;re concerned, the fun has just begun!</p>
<p>&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages&#8230;&#8221;  Read the plan at aworldfair.blogspot.com.</p>
<p>With great affection,<br />
The Americans</p>
