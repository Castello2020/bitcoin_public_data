<h3 style="color: #000099;">IRS Targeted those Educating Americans &#8220;on the Constitution and Bill of Rights&#8221;, or &#8220;Government Spending, Government Debt or Taxes&#8221; or Anyone Working to “Make America a Better Place To Live”</h3>
<p>The IRS started targeting Tea Party members, &#8220;Patriots&#8221; and similar conservatives <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/05/irs-began-targeting-conservatives-in-2010/">starting in 2010</a>.</p>
<p>But the IRS&#8217; harassment of conservatives expanded <em>way beyond</em> those groups.</p>
<p>As United Press International <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2013/05/13/Reports-IRS-scrutiny-was-broader-than-acknowledged/UPI-94681368432000/">reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>U.S. Internal Revenue Service inquiry of conservative groups included those lobbying to &#8220;make America a better place to live,&#8221; new details emerging about the IRS investigation indicated. That lever goes beyond what the IRS admitted Friday, which was that it targeted groups with &#8220;Tea Party&#8221; or &#8220;patriot&#8221; in their names, several media outlets reported Monday, based on draft findings from disclosures to congressional investigators by the Treasury Department&#8217;s inspector general for tax administration.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At various points over the past two years, the Cincinnati IRS office, which is in charge of evaluating applications for tax-exempt status, focused on groups making statements that &#8220;criticize how the country is being run&#8221; and <strong>those involved in educating Americans &#8220;on the Constitution and Bill of Rights</strong>,&#8221; the draft report cited by The Washington Post indicated.</p>
<p>By June 2011 some IRS specialists were probing applications of groups focusing on <strong>&#8220;government spending, government debt or taxes</strong> [and] education of the public by <strong>advocacy</strong>/lobbying <strong>to &#8216;make America a better place to live,</strong>&#8216;&#8221; the report cited by the Journal indicated.</p>
<p>The inspector general&#8217;s investigation also found<strong> the head of the IRS tax-exempt-organizations division knew as early as June 2011 conservative groups were being inappropriately targeted</strong> &#8212; several months before Douglas Shulman, IRS commissioner at the time, denied to a congressional committee the agency was targeting conservative groups, the newspapers said</p></blockquote>
<p>Liberals should <em>not</em> assume that this is the &#8220;other guy&#8217;s&#8221; fight.</p>
<p>The targeting of conservatives under a Democratic administration could switch to a targeting of liberals under a subsequent Republican administration.</p>
<p>Congressman Mike Rogers is correct when he <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/13/irs-scrutiny-went-beyond-tea-party-criteria-broader-than-thought/">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t care if you&#8217;re a conservative, a liberal, a Democrat or a Republican, this should send a chill up your spine.</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember, governments<a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/03/it-is-always-the-tactic-of-governments-that-seek-to-abuse-power-to-select-the-most-marginalized-and-easily-demonized-targets-in-the-first-instance.html"> always target the &#8220;out&#8221; group first, and &#8211; if we don&#8217;t protest -  spread the abuse </a>to include <em>everyone</em>.</p>
<p>It is ironic &#8211; and downright Orwellian &#8211; that the IRS targeted people trying to educate Americans on the Constitution and Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not entirely surprising, given that the Bill of Rights have been <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/02/constitution.html">fatally wounded</a> by the Bush and Obama administrations, and that liking <a title="the Founding Fathers" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oP1Ke70Mi8" target="_blank">the Founding Fathers</a> or being  <a title="“reverent of individual liberty”" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/02/government-uses-anti-terror-laws-to-crush-dissent-and-help-big-business.html">“reverent of individual liberty”</a>  could get one branded as a potential terrorist.</p>
<p>And the IRS is acting like Big Brother &#8230; <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/05/irs-will-spy-on-our-shopping-records-travel-social-interactions-health-records-and-files-from-other-government-investigators.html">spying on our shopping records, travel, social interactions, health records and files from other government investigators</a>. The IRS targeting those who try to educate people about taxes is analogous to the Federal Reserve <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/09/the-federal-reserve-has-just-entered-the-counterespionage-era-and-will-be-monitoring-everything-written-about-it-anywhere-in-the-world.html">using web-based counter-espionage</a> to attack critics of Fed policies.</p>
<p>Welcome to modern America &#8230;</p>
<p><em>Postscript: Those who assume that the Tea Party is made up of a bunch of crazies may be interested in learning that &#8211; despite the <a title="divide-and-conquer tricks" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/07/the-founding-fathers-tried-to-warn-us-about-the-threat-from-a-two-party-system.html">divide-and-conquer tricks</a> that the mainstream media peddles &#8211; the Occupy movement and the Tea Party were originally <a title="protesting the exact same thing" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/11/the-occupy-movement-is-protesting-the-same-thing-that-the-founding-fathers-protested-at-the-boston-tea-party.html">protesting the <strong>exact same things</strong></a>: the <a title="malignant, symbiotic relationship between big government and big corporations" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/10/conservatives-and-liberals-agree-end-the-malignant-symbiotic-relationship-between-big-government-and-big-corporations.html">malignant, symbiotic relationship between big government and big corporations</a>, and the <a title="both railed against" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/10/second-wave-of-protests-unleashed-targeting-federal-reserve.html">destruction to our economy</a>  caused by the <a title="unchecked power of the Federal Reserve" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/10/occupy-wall-street-and-occupy-the-fed-are-two-sides-of-the-same-coin.html">unchecked power of the Federal Reserve</a>.</em></p>

It&#8217;s funny, but liberals seem to be in the majority when our foreign aggressions take place. And yet, they claim to be opposed to such aggression. Bush had a liberal democratic majority in Congress to deal with during his campaign to invade Iraq. Somehow, he was mysteriously granted approbation to deploy our troops for that purpose, despite the clear Constitutional mandate that Congress Declares War (Watch FDR&#8217;s post Pearl Harbor speech, where he asks Congress to do just that.)  </p>
<p>The Tea Party has not prevented one abortion. They have not halted the effort to protect and grant gays &#8216;Special Rights&#8217; to be married. They have not stopped the flood of illegal aliens over our borders, or quota hiring, huge budget deficits, school lunch confiscations, etc. What they HAVE done is give our government the green light to advance a doctrine known as &#8220;PNAC&#8221;.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-76710" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&#8220;The targeting of conservatives under a Democratic administration could switch to a targeting of liberals under a subsequent Republican administration.&#8221;</p>
<p>I strenuously agree that: &#8220;I don’t care if you’re a conservative, a liberal, a Democrat or a Republican, this should send a chill up your spine.  Remember, governments always target the “out” group first, and – if we don’t protest &#8211;  spread the abuse to include everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet, without a doubt, this has already happened to &#8220;liberals&#8221; and &#8220;Democrats&#8221; under Republican administrations, usually under the auspices of the FBI and/or some other 3-letter intel agencies using the &#8220;cover&#8221; of the IRS to harass vocal-opposition-to-current-power targets.</p>
<p>I was one of them during the Bush II &#8220;you are either with us, or with the terrorists&#8221; Administration. I protested the Iraq War, and am pro-choice/LGBTQ/pro-Palestinian rights. I am a very typical &#8220;liberal,&#8221; who just happens to have a BA in economics, and is vehemently verbally opposed to neoliberalism/globalism/neocolonialism/shock doctrine/fascism.</p>
<p>And yet, after the invasion of Iraq, the IRS &#8220;targeted&#8221; me, specifically with regards to my &#8220;lack of marital status&#8221; and the IRS&#8217; concern about &#8220;questionable income/expenses&#8221; related to the facts thereof. Remember, I&#8217;m one those uppity &#8220;inherently inferior females&#8221; that the Bush II Religious Right types likes to denigrate for having the temerity to think she should be anything more than a walking uterus/cleaning lady/cook/trophy asset on a man&#8217;s balance sheet. And during the Bush II Administration, those &#8220;with us or against us&#8221; pitbulls were unleashed onto my doorstep simply for shock and awe intimidation value and because they could, pure and simple.</p>
<p>It was precisely during the Bush II &#8220;third reich&#8221; reign after 9/11 that most of the country was in abject fear of being considered &#8220;unpatriotic&#8221; because they knew that they too could and would be targeted any which way TPTB wanted. (Remember what happened to Michael Moore after giving his Academy Award speech: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/13/michael-moore-death-threats-today_n_960333.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/13/michael-moore-death-threats-today_n_960333.html</a>)  </p>
<p>So at least now you can complain and write about it without getting your DHS-affiliated-religious-right-former/current-military neighbors (police/fire/etc-http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/05/10/190907/tomas-de-torquemada-in-the-us.html) inspecting you under locally severe criminal and/or civil scrutiny for practically nothing because they were both encouraged to, and because they could. I only wish at the time I could have spoken out so forcefully as these groups are now against this &#8220;chilling&#8221; mistreatment by TPTB without the threat of facing far more severe &#8220;penalties&#8221; for doing so in the process!</p>

There is no sexual function of that orifice. The female vagina is the receptacle for the male penis, which, when inserted and thrust repeatedly into said orifice, eventually ejaculates semen and sperm, usually resulting in the impregnation of the female. Uh, do you like, understand this?</p>

It seems today we have a large complement of &#8220;Professional Politicians&#8221; who never set foot in those fields. Indeed, they have never received a salary or benefit that wasn&#8217;t underwritten by taxpayers.  One other aspect of this current regime entails many examples of nepotism. Hillary is a glowing example of that scourge.  ALGORE, too, was advantaged in this manner. To be in a position of power, one must understand the effects of wielding their authority over populations. This current regime couldn&#8217;t care less what their policies have wrought on our society.</p>

They were all self-reporting groups.  All this happened under the watch of a GW Bush appointed IRS head, Douglas Shulman, not the temp guy that was just fired, Steven Miller.  The IRS mishandled this and didn&#8217;t respond appropriately.  501(c)(4) are supposed to be exclusively social welfare according to the 1913 law passed.  After Citizens United, the number of 501(c)(4) applications rose to 3,400 in 2012, more than double the level in 2010.  Karl Rove’s organization spent, based on its tax filings, less than one-tenth of 1 percent of its 2011 revenue on social welfare.</p>
<p>Washington&#8217;s Blog should do a better job on getting all the facts before putting their screed down for all to see.  It was pretty sloppy &#8220;reporting&#8221; or &#8220;blogging&#8221;. </p>
<p>Last thing on this.  This is another example of Republicans saying &#8220;JUMP&#8221; and Obama asking &#8220;HOW HIGH&#8221;.  This guy is truly a disgrace as a person and as a president.</p>

Why would one of your supposedly regressive political appointees advantage liberals and disadvantage conservatives? Personally, I think you liberals are starting to get desperate. You flail around with these ridiculous Conspiracy Theories, and none of them make a lick of sense. Really, you should just learn to allow the facts to accumulate, and the processes of government investigations and Congressional consideration to be completed. If you REALLY want a &#8220;Conspiracy Theory&#8221;, why not question the reasons why THIS issue cropped up in the middle of the Benghazi Scandal?</p>

<p>Douglas Shulman was Commissioner of Internal Revenue until November 9, 2012.  His nomination was confirmed by the full U.S. Senate on March 14, 2008 and he was sworn in on March 24, 2008.  </p>
<p>So yes it occurred on his watch.  But he probably didn&#8217;t know it was going on.</p>
<p>Btw, here&#8217;s the seven questions the Tea Party didn&#8217;t like and what started this fake scandal:</p>
<p>1.  Requested the names of the donors</p>
<p>2.  Requested a list of all issues that are important to the organization and asked that the organization indicate its position regarding such issues</p>
<p>3.  Requested a) the roles and activities of the audience and participants other than members in the activity and b) the type of conversations and discussions members and participants had during the activity</p>
<p>4.  Asked whether the officer, director, etc has run or will run for public office</p>
<p>5.  Requests the political affiliation of the officer, director, speakers, candidates supported, etc, or otherwise refers to relationship with identified political party-related organizations</p>
<p>6.  Requested information regarding employment, other than for the organization, including hours worked</p>
<p>7.  Requested information regarding activities of another organization &#8211; not just the relationship of the other organization to the applicant.</p>
<p>As far Benghazi, if only Republicans were as vigilant when the president is also a Republican. Let&#8217;s see, under George W Hoover, there was:<br />
1) 2002: U.S. Consulate In Karachi, Pakistan, Attacked; 10 Killed, 51 Injured</p>
<p>2) 2004: U.S. Embassy Bombed In Uzbekistan -2 killed, 9 injured</p>
<p>3) 2004: Gunmen Stormed U.S. Consulate In Saudi Arabia. 8 people killed</p>
<p>4) 2006: Armed Men Attacked U.S. Embassy In Syria &#8211; 1 killed</p>
<p>5) 2007: Grenade Launched Into U.S. Embassy In Athens</p>
<p>6) Rioters Set Fire To U.S. Embassy In Serbia</p>
<p>7) Ten People Killed In Bombings At U.S. Embassy In Yemen </p>
<p>According the Wall Street Journal and the London Telegraph the US Embassy was mainly being used for a secret CIA operation and WAS NOT really a consulate. </p>
<p>According to the Business Insider, in March 2011 Stevens became the official U.S. liaison to the al-Qaeda-linked Libyan opposition, working directly with Abdelhakim Belhadj of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group&#8211;a group that has now disbanded, with some fighters reportedly participating in the attack that took Stevens&#8217; life.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s speculation that CIA boss David Petraeus&#8217; affair wasn&#8217;t really the reason he resigned.  He was scheduled to testify under oath the next week before House and Senate committees regarding the Benghazi consulate. Many speculate that it wasn&#8217;t an affair – but the desire to avoid testifying on Benghazi – which was the real reason for Petraeus&#8217; sudden resignation.</p>

dissent has been ruthlessly attacked over the last 20 years&#8211;labor unions, Tea Party groups, OWS, etc. Recent &#8220;domestic terrorist&#8221; legislation appears to be targeted at these conservative groups and following the media circus that followed the Boston bombings, several &#8220;news&#8221; outlets ran trial balloons to test the waters, by insinuating that these groups were behind the attacks. Several weeks prior, NPR ran a lengthy story describing how the Southern Poverty Law Center tracks &#8220;patriot&#8221; groups and characterizes them as hate groups. I imagine that one of the Kleptocracy&#8217;s wettest dreams is that they provoke one of these groups into violence so they can round them up and disarm them in the name of National Security.</p>

<p>But seriously?  Put your toys down and pick your brain up.  The second you use a firearm against the government, you are a marked man committing to have a police force with essentially unlimited staff and ammo turn you into hamburger and scrape you into a big ol&#8217; Ziploc.  The only crime is challenging authority.  (Almost) always has been, (almost) always will be.</p>

<p>Well&#8230; the privileges of being wealthy certainly have been restored.  You can ask for the rules of the market to change in your favor at just about any time and get results.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you read the Constitution, it does not make any reference to any of those categories being entitled to power enshrinement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Can you tell me, then, what the 15th, 19th and 26th Amdts. were all about?  Actually, it&#8217;s very well known that only white, male landowners (the latter implying a certain amount of discretionary wealth) over the age of 21 were guaranteed the right to vote by the original Constitution.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much national good has come about from allowing people with Marxist<br />
tendencies to gain control of the functions of government?&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d get your head out of the movement, you&#8217;d see they haven&#8217;t.  What do private corporations for private wealth have to do with Marxism anyway?  If there is socialism, it&#8217;s ONLY for the wealthy.  With a brief blip around the 1950s, that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s been throughout Western history.</p>

<p>rotflmao!</p>
<p>GW, I believe every one of the &#8220;Conservative Groups&#8221; in question were doing just that&#8230; and were fraudulently using taxpayer money (through tax breaks to their corporate handlers) to fund the operations&#8230; how about some details (and rage) on that aspect of the story (the IRS should of course be going after all of these groups, and if they can&#8217;t be charged through current law, congress should legislate them out of existence).</p>
<p>p.s. The Tea Party was taken over and funded by corporations in the very early stages, using the &#8220;Patriot&#8221; meme as cover to ramp up the kleptocracy&#8230; OWS remains a (relatively) honest  effort to fight back, with lack of success (due mostly to the corporate controlled media and law enforcement) being the DNA evidence.</p>

You can only impose your control-freak persona over the teeming masses for so long before people start to resent your arrogance. Arrogance is a trait of liberals, along with the aforementioned need to control the population. One-by-one, their socially destructive tenets were pushed down our throats with the alleged impetus of some &#8220;Mandate&#8217; which propelled this &#8216;monarch&#8217; into office. When kids suddenly were required to turn-in the bagged lunches, which their untutored parents ignorantly supplied them with, those parents were a little upset about such an extension of our government. Gays are now on the Endangered Species List. Budget constraints and American Sovereignty have both been relegated to a quaint notion status. </p>
<p>Liberals destroy societies. It&#8217;s what they do. They can&#8217;t help it! I&#8217;m only hopeful that Americans realize the extent to which these people have metastasized into our Halls of Power, media and courts, and perform the necessary extirpations to rid us of these whining control freaks.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-77252" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Canistercook, there is much corruption in our government, for sure. I worked for the government, and I can assure you there are elements within that entity who seek more power than they are accorded by statutes. The people I worked with were Retired Military &#8216;Double Dippers&#8217;, who in some cases receive up to three separate federal paychecks at the end of their careers (Military Retirement, Civil Service Retirement and Social Security. Some even have their wives on the public dole.) These people are used to having a fence around them which limits their powers. Once they get out into civilian life, their gung ho &#8216;tudes&#8217; are kept in check. However, if they RETURN to Federal Service (as many do..)  they instantly restore their stripes on their sleeves, or officer badge of rank, and continue on with their &#8216;Military-Political&#8217; activities. People in  civilian government sectors are considered by these authoritarian &#8220;Lifers&#8221; to be in some ad hoc &#8216;Boot Camp&#8217;, with Double Dippers established as the D.I.s. I&#8217;ve seen many examples of this type of behavior (Do you remember Retired General Haig, who &#8216;took charge&#8217; of the government after the attempted assassination of Reagan? That is not an isolated case&#8230;) </p>
<p>One remedy for preventing this type of situation was eliminated by Clinton: The &#8220;Dual Compensation Act&#8221;. Once that measure was repealed, Double Dippers flooded into organizations like Homeland Security, FEMA, TSA, DoD, the FAA and other government entities, rank intact. Perhaps much of this authoritarian hubris now displayed by our government arose from a large complement of &#8220;Lifers&#8221;.</p>

Now his admonishment that impeaching Obama would be fruitless has vindicated my view. Like the so-called &#8220;Tea Party&#8221;, Limbaugh&#8217;s main concern is Israel. The PNAC Doctrine, cooked up in the 1990s, is basically a blueprint for American/Israeli hegemony in the Middle East. The impetus to convince Americans to adopt such a bellicose plan was plainly described to be a &#8216;New Pearl Harbor&#8217;. Ever since 9/11, these &#8216;Conservatives&#8217; have harped unceasingly about invading and/or making &#8220;Regime Changes&#8221; in every Middle East country that just happens to be listed on the PNAC Protocol. Though true conservatives would eschew irrational reactions to foreign intrigue if it had no effect on America, Neo Cons jump like scalded monkeys (usually a liberal tactic..) when they get a chance to address these &#8216;atrocities&#8217;.<br />
Neo Cons talk the conservative talk, but they don&#8217;t walk the walk. Indeed, in Limbaugh&#8217;s case, he has &#8220;Presided&#8221; over two Clinton Presidencies, Two Obama Presidencies, Hillary&#8217;s undeserved political appointment, Gay Marriage, ad nauseam. It would seem to those of us who evince a conservative stripe that we&#8217;re placing our political eggs in a closet liberal basket.</p>

While working for the IRS, I had all fantastic appraisals, three formal awards, and letters of recognition from other employees and managers. Then suddenly I was moved to another manager (a member of the executive team at the New Carrolton, MD. site). That&#8217;s when my career fell apart. In the course of working for this manager for a few months, she assaulted me twice, wrote me up for not turning in work that I had turned in, and, once I filed a complaint about her physicality, accused me of being physical toward her. She got several members of the executive team involved in harassing me out, then issued me a suspension based on fiction. (Notice that, in my 30 year career in the industry, I had never once come close to any kind of discipline.)<br />
The manager in question brought me before her manager (someone who wielded even more power) for a bawling out whenever she felt I had dome something wrong. The union admitted to wrong-doing on the part of the manager, but never lifted a finger to help out. The purported wrong-doing was always a piece of fiction, and provably so. (I was once falsely accused of going AWOL for three weeks because I purportedly had not filed the right paperwork. Not only had I filed the right paperwork, but management actually knew I had, but wrote me up anyway.) When the woman&#8217;s manager had me to his office to issue the final notice of the suspension, For about half an hour I explained  why the suspension was not deserved. Finally I burst into tears. Then he said: &#8220;You are too emotional for us.&#8221; Notice that this was after several months of harassment at the hands of the executive team.<br />
Finally, all charges were dropped on appeal and I left with a positive reference from management.<br />
This experience is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. The executive team spent hundreds of thousands of tax payer dollars to bully me out.<br />
The IRS should make training videos for managers on how to bully people out. (Maybe they already know how.)</p>
