						<h3 style="color: #000099;"></h3>
<h3 style="color: #000099;">U.S. Officials Created a False Link Between Iraq and 9/11</h3>
<p>5 hours after the 9/11 attacks, Donald Rumsfeld said <a title="“my interest is to hit Saddam”." href="http://rawstory.com/news/2007/Hours_after_911_attacks_Rumsfeld_allegedly_0502.html" target="_blank">“my interest is to hit Saddam”.</a></p>
<p>He also said <a title="“Go massive . . . Sweep it all up. Things related and not.”" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/04/september11/main520830.shtml" target="_blank">“Go massive . . . Sweep it all up. Things related and not.”</a></p>
<p>And at 2:40 p.m. on September 11th, in a memorandum of discussions between top administration officials, several lines below the statement “judge whether good enough [to] hit S.H. [that is, Saddam Hussein] at same time”, is the statement <a title="“Hard to get a good case.”" href="http://www.yourbbsucks.com/forum/showthread.php?t=8397" target="_blank">“Hard to get a good case.”</a> In other words, top officials knew that there wasn’t a good case that Hussein was behind 9/11, but they wanted to use the 9/11 attacks as an excuse to justify war with Iraq anyway.</p>
<p>Moreover, “Ten days after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, <a title="President Bush was told in a highly classified briefing that the U.S. intelligence community had no evidence linking the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein to the [9/11] attacks and that there was scant credible evidence that Iraq had any significant collaborative ties with Al Qaeda”" href="http://nationaljournal.com/about/njweekly/stories/2005/1122nj1.htm" target="_blank">President Bush was told in a highly classified briefing that the U.S. intelligence community had no evidence linking the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein to the [9/11] attacks and that there was scant credible evidence that Iraq had any significant collaborative ties with Al Qaeda”</a>.</p>
<p>And a Defense Intelligence Terrorism Summary issued in February 2002 by the United States Defense Intelligence Agency <a title="cast significant doubt on the possibility of a Saddam Hussein-al-Qaeda conspiracy" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/06/politics/06intel.ready.html?ei=5090&amp;en=a943ec3b39b0a896&amp;ex=1288933200&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=print" target="_blank">cast significant doubt on the possibility of a Saddam Hussein-al-Qaeda conspiracy</a>.</p>
<p>And yet Bush, Cheney and other top administration officials claimed repeatedly for years that Saddam was behind 9/11. See <a title="this analysis" href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/007005.php" target="_blank">this analysis</a>. Indeed, <a title="Bush administration officials apparently swore in a  lawsuit that Saddam was behind 9/11" href="http://www.opednews.com/maxwrite/print_friendly.php?p=opedne_evelyn_p_051115_bush_gang_swore_sadd.htm" target="_blank">Bush administration officials apparently swore in a <strong>lawsuit</strong><em></em> that Saddam was behind 9/11</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, President Bush’s <a title="March 18, 2003 letter to Congress authorizing the use of force against Iraq" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/03/20030319-1.html" target="_blank">March 18, 2003 letter to Congress authorizing the use of force against Iraq</a>, includes the following paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>(2) acting pursuant to the Constitution and Public Law 107-243 is consistent with the United States and other countries continuing to take the necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations, <strong>including those nations, organizations, or persons who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, the Bush administration expressly justified the Iraq war to Congress by representing that Iraq planned, authorized, committed, or aided the 9/11 attacks.</p>
<p>Indeed, Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Ron Suskind <a href="www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12308.html">reports</a> that the White House ordered the CIA to forge and backdate a document falsely linking Iraq with Muslim terrorists and 9/11 … and that the CIA complied with those instructions and in fact created the forgery, which was then used to justify war against Iraq. And see <a title="this" href="http://rawstory.com/news/2008/Suskind_Bush_ordered_fake_letter_linking_0805.html" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
<p>Suskind also revealed that “Bush administration had information from a top Iraqi intelligence official ‘that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq – intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion.’ ”</p>
<p>Cheney made the false linkage between Iraq and 9/11 <a title="on many occasions" href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/Cheney-Accidentally-Admits-by-Steven-Leser-090603-753.html" target="_blank">on many occasions</a>.</p>
<p>For example, according to Raw Story, Cheney was still alleging a connection between Iraq and the alleged lead 9/11 hijacker in September 2003 – a year after it had been widely debunked. When NBC’s Tim Russert <a title="asked" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3080244/" target="_blank">asked</a> him about a poll showing that 69% of Americans believed Saddam Hussein had been involved in 9/11, Cheney replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s not surprising that people make that connection.</p></blockquote>
<p>And even after <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5223932/ns/us_news-security/t/panel-sees-no-link-between-iraq-al-qaida/#.UIde6fWUxqI">the 9/11 Commission debunked</a> any connection, Cheney <a title="said" href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/18/cheney.iraq.al.qaeda/" target="_blank">said</a> that the evidence is “overwhelming” that al Qaeda had a relationship with Saddam Hussein’s regime , that Cheney “probably” had information unavailable to the Commission, and that the media was not ‘doing their homework’ in reporting such ties.</p>
<p>Again, the Bush administration expressly justified the Iraq war by representing that Iraq planned, authorized, committed, or aided the 9/11 attacks. See <a title="this" href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/18/cheney.iraq.al.qaeda/" target="_blank">this</a>, <a title="this" href="http://www.nationalreview.com/murdock/murdock040303.asp" target="_blank">this</a>, <a title="this" href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=complete_timeline_of_the_2003_invasion_of_iraq_986#complete_timeline_of_the_2003_invasion_of_iraq_986" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
<p>On December 16, 2005, Bush admitted <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/140133_bushiraq18.html">&#8220;There was no evidence that Saddam Hussein was involved with the attack of 9/11&#8243;</a> (and see <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=f_A77N5WKWM">this video</a>).  However, Bush and Cheney <em>continued</em> to frequently <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080323232554/http://news.yahoo.com/s/mcclatchy/20080318/wl_mcclatchy/2883358">invoke 9/11</a> as justification for the Iraq war.  And <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/03/13/MNG7UOK2D61.DTL&amp;type=printable">see this</a>. (Cheney finally <a href="http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/archive/NATL-Saddam-911-Werent-Linked-Cheney.html">admitted</a> in 2009 that there was no link.)</p>
<p>A bipartisan Senate Report from 2006 found that <a href="http://editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003119383&amp;imw=Y" rel="nofollow">Bush misled the press on Iraq link to Al-Qaeda</a>.</p>
<p>The administration&#8217;s false claims about Saddam and 9/11 helped convince a large portion of the American public to support the invasion of Iraq. While the focus now may be on false WMD claims, it is important to remember that, at the time, the alleged link between Iraq and 9/11 was <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0314/p02s01-woiq.html">at least as important in many people&#8217;s mind as a reason to invade Iraq</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, the <a title="everyone knew" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/11/everyone-knew-that-iraq-didnt-have-wmds.html">false claims about Iraqi WMDs</a> probably would not have gained traction if it wasn&#8217;t for the anti-Arab hysteria after September 11th. And the government policy of torture would not have been tolerated if we weren&#8217;t misled into thinking that Saddam and Al-Qaeda had formed an unholy, all-powerful alliance on 9/11, and had to be stopped at any cost. Thus, the Saddam-911 deception was a necessary <em>precursor</em> to the administration&#8217;s WMD lies and torture policies.</p>
<p>And 2006 polls show that almost <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070209222257/http://www.zogby.com/NEWS/ReadNews.dbm?ID=1075">90% of the troops in Iraq are under the mistaken belief that the U.S. mission in that country is “to retaliate for Saddam’s role in the 9-11 attacks.”</a> In other words, our kids are fighting and dying because of this lie.</p>
<h3 style="color: #000099;">U.S. Officials Launched a Systematic Program of Torture Using Specialized Techniques Which Produce <em>False</em> Confessions &#8230; to Justify the Iraq War</h3>
<p>Not only did Bush, Cheney and other top government officials lie about us into the Iraq war by making a false linkage between Iraq and 9/11, but they carried out a systematic program of torture in order to <em>intentionally create <strong>false evidence</strong></em> of that allegation.</p>
<p>Indeed, <a title="the entire purpose behind the U.S. torture program was to obtain false confessions" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/04/9-torture-myths-debunked.html">the <em>entire purpose</em> behind the U.S. torture program</a> was to obtain <em><strong>false</strong></em> confessions.</p>
<p>And the torture techniques used were <a title="Communist techniques specifically designed to produce false confessions" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/05/u-s-government-used-communist-torture-techniques-specifically-designed-to-produce-false-confessions.html">Communist techniques <strong><em>specifically designed</em></strong> to produce <em>false</em> confessions</a>.</p>
<p>Senator Levin, in commenting on a Senate Armed Services Committee report on torture in 2009, <a title="commenting" href="http://www.levin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/?id=ba6f0d71-052a-4fb0-a11d-ab12ef6a6820" target="_blank">dropped the following bombshell</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>With last week’s release of the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinions, it is now widely known that Bush administration officials distorted Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape “SERE” training – a legitimate program used by the military to train our troops to resist abusive enemy interrogations – by authorizing abusive techniques from SERE for use in detainee interrogations. Those decisions conveyed the message that abusive treatment was appropriate for detainees in U.S. custody. They were also an affront to the values articulated by General Petraeus.</p>
<p>In SERE training, U.S. troops are briefly exposed, in a highly controlled setting, to abusive interrogation techniques used by enemies that refuse to follow the Geneva Conventions. The techniques are based on tactics used by Chinese Communists against American soldiers during the Korean War for the purpose of eliciting <em>false</em> confessions for propaganda purposes. Techniques used in SERE training include stripping trainees of their clothing, placing them in stress positions, putting hoods over their heads, subjecting them to face and body slaps, depriving them of sleep, throwing them up against a wall, confining them in a small box, treating them like animals, subjecting them to loud music and flashing lights, and exposing them to extreme temperatures. Until recently, the Navy SERE school also used waterboarding. The purpose of the SERE program is to provide U.S. troops who might be captured a taste of the treatment they might face so that they might have a better chance of surviving captivity and resisting abusive and coercive interrogations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Senator Levin then documents that SERE techniques were deployed as part of an official policy on detainees, and that SERE instructors helped to implement the interrogation programs.  He noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>The senior Army SERE psychologist warned in 2002 against using SERE training techniques during interrogations in an email to personnel at Guantanamo Bay, because:</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]he use of physical pressures brings with it a large number of potential negative side effects… When individuals are gradually exposed to increasing levels of discomfort, it is more common for them to resist harder… If individuals are put under enough discomfort, i.e. pain, they will eventually do whatever it takes to stop the pain. This will increase the amount of information they tell the interrogator, but it does not mean the information is accurate. In fact, it usually decreases the reliability of the information because the person will say whatever he believes will stop the pain… Bottom line: the likelihood that the use of physical pressures will increase the delivery of accurate information from a detainee is very low. The likelihood that the use of physical pressures will increase the level of resistance in a detainee is very high… (p. 53).</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>McClatchy <a title="fills in" href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/227/story/66622.html?ref=fp1" target="_blank">filled in</a> some of the details:</p>
<blockquote><p>Former senior U.S. intelligence official familiar with the interrogation issue said that Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld demanded that the interrogators find evidence of al Qaida-Iraq collaboration…</p>
<p>For most of 2002 and into 2003, Cheney and Rumsfeld, especially, were also demanding proof of the links between al Qaida and Iraq that (former Iraqi exile leader Ahmed) Chalabi and others had told them were there.”</p>
<p>It was during this period that CIA interrogators waterboarded two alleged top al Qaida detainees repeatedly — Abu Zubaydah at least 83 times in August 2002 and Khalid Sheik Muhammed 183 times in March 2003 — according to a newly released Justice Department document…</p>
<p>When people kept coming up empty, they were told by Cheney’s and Rumsfeld’s people to push harder,” he continued.”Cheney’s and Rumsfeld’s people were told repeatedly, by CIA . . . and by others, that there wasn’t any reliable intelligence that pointed to operational ties between bin Laden and Saddam . . .</p>
<p>A former U.S. Army psychiatrist, Maj. Charles Burney, told Army investigators in 2006 that interrogators at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility were under “pressure” to produce evidence of ties between al Qaida and Iraq.</p>
<p>“While we were there a large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between al Qaida and Iraq and we were not successful in establishing a link between al Qaida and Iraq,” Burney told staff of the Army Inspector General. “The more frustrated people got in not being able to establish that link . . . there was more and more pressure to resort to measures that might produce more immediate results.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s obvious that the administration was scrambling then to try to find a connection, a link (between al Qaida and Iraq),” [Senator] Levin said in a conference call with reporters. “They made out links where they didn’t exist.”</p>
<p>Levin recalled Cheney’s assertions that a senior Iraqi intelligence officer had met Mohammad Atta, the leader of the 9/11 hijackers, in the Czech Republic capital of Prague just months before the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</p>
<p>The FBI and CIA found that no such meeting occurred.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, top Bush administration officials not only knowingly lied about a non-existent connection between Al Qaida and Iraq, but they pushed and insisted that interrogators use special torture methods aimed at extracting <em>false confessions</em> to attempt to create such a false linkage.</p>
<p>The Washington Post <a title="reported" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/white-house-watch/torture/torturing-for-propaganda-purpo.html" target="_blank">reported</a> the same year:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite what you’ve seen on TV, torture is really only good at one thing: eliciting <strong>false confessions</strong>. Indeed, Bush-era torture techniques, we now know, were cold-bloodedly modeled after methods used by <strong>Chinese Communists</strong> to extract confessions from captured U.S. servicemen that they could then use for propaganda during the Korean War.</p>
<p>So as shocking as the latest revelation in a new Senate Armed Services Committee report may be, it actually makes sense — in a nauseating way. The White House started pushing the use of torture not when faced with a “ticking time bomb” scenario from terrorists, but when <strong>officials in 2002 were desperately casting about for ways to tie Iraq to the 9/11 attacks</strong> — in order to strengthen their public case for invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11 at all.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Gordon Trowbridge writes for the Detroit News: “Senior Bush administration officials pushed for the use of abusive interrogations of terrorism detainees in part to seek evidence to justify the invasion of Iraq, according to newly declassified information discovered in a congressional probe.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, one of the two senior instructors from the Air Force team which taught U.S. servicemen how to resist torture by foreign governments when used to extract false confessions has blown the whistle on the true purpose behind the U.S. torture program.</p>
<p>As Truth Out <a title="reported" href="http://www.truth-out.org/cia-psychologists-notes-reveal-bushs-torture-program68542" target="_blank">reported</a> last year:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jessen’s notes were provided to Truthout by retired Air Force Capt. Michael Kearns, a “master” SERE instructor and <a title="decorated" href="http://truthout.org/files/Kearns-letter-SERE.pdf" target="_blank">decorated</a> veteran who has previously held high-ranking positions within the Air Force Headquarters Staff and Department of Defense (DoD).</p>
<p>Kearns and his boss, Roger Aldrich, the head of the Air Force Intelligence’s Special Survial Training Program (SSTP), based out of Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane, Washington, hired Jessen in May 1989. Kearns, who was head of operations at SSTP and trained thousands of service members, said Jessen was brought into the program due to an increase in the number of new SERE courses being taught and “the fact that it required psychological expertise on hand in a full-time basis.”</p>
<p>Jessen, then the chief of Psychology Service at the US Air Force Survival School, immediately started to work directly with Kearns on “a new course for special mission units (SMUs), which had as its goal individual resistance to terrorist exploitation.”</p>
<p>The course, known as SV-91, was developed for the Survival Evasion Resistance Escape (SERE) branch of the US Air Force Intelligence Agency, which acted as the Executive Agent Action Office for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Jessen’s notes formed the basis for one part of SV-91, “Psychological Aspects of Detention.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Kearns was one of only two officers within DoD qualified to teach all three SERE-related courses within SSTP on a worldwide basis, according to a copy of a 1989 letter written Aldrich, who <a title="nominated him" href="http://truthout.org/files/kearns-officer-of-the-year.pdf" target="_blank">nominated him</a> officer of the year.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Jessen notes clearly state the totality of what was being reverse-engineered – not just ‘enhanced interrogation techniques,’ but an entire program of exploitation of prisoners using torture as a central pillar,” he said. “What I think is important to note, as an ex-SERE Resistance to Interrogation instructor, is the focus of Jessen’s instruction. It is exploitation, not specifically interrogation. And this is not a picayune issue, because if one were to ‘reverse-engineer’ a course on resistance to exploitation then what one would get is a plan to exploit prisoners, <em>not </em>interrogate them. The CIA/DoD torture program appears to have the same goals as the terrorist organizations or enemy governments for which SV-91 and other SERE courses were created to defend against: the full exploitation of the prisoner in his intelligence, <strong>propaganda</strong>, or other needs held by the detaining power, such as the recruitment of informers and double agents. Those aspects of the US detainee program have not generally been discussed as part of the torture story in the American press.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Jessen wrote that cooperation is the “end goal” of the detainer, who wants the detainee “to see that [the detainer] has ‘total’ control of you because you are completely dependent on him, and thus you must comply with his wishes. <strong>Therefore, it is absolutely inevitable that you must cooperate with him in some way (propaganda, special favors, confession, etc.)</strong>.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Kearns said, based on what he has read in declassified government documents and news reports about the role SERE played in the Bush administration’s torture program, Jessen clearly “reverse-engineered” his lesson plan and used resistance methods to abuse “war on terror” detainees.</p></blockquote>
<p>So we have the two main Air Force insiders concerning the genesis of the torture program confirming – with original notes – that the whole purpose of the torture program was to extract false confessions.</p>
<p>Indeed, the top interrogation experts from U.S. military and intelligence services say that <a title="all torture is lousy at producing actionable intelligence" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/04/9-torture-myths-debunked.html">all torture is lousy at producing actionable intelligence</a>, the <em>only things</em> it is good for are (1) producing false confessions, (2) creating more terrorists, and (3) <em>itself</em> acting as a <a title="form of terrorism" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/05/torture-is-a-form-of-terrorism.html">form of terrorism</a>.</p>
<p>And false confessions <strong><em>were</em></strong>, in fact, extracted.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A humanitarian aid worker said: <a title="Humanitarian Aid Worker: Torture Only Stopped When I Pretended I Was In Al Qaeda" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/06/humanitarian-aid-worker-torture-only.html">torture only stopped when I <em>pretended</em> I was in Al Qaeda</a></li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li title="Guardian: Abu Zubaydah">President Bush mentioned Abu Zubaydah as a success story, where torture saved lives.  Zubaydah was suspected of being a high-ranking al-Qaida leader. Bush administration officials claimed Zubaydah told them that al-Qaida had links with Saddam Hussein. He also claimed there was a plot to attack Washington with a &#8220;dirty bomb&#8221;. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/nov/09/george-bush-waterboarding-torture">Both claims are now recognized to be false, even by the CIA, which also admits he was never a member of al-Qaida</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>One of the Main Sources for the 9/11 Commission Report <em>was <a title="One of the Main Sources for the 9/11 Commission Report was Tortured Until He Agreed to Sign a Confession that He Was NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO READ" href="http://georgewashington2.blogspot.com/2009/05/one-of-main-sources-for-911-commission.html" target="_blank">Tortured Until He Agreed to Sign a Confession that He Was <strong>NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO READ</strong></a></em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The so-called 9/11 mastermind said: <a title="9/11 Mastermind: “During … My Interrogation I Gave A Lot Of False Information In Order To Satisfy What I Believed The Interrogators Wished To Hear”" href="http://georgewashington2.blogspot.com/2009/05/during-my-interrogation-i-gave-lot-of.html" target="_blank">“During … my interrogation I gave a lot of false information in order to satisfy what I believed the interrogators wished to hear”</a> (the self-confessed 9/11 “mastermind” <a title="Self-Confessed 9/11 “Mastermind” Also Falsely Confessed to Crimes He Didn’t Commit" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/04/self-confessed-911-mastermind-also.html">falsely confessed to crimes he didn’t commit</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>(Indeed, the 9/11 Commission Report was largely based on a <em>third-hand</em> account of what tortured detainees said, with<a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/03/the-reason-for-this-cover-up-goes-right-to-the-white-house.html"> two of the three parties in the communication being government employees</a>. And the government went to great lengths to <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/08/911-criminal-incompetence-and-ass-covering-by-the-bush-administration.html">obstruct justice and hide unflattering facts</a> from the  Commission.)</p>
<p>Again, this essay is not focused on questioning the government&#8217;s statements about Al Qaeda and 9/11 &#8230; it focuses on the false testimony and coercion post-9/11 to justify war against Iraq.</p>
<h3 style="color: #000099;">Did Government Officials Have Any Motive?</h3>
<p>When criminal prosecutors look assess whether or not a suspect is likely guilty, they determine whether or not he had motive, means and opportunity.</p>
<p>The means and opportunity for top U.S. officials to carry out the war crimes of lying us into war based upon a false linkage between Iraq and 9/11 and to torture people into giving false confessions is a given.  Specifically, top government officials such as President Bush, Vice President Cheney and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld had power to take such actions, if they had wanted to.</p>
<p>It has been extensively documented that the White House decided to invade Iraq <em><a title="before 9/11" href="http://crooksandliars.com/karoli/new-documents-show-bush-administration-plan" target="_blank">before 9/11</a></em>:</p>

And in 2000, Cheney <a title="said" href="http://www.cato.org/dispatch/10-06-00d.html" target="_blank">said</a> a Bush administration might “have to take military action to forcibly remove Saddam from power.” And <a title="see this" href="http://www.aolnews.com/2011/02/08/donald-rumsfeld-files-reveal-pre-9-11-focus-on-iraq/" target="_blank">see this</a>.</li>

<p>Indeed, neoconservatives planned regime change <a title="Neoconservatives Planned Regime Change Throughout the Middle East and North Africa 20 Years Ago ?" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/11/neoconservatives-planned-regime-change-throughout-the-middle-east-and-northern-africa-20-years-ago.html" rel="next">in Iraq &#8211; and throughout the Middle East and North Africa &#8211; <em><strong>20</strong> years ago</em></a>.</p>
<p>This provides evidence of motive by top American officials to create false justifications for a war against Iraq.</p>
<p align="left">In addition, Cheney and Rumsfeld made <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/golub03212003.html">false claims exaggerating the threat</a> posed by <em>Russia&#8217;s</em> weapons <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0213-28.htm">in the <em>1970s</em></a> to justify huge increases in military spending.  Prosecutors look at previous lies as evidence that the defendant is intentionally lying <em>now</em>. Similarly, Cheney and Rumsfeld&#8217;s lies about WMDs in the 1970s add to the <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/11/everyone-knew-that-iraq-didnt-have-wmds.html">mountain of evidence</a> that government officials intentionally lied about Iraqi WMDs.</p>
<p align="left">Moreover, Saddam <a title="allegedly" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=484162" target="_blank">allegedly</a> offered to leave Iraq:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Fearing defeat, Saddam was prepared to go peacefully in return for £500million ($1billion)”.</p>
<p>“The extraordinary offer was revealed yesterday in a transcript of talks in February 2003 between George Bush and the then Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar at the President’s Texas ranch.”</p>
<p>“The White House refused to comment on the report last night. But, if verified, it is certain to raise questions in Washington and London over whether the costly four-year war could have been averted.”</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the tapes, Bush told Aznar that whether Saddam was still in Iraq or not, “We’ll be in Baghdad by the end of March.” See also <a title="this" href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/saddam-was-open-to-exile-report/2007/09/27/1190486484569.html" target="_blank">this</a> and <a title="this" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9864433" target="_blank">this</a>.  If true, this adds additional circumstantial evidence that U.S. officials were committed to a war in Iraq even if Saddam Hussein voluntarily left.</p>
<h3 style="color: #000099;">But Are They Guilty of War Crimes?</h3>
<p>The Nuremberg Tribunal which convicted and sentenced Nazis leaders to death conceived of wars of aggression &#8211; i.e. wars not launched in self-defense &#8211; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_aggression#The_Nuremberg_Principles">defined</a> the following as &#8220;crimes against peace&#8221;, or war crimes:</p>
<dl>
<dd>(i) <em>Planning, preparation, initiation or waging of a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances;</em></dd>
<dd>(ii) <em>Participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the acts mentioned under (i)</em></dd>
</dl>
<p>The Tribunal considered wars of aggression to be the ultimate war crime, which <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-Ni6Qy2E9KwC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=essentially+an+evil+thing...to+initiate+a+war+of+aggression...is+not+only+an+international+crime%3B+it+is+the+supreme+international+crime,+differing+only+from+other+war+crimes+in+that+it+contains+within+itself+the+accumulated+evil+of+the+whole.">encompassed all other crimes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Judgment of October 1, 1946, International Military Tribunal Judgment and Sentence, 22 IMTTRIALS, supra note 7, at 498, reprinted in 41 AM. J. INT&#8217;LL. 172, 186 (1947)</em>.</p>
<p>Given that Iraq had <em>no connection</em> with 9/11 and possessed no weapons of mass destruction, the Iraq war was a crime of aggression and &#8211; under the standards by which Nazi leaders were convicted by the Nuremberg Tribunal &#8211; the American leaders who lied us into that war are guilty of war crimes.</p>
<p>Benjamin Ferencz, a former chief prosecutor for the Nuremberg Trials, declared:</p>
<blockquote><p>A prima facie case can be made that the United States is guilty of the supreme crime against humanity — that being an illegal war of aggression against a sovereign nation.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>In January 2003, a group of American law professors warned President George W. Bush that he and senior officials of his government could be prosecuted for war crimes if their military tactics violated international humanitarian law.</p></blockquote>
<p>Eminent legal scholars such as former <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Fire-This-Time-Crimes/dp/0965691683">U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clarke</a> and Dean of the Massachusetts School of Law and a professor of law <a href="http://www.mslaw.edu/Faculty_velvel.htm">Lawrence Velvel</a> have since stated that high-level Bush administration officials did commit war crimes in relation to the Iraq war.</p>
<p>Torture is &#8211; of course &#8211; a violation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture#Geneva_Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a>, which make it illegal to inflict mental or physical torture or inhuman treatment. It is clearly-established that <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/04/9-torture-myths-debunked.html">waterboarding is torture</a>. <em></em>The torture was, in fact, systematic, and included widespread sexual humiliation, murder and other <a href="http://georgewashington2.blogspot.com/2009/05/here-are-few-of-torture-photos-obama.html">unambiguous forms of torture</a>.<em></em></p>
<p>Velvel and many other legal experts say that the torture which was carried out after 9/11 is a <a href="http://lawsnotmen.org/memorandum">war crime</a>.</p>
<p>Colin Powell&#8217;s former chief of staff stated that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4480638.stm">Dick Cheney is guilty of war crimes</a> for <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/cheney-oversaw-torture-former-cia-director/2005/11/18/1132016963907.html">overseeing torture policies</a><em>.  </em><em></em></p>
<p>Matthew Alexander – a former top Air Force interrogator who led the team that tracked down Abu Musab al-Zarqawi – notes that government officials <a title="agrees" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/06/torture-may-have-slowed-h_n_858642.html" target="_blank">knew they are vulnerable for war crime prosecution</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>They have, from the beginning, been trying to prevent an investigation into war crimes.</p></blockquote>
<p>A Malaysian war crimes commission also found Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and five administration attorneys <a href="http://firedoglake.com/2012/05/13/war-crimes-conviction-%E2%80%93-malaysian-tribunal-finds-bush-et-al-guilty/">guilty of war crimes</a> (although but the commission has no power to enforce its judgment).</p>
<p>The United States War Crimes Act of 1996, a federal statute set forth at <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/ts_search.pl?title=18&amp;sec=2441">18 U.S.C. § 2441</a>, also makes it a federal crime for any U.S. national, whether military or civilian, to violate the Geneva Convention by engaging in murder, torture, or inhuman treatment.</p>
<p>The statute applies not only to those who carry out the acts, but also to those who <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/30/1333214#transcript">ORDER IT, know about it, or fail to take steps to stop it.</a> The statute applies to <a href="http://www.nlg.org/news/statements/BushTortureJune2004.htm">everyone, no matter how high and mighty</a>.</p>
<p>18 U.S.C. § 2441 has no statute of limitations, which means that a war crimes complaint can be filed at any time.</p>
<p>The penalty may be life imprisonment or &#8212; if <em>a single</em> prisoner dies due to torture &#8212; death. Given that there are numerous, documented cases of prisoners being tortured to death by U.S. soldiers in both Iraq and Afghanistan, that means that the death penalty would be appropriate for anyone found guilty of carrying out, ordering, or sanctioning such conduct.</p>
<p>The Military Commissions Act of 2006 limited the applicability of the War Crimes Act, but still made the following <a title="unlawful" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Commissions_Act_of_2006" target="_blank">unlawful</a>: torture, cruel or inhumane treatment, murder, mutilation or maiming, intentionally causing serious bodily harm, rape, sexual assault or abuse.</p>

<p>That being said, I suppose it&#8217;s a good idea to keep reminding people about the <b>facts</b> surrounding 911 and the Orwellian &#8220;war on terror&#8221;. Although, it never did much good with the Kennedy and numerous other assassinations, a multitude of &#8220;false flag&#8221; operations or any of the other illegal <a href="http://chimaeraimaginarium.wordpress.com/2011/11/16/lets-talk-about-amerikan-history-random-acts-of-genocide/" rel="nofollow">american &#8220;interventions&#8221;</a> in sovereign nations over many decades.</p>
<p>Maybe someday, if we&#8217;re not all wiped out by the sixth great extinction event unfolding at this time, after all the perpetrators are long dead, a few paragraphs in some history book will briefly address the evils of the &#8220;american empire&#8221;. Or perhaps a great tome, &#8220;The Rise and Fall of the American Empire&#8221;, will be authored. Or not.</p>

You sound like a CIA shill troll.</p>
<p>Only defeatists,<br />
Give up before they try,<br />
Only cowards,<br />
Roll over and die. </p>
<p>AND, YOU ARE WRONG! This is not old news to those millions recently coming on to the internet. It is fresh news to them. And their numbers are growing every day!</p>
<p>You sound like Grandma Shiela on Chris Floyd’s blog, Empire Burlesque.</p>
<p><a href="http://chris-floyd.com/" rel="nofollow">http://chris-floyd.com/</a></p>
<p>Just an opinion dude, but god you radiate defeatism. Its dripping off of your every word. What the hell do you get out of bed for in the morning your only going to be tired again at the end of the day? Why brush your teeth they will only get dirty again. Why wipe your ass its only going to fill up with crap again?</p>
<p>I nominate you for defeatist poison of the day.</p>
<p>Trust me they are all going to jail and they are all living in their own prisons of their own making right now.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorry I don&#8217;t share your optimism any longer. I&#8217;ve been trying to maintain mine, in spite of all the evidence of our entire history, for over fifty years.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my opinion this version of &#8220;civilisation&#8221; cannot be <i>fixed</i>. I merely think people need to be devoting more time to preparing for what&#8217;s coming. It&#8217;s now a matter of survival.</p>
<p>You say defeatist, I say realist. Only time will tell.</p>
<p>Your video is quite profound. The focus on fundamentalist christianity is very appropriate. Thank you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll pay you back in kind. Keep in mind, the song was written back in 1983 and I&#8217;ve been trying to wake people up since well before then.<br />

<p>There is no <i>force</i> inherent in politics. The psychopaths controlling the world&#8217;s economies by usury, who completely <b>own</b> the politicians and their faux governments are, for now, the strongest force on the planet.</p>
<p>Mother nature will soon put an end to that.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m simply offering an opinion. If you disagree, that&#8217;s perfectly fine. I hold your right to do so as dearly as my own.</p>
<p>I never said that nothing <b>can</b> be done, simply that it won&#8217;t be. Until this cycle of history reaches that point where enough people are pushed to the point beyond which they cannot be pushed further. And then will come, as so many times before, a revolution with all the attendant violence, blood and death so we can go back and do it all over again.</p>

<p>However, what I see is an incredible awakening happening NOW, as millions and millions of people are being pushed to the limit.  At the same time I see many brave people, who don&#8217;t think trying is futile, working hard behind the scenes to bring about real change through the right issues (like in this article), without violence.</p>
<p>People like this guy: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68_3rjp0Rkw&#038;feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68_3rjp0Rkw&#038;feature=youtu.be</a></p>
<p>I &#8220;believe&#8221; in those types of good people and that they can be instrumental in bringing about the massive change that is so needed now.  I think the system of lies has reached its limit and is coming to an end.</p>

The question that begs to be asked is if intelligence knew Iraq had no WMDs and they have said Iran has no nuclear weapons program, what is the purpose of the brutal sanctions used against both countries? Answer: to soften up the country up for invasion, occupation and wealth extraction. It&#8217;s pretty straight forward. This has been our unstated foreign policy from the get go and yet Americans are still unable to connect the dots. Until they do, the depraved degenerate lunatics who carry out these atrocities will continue to get away with it.</p>

That&#8217;s why all the objections just suddenly stopped in the international body&#8230;do some real research instead of talking out of your poop chute.</p>

<p>By our illegal and immoral actions we&#8217;ve created a growing body of <i>&#8220;terrorists&#8221;</i> throughout the world that see america as the real <i>&#8220;axis of evil&#8221;</i> and therefore are opposed to any further expansion of the empire. </p>
<p>The &#8220;war on terror&#8221; is a self-sustaining negative feedback loop. Our rulers started it for the very reason that, once set in motion, it&#8217;s nearly impossible to stop. Perpetual war was the goal and it has been achieved.</p>

<p>because some soldiers found some containers or trucks they thought were suspicious.   the media put it in the news immediately.   but when the stuff was analyzed, there were no traces of chemical agents for warfare.   but the follow up reports didn&#8217;t get much coverage.</p>

You must be too young to remember, however I remember working as a bartender and arguing with one of the waitresses because she believed Saddam Hussein was a terrorist and he helped plan the 9/11 attacks.  Then the whole WMD, smalll pox and anthrax scare came out where we were all lead to believe that there were Iraqis that were going to try and infect the troops with small pox and anthrax, so the troops went in with special gear so they wouldn&#8217;t get infected. lol.  They found no small pox, anthrax or WMD go figure&#8230;and this was AFTER the UN investigator went in and said there are NO WMDS! Its just another lie in the long line of lies the President and his administration made&#8230;along with Condi&#8217;s famous &#8220;We had no knowlege of the 9/11 attacks.&#8221; Yes they did. Richard Clark sent numerous memos to Bush..actually the CIA was following some of the terrorists AND Bin Laden right before it happened.

This stipulated that if one member (U.S.) was attacked, all other members would come to its defense. Obviously this was an historic moment and justification for a preemptive strike on the tyrannical regimes of Saddam-Hussein and the Taliban. If you were to prosecute an American federal official for war crimes do it for the means by which he achieved the goal not in presenting the goal that dozens of nations put their citizen&#8217;s lives on the line to accomplish. That said, Iran is a real threat to international security and should be handled with respect for the volatile situation it is and not put off as another steaming pile of dung that Israel wants to dirty American hands in.</p>

There is really no question Bush neocon cabal are guilty of 911, by virtue of the cover-up if nothing else; and of war crimes as result following.<br />
In the 11 years since the atrocity, the circle of those dependent upon OCT narrative [Commission/creatioNIST reports] being maintained, has widened &#8216;considerable&#8217;.<br />
Therefore, given the forensics establishing some form of controlled demolition of the 3 towers is extensive, continuing, and knowledge of it widespread and understood by many within the ruling elites since that day [there can be little excuse for their NOT knowing 911 was false flag and the WAR corollary to that] but by their continuing &#8216;the program&#8217;, those &#8216;many more&#8217; have become complicit, and further barrier to Justice being able to be done, since more people have more to loose.</p>
<p>It was John Kennedy jnr. who said TIME is the enemy of truth. And it was ROVE reported to have said :<br />
&#8220;We&#8217;re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And<br />
while you&#8217;re studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we&#8217;ll act<br />
again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that&#8217;s<br />
 how things will sort out. We&#8217;re history&#8217;s actors…and you, all of you,<br />

Americans have been paying for these crimes and i doubt that will change any time soon.</p>

Then Obama would have to figure out a reason for fighting Iran, and whatever other mid-east country that has something we want.  Really Saudi Arabia had more to do with the 9/11 attacks, since they helped fund the frickin thing and continue to fund terror cells. Its ridiculous how screwed up everything is and no one is informed. Great read. I would like to see something like this on CNN or NBC (but that would never happen) that way maybe more people would understand the full extent to how much of a slippery slope Iraq was. I believe the attack of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iraq have INCREASED terrorism and the hatred of American people by the Arab people.  This could have been resolved in a different manner.  They could have taken out Bin Laden (which they did) without attacking all these countries.  Our whole economy has been destroyed, our troops have come home (if they lived) with PTSD, and the Arab world hates us.</p>

They allowed the war to happen and have the blood of millions on their hands. The person who says he voted against the war but still continues the murder with drones is just as culpable; (I refuse to call him my President). Didn&#8217;t he say he would investigate and prosecute those war mongers, close Guantanamo and end the Afghanistan war as well, among so many other broken promises? If you see names like Rockefeller you can forget prosecution. Haven&#8217;t you herd of the new world order? It&#8217;s here thanks to garbage food pounding, diabetic, fat, lazy, TV watching Americans, who expect a handout and a free phone that hard working Patriots pay for in hidden fees from a corporation that makes billions but pays less taxes than you and I. No, things aren&#8217;t going to get better they are going to get worse.</p>

<p>Quoted from above: &#8220;(2) acting pursuant to the Constitution and Public Law 107-243 &#8230;continuing to take the necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations, including those nations, organizations, or persons who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.</p>
<p>Then the writer of this piece immediately essentially removes the word &#8220;or&#8221; and implies that the President included Iraq as an &#8220;all of the above&#8221; party.</p>
<p>Look &#8211; I have absolutely no doubts that GW Bush was itching to pound Saddam.  He continually violated the international rules set up, he threatened and tried to shoot down US and allied aircraft.  And indeed, there was SOME kind of WMD program &#8211; as now those weapons are in the hands of the dictator in Syria&#8230;</p>
<p>But regardless &#8211; GW, justified by 9/11 or otherwise, had a mess to clean up, left hanging by his own Father&#8217;s lack of backbone in the previous Iraq war.</p>
<p>And now, we have a president who wants to use drones to kills US Citizens on US soil without a trial &#8211; and we still hammering on Iraq and Bush.  How sad a life one must have to continue to live in the past.</p>
<p>We have far larger issues facing us right now &#8211; including an assault on the Constitution that makes ANY and ALL actions by the Bush administration look like a child&#8217;s game.  Lets focus on the problems at hand now.</p>

We did so without the permission of the British Government .  It also violated our treaties as a part of the O.A.S. . The U.S. had a legal standing to protect the Panama Canal an to occupy the area known as the Canal Zone. We had no legal right under U.S. or International Laws to force a change of Panama&#8217;s Government . An then after 10 years of supplying Iraq with not only conventional weapons. In Violation of proliferation treaties we supplied Iraq with Chemical &amp; Biological weapons as well the technology to make more. After we made Iraq the largest Military force in the Middle East. An months prior to the invasion of Kuwait . The U.S. Envoy to Iraq states that he relayed a message from President H. Bush. That the U.S. considered the Iraq an Kuwait dispute as a internal matter.    Who are we to tell Russia their actions are wrong ?  You must first act as a nation of laws an morality before you can condemn another.</p>

The problem we face as citizens who consider their government to have committed serious crimes is one of our image to the rest of America that isn&#8217;t aware or doesn&#8217;t care. In the same way that Greenpeace alienates the environmentalist cause from the mainstream American, adopting an extremist tone and embracing fiery rhetoric alienates the belief that our government committed serious war crimes from the mainstream American. We must make our case in a manner that leaves those who disagree with us little grounds to dismiss us as conspiracy theorists and the like. That being said, this article achieves that objective far better than most I have read!</p>

If they hadn&#8217;t killed all those poeple in the towers, that would a funny joke, as it can NEVER happen. Also,the building collaped in on itself, which is a trademark of building demolition with explosives, and the fall created apyroclastic flow, just like from a volcano but less intense.That&#8217;s why those cars were next to the twin towers melted. The heat needed to generate these flows comes only from volcanos, the space shuttle at liftoff and demolitions using military grade explosives. He should be appearing in the war trials court at the Hague. It must be nice to be rich enough to avoid the deserved consiquences of an illegal and evil act</p>
