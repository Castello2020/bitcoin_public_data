<p>David Steele is a former <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_David_Steele" target="_blank">20-year Marine Corps infantry and intelligence officer, the second-ranking civilian in U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence, and former CIA clandestine services case officer</a>.</p>
<p>Steele has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LNNW9GMEILN5/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm">previously written</a> that &#8220;9/11 was at a minimum allowed to happen as a pretext for war&#8221;.</p>
<p>This month, Steele went further, <a href="http://www.wedemandtransparency.com/steele.html">writing</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pakistan briefed Cheney [about the plans for the terrorist attacks ahead of time] …nations also got wind of this and warned the CIA. We also had two walk-ins to the FBI, one in Orlando, one in Newark, that were dismissed by the FBI because the names were all virgins and not in the FBI data base—the arrogance of stupid bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Cheney saw an opportunity for what Bush called his trifecta, and gave it to him by giving the go-ahead to ISI and Al Qaeda, and ordering up a terrorism exercise that allowed him to send all relevant close-in air defense strip alert craft away from the target areas, and to disable the NORTHCOM normal response to flight path diversion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the details might be open to debate, many other <a href="http://patriotsquestion911.com/#McGovern">very high-level intelligence officers</a> have said the &#8220;official&#8221; explanation for 9/11 makes no sense. And see <a href="http://911summary.com/intel.php">this</a> and <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/06/dick-cheney-only-had-to-delay-things.html">this</a>.</p>

It might be impossible to pin it on one guy but it&#039;s not impossible to pin it on at least an incompetent government intelligence agency and the whole emergency response system.

All you have to do is be open-minded enough to check it out. The easiest way is to google: therminte and 9/11. It&#039;s been independently proven that the high explosive thermite was used to turn the WTC buildings into dust. How would someone in the mountains in Afghanistan have access to thermite, and then get access to the WTC buildings to plant the therminte?  Further, thermite was created in 1993-4 by a company called Dresser Mining (the CEO was no less than Paul Bremer, remember him and Iraq?) and Dresser Mining later  merged with Halliburton around 1997.  And Halliburton&#039;s CEO at that time was a guy named Dick Cheney. Remember him? There is a link right there between the thermite that brought down the WTC towers and the Bush administratin. None of this is rocket-science. Just look at how the WTC buildings came down. Free-fall. Planned demolition is the only way that could happen.  There has never been a fire on the planet that has ever been capable of bringing buildings down like that, free-fall. Just open your mind and do a little research and you&#039;ll see overwhelming evidence that the Bush administration was deeply involved in 9/11. If you&#039;re not willing to do that, than you might want to  see a shrink because you are living in some very serious denial about what&#039;s real and what&#039;s fantasy&#8230;.Unquestionably, 9/11 was an inside job.</p>

What person that was an official investigator of the WTC collapse has come out in a whistleblower suit to let us know that thermite took down the building?  Where are the hundreds of contractors that would have been required to drill holes in beams, run thousands of miles of wire and place shaped charges on beams up and down the WTC?   Sure all those reqular guys who lost friends in the collapse just are shutting up.   Sometimes it is soothing for people to attribute incompetence to conspiracy.    Makes the world seem a little safer thinking that some invisible hand is behind such horror and evil.   BTW, I understand that Bremmer is only 9 steps removed from Kevin Bacon.  It&#039;s my theory that he put Kevin up to making that crappy Footloose movie.</p>

Scientists, engineers, and even POLITICIANS, not only from the US, but from all over the world, are in general agreement that the incidents of 9/11 are NOT as explained by the 9/11 Commission Report.     Bet you are all for the &#039;Cap and Trade&#039; lie, as well? After all, AlGore says global warming is true&#8230;</p>

I would rather know the truth than live my life in a delusional state of denial. If you want to see just how much evidence there is to completely dismantle the government&#039;s conspiracy theory, watch this. (It&#039;s about the Pentagon attack and there is no denying this hardcore evidence if your a rational human being). Peace and love people!</p>

If fire lead to the collapse then those buildings toppel not pancake look at the film you can see the top of the tower coming off and then it just disinigrates into nothingness. You don&#039;t have to be a tinfoil madhatter to get that things are not as we were told. Also this idea that &quot;we want these fantastic ideas to be true because it provides some type of psych-candy or ego bait is stupid&quot; No it wouldnt need hundreds of people to pull this off only access to a small team in the eleavator shaft and this is quite feasible. There is no evidense of wire, blast caps, there is photographic evidense of cut beams and nano-thermite in the dust from a peer reviewed journal. Mocking or making light of is ones psychological response to the cognitive dissonance felt by reviewing the 9/11 evidense.</p>

It&#039;s not exactly high tech stuff. A thermite reaction is any reaction of a metal powder and metal oxide. It&#039;s wasn&#039;t &quot;created in 1993-4 by a company called Dresser Mining,&quot; it was invented in 1893 and has been used ever since for welding and other applications. It&#039;s not surprising to me that you&#039;d find all sorts of stuff in the dust from two gigantic buildings, including some aluminium oxide. In fact, with all the heat in the building itself (from everything burning), you&#039;d probably get all sorts of oxides forming, releasing even more heat.</p>

It&#039;s a mixture of Iron and Aluminum and iron-oxide. It&#039;s used in the construction of Rail Ways to fuse two sections of rail together. It&#039;s really not that hard to come by, anyone with a basic education in Chemistry could whip some up. and though I haven&#039;t looked yet for the source of this comment. I&#039;m guessing that any fire that generated temperatures as high as those that were generated in the WTC, would melt metal in a way that could look like thermite. I really don&#039;t understand why people think that a jumbo jet plane crashing into a building, and then burning all of it&#039;s available jet fuel isn&#039;t enough to weaken the structure to the point of collapse and need to seek out some other reasons. While I&#039;m not convinced that Bush and his advisers didn&#039;t have anything to do with 9-11, I doubt very strongly that anyone helped the WTC towers fall. Simply crashing the planes into the buildings and the pentagon was enough pretense for the war that followed.</p>

Your complete lack of understanding basic concepts and fact checking has already made your point look like that of a child (you probably are).

First, the statement that it was invented by a company in 1993 is false. It has been known and used for the last 70 years in repairs and manufacture, esp., with railroads (as a method of quick welding tracks). It is also not especially explosive. It does burn at a high temp, but needs other explosive materials to blow up. It can be used as a fuse. The &quot;thermite residue&quot; is also bogus. The residue will be Aluminum or another highly reactive metal oxide plus elementary lesser reactive metals (such as elemental iron). These residues can be left at any high temperature fire.</p>

It&#039;s been around for ever, and is commonly used in industrial applications.It is not high explosive. Once you get it lit, it just burns really, really hot&#8211;hot enough that if you put a flower pot full of thermite on the hood of a car, the melted iron and aluminum will make a hole in the engine block of the car&#8211;but it won&#039;t blow up the flower pot.

The whole connection to thermite and Cheney is wrong.  You lose a lot of merit when you can chip away at so many other facts.  Loose Change makes the same mistake.History A thermite reaction using Iron(III) OxideThe thermite (thermit) reaction was discovered in 1893 and patented in 1895 by German chemist Hans Goldschmidt. Consequently, the reaction is sometimes called the &quot;Goldschmidt reaction&quot; or &quot;Goldschmidt process&quot;. Dr. Goldschmidt was originally interested in producing very pure metals by avoiding the use of carbon in smelting, but he soon realized the value in welding.The first commercial application was the welding of tram tracks in Essen, in 1899. Evonik, formerly Degussa, a corporate descendant of Goldschmidt&#039;s firm, is still today one of the world&#039;s largest producers of welding thermite.</p>

Plop me in a remote corner of Whereverstan and I bet I can scrounge the materials for some within a few hours.  Real exotic stuff &#8211; powdered aluminum and rust.  Oh, and it&#039;s not explosive, just reacts very fast with high heat.  The &quot;evidence&quot; for a thermite reaction?  Aluminum oxide and molten iron, pretty much what you&#039;d expect from a burning aircraft and office building.</p>

He said his brother-in-law was Osama Bin Laden.Every night my brother had to file a report on what happened that night &#8211; so he wrote down what that prisoner told him.  The following day my brother was requested by his boss for a meeting with a CIA and an NSA officer where they asked him to talk about what happened last night and for him to tell his story verbatim as it was told to him.  He was then asked who else knew &#8211; at the time no one.Then they admitted that it was true and went on to tell him that Osama Bin Laden died of natural causes.  Then they said that this info needs to be kept silent and that the &quot;War on Terror&quot; needed a face in order to generate the funding.I believe his story more than anything else &#8211; and his version of everything has an extra perspective added in &#8211; real life war.</p>

The entire security system was disabled. No keycard tracking of access for the full 48 hours. The building tenants had to shut down such things as the server room that Forbes kept there. All electricity was off. This was labeled a &quot;networking cable upgrade&quot;. That monday for the first time since the attempted bombing under Clinton the bomb sniffing dogs were removed and no longer used on 911.This is a solid fact. You can listen to any murder trial and find holes where the prosecution is off base. That is why we weight the details and use a preponderance of evidence. Dick Cheney scheduled the bizarre training that deprived us of our defense at NORAD. He also scheduled the Specific incident that had FEMA in downtown Manhatten on Monday night for a planned &quot;excerise&quot; tuesday that involved a terrorist flying a plane into a major building.This was not the responsibly of his office whatsoever until GWB specifically issued executive order making it so.These two incidents alone are interesting.  Combined with a flat refusal to testify under oath by either man and them demanding to be questioned only together is becomes something not one president has ever done under such circumstances. You by far are the odd one out ruling them innocent and therefore not assessing the evidence out of hand.</p>

WTC 6 was 8 stories high. The total height of its central debris of the crater was about 30 to 50 feet below sea level and about 120 feet wide. Eight stories of building collapses and leaves a hole at least 30 feet deep.   Light Detection and Ranging &#8211; LIDAR displays from NOAA &#8211; Dark Green = 0 to -30 feet. Another LIDAR map shows the central portion depth of WTC 6 in the range of -35 to -55 feet. Besides the crater in WTC 6, note the two craters that surround WTC 1 (perimeters are 30 feet deep and 250 to 300 feet wide) and WTC 2 (perimeters are 30 feet deep and more than 300 feet wide &#8211; some overlapping of the explosions). WTC 1 &#8211; 110 stories tall &#8211; debris pile 6 stories with a 30 feet crater surrounding it. WTC 2 &#8211; 110 stories tall &#8211; debris pile 6 stories high with a 30 feet crater surrounding it. WTC 3 (Marriott) &#8211; 22 stories tall &#8211; debris pile 3 stories. WTC 4 &#8211; 9 stories tall &#8211; debris pile 3 stories (the only building that is even close to its correct debris height). WTC 6 &#8211; 8 stories tall &#8211; debris pile MINUS 3 stories. WTC 7 &#8211; 47 stories tall &#8211; debris pile 7 stories. The New York times has a crude interactive map placing the crater depth at -30 feet. According to the official story, beams from WTC 1 collapsed the building. However, the collapse did not make a debris pile. It made a debris hole. (BTW, no supposed unspecified vague ‘scalar’ weapon can make these massive craters beneath intact debris.)</p>

Really? Fire does not does not cause a sudden collapse of steel. The mass below the portion of the building that is damaged needs to be moved out of the way for the entire &quot;collapsing mass&quot; of the building to fall at the rate of gravity. Anyone who has ever had a decent study of classical physics knows this. And anyone with half a brain that watches WT7 come down knows that fire had nothing to do with it.Now the question is, if WT7 was rigged for demolition, is it so wild to believe that the other two towers were as well? Also consider the twin tower buildings were only holding 10% of their full capacity load, meaning that an instant collapse of steel (which at the temperature of a hydrocarbon fueled fire, that we see in both buildings hit by planes, could simply not occur) at the locations that the planes hit at would most certainly not cause the onset of collapse into its own footprint. It was designed to be able to support 9 times what it was supporting to begin with! Is it safer for you to believe that this is a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; and not a scientific argument than to accept the possibility that this event could have happened differently than was presented to the public?Such nano-thermite Dr. Jones and see the peer reviewed evidence.Look at the scientific evidence presented and it is a one sided argument&#8230;.<a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ae911truth.org/</a></p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3473" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>When we lift the veil and confront our demons we will rise up on wings of eagles and see the evil done in our name. We have only to look under the rug and open the closet to our inner self to reveal the shadow.  The 911 conspiracy theory that the government proposes and promotes to the world is false; it is not supported by the facts or the evidence, plain and simple. The Conspiracy Truth that is supported by the facts and the evidence is quit clear when one takes responsibility for the information and does their own research. 911 was a false flag operation, a Psy/Op, perpetrated on the American people involving numerous people, including but not limited to Osama Bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network, and orchestrated and directed by our intelligence apparatus, therefore a conspiracy at the highest level of our government and our intelligence services. The evidence shows beyond a reasonable doubt that the government’s simple conspiracy theory is not supported by facts or the evidence. The only way this operation could have been carried out was with the knowledge and support of rough elements within our intelligence services and with the complicity of our political establishment. False flag operations are nothing new in the world and go back literally to the dawn of civilization. The 911 incident was a classic example of a false flag operation, an orchestrated Psychological/Operation, very similar to others in our more recent collective experience. The Kennedy Assassination is a perfect example. When one takes the Governments line, at face value, and accepts the lone gunman theory, not a conspiracy, then from the start, one has already thrown out multiple possible conspiracy theories. If a conspiracy theory is proposed, with little support of the facts, then it is a conspiracy theory and nothing more. If on the other hand the overwhelming evidence shows a conspiracy was involved then it is about uncovering the known facts and uncovering the conspiracy truth. Deception is never easy to accept. It hurts when we uncover something hidden and many times we are unable to face the truth. It speaks to the shadow side of our experience. All of us have our shadow side on an individual and a collective basis. We wear a mask in public and many times it is the person we project to the world. Both are a true aspect of our character. Our shadow side is one side of our polarity, the ying and the yang is the other side of who we are. Many times we fail to face our shadow side and it stays hidden, not only from the public but more importantly from ourselves. We do this individually and collectively. When we fail to confront our collective shadow we fail all of humanity.This same reality works on a micro and a MACRO level. The 911 conspiracy, both the false story and the truth speaks to our collective shadow. When one is confronted with the 911 conspiracy and does their own research, it can act as a trigger to face the shadow within, both on an individual and collective basis. Many fail to see the deception because they are not ready to look within and confront the shadow side of their personality and experience. The 911 Psy/Op can be the triggering event to awaken us from a very bad situation, i.e. a criminal group with an agenda to take over the world through the manipulation of our American system. I would suggest, as tough as it may be, to do your own research and come to your own conclusions. Don’t allow your fear to hold you back from the truth and keep you from facing what is really taking place in the world. We either wake up now or in a short while it may be too late………  Robert Reckmeyer</p>

I also witnessed Atta and company ask for a copy of &quot;The Anarchist&#039;s Cookbook&quot; from a bookstore that had just won a landmark case forbidding government trolling in bookstore records. (the &quot;Anarchists Cookbook&quot; was bomb making for giggly teen boys, much too unsophisticated for those guys-they were high tech) That receipt was reported to be in Atta&#039;s &quot;lost&quot; luggage and was presumably used to help pass the Patriot Act that (guess what?) lets the government troll in bookstore and library records. Do you think that a bunch of Saudi &quot;terrorists&quot; care about whether we pass the Patriot Act? That was a smug, arrogant act. Our leaders are kissy-kissy with the Saudis since the Saudis linked the dollar to oil, keeping it up when it should be down. We are horribly entwined in the Middle East. Bin Laudin and Atta money came through Dubai and we were denied access to records? Our defense contractors funnel funds through Dubai. Cheney&#039;s Halliburton is now a Dubai company. Remember the big deal about the Dubai Ports and all the lost airline luggage? That is because I approached Congress and the media the day before with all this and they did their usual smoke screen. The Dubai Ports deal was a tiny footnote. Last I heard, they still have the ports. Elizabeth Vargus looked like a deer in the headlights reporting this nonsense. Of course, 911 was an inside job. Unless you do controlled demolition, a building doesn&#039;t come down in it&#039;s tracks. Duh. Absolutely everybody knows all this. Nothing I have said is a secret. Even Alan Greenspan said that Iraq was about oil. No big glory story about fighting terrorists. No WMD. We have spy satellites that can read the newspaper in your hands. Do you think we wouldn&#039;t have known what, where, why and who? Afganistan was originally a potential pipeline for oil from the other &#039;stans. Georgia is a potential staging area for a move against Iran. It is all about peak oil. The stuff is running out. But, dumb Americans will believe anything&#8230; until they don&#039;t. Disinfo agents need to remember the lessons of WWII. Following orders is ultimately no excuse. Torture investigation is only the beginning.</p>

Iron spheres means molten iron, which contradicts the reports saying fires weren&#039;t hot enough.Unburned grains of iron oxide and aluminium can not be formed by fires involving building materials.  I mean think about it, the counter claim there is that aluminium facade and steel girders somehow combined in the fire to create layered grains of un-burned combustible material.  Complete gap in logic but I have seen that argument in more than one place.</p>

The question for me is, despite the causes, &quot;why is our government so unwilling to do anything to investigate in a serious way?&quot;  Are we the people and our wants so insignificant to the powers that be that they wont even listen to us?  Who is holding the reigns here? All that should be required for the investigation to go further is enough public support.  And yet even in the face of screaming crowds the government does nothing. The real tragedy of 9/11 for me is the undeniable proof that our government never cared for us.  It was only ever a veil of supposed interest that was lifted that day.</p>

The substance found (in surprisingly large quantities) in the Twin Towers dust was very special indeed. It was nothing like regular thermite in appearance; the aluminum/iron oxide grains were too small to be resolved with optical microscopes. The chemical composition was first identified by spectroscopy, and then the grain structure and size confirmed by electron microscope. This was an experimental compound in 2001, first mentioned in scientific literature only three or four years previously, and not commercially available even today. It is not something you can mix up in the kitchen, it requires advanced manufacturing techniques even to produce the grains. There are only a few facilities in the world with the capability, and they are all government operations or military contractors. If it became known who they are and in what countries they are located&#8230; Ah, but that would be telling.I&#039;m not a &quot;truther&quot;, I&#039;m a scientist. I like to understand things. When an explanation is offered that doesn&#039;t agree with the observed facts, I question it. When the authority offering the explanation ignores or denies the observed facts, I cry foul. When a bunch of religious maniacs (for that is what they appear to be) appears on the scene to shout down every attempt to investigate further, I&#039;m reminded of Galileo and the Inquisition and, uh, which of them turned out to be right.</p>

The best you can do is to use critical judgment based on available facts, and come to your own conclusion.But those who think any conspiracy would require hundreds of &quot;insiders,&quot; consider this possibility:After the 1993 bombing, someone responsible for security realizes that if another bombing were to take place, it might be neccesary to have a controlled demolition of either building to save lives. If the buildings were damaged enough, a non-controlled breakup would surely be far more deadly and damaging then a controlled demolition.So, with complete loyalty to the nation, a team  secretly installs demolition charges. They know they must keep the secret to prevent frightening people.After the airliners strike, someone decides at some point ( with prodding from higher authority ) that the buildings must &quot;be pulled,&quot; lest even more people die.The best secret is the one that is done in the name of national security. If there was a domestic conspiracy, most active participants did things in the belief that they were working on behalf of the nation, and will keep the secret out of patriotism. Only a few people in charge need understand the &quot;true&quot; goal.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3500" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Various parties can argue all day long about whether the towers were brought down by demolition or by those nasty terrorists.  Visual proof is the key.There is a great video production that analyzes footage, in slow motion, and draws attention not to the obvious and dramatic destruction up at the top of the towers as the collapses start, but at mid and lower sections.  Small explosive bursts can be seen well before the towers each start their rapid collapse.  These are &quot;squibs&quot; &#8211; explosive charges used in common building demolitions that weaken or break key points in a building so it will fall as designed.  The video goes on to examine girders lying in the debris piles which clearly show the angular cut marks made by the squibs and demolition prep.  It also explains that during the year preceding the attacks, whole business offices in the towers were repeatedly forced to move by the Port Authority and sections of the building were cordoned off for months.  Office workers reported hearing much construction work but never saw contractors come and go.  And at that time, building occupancy was down, which made it easier to move company offices around.That video production is currently unavailable because of a &quot;copyright dispute&quot; (highly doubtful) but if anyone wants to follow up, go to the distributor&#039;s website, Avatar Products, and enter &quot;911 Mysteries&quot; in the search window.  Supposedly a new, updated production is in the works.  (Let&#039;s hope so.)  As far as motive:  We can go back to the first tower attack in 1993, with the huge explosion in the basement.  If I recall correctly, once the terrorist was arrested, his stated intent was to bring down the building, to destabilize and cause it to fall across several city blocks.  The damage to the building and the deaths of the people inside would have been bad enough, but the destruction wrought on neighboring businesses and the public on the street would have been equally horrific.  Consider that the Port Authority also became concerned about this possibility in the future.  Let us also consider that, quite aside from any foreknowledge of 9/11, the PA decided to rig the buildings, quietly and secretly, in the event of a future attack, such that if necessary the buildings could be brought down in as small a footprint as possible.  Note that after the attacks, the Port Authority would not surrender the blueprints for the buildings unless they were indemnified (given immunity) against lawsuit.  Note also that other WTC building were similarly rigged with such preparation and that Building 7 came down perfectly with relatively minor secondary fires and NO terrorist attack.And so, the day comes of the attacks.  Being pre-rigged facilitated a beautiful opportunity when the time came.  The buildings were not rigged specifically for 9/11.  It would take too much time to do this on short notice.  But they WERE rigged for the most mundane of business reasons &#8211; to protect the Port Authority in case of massive lawsuits due to future building destruction  by terrorists.  There were also insurance issues to consider.   The loss of WTC 1 and 2 represented a confluence of perfect opportunity and provided the impetus for a war to seize Iraq&#039;s oil assets that was nearly 20 years in planning by neo-cons, defense industry cronies, and corporate oil.  Let us not forget that the Bush Admin cheekily and flagrantly termed the first stage of the Iraq war &quot;Operation Iraqi Liberation&quot; &#8211; OIL.  The promulgators of this war are still laughing all the way to the bank.  Anyone who is blinded by patriotism has failed in their responsibility as an American to see this for what it is.  Wars are sold to the masses on ideology, but are always economic.  The working and middle classes unwittingly surrender the lives of their sons and daughters to serve the lies and deceit of the uber wealthy.  Just follow the money.  That&#039;s what brought down the towers.</p>
