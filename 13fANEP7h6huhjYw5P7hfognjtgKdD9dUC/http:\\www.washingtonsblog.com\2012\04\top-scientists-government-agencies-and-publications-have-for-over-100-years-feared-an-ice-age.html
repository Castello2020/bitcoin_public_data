<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Fear of the Big Freeze<br />
</h3>
<p>There has been an intense debate among leading scientists, government agencies and publications  over whether the bigger threat is global warming or a new ice age.     As we&#8217;ve previously <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/12/scientists-considered-pouring-soot-over-the-arctic-in-the-1970s-to-help-melt-the-ice-in-order-to-prevent-another-ice-age.html">noted</a>,  top researchers have feared an ice age &#8211; off and on &#8211; for more than 100 years. (This post does not weigh in one way or the other.  It merely presents a historical record.)</p>
<p>On February 24, 1895, the New York Times published an <a title="article" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F02E1D8163CE433A25757C2A9649C94649ED7CF" target="_blank">article</a>   entitled “PROSPECTS OF ANOTHER GLACIAL PERIOD; Geologists Think the   World May Be Frozen Up Again”, which starts with the following   paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>The question is again being discussed   whether recent and long-continued observations do not point to the   advent of a second glacial period, when the countries now basking in the   fostering warmth of a tropical sun will ultimately give way to the   perennial frost and snow of the polar regions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In September 1958, Harper’s wrote an <a title="article" href="http://www.harpers.org/archive/1958/09/0008810" target="_blank">article</a> called “The Coming Ice Age”.</p>
<p>On January 11, 1970, the Washington Post wrote an <a title="article" href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/157892192.html?dids=157892192:157892192&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=JAN+11%2C+1970&amp;author=Washington+Post+Staff+WriterBy+David+R.+Boldt&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=Colder+Winters+Held+Dawn+of+New+Ice+Age&amp;pqatl=google" target="_blank">article</a> entitled “Colder Winters Held Dawn of New Ice Age – Scientists See Ice Age In the Future” which stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Get   a good grip on your long johns, cold weather haters–the worst may be   yet to come. That’s the long-long-range weather forecast being given out   by “climatologists.” the people who study very long-term world weather   trends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1972, two scientists – George J. Kukla  (of  the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory) and R. K. Matthews   (Chairman, Dept of Geological Sciences, Brown University) – wrote the   following <a title="letter" href="http://www.roubini.com/us-monitor/257861/an_important_letter_sent_to_the_president_about_the_danger_of_climate_change" target="_blank">letter</a> to President Nixon warning of the possibility of a new ice age:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>Aware   of your deep concern with the future of the world, we feel obliged to   inform you on the results of the scientific conference held here   recently. The conference dealt with the past and future changes of   climate and was attended by 42 top American and European investigators.   We enclose the summary report published in <em>Science</em> and further publications are forthcoming in <em>Quaternary Research</em>.</p>
<p>The   main conclusion of the meeting was that a global deterioration of   climate, by order of magnitude larger than any hitherto experience by   civilized mankind, is a very real possibility and indeed may be due very   soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The cooling has natural cause and   falls within the rank of processes which produced the last ice age.  This  is a surprising result based largely on recent studies of deep sea   sediments.</p>
<p>Existing data still do not allow forecast of the   precise timing of the predicted development, nor the assessment of the   man’s interference with the natural trends. It could not be excluded   however that the cooling now under way in the Northern Hemisphere is the   start of the expected shift. The present rate of the cooling seems  fast  enough to bring glacial temperatures in about a century, if  continuing  at the present pace.</p>
<p>The practical consequences which might be brought by such developments to existing social institution are among others:</p>
<p>(1)   Substantially lowered food production due to the shorter growing   seasons and changed rain distribution in the main grain producing belts   of the world, with Eastern Europe and Central Asia to be first  affected.</p>
<p>(2)  Increased frequency and amplitude of extreme  weather anomalies such as  those bringing floods, snowstorms, killing  frosts, etc.</p>
<p>With the efficient help of the world leaders, the research …</p>
<p>With best regards,</p>
<p>George J. Kukla (Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory)</p>
<p>R. K. Matthews (Chairman, Dept of Geological Sciences, Brown U)</p>

<p>The   White House assigned the task of looking at the claims contained in  the  letter to its science agencies, especially the National Science   Foundation and NOAA, who engaged in a <a title="flurry of activity" href="http://www.meteohistory.org/2004polling_preprints/docs/abstracts/reeves&amp;etal_abstract.pdf" target="_blank">flurry of activity</a> looking into the threat of an ice age.</p>
<p>On August 1, 1974 the White House wrote a <a title="letter" href="http://www.meteohistory.org/2004polling_preprints/docs/abstracts/reeves&amp;etal_abstract.pdf" target="_blank">letter</a> to Secretary of Commerce Frederick Dent stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Changes   in climate in recent years have resulted in unanticipated impacts on   key national programs and policies. Concern has been expressed that   recent changes may presage others. In order to assess the problem and to   determine what concerted action ought to be undertaken, I have decided   to establish a subcommittee on Climate Change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Out of this concern, the U.S. government started monitoring climate.</p>
<p>As NOAA scientists Robert W. Reeves, Daphne Gemmill, Robert E. Livezey, and James Laver <a title="point out" href="http://www.meteohistory.org/2004polling_preprints/docs/abstracts/reeves&amp;etal_abstract.pdf" target="_blank">point out</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There   were also a number of short-term climate events of national and   international consequence in the early 1970s that commanded a certain   level of attention in Washington. Many of them were linked to the El   Niño of 1972-1973.</p>
<blockquote><p>A killing winter freeze followed by   a severe summer heat wave and drought produced a 12 percent shortfall   in Russian grain production in 1972. The Soviet decision to offset the   losses by purchase abroad reduced world grain reserves and helped drive   up food prices.Collapse of the Peruvian anchovy harvest in late 1972  and  early 1973, related to fluctuations in the Pacific ocean currents  and  atmospheric circulation, impacted world supplies of fertilizer, the   soybean market, and prices of all other protein feedstocks.</p>
<p>The   anomalously low precipitation in the U.S. Pacific north-west during the   winter of 1972-73 depleted reservoir storage by an amount equivalent  to  more than 7 percent of the electric energy requirements for the  region.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>On June 24, 1974, Time Magazine wrote an <a title="article" href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944914,00.html" target="_blank">article</a> entitled “Another Ice Age?” which stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>As   they review the bizarre and unpredictable weather pattern of the past   several years, a growing number of scientists are beginning to suspect   that many seemingly contradictory meteorological fluctuations are   actually part of a global climatic upheaval. However widely the weather   varies from place to place and time to time, when meteorologists take  an  average of temperatures around the globe they find that the  atmosphere  has been growing gradually cooler for the past three  decades. The trend  shows no indication of reversing. Climatological  Cassandras are becoming  increasingly apprehensive, for the weather  aberrations they are  studying may be the harbinger of another ice age.</p>
<p>Telltale signs are everywhere …</p>
<p>Whatever   the cause of the cooling trend, its effects could be extremely  serious,  if not catastrophic. Scientists figure that only a 1% decrease  in the  amount of sunlight hitting the earth’s surface could tip the  climatic  balance, and cool the planet enough to send it sliding down  the road to  another ice age within only a few hundred years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(here’s the <a title="printer-friendly" href="http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,944914,00.html" target="_blank">printer-friendly</a> version).</p>
<p>Science News wrote an <a title="article" href="http://www.sciencenews.org/view/access/id/37739/file/SN1975_Climate_change_chilling_possibilities.pdf" target="_blank">article</a> in 1975 called “Chilling Possibilities” warning of a new ice age.</p>
<p>A January 1975 <a title="article" href="http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/iceage/ny-times-1975-01-19.pdf" target="_blank">article</a> from the New York Times warned:</p>
<blockquote><p>The   most drastic potential change considered in the new report (by the   National Academy of Sciences) is an abrupt end to the present   interglacial period of relative warmth that has governed the planet’s   climate for the past 10,000 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On April 28, 1975, Newsweek wrote an article stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Climatologists  are pessimistic that political leaders will take any positive action to  compensate for the climatic change, or even to allay its effects. They  concede that some of the more spectacular solutions proposed, such as  melting the Arctic ice cap by covering it with black soot or diverting  arctic rivers, might create problems far greater than those they solve.  But the scientists see few signs that government leaders anywhere are  even prepared to take the simple measures of stockpiling food or of  introducing the variables of climatic uncertainty into economic  projections of future food supplies. The longer the planners delay, the  more difficult will they find it to cope with climatic change once the  results become grim reality.</p>

<p><a title="Here" href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2006/apr/02/20060402-112828-5298r/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a reprint of the article in the Washington Times, and <a title="here" href="http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/iceage/newsweek-coolingworld.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> is a copy of the 1975 Newsweek article.</p>
<p>Newsweek <a title="discussed" href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/72481" target="_blank">discussed</a> its 1975 article in 2006:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>In  April, 1975 … NEWSWEEK published a small back-page article about a very  different kind of disaster. Citing “ominous signs that the earth’s  weather patterns have begun to change dramatically,” the magazine warned  of an impending “drastic decline in food production.” Political  disruptions stemming from food shortages could affect “just about every  nation on earth.” Scientists urged governments to consider emergency  action to head off the terrible threat of . . . well, if you had been  following the climate-change debates at the time, you’d have known that  the threat was: global cooling…</p>
<p>Citizens can judge for themselves  what constitutes a prudent response-which, indeed, is what occurred 30  years ago. All in all, it’s probably just as well that society elected  not to follow one of the possible solutions mentioned in the NEWSWEEK  article: to pour soot over the Arctic ice cap, to help it melt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New York Times science columnist John Tierney <a title="noted" href="http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/29/dr-holdrens-ice-age-tidal-wave/?apage=2" target="_blank">noted</a> in 2009:</p>
<blockquote><p>In   1971, long before Dr. Holdren came President Obama’s science adviser,   in an essay [titled] “Overpopulation and the Potential for Ecocide,”  Dr.  Holdren and his co-author, the ecologist Paul Ehrlich, <a title="warned of a coming ice age" href="http://www.zombietime.com/zomblog/?p=873" target="_blank">warned of a coming ice age</a>.</p>
<p>They   certainly weren’t the only scientists in the 1970s to warn of a coming   ice age, but I can’t think of any others who were so creative in their   catastrophizing. Although they noted that the greenhouse effect from   rising emissions of carbon dioxide emissions could cause future warming   of the planet, they concluded from the mid-century cooling trend that   the consequences of human activities (like industrial soot, dust from   farms, jet exhaust, urbanization and deforestation) were more likely to   first cause an ice age. Dr. Holdren and Dr. Ehrlich wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The   effects of a new ice age on agriculture and the supportability of  large  human populations scarcely need elaboration here. Even more  dramatic  results are possible, however; for instance, a sudden outward  slumping  in the Antarctic ice cap, induced by added weight, could  generate a  tidal wave of proportions unprecedented in recorded history.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>A May 21, 1975 <a title="article" href="http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/iceage/ny-times-1975-05-21.pdf" target="_blank">article</a> in the New York Times again stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sooner or later a major cooling of the climate is widely considered inevitable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The American Institute of Physics – the organization mentioned in the Boston Globe article – <a target="_blank" title="provides" href="http://www.aip.org/history/climate/RainMake.htm">notes</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>For a few years in the early 1970s, new evidence and   arguments led many scientists to suspect that the greatest climate risk   was not warming, but cooling. A new ice age seemed to be approaching  as  part of the natural glacial cycle, perhaps hastened by human  pollution  that blocked sunlight. Technological optimists suggested ways  to counter  this threat too. We might spread soot from cargo aircraft  to darken the  Arctic snows, or even shatter the Arctic ice pack with  <strong>“clean”  thermonuclear explosion</strong>s.
<p align="justify">***</p>
<p align="justify"> The bitter fighting among communities over  cloud-seeding  would be as nothing compared with conflicts over attempts  to engineer  global climate. Moreover, as Budyko and Western scientists  alike warned,  scientists could not predict the consequences of such  engineering  efforts. We might forestall global warming only to find we  had triggered  a new ice age. </p>

<p>A 1994 Time article entitled “The Ice Age Cometh?” <a title="stated" href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,980050,00.html" target="_blank">stated</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>What  ever happened to global warming? Scientists have issued apocalyptic  warnings for years, claiming that gases from cars, power plants and  factories are creating a greenhouse effect that will boost the  temperature dangerously over the next 75 years or so. But if last week  is any indication of winters to come, it might be more to the point to  start worrying about the next Ice Age instead. After all, human-induced  warming is still largely theoretical, while ice ages are an established  part of the planet’s history. The last one ended about 10,000 years ago;  the next one — for there will be a next one — could start tens of  thousands of years from now. Or tens of years. Or it may have already  started.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Register <a target="_blank" title="notes" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/06/14/ice_age/">reported</a> last year:
</p>
<blockquote><p>What  may be the science story of the century is breaking  this  evening, as  heavyweight US solar physicists announce that the  Sun  appears to be  headed into a lengthy spell of low activity, which  could  mean that the  Earth – far from facing a global warming problem –  is  actually headed  into a mini Ice Age.</p>

</p></div>
<p>The  announcement made on 14 June (18:00 UK time) comes from   scientists at  the US National Solar Observatory (NSO) and US Air Force   Research  Laboratory. Three different analyses of the Sun’s recent   behaviour all  indicate that a period of unusually low solar activity  may  be about to  begin.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>This could have major implications for the Earth’s climate. According to a statement issued by the NSO, announcing the research:</p>
<blockquote><p>An  immediate question is whether this slowdown presages a   second Maunder  Minimum, a 70-year period with virtually no sunspots   [which occurred]  during 1645-1715.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As NASA <a title="notes" target="_blank" href="http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/SunspotCycle.shtml">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Early  records of sunspots indicate that the Sun went  through  a period of  inactivity in the late 17th century. Very few  sunspots were  seen on the  Sun from about 1645 to 1715. Although the  observations were  not as  extensive as in later years, the Sun was in  fact well observed  during  this time and this lack of sunspots is well  documented. This  period of  solar inactivity also corresponds to a  climatic period called  the  “Little Ice Age” when rivers that are  normally ice-free froze and  snow  fields remained year-round at lower  altitudes. There is evidence  that  the Sun has had similar periods of  inactivity in the more distant  past.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During  the Maunder Minimum and for periods either side of it, many   European  rivers which are ice-free today – including the Thames –   routinely  froze over, allowing ice skating and even for armies to march   across  them in some cases.</p>
<p>“This is highly unusual and unexpected,”  says Dr Frank Hill of the   NSO. “But the fact that three completely  different views of the Sun   point in the same direction is a powerful  indicator that the sunspot   cycle may be going into hibernation.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>According to the NSO:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Penn  and Livingston observed that the average field  strength  declined about  50 gauss per year during Cycle 23 and now in  Cycle 24.  They also  observed that spot temperatures have risen exactly  as expected  for such  changes in the magnetic field. If the trend  continues, the  field  strength will drop below the 1,500 gauss  threshold and spots will   largely disappear as the magnetic field is no  longer strong enough to   overcome convective forces on the solar  surface.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In parallel with this comes research from the US Air Force’s studies  of the solar corona.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Cycle  24 started out late and slow and may not be strong enough to   create a  rush to the poles, indicating we’ll see a very weak solar   maximum in  2013, if at all. If the rush to the poles fails to complete,   this  creates a tremendous dilemma for the theorists … No one knows   what  the Sun will do in that case.”</p>
<p>According to the collective wisdom of the NSO, another Maunder Minimum may very well be on the cards.</p>
<p>“If  we are right,” summarises Hill, “this could be the last solar   maximum  we’ll see for a few decades. That would affect everything from   space  exploration to Earth’s climate.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>    The big consequences  of a major solar calm spell, however, would  be  climatic. The next few  generations of humanity might not find  themselves  trying to cope with  global warming but rather with a  significant  cooling. This could  overturn decades of received wisdom on  such things  as CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emissions, and lead to radical shifts in government policy worldwide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Agence France-Presse <a target="_blank" title="reports" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110614/ts_afp/usspacesun">reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For years, scientists have been predicting the Sun would  by around  2012 move into solar maximum, a period of intense flares and  sunspot  activity, but lately a curious calm has suggested quite the  opposite.                 </p>
<p> According to three studies released in the United States on Tuesday,   experts believe the familiar sunspot cycle may be shutting down and   heading toward a pattern of inactivity unseen since the 17th century.</p>
<p> The signs include a missing jet stream, fading spots, and slower   activity near the poles, said experts from the National Solar   Observatory and Air Force Research Laboratory.</p>
<p> “This is highly unusual and unexpected,” said Frank Hill, associate   director of the NSO’s Solar Synoptic Network, as the findings of the   three studies were presented at the annual meeting of the American   Astronomical Society’s Solar Physics Division in Las Cruces, New Mexico.</p>
<p> “But the fact that three completely different views of the Sun point  in  the same direction is a powerful indicator that the sunspot cycle  may be  going into hibernation.”</p>
<p> Solar activity tends to rise and fall every 11 years or so. The  solar  maximum and solar minimum each mark about half the interval of  the  magnetic pole reversal on the Sun, which happens every 22 years.</p>
<p> Hill said the current cycle, number 24, “may be the last normal one  for  some time and the next one, cycle 25, may not happen for some time.</p>
<p> “This is important because the solar cycle causes space weather  which  affects modern technology and may contribute to climate change,”  he told  reporters.</p>
<p> Experts are now probing whether this period of inactivity could be a   second Maunder Minimum, which was a 70-year period when hardly any   sunspots were observed between 1645-1715, a period known as the “Little   Ice Age.”</p>
<p> “If we are right, this could be the last solar maximum we’ll see for  a  few decades. That would affect everything from space exploration to   Earth’s climate,” said Hill.</p>

<p>And the Wall Street Journal <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204257504577150812451167538.html">wrote</a> in January:</p>
<blockquote><p>The   entire 10,000-year history of civilization has happened in an  unusually  warm interlude in the Earth&#8217;s recent history. Over the past  million  years, it has been as warm as this or warmer for less than 10%  of the  time, during 11 brief episodes known as interglacial periods.  [In other words, the Earth is in an ice age <em>most of the time</em>, and that the warmer "interglacial" periods are rare.] One theory  holds that agriculture and dense settlement were impossible  in the  volatile, generally dry and carbon-dioxide-starved climates of  the ice  age, when crop plants would have grown more slowly and  unpredictably  even in warmer regions.</p>
<p>This warm spell is already  11,600 years  old, and it must surely, in the normal course of things,  come to an end.  In the early 1970s, after two decades of slight  cooling, many  scientists were convinced that the moment was at hand.  They were  &#8220;increasingly apprehensive, for the weather aberrations they  are  studying may be the harbinger of another ice age,&#8221; said Time in  1974.  The &#8220;almost unanimous&#8221; view of meteorologists was that the  cooling trend  would &#8220;reduce agricultural productivity for the rest of  the century,&#8221;  and &#8220;the resulting famines could be catastrophic,&#8221; said  Newsweek in  1975.</p>
<p>Since then, of course, warmth has returned,  probably driven  at least partly by man-made carbon-dioxide emissions. A  new paper, from  universities in Cambridge, London and Florida, drew  headlines last week  for arguing that these emissions may avert the  return of the ice age.  Less noticed was the fact that the authors, by  analogy with a previous  warm spell 780,000 years ago that&#8217;s a &#8220;dead  ringer&#8221; for our own, expect  the next ice age to start &#8220;within about  1,500 years.&#8221; Hardly the day  after tomorrow.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s striking  that most interglacials begin  with an abrupt warming, peak sharply,  then begin a gradual descent into  cooler conditions before plunging  rather more rapidly toward the  freezer. The last interglacial—which  occurred 135,000 to 115,000 years  ago (named the Eemian period after a  Dutch river near which the fossils  of warmth-loving shell creatures of  that age were found)—saw  temperatures slide erratically downward by  about two degrees Celsius  between 127,000 and 120,000 years ago, before  a sharper fall began.</p>
<p>Cyclical  changes in the earth&#8217;s orbit  probably weakened sunlight in the northern  hemisphere summer and thus  caused this slow cooling. Since the northern  hemisphere is mostly land,  this change in the sun&#8217;s strength meant  gradually increased snow and  ice cover, which in turn reflected light  back into space. This would  have further cooled the air and, gradually,  the ocean too.  Carbon-dioxide levels did not begin to fall much until  about 112,000  years ago, as the cooling sea absorbed more of the gas.</p>
<p>Our   current interglacial shows a similar pattern. Greenland ice cores and   other proxy records show that temperatures peaked around 7,000 years   ago, when the Arctic Ocean was several degrees warmer than today, trees   grew farther north in Siberia and the Sahara was wet enough for hippos   (Africa generally gets wetter in warm times). Data from the southern   hemisphere reveal that this &#8220;Holocene Optimum&#8221; was global in extent.</p>
<p>An   erratic decline in temperature followed, with Minoan, Roman and   Medieval warm periods peaking at successively lower temperatures,   culminating in the exceptionally cool centuries of the &#8220;Little Ice Age&#8221;   between 1550 and 1850, when glaciers advanced all over the world. In  the  Greenland ice cores, these centuries stand out as the longest and  most  consistent cold spell of the current interglacial.</p>
<p>In other  words,  our own interglacial period has followed previous ones in having  an  abrupt beginning and a sharp peak, followed by slow cooling. The   question is whether recent warming is a temporary blip before the   expected drift into glacial conditions, or whether humankind&#8217;s impact on   the atmosphere has now reversed the cooling trend.</p>

The facts stated in the post are accurate and have been taken in the correct context. I know. I have worked in the solar and space physics fields for over 20 years.

The latest research that I have read (March 2012) clearly indicates a continued reduction in the solar magnetic field strengths, which again supports a weaker solar maximum. That isn&#8217;t nonsense. That is fact. Tying this activity to possible ice ages has not been conclusively proven, so perhaps that is what you are considering &#8220;nonsense?&#8221; If so, I think that is a harsh word, given all that we know concerning how global climate can be affected by quiet solar conditions and changes in irradiance.

<p>One factor seldom mentioned is that when China stops spewing particulate pollution into the air, the cooling caused by global dimming will cease &#8211; and global warming will take off much faster &#8211; even with the small amount of reduced dimming that happened when planes were grounded after 911 had an effect on temperature. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkJUJ5-PL-0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkJUJ5-PL-0</a></p>
<p>Why might China stop spewing pollution &#8211; peak oil, coming peak coal.  Things that are finite can run out.  Unfortunately oil and coal will not run out soon enough to make our world much warmer.</p>

Then Henry&#8217;s friend, Rudolph Diesel meant his first car to run on hemp based vegetable oil&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;so just who do you suppose strongly suggested ($) they use oil?<br />
water car?  air car?  magnet run engines?  but will they get a chance?</p>

The professional global warming deniers have succeeded in convincing otherwise intelligent people that there is any question about global warming.  Funded by the oil companies and trained by the propagandists used by the Tobacco Industry they have created doubt about the MOST serious threat facing our species.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the glaciers keep melting &#8211; perhaps from the hot air put out by deniers.   I expect the fact that 15,000 heat records were broken in March in the US is bringing out the denialists in a desperate effort to keep the doubt going.</p>

A relative of mine who is at least as intelligent as myself (and attended the same university!)  has deliberately turned off his brain on important issues like climate change when the use of that organ refutes  the belief system he wants to embrace.   Another college-educated relative (also in the deep south) has successfully erased any evidence of having ever learned a speck of biology or history.   In her case, whatever the preacher at her church is currently saying is the plain and simple truth.   In the event that holy person turned on a dime and said the exact opposite of what he did last week, she&#8217;d not even blink when she followed the new line.   </p>
<p>I gave up on discussion with these types quite a while back &#8211; they are simply immune to any reality besides the one they&#8217;ve made for themselves out of thin air.    A person can&#8217;t expect &#8220;evidence&#8221; and &#8220;logic&#8221; to have any influence with these poor folks when they are &#8211; in real time &#8211; denying the inputs from their own eyes and ears.</p>

The CO2 ruining the planet is aimed at a global tax enslaving the masses and establishing a global rule.  ugh<br />
What is killing the planet is of course the BP explosion, Obama not allowing the tankers from foreign countries to clean up early in the game, the criminal millions of gallons of Corexit (banned in the U.K. for 30+ years) etc. etc. etc.  totally disgusting!   and there is this-<br />
Since the 1980s, weather warfare took a leap.  H.A.A.R.P. (see Nick Begich), scalar weapons, chemtrails or &#8216;persistent contrails&#8217; (military chaff) are drastically controlling weather patterns and intensifying &#8216;tornado&#8217; or what in reality are inland hurricanes, flooding or drought etc.<br />

dutchsinse predicted the Joplin MO, inland hurricanes, shows the radar and the HAARP circle returns and scalar lines for your own eyes to see.  China doesn&#8217;t hide their weather manipulation, their people cannot bark about it.  They blew it and made it snow so heavy there were many deaths some years ago.  Check out Paul McCartney clearing the area from clouds for his concert years ago&#8230; Russia blames us for their drought, Haiti is another issue&#8230;&#8230;..The radiation from Fukushima is 200 times higher than EPA levels allow, and it&#8217;s getting worse.

<p>NOAA is still monitoring global warming induced climate change: </p>
<blockquote><p>
The temperature analysis released by the U.S. government each month usually isn’t all that riveting, but the one that came out Monday is a doozy — and not just for weather wonks. Highlights for the contiguous U.S. (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) include:</p>
<blockquote><p>
*Last month was the warmest March on record (records go back to 1895) at 51.1 degrees; this is 8.6 degrees above the 20th century average, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
<p>*January-March was the warmest first quarter on record; the average temperature of 42 degrees was 6 degrees above average.</p>
<p>*April 2011-March 2012 was the warmest stretch of those 12 months on record; at 55.4 degrees, that period was 2.6 degrees above average.</p>
<p>*In March, 15,292 records were broken for warmth; 7,775 were new daytime highs in cities across the country and 7,517 were new nighttime highs.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“What is so amazing to me is that 25 states had their warmest March on record,” he told msnbc.com. “In addition, another 15 states had a top ten warmest March. Add the two numbers together and that makes a mind-boggling 40 states that had a March that was among their warmest on record.”</p></blockquote>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-39376" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>At this point, we need to look at the science.  Just Remember, lead climate scientists at NASA have come out and debunked Carbon as a global warming creator, claims&#8230; &#8220;Carbon follows temperature rise, not the other way round,&#8221; like saying, you don&#8217;t FIRST get steam, then the kettle boils&#8230; it is the other way round. </p>
<p>With more than 1000 International Scientists recent dissent over Man- Made Global Warming, asserting that man-made global warming is nothing more than data manipulation, &#8220;a lie&#8221;, when the science is taken out of the political realm and examined empirically.  Point is, not a time to be dogmatic about Global Warming.   </p>
<p>I smell a rat.  Global warming or Global cooling, as correctly pointed out in this article here, has and was used as an excuse to implement Global Tax Schemes&#8230; worth potentially trillions.  Kind of getting ridiculously obvious that the general public is being played for caring fools who want to save our beautiful earth and protect our nature.  Unfortunately, everyday, as the science shows us&#8230; Global Warming looks like a ruse with Geo Political and financial agendas attached to it.  </p>
<p>Have you ever thought Al ‘manbearpig” Gore is just a salesman?  Do you feel lied too?  Do you feel like you have been played for a caring fool who loves nature, like I do?  Well you have&#8230;</p>
<p>Conspiracy, collusion in exaggerating warming data, possibly illegal destruction of embarrassing information, organized resistance to disclosure, manipulation of data, private admissions of flaws in their public claims and much more.  You might have thought someone had mistakenly hacked into the Soprano family computer network. But no&#8230; these are the leading lights in collating scientific data for the UN IPCC.  YES&#8230;We are talking the CLIMATE GATE SCANDAL.</p>
<p>In November 2009 somebody illegally hacked into the University of East Anglia’s Climate Research Unit (CRU) in the UK, subsequently publishing 10 years of emails and documents on the Internet. However reprehensible an act of cyber-pilfering, the contents of the authenticated emails carried within them the seeds of a major science scandal; a scandal Andrew Bolt rightly sees as the “greatest in modern science”.  </p>
<p>What was particularly explosive was the unheralded insight it gave us into the scientific world of some of the leading promoters of man-made Global Warming (GW) theory.  Charges were laid, people where fired, fraud was found, data manipulation rampant.  These are the group that write the climate report for the IPCC &amp; UNITED NATIONS, and global policies are based around.</p>
<p>You’d have to have a non-melting ice-cap for a heart not to laugh.  The following did make me laugh in a worldly sort of chuckle: </p>
<p>&#8220;New research from the Arctic’s Bering Sea also found that ice is thickening to ALL-TIME RECORD HIGH LEVELS.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The amount of floating ice in the Arctic’s Bering Sea – which had long been expected to retreat disastrously by climate-Cassandra organisations such as Greenpeace – reached all-time record high levels last month, according to US researchers monitoring the area using satellites,” reports the Register.</p>
<p>The article points to a 1999 Greenpeace prediction that sea ice in the area “could vanish altogether,” another piece of alarmist propaganda debunked by reality.</p>
<p>Despite a multitude of data that continually serves to eviscerate the pseudo-science behind man-made global warming, illustrating again that the earth has gone through natural warming and cooling cycles since its very genesis, climate change snake oil salesmen like NASA’s James Hansen, who this week will call for a global tax on CO2 emissions, continue to ignore real science in pursuit of their political agenda to exploit heartfelt environmental concerns for profit and power.&#8221;</p>
<p>No matter how hard we try to ignore it or deny it, eventually the lies fall away. Whether we like it or not. But here&#8217;s the truth about the truth.  We are being played for fools&#8230;. played for caring fools.  The worst thing about being lied to is knowing you&#8217;re not worth the truth.  </p>
<p>Well, I am at the point, as Friedrich Nietzsche says, &#8220;I&#8217;m not upset that you lied to me, I&#8217;m upset that from now on I can&#8217;t believe you&#8230;.”  Say hi to the globalist&#8217;s for me Al Gore, next time you are at a Bilderberg meeting.</p>

<p>What is most important to keep in mind is that one side is pursuing science; the other is defending profits using a script perfected by the heirs of Eduard Bernays for tobacco, asbestos, creationism, and other industries that manufacture public harm on a massive scale.  This denial industry is a cost of doing business for companies that make rather substantial profits under present conditions, and finds it worthwhile to fund the US Chamber of Commerce, Heartland Institute, and a multitude of think tanks, lobbyists, PR firms, media companies and celebretard spokesmodels because they can do so and still profit obscenely.<br />
The global cooling myth is popular because it uses a smidgen of truth to catapult the propaganda-the sun does produce heat at levels that have varied over time that is a substantial input to the climate system-then sells the lie that CO2 and other parts of the climate system are inconsequential.</p>

<p>Where: </p>
<p>&#8220;<b>x</b>&#8221; is Earth&#8217;s warming / cooling value (&#8217;0&#8242; is preferred, stable value)<br />
&#8220;<b>y</b>&#8221; is incoming solar energy (which becomes heat)<br />
&#8220;<b>z</b>&#8221; is the Earth&#8217;s retention factor (how much solar induced heat escapes as heat radiation)</p>
<p>As &#8220;y&#8221; fluctuates there is a natural impact on the warming / cooling of the Earth (&#8220;x&#8221;).<br />
As &#8220;z&#8221; fluctuates, likewise there is a natural impact on the warming / cooling of the Earth (&#8220;x&#8221;).</p>
<p>Since the Sun&#8217;s ~11 year cycles have never caused catastrophic warming or cooling (&#8220;x&#8221;), then the relation between &#8220;x&#8221; and &#8220;z&#8221; is the factor we focus on.</p>
<p>That is, the radiation of heat into space (&#8220;z&#8221;) must equal the incoming solar &#8220;heat&#8221; (&#8220;y&#8221;) to keep &#8220;x&#8221; at the perfect zero value (neither cooling nor warming).</p>
<p>The global warming science focuses on what affect human endeavors have on &#8220;z&#8221;.</p>
<p>The dumping of gases into the atmosphere (&#8220;d&#8221;), which hamper heat radiating into space in the manner &#8220;z-d&#8221;, cause x to go out of balance.</p>
<p>These gases, like CO2, methane, etc., prevent the Earth&#8217;s heat from being radiated into space, and therefore &#8220;x&#8221; is no longer the balanced value of &#8220;0&#8243;, it begins to increase.</p>
<p>That warming causes more green-house gases to be released from the various heat sinks, ocean, forests, land, etc., and a runaway factor begins.</p>

You are failing democracy by simply walking away from your duty to explain to us why the statistics used to make policy are not correct, inappropriately applied, or otherwise flawed.  Just walking away is the weak response that tyrants rely on to take over democracies.  Do your duty to your country and explain why the satellites are wrong, why the tree rings are wrong, why the glacier cores are wrong, and why the government would benefit from misrepresenting these numbers.<br />
The changes are already occurring in the Arctic and the government is already making plans for adjustment to a new climate regime-DOD has been studying the problem for decades and other agencies in the executive branch are studying the phenomenon.  If reality and democracy are too hard for you perhaps you are better off staying on the couch and sending your deeply considered opinions to the Yahoo message boards.</p>

<p>But Global Warming aside here is something that really should concern everyone. Right now, today we live with a higher level of CO2, nearly double, than any time in Homo Sapiens existence on this planet and anyone who tells you they know for sure it won&#8217;t harm humans or cause mutations is lying to your face &#8230; We don&#8217;t know because we have no record of it and all testing with CO2 is done on a scale of minutes and hours, not years and entire lifetimes of exposure</p>

<p>&#8220;On December 15, 2009, Richard K. Moore sent a message to subscribers to his mailing list entitled global warming — The official NOAA ice core data. &#8221;</p>
<p>Who is Richard K. Moore?    </p>
<p>About the author:  Richard Moore &#8211;  Wexford, Ireland<br />
Stanford University, 1964, B.S. Mathematics, with distinction.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapingthematrix.org/about_author.html" rel="nofollow">http://escapingthematrix.org/about_author.html</a></p>
<p>Some thoughts: the guy isn&#8217;t stupid.  But nor is he young.   Assuming he entered Stanford at 18 and spent four years there, he was born in 1942.    2012-1942 = 70.     Another safe assumption is that he either didn&#8217;t learn any physical science while at college, or has forgotten it all.   Why would I say that?     Because down in your link I found this nugget:</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with you that a case can still be made for global warming, if proof of CO2&#8242;s alleged influence can be produced. &#8221;</p>
<p>This is a pretty amazing statement!   Conclusion: Mr. Moore has an agenda.   His devotion to that agenda has caused him to reject anything which stands in its way.     The blinders he puts on are necessary because he couldn&#8217;t maintain his views about the evil AlGore without them.</p>
<p><a href="http://globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&#038;aid=7693" rel="nofollow">http://globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&#038;aid=7693</a></p>
<p>Please note this section:  </p>
<p>&#8220;In this context, the net consequence of a major biofuel agenda comes down to intentional genocide. In order to provide marginally more fuel to the over-consuming industrialized nations, untold millions will starve in the third world, in addition to those untold millions that are already starving. The marginal energy gain is so small by comparison, that we must accept that the biofuels agenda is primarily about genocide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Moore is by no means an evil person, but with regard to regard to his views on climate change he&#8217;s merely a well-meaning old crank with some astonishing delusions.</p>

<p>ZS says, &#8220;the guy isn’t stupid. But nor is he young.&#8221;  Is ZS really unaware that the age of a person presenting an argument is irrelevant to the validity of the argument?</p>
<p>ZS claims that Richard K. Moore&#8217;s statement (quoted without any context) that “a case can still be made for global warming, if proof of CO2′s alleged influence can be produced” is &#8220;amazing&#8221; (no reason given for why it is &#8220;amazing&#8221;) and justifies ZS&#8217;s &#8220;safe assumption&#8221; that Moore &#8220;didn’t learn any physical science while at college, or has forgotten it all&#8221;.  But obviously there is <em>no connection at all</em> between Moore&#8217;s statement and ZS&#8217;s &#8220;safe assumption&#8221;, and it certainly does not follow that &#8220;Mr. Moore has an agenda&#8221; (whatever ZS wishes to insinuate by that).  ZS then continues with some vapid pop psychoanalysis of Moore which is obviously a product of his fantasy.</p>
<p>ZS then cites an article published by globalresearch.ca (entitled &#8220;The Post-Bush Regime: A Prognosis&#8221;), and quotes a few sentences  in which Moore is discussing the global food crisis, but ZS makes no attempt to explain how this is relevant to the question of anthropogenic global warming.</p>
<p>ZS concludes that Moore is &#8220;merely a well-meaning old crank with some astonishing delusions.&#8221;  Well, any fool can mouth off with insults instead of rational argument, and intelligent readers can read Moore&#8217;s articles and decide for themselves which one is the crank.</p>
<p>Perhaps ZS&#8217;s insulting of Richard K. Moore in the manner he has done is really an instance of a classic troll tactic, namely, to distract attention, in this case from the criticism of the claim of anthropogenic global warming (and the conclusion that it is a scam) which is contained in the page I cited: “The Global Warming Scare” at <a href="http://www.serendipity.li/capitalism/global_warming_scare.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.serendipity.li/capitalism/global_warming_scare.htm</a></p>

<p>Pointing out that some individual is a delusional ignoramus, and providing evidence of that situation, that&#8217;s usually enough to discredit their wild claims.</p>
<p>&#8220;ZS claims that Richard K. Moore’s statement (quoted without any context) that “a case can still be made for global warming, if proof of CO2′s alleged influence can be produced” is “amazing” (no reason given for why it is “amazing”)&#8221;</p>
<p>As for why it&#8217;s &#8220;amazing&#8221;, I&#8217;m providing a link to a text I found on Google Books titled &#8216;The Physics of Atmospheres&#8217;.   The link is to the very first page and the subject is &#8220;Some Basic Ideas&#8221;.      This is the college-level equivalent of &#8216;baby talk&#8217;.</p>

<p>Denying basic stuff about physical science is the essence of Denialism.</p>
<p>I trust you now see why I used the word &#8220;amazing&#8221; &#8211; this is basic physics which Mr. Moore pretended (?) not to understand.</p>

<p>ZS&#8217;s troll tactic of trying to distract our attention from the facts (in particular the graphs showing ice temperature plotted against historical time over the last 50,000 years), reasoning and conclusion presented at “The Global Warming Scare” at <a href="http://www.serendipity.li/capitalism/global_warming_scare.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.serendipity.li/capitalism/global_warming_scare.htm</a> is simply not going to work.</p>

it&#8217;s tragic how many truly ignorant persons have not delved into the both sides  of the global &#8216;cooling&#8217;, then &#8216;warming&#8217; then &#8216;change&#8217; debate.  Evidently, not following those attempting to save their hides from the oligarchy- &#8216;hell bent&#8217; on taking over with a greening agenda they knew would be a more palatable way to smooze young concerned minds, then coercing them by suggesting a communist way of life.  Brilliant!<br />
Banks and Big Oil are behind it.  watts had the emails to prove it, money being requested by U.N. scientists in emails (Climategate) Hiding the decline etc. etc. etc.<br />
Maurice Strong thought most of it out.  Just love his extended plot of &#8216;Agenda 21&#8242; which the movie &#8216;Hunger Games&#8217; outlines to a great extent.  Land grabbing is going on in the U.S. every day now.  Look it up!<br />
What a wonderful world, huh?  Why do you suppose some former communist countries and others have thrown out Monsanto&#8217;s GMO seeds and frankenfoods?  Once controlled by elites driving them into the grave, never again? (North Korea, great example, starving masses mindlessly honoring their leader)  wattsupwiththat.com will refute and prove the CO2 harmful to the planet is an agenda and B.S.  I always wonder why why do the global warming &#8216;alarmists&#8217; NEVER mention the massive geo-engineering of destructive chemicals being sprayed daily throughout the world?  &#8216;What in the World are They Spraying&#8217; is a movie for those blind to the obvious.<br />
The amounts of aluminum and barium, nano-particulates, fibers and crap&#8230;<br />
The planet is being killed off.  If you want to be very shocked, google the dolphins burned in Iran by H.A.A.R.P. &#8211; worst I have ever seen yet.<br />
aircrap.org /funny name, seriously great site!<br />
I love this glorious environment we enjoy, I am a scientific field worker outraged by the weather warfare directed at the planet.  Get a real concern, one that is fiercely upon us!  Don&#8217;t give into mind control, think for yourselves please.</p>

It begins with &#8216;stabilizing population&#8217;, a euphemism for systematically reducing population in the third world, so that more of their resources can be stolen.

<a href="http://rkmdocs.blogspot.com/2010/01/climate-science-observations-vs-models.html" rel="nofollow">Climate science: observations vs. models &#8212; the global-warming illusion</a><br />
which has a lot more graphs of ice-core temperatures than the web page I cited previously.  Especially interesting is the final section, &#8220;What is the real agenda of the politically powerful factions who are promoting global-warming alarmism?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to ZS for drawing attention to Richard K. Moore&#8217;s writings.  Many of Moore&#8217;s articles (on topics other than climate change) are available on the <a href="http://www.serendipity.li/" rel="nofollow">Serendipity</a> website.

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-40019" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The saga of the old Ireland-based writer isn&#8217;t quite finished.     Using the keyword &#8220;9/11&#8243; I&#8217;ve established the fellow is a genuine &#8220;9/11 Truther&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps the most compelling physical evidence, contrary to the official story, is the manner in which the Trade Center towers collapsed. The videos of the collapses look exactly like professional demolitions, the buildings collapsing inward, in a perfectly balanced way. Eyewitnesses, including professional fire fighters, reported hearing multiple explosions throughout the buildings, and seismic records indicate a strong blast at the base of each tower prior to its collapse. Elaborate simulations have been presented in the mass media that attempt to explain that the first tower collapse could have been caused by heat from the burning fuel.&#8221;</p>

<p>BTW, in the same article Mr. Moore introduced me to his &#8216;Oklahoma Federal Building Truther&#8217; stance.    Who knew!</p>
<p>From what I can tell Mr. Richard K. Moore writes to pay the bills.  He writes a LOT, and about subjects he&#8217;d have been well advised to avoid.     From his article titled &#8220;The Grand Story of Humanity&#8221; we learn the real reason humans have large brains.   </p>
<p><a href="http://www.gaiamedia.org/content/english/templates_06_medien/article_e_humanity.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gaiamedia.org/content/english/templates_06_medien/article_e_humanity.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, the development of our intelligence had nothing to do with survival. Rather, it had to do with our love of conversation, stories, music, and songs. Our brains co-evolved along with the complexity of our languages. As the languages became more complex, more brain power was needed to deal with the syntax and vocabulary, which then led to even more complex language, and so on. There was evidently, early on, a sexual preference in our species for good story tellers and good listeners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, a few hundred thousand years ago a female looking for somebody to father her children paid special attention to the fellows who harmonized best as the happy gang of proto-humans sat around the fire holding hands and singing their version of Kumbaya.</p>
<p>Despite being out of college for over half a century, Mr. Moore has some firm opinions on energy technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;Other alternatives, such as wind farms, nuclear, and solar cells, even with massive investments, can contribute only marginally to our total energy usage.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&#038;aid=12433" rel="nofollow">http://globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&#038;aid=12433</a></p>
<p>Never mind that he pulled this nonsense straight out of his heinie.   Wind power could produce mankind&#8217;s energy right now.    At considerably more expense, so could solar cells.     These could be on rooftops, on huge dedicated &#8216;farms&#8217;, and in high orbit around the earth.  The latter would be pretty pricey, but entirely practical.   And the same is true for nuclear power.   It would be by far the most expensive, and vastly more dangerous than anything else, but the reserves of uranium and thorium and the unsafe power plant technology to produce humanity&#8217;s energy certainly do exist. </p>
<p>One final example of how careless Mr. Moore is with his writing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The new report is from scientist Joseph D&#8217;Aleo and was highlighted in a report on global warming on KUSI television in San Diego.</p>
<p>It comes only weeks after the tumultuous climategate e-mail scandal in Britain erupted, proving top global warming scientists manipulated data there.</p>
<p>The report from D&#8217;Aleo, a retired climatologist who has been skeptical of global warming, contends climate data has been corrupted and skewed by &#8220;urbanization and other local factors such as land-use-land-cover changes and improper siting.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Mr. Moore had bothered to google &#8220;Joseph D&#8217;Aleo&#8221; he&#8217;d have found him to be a meteorologist &#8211; a cable TV weatherman.   Don&#8217;t know whether or not &#8216;scientist&#8217; is a proper description for D&#8217;Aleo,  but &#8220;retired climatologist&#8221; damned well isn&#8217;t.   Does this faux pas fall under &#8220;ignoramus&#8221; or &#8220;careless fanatic&#8221; &#8211; take your choice.</p>
<p>So why have I taken this time to beat up on poor Mr. Moore?   </p>
<p>It&#8217;s because he&#8217;s a typical &#8220;authority&#8221; dragged out by amateur Deniers.     They don&#8217;t have enough real climate scientists on their side that they&#8217;d need to take off their shoes and socks to count them, so they&#8217;re forced to go with the  third and fourth string guys &#8211; people who appear to be  literate and can draw pretty &#8220;scientific-looking&#8221; pictures and graphs.   </p>
<p>Does their current &#8220;Important Climate Denier&#8221; guy hatch silkworms in his hat?   Does he think he has conversations with gnomes in his garden?   Does Exxon pay have him on an allowance to write his Denials?  It Does Not Matter &#8211; his ramblings about Climate Science must be respected.  </p>
<p>Contrariwise, evil Government Scientists cannot be trusted under any circumstances.   They are the exact opposites of the Amateur Experts because they&#8217;re intelligent, educated, and have vast amounts of experience in their field.   </p>
<p>So we see and will continue to see the parade of clowns and jokers who Must Be Respected in their Denials.</p>
<p>If anybody has guessed I&#8217;m not going to be respectful of those clowns and jokers, they&#8217;ve guessed right.<br />

<p>Peer-Reviewed Research: Unprecedented Global Warming During Medieval Period, Boreholes Reveal<br />
Way back in 1997, researchers published a paper that was based on data from 6,000 plus borehole sites from all the continents. The reconstructed temperatures clearly showed a Medieval Period warming that was, and is, unprecedented. ( chart below) The data also makes clear that subsequent warming began well before the growth of human CO2 emissions and this natural rebound would obviously lead to temperatures similar to the Medieval Period.</p>
<p>A year later, the infamous Mann hockey-stick temperature chart ( posted bottom) was published to wild acclaim by the IPCC and AGW-centric activists. So popular did the Mann chart become, the 6,000+ borehole chart was completely ignored since its data refuted the Mann study. The borehole scientists (Pollack, Huang, Shen) then decided to re-publish their study with primarily only the blue-side (the typical AGW-favored data cherry-picking) of the chart below. This repackaged borehole study became accepted by the AGW-centric scientists as it seemed to support their cause and the Mann&#8217;s hockey-stick.</p>
<p>Now </p>
<p>Antartic ice cores confirm, Medieval Warm Period was global.</p>
<p><a href="http://home.iprimus.com.au/nielsens/medieval.html" rel="nofollow">http://home.iprimus.com.au/nielsens/medieval.html</a></p>
<p>By peer reveiwed data a Global Medieval Warm period DID exist 1000 years ago The temperature was about 1 degree C warmer than it is now.<br />
And afterward a global Little Ice Age DID exist, much colder than now. We are still on the natural warm swing from the little ice age.</p>
<p>This PROVES climate cycles are natural.<br />
Proves they are not man made.<br />
Proves CO2 doesn&#8217;t drive climate.<br />
Proves even a degree warmer climate than now is beneficial, and not a catastrophe!</p>
<p>Mann DID publish the lying hockey stick chart 1 year later, totally erasing and ignoring the MWP and the LIA.<br />
Not only did the IPCC endorse this lie, all the &#8220;consensus&#8221; endorsed it, even the scientists who did the original MWP study, REPUBLISHED their modified chart, now only showing the recent 500 years, because, they didn&#8217;t want to conflict with Mann&#8217;s lying chart and it&#8217;s message!</p>
<p>Proof the global warmists lie!<br />
Proof they doctor data!<br />
Proof they ignore what doesn&#8217;t agree with them!<br />
Proof they pressure even peer reviewed studies to be truncated.</p>
<p>It all adds up to:</p>
<p>Man Made Global Warming is CRAP!</p>
<p>Now ask yourself WHY the lies?</p>

The U.S. lacks the financial structure to deal with climate change.  Most folks don&#8217;t seem to buy into the CO2 warming thingy.  It simply tracks temp changes rather poorly.  What really needs changing is our tax climate to a more favorable geoeconomics coupled with evironmental concerns. Only when the global financial structures are reshaped can the world deal with the potential whatever if it is still of concern.</p>
