<h3 style="color: #000099;">Americans Are Acting Like Slowly Boiling Frogs</h3>
<p>In the classic history of Nazi Germany, <em>They Thought They Were Free,</em> Milton Mayer <a title="writes" href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/511928.html" target="_blank">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“What happened here was the <strong>gradual habituation of the people, little by little</strong>, to being governed by surprise; to receiving decisions deliberated in secret; to believing that the situation was so complicated that the government had to act on information which the people could not understand, or so dangerous that, even if the people could not understand it, it could not be released because of national security. And their sense of identification with Hitler, their trust in him, made it easier to widen this gap and reassured those who would otherwise have worried about it.</p>
<p>“This separation of government from people, this widening of the gap, <strong>took place so gradually and so insensibly, each <a id="_GPLITA_2" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Text-Enhance" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/01/u-s-government-claims-that-the-situation-is-so-complicated-and-dangerous-that-it-must-act-on-secret-information-just-like-the-nazis.html#">step</a> disguised (perhaps not even intentionally) as a temporary emergency measure or associated with true patriotic allegiance or with real social purposes</strong>. And all the crises and reforms (real reforms, too) so occupied the people that they did not see the <strong>slow motion</strong> underneath, of the whole process of government growing remoter and remoter.</p></blockquote>
<p>The German citizens were <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/01/u-s-government-claims-that-the-situation-is-so-complicated-and-dangerous-that-it-must-act-on-secret-information-just-like-the-nazis.html">boiling frogs</a> &#8230; the water heating up so gradually that they didn&#8217;t realize they had to jump out of the pot to safety.</p>
<p>Because the exact same thing is happening to Americans (<a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/06/fear-of-terror-makes-people-stupid.html">fear of terror makes people stupid</a> no matter what country they live in),  let&#8217;s remember <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/02/constitution.html">exactly what we&#8217;ve lost</a> in recent years &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="decoded aligncenter" src="http://www.theispot.com/images/source/FredaLibertyUpended1.jpg" alt="http://www.theispot.com/images/source/FredaLibertyUpended1.jpg" width="762" height="1000" /><em>Painting by Anthony Freda: <a title="www.AnthonyFreda.com" href="http://www.anthonyfreda.com/" target="_blank">www.AnthonyFreda.com</a></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First Amendment</span></p>
<p>The 1st Amendment protects speech, religion, assembly and the press:</p>
<blockquote><p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the government is <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/08/because-i-was-silent-when-they-came-for-others-when-they-came-for-me-there-was-no-one-left-to-speak-out.html">arresting those speaking out</a> &#8230; and <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/12/government-and-big-banks-joined-forces-to-violently-crush-peaceful-protests.html">violently crushing peaceful assemblies which attempt to petition the government for redress</a>.</p>
<p>A federal judge found that the law allowing indefinite detention of Americans without due process has a <a title="“chilling effect” on free speech" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ndaa-permanently-blocked-2012-9" target="_blank">“chilling effect” on free speech</a>. And see <a title="this" href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/04/03/hedges-ndaa-is-chilling-the-practice-of-journalism/" target="_blank">this</a> and <a title="this" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/mar/28/helping-chris-hedges-lawsuit-ndaa" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeanine-molloff/trespass-bill_b_1328205.html">enacted laws</a> allowing the secret service to <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2012/03/01/does-hr-347-the-trespass-bill-change-any">arrest anyone <em>protesting</em> near the president or other designated folks</a> (that might explain incidents like <a title="arrested a young father walking with his son simply because he told Dick Cheney that he disagreed with his policies" href="http://www.progressive.org/mag_mc100406" target="_blank">this</a>).</p>
<p>The <a title="threat of being labeled a terrorist" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/12/the-fbi-drowning-in-counter-terrorism-money-power-and-other-resources-will-apply-the-term-terrorism-to-any-group-it-dislikes-and-wants-to-control-and-suppress.html">threat of being labeled a terrorist for exercising our First Amendment rights</a> certainly violates the First Amendment.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second Amendment</span></p>
<p>The 2nd Amendment states:</p>
<blockquote><p>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gun control and gun rights advocates obviously have very different views about whether guns are a force for violence or for good.</p>
<p>But even a top liberal Constitutional law expert reluctantly admits  that the right to own a gun is <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/02/top-liberal-constitutional-law-expert-gun-ownership-is-an-individual-constitutional-right-as-important-as-freedom-of-speech-or-religion.html">as important a Constitutional right as freedom of speech or religion</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Like many academics, I was happy to blissfully ignore the Second Amendment. It did not fit neatly into my socially liberal agenda</strong>.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It is hard to read the Second Amendment and not honestly conclude that the Framers intended gun ownership to be an individual right. It is true that the amendment begins with a reference to militias: “A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.” Accordingly, it is argued, this amendment protects the right of the militia to bear arms, not the individual.</p>
<p>Yet, if true, the Second Amendment would be effectively declared a defunct provision. The National Guard is not a true militia in the sense of the Second Amendment and, since the District and others believe governments can ban guns entirely, the Second Amendment would be read out of existence.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>More important, <strong>the mere reference to a purpose of the Second Amendment does not alter the fact that an individual right is created. The right of the people to keep and bear arms is stated in the same way as the right to free speech or free press.</strong> The statement of a purpose was intended to reaffirm the power of the states and the people against the central government. At the time, many feared the federal government and its national army. <strong>Gun ownership was viewed as a deterrent against abuse by the government, which would be less likely to mess with a well-armed populace.</strong></p>
<p>Considering the Framers and their own traditions of hunting and self-defense, <strong>it is clear that they would have viewed such ownership as an individual right — consistent with the plain meaning of the amendment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>None of this is easy for someone raised to believe that the Second Amendment was the dividing line between the enlightenment and the dark ages of American culture. Yet, it is time to honestly reconsider this amendment and admit that … here’s the really hard part … the <a id="_GPLITA_5" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Text-Enhance" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/02/top-liberal-constitutional-law-expert-gun-ownership-is-an-individual-constitutional-right-as-important-as-freedom-of-speech-or-religion.html#">NRA</a> may have been right.</strong> This does not mean that Charlton Heston is the new Rosa Parks or that no restrictions can be placed on gun ownership. But it does appear that <strong>gun ownership was made a protected right by the Framers and, while we might not celebrate it, it is time that we recognize it</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The gun control debate &#8211; including which weapons and magazines are banned &#8211; is still in flux &#8230;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Amendment</span></p>
<p>The 3rd Amendment prohibits the government forcing people to house soldiers:</p>
<blockquote><p>No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.</p></blockquote>

<p>The 4th Amendment prevents unlawful search and seizure:</p>
<blockquote><p>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The domestic use of drones to spy on Americans clearly violates the Fourth Amendment and limits our rights to personal privacy.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many police departments are also using drones to spy on us. As the Hill <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/265693-police-drone-use-prompts-privacy-concerns">reported</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>At least 13 state and local police agencies around the country have used drones in the field or in training, according to the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, an industry trade group. The Federal Aviation Administration has predicted that by the end of the decade, 30,000 commercial and government drones could be flying over U.S. skies.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>&#8220;Drones should only be used if subject to a powerful framework that regulates their use in order to avoid abuse and invasions of privacy,&#8221; Chris Calabrese, a legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said during a congressional forum in Texas last month.</p>
<p>He argued police should only fly drones over private property if they have a warrant, information collected with drones should be promptly destroyed when it&#8217;s no longer needed and domestic drones should not carry any weapons.</p>
<p>He argued that drones pose a more serious threat to privacy than helicopters because they are cheaper to use and can hover in the sky for longer periods of time.</p>
<p>A congressional report earlier this year predicted that drones could soon be equipped with technologies to identify faces or track people based on their height, age, gender and skin color.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even without drones, Americans are the <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/12/americans-the-most-spied-on-people-in-world-history.html">most spied on people in world</a> history:</p>

<p>As the top spy chief at the U.S. National Security Agency <a title="explained" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/12/top-nsa-spying-chief-if-you-ever-get-on-their-enemies-list-like-petraeus-did-then-you-can-be-drawn-into-that-surveillance.html">explained</a> this week, the American government is collecting some 100 billion 1,000-character emails per day, and 20 trillion communications of all types per year.</p>
<p>He says that the government has collected all of the communications of congressional leaders, generals and everyone else in the U.S. for the last 10 years.</p>
<p>He further explains that he set up the NSA’s system so that all of the information would automatically be encrypted, so that the government had to obtain a search warrant based upon probably cause before a particular suspect’s communications could be decrypted.  [He specifically did this to comply with the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure.] But the NSA now collects all data in an unencrypted form, so that no probable cause is needed to view any citizen’s information.  He says that it is actually cheaper and easier to store the data in an encrypted format: so the government’s current system is being done for political – not practical – purposes.</p>
<p>He says that if anyone gets on the government’s “enemies list”, then the stored information will be used to target them. Specifically, he notes that if the government decides it doesn’t like someone, it analyzes all of the data it has collected on that person and his or her associates over the last 10 years to build a case against him.</p></blockquote>

<p>The systems are being installed in San Francisco, Baltimore, and other cities with funding from the Department of Homeland Security in some cases ….</p>
<p>The IP audio-video systems can be <a title="accessed remotely via a built-in web server" href="https://t5_sites_static.s3.amazonaws.com/schipul-safetyvision/media/files/product/fe76a0de/SVC-2200-Spec-Sheet.pdf" target="_blank">accessed remotely via a built-in web server</a> (.pdf), and can be combined with GPS data to track the movement of buses and passengers throughout the city.</p>

<p>The systems use cables or WiFi to <strong>pair audio conversations with camera images in order to produce synchronous recordings. Audio and video can be monitored in real-time</strong>, but are also stored onboard in blackbox-like devices, generally for 30 days, for later retrieval. Four to six cameras with mics are generally installed throughout a bus, including one near the driver and one on the exterior of the bus.</p>

<p>Privacy and security expert Ashkan Soltani told the Daily that the audio could easily be coupled with facial recognition systems or audio recognition technology to identify passengers caught on the recordings.</p></blockquote>

<p>America welcomes a new brand of smart street lightning systems: energy-efficient, long-lasting, complete with LED screens to show ads. They can also spy on citizens in a way George Orwell would not have imagined in his worst nightmare.</p>
<p>­With a price tag of $3,000+ apiece, according to an ABC report, the street lights are now being rolled out in Detroit, Chicago and Pittsburgh, and may soon mushroom all across the country.</p>
<p>Part of the Intellistreets systems made by the company Illuminating Concepts, they have <strong>a number of “homeland security applications” attached</strong>.</p>

Each can capture images and count people for the police through a digital camera, record conversations of passers-by and even give voice commands thanks to a built-in speaker</strong>.</p>
<p>Ron Harwood, president and founder of Illuminating Concepts, says he eyed the creation of such a system after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the Hurricane Katrina disaster.

<p>The ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/fact-sheet-us-constitution-free-zone">explained</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normally under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the American people are not generally subject to random and arbitrary stops and searches.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The border, however, has always been an exception.  There, the longstanding view is that the normal rules do not apply.  For example the authorities do not need a warrant or probable cause to conduct a “routine search.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>But what is “the border”?  According to the government, it  is a 100-mile wide strip that wraps around the “external boundary” of the United States.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As a result of this claimed authority, individuals who are far away from the border, American citizens traveling from one place in America to another, are being stopped and harassed in ways that our Constitution does not permit.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Border Patrol has been setting up checkpoints inland — on highways in states such as California, Texas and Arizona, and at ferry terminals in Washington State. Typically, the agents ask drivers and passengers about their citizenship.  Unfortunately, our courts so far have permitted these kinds of checkpoints – legally speaking, they are “administrative” stops that are permitted only for the specific purpose of protecting the nation’s borders.  They cannot become general drug-search or other law enforcement efforts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>However, these stops by Border Patrol agents are not remaining confined to that border security purpose.  On the roads of California and elsewhere in the nation – places far removed from the actual border – agents are stopping, interrogating, and searching Americans on an everyday basis with absolutely no suspicion of wrongdoing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The bottom line is that the extraordinary authorities that the government possesses at the border are spilling into regular American streets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Computer World <a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/privacy/21805/2-out-every-3-americans-lost-fourth-amendment-protections-dhs">reports</a> today:</p>
<blockquote><p>Border agents don’t need probable cause and they don’t need a stinking warrant since they don’t need to prove any reasonable suspicion first. Nor, sadly, do two out of three people have First Amendment protection; it is as if DHS has voided those Constitutional amendments and protections they provide to nearly 200 million Americans.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Don’t be silly by thinking this means only if you are physically trying to cross the international border. As we saw when discussing the DEA using license plate readers and data-mining to <a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/20209/aclu_dea_tracks_americans_movements_plans_to_data_mine_license_plate_records">track Americans movements</a>, the U.S. “border” stretches out 100 miles beyond the true border. Godfather Politics <a href="http://godfatherpolitics.com/9446/dhs-nullifies-fourth-amendment-rights-of-millions-of-americans/">added</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But wait, it gets even better!  If you live anywhere in Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey or Rhode Island, DHS says the search zones encompass the entire state.</p></blockquote>
<p>Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have a “longstanding constitutional and statutory authority permitting suspicionless and warrantless searches of merchandise at the border and its functional equivalent.” This applies to electronic devices, according to the recent CLCR “Border Searches of Electronic Devices” executive summary [<a href="http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/crcl-border-search-impact-assessment_01-29-13_1.pdf">PDF</a>]:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Fourth Amendment</strong></p>
<p>The overall authority to conduct border searches without suspicion or warrant is clear and longstanding, and courts have not treated searches of electronic devices any differently than searches of other objects.  We conclude that CBP’s and ICE’s current border search policies comply with the Fourth Amendment.  We also conclude that imposing a requirement that officers have reasonable suspicion in order to conduct a border search of an electronic device would be operationally harmful without concomitant civil rights/civil liberties benefits.  However, we do think that recording more information about why searches are performed would help managers and leadership supervise the use of border search authority, and this is what we recommended; CBP has agreed and has implemented this change beginning in FY2012.</p>
<p><strong>First Amendment</strong></p>
<p>Some critics argue that a heightened level of suspicion should be required before officers search laptop computers in order to avoid chilling First Amendment rights.  However, we conclude that the laptop border searches allowed under the ICE and CBP Directives do not violate travelers’ First Amendment rights.</p></blockquote>
<p>The ACLU said, Wait one darn minute! Hello, what happened to the Constitution? Where is the rest of CLCR report on the “policy of combing through and sometimes confiscating travelers’ laptops, cell phones, and other electronic devices—even when there is no suspicion of wrongdoing?” DHS maintains it is not violating our constitutional rights, so the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-and-liberty-immigrants-rights-national-security/aclu-files-foia-request-unreleased">ACLU said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If it’s true that our rights are safe and that DHS is doing all the things it needs to do to safeguard them, then why won’t it show us the results of its assessment? And why would it be legitimate to keep a report about the impact of a policy on the public’s rights hidden from the very public being affected?</p></blockquote>
<p>***</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/the-constitution-repealed-in-ten-states-89864/">ChristianPost wrote</a>, “Your constitutional rights have been repealed in ten states. No, this isn&#8217;t a joke. It is not exaggeration or hyperbole. If you are in ten states in the United States, your some of your rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights have been made null and void.”</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-and-liberty-immigrants-rights-national-security/aclu-files-foia-request-unreleased">ACLU filed</a> a Freedom of Information Act request for the entire DHS report about suspicionless and warrantless “border” searches of electronic devices. ACLU attorney Catherine Crump said “We hope to establish that the Department of Homeland Security can’t simply assert that its practices are legitimate without showing us the evidence, and to make it clear that the government’s own analyses of how our fundamental rights apply to new technologies should be openly accessible to the public for review and debate.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the EFF has <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/05/border-search-answers">tips</a> to protect yourself and your devices against border searches. If you think you know all about it, then you might try testing your knowledge with a <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/border-search-quiz">defending privacy at the U.S. border quiz</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wired <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/04/border-agents-c/">pointed out</a> in 2008 that the courts have routinely upheld such constitution-free zones:</p>
<blockquote><p>Federal agents at the border do not need any reason to search through travelers’ laptops, cell phones or digital cameras for evidence of crimes, a federal appeals court ruled Monday, extending the government’s power to look through belongings like suitcases at the border to electronics.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the government, finding that the so-called border exception to the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable searches applied not just to suitcases and papers, but also to electronics.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Travelers should be aware that anything on their mobile devices can be searched by government agents, who may also seize the devices and keep them for weeks or months. When in doubt, think about whether online storage or encryption might be tools you should use to prevent the feds from rummaging through your journal, your company’s confidential business plans or naked pictures of you and your-of-age partner in adult fun.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fifth Amendment</span></p>
<p>The 5th Amendment addresses due process of law, eminent domain, double jeopardy and grand jury:</p>
<blockquote><p>No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the American government has shredded the 5th Amendment by <a title="subjecting us to indefinite detention" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/12/scandal-alert-congress-is-quietly-abandoning-the-5th-amendment/266498/" target="_blank">subjecting us to indefinite detention</a> and <a title="taking away our due process rights" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/08/governments-indefinitely-detaining-citizens-in-psychiatric-wards-without-due-process-of-law.html">taking away our due process rights</a>.</p>
<p>The government claims the right to <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/12/constitutional-expert-president-obama-says-that-he-can-kill-you-on-his-own-discretion-he-can-jail-you-indefinitely-on-his-own-discretion.html">assassinate or indefinitely detain any American citizen on U.S. citizen without any due process</a>. And <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/10/the-same-secret-government-agency-which-spies-on-all-americans-also-decides-who-gets-assassinated-by-drones.html">see this</a>.</p>
<p>As such, the government is certainly depriving people of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.</p>
<p>There are additional corruptions of 5th Amendment rights &#8211; such as property being taken for <a href="http://www.ij.org/new-london-connecticut-release-7-12-2005"><em>private</em> purposes</a>.</p>
<p>The percentage of prosecutions in which a defendant is denied a  grand jury is difficult to gauge, as there is <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/01/u-s-government-claims-that-the-situation-is-so-complicated-and-dangerous-that-it-must-act-on-secret-information-just-like-the-nazis.html">so much secrecy</a> surrounding many <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/01/911-military-trial-judge-frustrated-by-government-censorship-like-the-911-commissioners.html">terrorism trials</a>.</p>
<p>Protection against being tried twice for the same crime after being found innocent (&#8220;double jeopardy&#8221;) seems to be intact.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sixth Amendment<br />
</span></p>
<p>The 6th Amendment guarantees the right to hear the criminal charges levied against us and to be able to confront the witnesses who have testified against us, as well as speedy criminal trials, and a public defender for those who cannot hire an attorney:</p>
<blockquote><p>In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.</p></blockquote>
<p>Subjecting people to <a title="subjecting us to indefinite detention" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/12/scandal-alert-congress-is-quietly-abandoning-the-5th-amendment/266498/" target="_blank">indefinite detention</a> or <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/12/constitutional-expert-president-obama-says-that-he-can-kill-you-on-his-own-discretion-he-can-jail-you-indefinitely-on-his-own-discretion.html">assassination </a>obviously violates the 6th Amendment right to a jury trial.  In both cases, the defendants is &#8220;disposed of&#8221; without ever receiving a trial &#8230; and often without ever hearing the charges against them.</p>
<p>More and more commonly, the government prosecutes cases <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/01/u-s-government-claims-that-the-situation-is-so-complicated-and-dangerous-that-it-must-act-on-secret-information-just-like-the-nazis.html">based upon &#8220;secret evidence&#8221;</a> that they don&#8217;t show to the defendant &#8230; or sometimes even the judge hearing the case.</p>
<p>The government uses “secret evidence” to <a title="spy on Americans" href="http://www.hofstralawreview.org/2012/05/15/secret-evidence-is-slowly-eroding-the-adversary-system-cipa-and-fisa-in-the-courts/" target="_blank">spy on Americans</a>, prosecute <a title="leaking" href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/joshgerstein/1011/Judge_OKs_secret_evidence_for_CIA_leak_trial.html" target="_blank">leaking</a> or <a title="terrorism" href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/02/08/judge-secret-evidence-ok-in-iraqi-in-terror-case/" target="_blank">terrorism</a> charges (even against <a title="U.S. soldiers" href="http://news.antiwar.com/2011/12/19/manning-hearing-moves-into-secret-sessions/" target="_blank">U.S. soldiers</a>) and even <a title="assassinate people" href="http://www.salon.com/2011/10/06/execution_by_secret_wh_committee/" target="_blank">assassinate people</a>.

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/08/opinion/a-new-court-for-terrorism.html">Secret witnesses</a> are being used in some cases. And sometimes lawyers are <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/08/well-known-lawyer-discusses-justice-department-shenanigans.html">not even allowed to read their own briefs</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, even the <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/05/weve-gone-from-nation-of-laws-to-nation.html">laws <em>themselves</em> are now starting to be kept secret</a>.  And it&#8217;s about to <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/06/international-treaty-negotiated-in-secret-even-hiding-the-terms-from-congressmen-with-every-reason-to-see-them-threatens-to-destroy-national-sovereignty.html">get a lot worse</a>.</p>
<p>True &#8211; when defendants <em>are</em> afforded a jury trial &#8211; they are provided with assistance of counsel. However, the <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/12/its-not-a-fiscal-cliff-its-the-descent-into-lawless-anarchy.html">austerity caused by redistribution of wealth to the super-elite</a> is causing severe budget cuts to the courts and the public defenders&#8217; offices nationwide.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are <a title="two systems of justice in America" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/04/america-is-a-failed-state-with-a-dual-justice-system-one-for-ordinary-people-and-then-one-for-people-with-money-and-enormous-wealth-and-power.html">two systems of justice in America</a> … one for the big banks and other fatcats, and <a title="one for everyone else" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/12/hsbc-prosecution-fine-money-laundering" target="_blank">one for everyone else</a>.   The government made it <a title="official policy" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/11/obama-prosecuting-fewer-financial-crimes-than-under-either-bush-presidency.html">official policy <em>not</em> to prosecute fraud</a>, even though fraud is the <a id="_GPLITA_0" title="Click to Continue &gt;; by Text-Enhance” href=”http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/12/even-the-mainstream-media-finally-awakens-to-the-fact-that-big-banks-are-criminal-enterprises.html#”&gt;criminal fraud&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title=" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/08/big-banks-worse-than-you-think.html">main business model</a> adopted by Wall Street.  Indeed, the <a id="_GPLITA_2" title="Click to Continue &gt;; by Text-Enhance” href=”http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/07/11869.html”&gt;giant banks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The perpetrators of the &lt;a href=" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/09/%E2%80%9Cgreatest-financial-crime-in-history%E2%80%9D.html">biggest financial crime in world history</a>, the <a title="largest insider trading scandal of all time" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/07/libor-the-largest-insider-trading-scandal-ever.html">largest insider trading scandal of all time</a>, illegal <a title="raiding of customer accounts" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/03/mf-global-personally-ordered-transfer-of-customer-funds.html">raiding of customer accounts</a> and <a title="blatant financing of drug cartels and terrorists" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/12/even-the-mainstream-media-finally-awakens-to-the-fact-that-big-banks-are-criminal-enterprises.html">blatant financing of drug cartels and terrorists</a> have all been committed recently without any real criminal prosecution or jail time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, government prosecutors are using the legal system to <a title="using laws to crush dissent" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/02/government-uses-anti-terror-laws-to-crush-dissent-and-help-big-business.html"> crush dissent</a> and to <a title="trying to blow the whistle" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/04/obama-has-prosecuted-more-whistleblowers-than-all-other-presidents-combined.html">silence whistleblowers</a>.</p>
<p>And some of the nation&#8217;s most powerful judges have lost their independence  &#8230; and are <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/11/does-the-justice-system-actually-dispense-justice-or-does-it-just-serve-the-powers-that-be-like-the-other-branches-of-government.html">in bed with the powers-that-be</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seventh Amendment</span></p>
<p>The 7th Amendment guarantees trial by jury in federal court for civil cases:</p>
<blockquote><p>In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.</p></blockquote>
<p>As far as we know, this right is still being respected.  However &#8211; as noted above &#8211; the <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/12/its-not-a-fiscal-cliff-its-the-descent-into-lawless-anarchy.html">austerity caused by redistribution of wealth to the super-elite</a> is causing severe budget cuts to the courts, resulting in the wheels of justice slowing down considerably.</p>

<p>The 9th Amendment provides that people have other rights, even if they aren&#8217;t specifically listed in the Constitution:</p>
<blockquote><p>The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.</p></blockquote>
<p>We can debate what our inherent rights as human beings are.  I believe they include the right to a level playing field, and access to safe food and water.  You may disagree.</p>
<p>But everyone agrees that the government should not <em>actively encourage</em> fraud and manipulation.  However, the government &#8211; through its <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/10/conservatives-and-liberals-agree-end-the-malignant-symbiotic-relationship-between-big-government-and-big-corporations.html">malignant, symbiotic relation with big corporations</a> &#8211; is interfering with our aspirations for <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/12/its-not-a-fiscal-cliff-its-the-descent-into-lawless-anarchy.html">economic freedom</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/11/we-can-fix-america-if-we-focus-on-what-all-americans-liberals-and-conservatives-want.html">safe food and water</a> (instead of <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/02/genetically-engineered-meat-skirts-testing-because-its-treated-as-an-animal-drug.html">arsenic-laden, genetically engineered junk</a>), freedom from undue health hazards such as <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/04/nuclear-power-is-expensive-and-bad-for-the-environment-it-is-really-being-pushed-because-it-is-good-for-making-bombs.html">irradiation</a> due to <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/01/how-can-we-reconcile-freedom-loving-libertarianism-versus-devotion-to-the-rule-of-law.html">government support</a> of archaic nuclear power designs, and a level playing field (as opposed to our crony capitalist system in which the <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/08/by-choosing-the-big-banks-over-the-little-guy-the-government-is-dooming-both.html">little guy has no shot</a> due to <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/02/more-rape-of-americans-by-elites-more-erosion-of-freedom.html">redistribution of wealth</a> from the middle class to the super-elite, and government support of <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/10/conservatives-and-liberals-agree-end-the-malignant-symbiotic-relationship-between-big-government-and-big-corporations.html">white</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/07/regulators-sleep-with-industry-provided-prostitutes-while-they-pimp-out-the-american-people.html">collar</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/07/corrupt-government-officials-should-be-in-jail-alongside-corrupt-banksters.html">criminals</a>).</p>
<p>By working hand-in-glove with giant corporations to defraud us into paying for a lower quality of life, the government is trampling our basic rights as human beings.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tenth Amendment</span></p>
<p>The 10th Amendment provides that powers not specifically given to the <em>Federal</em> government are reserved to the states or individual:</p>
<blockquote><p>The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.</p></blockquote>
<p>Two of the central principles of America&#8217;s Founding Fathers are:</p>
<blockquote><p>(1) The government is created and empowered with the consent of the people</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>(2) Separation of powers</p></blockquote>
<p>Today, <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/02/majority-of-americans-say-federal-government-threatens-freedom.html">most Americans believe</a> that the government is <em>threatening</em> &#8211; rather than <em>protecting</em> &#8211; freedom &#8230; and that it is no longer acting with the &#8220;consent of the governed&#8221;.</p>
<p>And the federal government is trampling the separation of powers by stepping on the toes of the states and the people.  For example, former head S&amp;L prosecutor Bill Black &#8211; now a professor of law and economics &#8211; <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/blog/2012/09/the-race-to-the-bottom-produces-regulators-who-are-invertebrates-and-epidemics-of-fraud/">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the resident examiners and regional staff of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency [both]  competed to weaken federal regulation and <strong>aggressively used the preemption doctrine to try to prevent state investigations of and actions against fraudulent mortgage lenders</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, the federal government is doing everything it can to stick its nose into every aspect of our lives &#8230; and <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/12/moores-law-cheap-electronics-and-homeland-security-money-combine-to-create-big-brother.html">act like Big Brother</a>.</p>

It was Communist Russia that stripped Christians of all rights and killed 66 million of them.  We are a Marxist State in every way, run by the same people.</p>
<p>&#8216;Hitler will have no war, but we will force it on him, not this year, but soon.&#8217; &#8211; Jew Emil Ludwig Cohn in Les Annales, June, 1934</p>
<p>&#8220;Germany is the enemy of Judaism and must be pursued with deadly hatred. The goal of Judaism of today is: the complete destruction of the nation. We demand a complete blockade of trade, the importation of raw materials stopped, and retaliation towards every German, woman and child.&#8221;<br />
-(Jewish professor A. Kulischer, Oct, 1937) </p>
<p>&#8220;Jewish communists participated efficiently and diligently&#8221; in collectivization. It was a war against the Russian people &#8211; a war that was carried out with &#8220;a certain enthusiasm among Jews.&#8221;<br />

All Germans had to request permits to own guns from the police, and only members of the SD, SS, and Stelhelm groups; as well as Party Members and known supporters could actually get those permits. It was quite similar to the Communists method of &#8220;Only Party Members&#8221;. </p>
<p>Interesting note, on recently reviewing the 1938 laws, was the fact they specifically outlawed the private ownership of the current military rifle of the day. That&#8217;s right, the German 98k Mauser BOLT ACTION Rifle with fixed 5rd magazine! How interesting that today across this nation politicians of the left are repeating this very thing, by trying to ban a Sporting Rifle (AR15) that looks like the current US Military M16. </p>
<p>Hey and don&#8217;t forget that Lenin declared he was a Social Democrat! Hitler was a Social Democrat too! National Socialist German Workers Party.</p>

<p>Stalin&#8217;s Jews, YNET News Israel-Sever Plocker<br />
Genrikh Yagoda,&#8221; the greatest Jewish murderer of the 20th Century, was GPU&#8217;s deputy commander and founder of the NKVD. Yagoda is responsible for the deaths of at least 10 million people. His Jewish deputies established the Gulag system.<br />

<p>&#8220;The Communist Movement and ideology played an important part In Jewish life, particularly in the 1920s, 1930s and during and after World War II.<br />
Jews became the leading element in the legal and illegal Communist Parties..<br />
Jews were instructed to change their names so as &#8220;not confirm right-wing propaganda that presented Communism as an alien, Jewish conspiracy.&#8221;<br />

<p>If you have finally awakened the least little bit to the stealthy predator&#8217;s approach&#8230;take action NOW!!!  Be sure you have a victory garden planted to get you through with your own food. Withdraw your support for the BEAST that is stalking you. Get water stored up, even if you must use 2 liter plastic soda bottles. Lots of it. And don&#8217;t pay taxes or get as much refunded as possible. Wipe out your credit card debt by refusing to pay it. Credit Bureau can be cleared up later, easily. Conserve, be smart, and don&#8217;t pick a fight you can&#8217;t win.</p>

 Are you upset with how this country is being run and want your voice to be heard?</p>
<p> Here&#8217;s an idea: Do nothing. Sit at home and chill. Don&#8217;t go out to eat,<br />
 don&#8217;t go to the movies, shopping, work, school, don&#8217;t drive your car,<br />
don&#8217;t do anything!</p>
<p> Just stock up on a month&#8217;s worth of supplies, like food, medications &#8211; those regular things you&#8217;ll need &#8211; and do nothing.</p>
<p> If more than half the United States does this all at the same time, can<br />
 you imagine what would happen to the economy? Can you imagine the sort<br />
of response that would be triggered?</p>
<p> What&#8217;s even better is that<br />
 this isn&#8217;t violent in any way. It&#8217;s a silent message. It&#8217;s not even<br />
rebellion. But it will get their attention in as little as one week&#8217;s<br />
time.</p>
<p> There have been studies made on how the country would be<br />
affected if just a smallpox outbreak was reported at several key<br />
transportation areas like JFK, O&#8217;Hare, etc.</p>
<p> Think of what it<br />
would do &#8211; how your voice WOULD be heard if you were to DO NOTHING for<br />
just one week. Two weeks or even one month.</p>
<p> All that&#8217;s<br />
necessary is to do absolutely nothing &#8211; don&#8217;t fly &#8211; don&#8217;t drive or ride a<br />
 bus or even a subway. Don&#8217;t leave your home to go to work or shopping -<br />
 don&#8217;t send your kids to school &#8211; don&#8217;t pay your bills &#8211; don&#8217;t do<br />
anything.</p>
<p> If you are a health care provider &#8211; a nurse or doctor<br />
 &#8211; don&#8217;t go back to your normal duties because once you have all shut<br />
down and are not doing your normal activities the beast will be forced<br />
to send in its military personnel to staff regular civilian duties until<br />
 they end the Country&#8217;s strike.</p>
<p> But in order to bring this<br />
beast to its knees you will need the vast majority of people to follow<br />
suit. In one weeks time &#8211; just 7 days of no activity the President will<br />
be urging every American to go back to work and their normal activities.</p>
<p> In two weeks time he will be begging you &#8211; and in one month the<br />
government will be in such dire strait they will be willing to listen to<br />
 the people&#8217;s voice. All done without firing a shot or any kind of<br />
violence &#8211; simply unify and DO NOTHING until the beast is brought to its<br />
 knees by your inaction.</p>
<p> Pass it on! Operation Inaction Starting April 1, 2013&#8243;</p>

<p>Sorry but violence or organized violence is the only way to take out the beast by giving it a taste of it&#8217;s own medicine but it has to be planned or it will be nothing better then mob rule and we know how well that worked out in the French Revolution.</p>

<p>Paradoxically, when I heard about Sen. Diane Frankenfeinstein defending her stupidity from attack by Sen. Ted Cruz, I recoiled in horror. She claimed that she was not some sixth-grader that needed lectured to.</p>
<p>She was right. By the time I was in sixth grade, I could read the United States Constitution. And here she is, well past the age of 18, proving time and again, every time she opens her foul mouth, that she is a functional illiterate.</p>
<p>People like the illiterate senator from California are what secret courts should be for. If they vote for passage of any legislation that is not outlined as something specific they can address within the Constitution, they need to enjoy the indefinite detention of Guantanamo Bay.</p>
<p>Or in her case, Alcatraz/.</p>
