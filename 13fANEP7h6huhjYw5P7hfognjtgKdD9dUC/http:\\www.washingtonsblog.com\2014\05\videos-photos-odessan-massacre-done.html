						<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">By Eric Zuesse:</p>
<p>For the first time in history, an organized massacre of civilians has been filmed by many people from many different angles and perspectives while it was happening, and is documented in extraordinary detail in “real time,” the perpetrators having no fear of any negative consequences from their endeavor, and even cheering and celebrating the tortures and deaths as they were being imposed upon the helpless victims. The perpetrators were unconcerned, because what they were doing was what the government (which the U.S. had imposed upon their country and which U.S. taxpayers had spent more than 5 billion dollars to bring about there) had wanted them to do, and had helped to organize them to carry out. These people were just having fun, like a party to them, nothing really serious at all. Sort of like Stanley Kubrick’s movie <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>, more than, say Auschwitz (such a bore!). But, if so, a hundredfold more. And none of these people (tragically including the victims) were actors!</p>
<p>Background: On May 2nd, the Ukrainian Government in Kiev, located in the west, ordered local governments in the country’s east to take over the buildings that were being occupied by Russian-speaking Ukrainians who didn’t recognize the legitimacy of that newly installed and U.S.-supported Ukrainian government. There was violence in many cities, one being Odessa, where Russian-speaking Ukrainians were taken into the Trade Unions Building (viewed as leftist by the conservative political parties) and were massacred by burning, gunshots, and other means.</p>
<p>This video from George Eliason, an American living in Ukraine, shows the Trade Unions Building starting to be firebombed; then at 2:28 a big firebomb is blasted into the building and there are cheers, but by the end of the video the flames are strong and the sky can hardly be seen because of the dense smoke from the burning building:</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/5HOfLxp896I" frameborder="0" width="785" height="589"></iframe></p>
<p>The next video shows the firebombs (Molotov cocktails) being thrown into the Odessa Trade Unions Building, and occupants escaping to the roof:</p>
<p><iframe width="785" height="589" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/s9AMjLBIliw?start=10" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This next, very brief, video shows the burning building from the street, with someone (who is identified on other videos as “Mykola”) firing a gun in the direction of the burning building:</p>
<p><iframe width="785" height="589" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ypnu0vteNto" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This next video shows a crowd of anti Russian-speaking men from the neo-Nazi Pravy Sector (or “Right Sector,” paramilitary racist anti-Russian nationalist Ukrainian party) herding Russian-speaking Ukrainians into the burning building:</p>
<p><iframe width="785" height="589" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/EvLukZZoTh8?start=114" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This video from Eliason shows members of Pravy Sector throwing stones and firing rifles into the building:</p>
<p><iframe width="785" height="589" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/L6rGl8N0gDU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This brief video from Eliason shows people jumping out of windows from the burning building:</p>
<p><iframe width="785" height="589" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ltgvkndn_vU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This video from Eliason shows people with clubs beating to death to finish off several people who had just jumped from the windows:</p>
<p><iframe width="785" height="589" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ltgvkndn_vU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This brief (2:06) video, which was uploaded to youtube on 6 May 2014,</p>
<p><iframe width="785" height="589" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/NgKK3vUVvio" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>shows an Odessan who is in a street-crowd right after the massacres had occurred on May 2nd, and he’s being asked questions about what had happened. A passerby with a cellphone recorded this brief interview, and the questions came from members of the crowd, who wanted his account.</p>
<p>Here’s my transcript of the video’s printed subscript’s English translation, retaining its typos exactly as they were shown in the film-clip (except that the curse-words aren’t shown letter-for-letter), and with clarifications added by me in <font color="red">red</font>:</p>
<p><em>Those who were collecting the bodies said: we were walking on the dead bodies &#8230; [How many people got killed there?] If we take the whole day, 116. &#8230; They are burying them secretly. They were collecting the bodies and finished off the wounded. [Did they poison them with some gas?] Not only with gas. They used stan granades, guns, traumatic guns, pump-action rifles. They chased the people into the building and finished them there. Two guys were clubbed to death with sticks. Is it normal? Is it a f&#8211;king united country? They burned a woman with two children alive. In the first floor this woman and two children were killed. &#8230; And the Media called us &#8230; I&#8217;m sorry but I will talk [<font color="red">to the media</font>]! The Ukrainian [<font color="red">Kiev</font>] Media call us terrorists. But the Right Sector [<font color="red">a Western-oriented neo-Nazi party, prominent in the new Kiev government</font>], the wankers, chased us up to the roof of the builing. They threw Molotov Cocktails at us and cried &#8216;Death to enemies&#8217;. To what enemies [<font color="red">he asked them</font>]? And then they cried [<font color="red">out in support of</font>] &#8216;United Ukraine&#8217;. [<font color="red">He replied</font>] F&#8211;k the United Ukraine. F&#8211;k this country [<font color="red">the newly installed government in Kiev</font>]. [How all this was going chronologically?] Chronologically? They came &#8230; [Were there any children killed?] There were many children, women and old people murdered. They finished off the wounded. With headshots. They jumped on their heads. The police couldn&#8217;t do anything, they only cordoned off the building. The police tried to come up, a grenade burst among them, and they jumped on the dead bodies. [Where are the rest of the bodies?] The rest of the bodies are six kilometers from Odessa. We need to go there and take them. [<font color="red">unclear question</font>] My name is Vania. [He turns to go.]</em></p>

<p>showing (as he titles them) “Pregant woman strangled with cord,” “Torture- Gasoline poured over his head,” and “Rape and torture victim.”</p>
<p>This next item is a picture of the burning building, and a list of the first 36 identified corpses:</p>

<p>This group of photos includes both the photo of the strangled pregnant woman and the video recorded from the ground below while she was screaming for help:</p>
<p><a href="http://ersieesist.livejournal.com/813.html" target="_blank">http://ersieesist.livejournal.<wbr>com/813.html</wbr></a></p>
<p>The following 59-second video taken right before the operation shows local Odessa police forces en-masse refusing to participate in it, dropping their shields and walking off, instead of following their instructions from the central government in Kiev:</p>
<p><a href="http://users.livejournal.com/_devol_/882549.html" target="_blank">http://users.livejournal.com/_<wbr>devol_/882549.html</wbr></a></p>
<p>The Ukrainian title right below that video translates as “Part of the Odessa Police refused to stand in the cordon.”</p>
<p>Next is a photo of two Right Sector girls smiling into the camera while carrying Molotov cocktails to the building to join in the massacre:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10203476189495505&amp;set=a.4248624383967.167315.1536441281&amp;type=1&amp;theater" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/<wbr>photo.php?fbid=<wbr>10203476189495505&amp;set=a.<wbr>4248624383967.167315.<wbr>1536441281&amp;type=1&amp;theater</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></a></p>
<p>The following 9-minute video was taken by a Right Sector person wandering through the wrecked burnt-out building on the night of May 2nd after the job was done, to inspect the corpses and record with pride and satisfaction the results of a day’s work:</p>
<p><iframe width="785" height="589" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/vv9_z6Cdf3g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The last two mentioned items are linked to on May 2nd, the very day of the events, at this informative blogpost:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.moonofalabama.org/2014/05/ukraine-imf-lose-the-east-and-get-more-money/comments/page/2/" target="_blank">http://www.moonofalabama.org/<wbr>2014/05/ukraine-imf-lose-the-<wbr>east-and-get-more-money/<wbr>comments/page/2/</wbr></wbr></wbr></a></p>
<p>where the 9-minute video is described thusly: “The people either suffocated to death or/and were beaten to death. The fascists are searching the corpses for their identification and names and contacts of their friends &#8230; apparently to put them on the list of further fascist terror.” Wallets are taken, etc., for that investigative purpose. So, the victims’ families might now also be in danger.</p>
<p>Also linked-to there is a photo of a coterie of about 6 girls pouring from a gasoline can into beer-bottles to make the Molotov cocktails. They looked like a group of friends simply enjoying a street-party:</p>

<p>Here is the ultimate group of videos:</p>

<p>Here are key parts translated from the transcript of the lengthiest video there:</p>
<p>0.43-47 “Let us burn those motherf&#8211;kers right in the building, f&#8211;king faggots”</p>
<p>1.08 Everything around is already burning. Injured people are lying on the ground.</p>
<p>1.18 1.20 Maidan activist Mykola is running and shooting at people, who are trying to escape from the window.</p>
<p>5.40-5.50 attackers throw more fire to the window and then are shouting “GOAL!!!”</p>
<p>6.25 – 7.13 Mykola &#8230; is shooting at people who are trying to catch air and are seen from the window.</p>
<p>8.10 Maidan activists are telling each other to go to the backyard, because people are trying to escape from there</p>
<p>8.26 Crowd is shouting “They are escaping! Run to the backyard!”</p>
<p>14.15 People, who are still alive are shouting “Police, you have been bought as scums and all of you will go to prison afterwards!”</p>
<p>14.41 Man from the window is shouting “Citizens of Odessa city, rise up!”</p>
<p>16.40 People start to jump from the window. 2, 3, 4 dead bodies. [Not shown, but only mentioned in the conversation.]</p>
<p>21.00 Still alive girls are shouting from the second and third floor.</p>
<p>23.00 Burning man has fallen from the window. Crowd is happy.</p>
<p>23.20 Anti-nationalist man is lying on the roof. Maidan nazzis are shouting to him “Jump! Glory to the Ukraine!”</p>
<p>Another of the videos there is “Ukraine Crisis – What You’re Not Being Told,” and it includes the tapped phone-call on which Estonia’s Foreign Minister Urmas Paet informed EU Foreign Policy Chief Cathy Ashton, regarding the results of Paet’s investigation into who was behind the snipers who on 20 February 2013 had fired on protesters in Kiev and murdered 21 people, which Obama blamed on Yanukovych and which was used as the chief legal pretext for his ouster. “There is now stronger and stronger understanding that behind the snipers it was not Yanukovych, but it was somebody from the new coalition.” The snipers firing both at the Maidan protesters and at Yanukovych’s police were hired by the people that Victoria Nuland placed into power to replace the democratically elected President, Yanukovych. He was corrupt, but he didn’t do this: “our” people did it, but Obama and his team hid it, and they still hide it.</p>
<p>And here are still-shots of the burnt corpses:</p>

<p>[Note from Washington's Blog:  Former Associated Press and Newsweek reporter Robert Parry documents other <a href="http://consortiumnews.com/2014/05/05/ukraines-dr-strangelove-reality/">horrific acts as part of the mass killing in Odessa</a>:  As the building was engulfed in flames, some people who tried to flee were chased and beaten, while those trapped inside heard the Ukrainian nationalists liken them to black-and-red-striped potato beetles called Colorados, because those colors are used in pro-Russian ribbons.  </p>
<p>“Burn, Colorado, burn” went the chant.</p>
<p>As the fire worsened, those dying inside were serenaded with the taunting singing of the Ukrainian national anthem. The building also was spray-painted with Swastika-like symbols and graffiti reading “Galician SS,” a reference to the Ukrainian nationalist army that fought alongside the German Nazi SS in World War II, killing Russians on the eastern front.]</p>
<p>The reason why the Kiev government is ousting Russian-speaking Ukrainians from government buildings in the east is to retain control of the east. CNBC had headlined on May 1st, just the day before these massacres, <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101631226" target="_blank">“IMF warns Ukraine on bailout if it loses east&#8221;</a> and reported: “‘This is something of a leap of faith for the IMF and is politically driven by key IMF shareholders [the international aristocracy in the U.S and Europe] to support the (interim prime minister Arseniy) Yatseniuk “kamikaze” administration in its reform efforts,’ according to Tim Ash, head of emerging markets research at Standard Bank.”</p>
<p>That “kamikaze” term there was referring to the following: Euronews on February 27th bannered “Ukraine’s New Premier Suggests Sacrifices Are Unavoidable,” and presented the hard-right Victoria Nuland, wife of the co-founder, along with Bill Kristol, of the Project for a New American Century. PNAC had famously championed Bush’s 2003 invasion of Iraq. Obama had appointed Nuland U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia. In the subsequently infamous leaked phone-conversation (reported by the BBC on February 7th, “Ukraine crisis: Transcript of leaked Nuland-Pyatt call”), she dictated to America’s Ukrainian Ambassador that Arseniy Yatsenyuk or “Yats” must run Ukraine. Yatsenyuk was dedicated to the West’s austerity measures, so as to burden ordinary Ukrainians with the enormous debts that had been piled up and socked away by Ukraine’e’s aristocrats, the former corrupt Ukrainian leaders who had stashed billions abroad. Nuland said, “I don’t see Klitchko in the government. I don’t think it’s necessary. I don’t think it’s a good idea. I think Yats is the guy. He’s got the economic experience, the governing experience. He’s the guy you know.” She didn’t want someone she didn’t know; only known corrupt insiders should be rulers. In gangland, you deal only with people you know. And now, the far-right economist “Yats” became the appointed leader, and he immediately said: “We need to form a responsible government — and it’s not about personalities, this is about responsibility. You know, to be in this government is to commit political suicide. And we need to be very frank and open. This is the political suiciders.” He was looking to impress the lenders, so that when he’d retire from government, he’d be able to cash in for his having served not Ukrainians, but the corrupt lenders to the corrupt former Ukrainian political leaders. The Obama plan was for Ukraine to become another Greece, only more so. A taped speech by Nuland to a hard-right corporate forum, the U.S.-Ukrainian Foundation, on 13 December 2013 was posted under the headline “Victoria Nuland Admits: US Has Invested $5 Billion In The Development of Ukrainian ‘Democratic Institutions’.” She said there that the anti-Russia elements in Ukraine represented “the principles and values that are the cornerstones for all free democracies.” The concept there of “democracy” was as versus communism, the polarity that had been central for her husband, Robert Kagan, co-founder with Bill Kristol of PNAC. And now, under the imposed Ukrainian leader “Yats,” Obama would extract repayment for the $5 billion, from the Ukrainian public. During George W. Bush’s Administration, Nuland had served as the principal deputy foreign policy adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney, but when John Kerry became Secretary of State, Kerry chose her to run Europe and Asia. Hillary Clinton had earlier made her the State Department’s official Spokesperson. The entire Obama Administration consisted of Republican “Democrats.” <em>[Side note: Washington’s Blog is a non-partisan site.   We believe that the war between liberals and conservatives is a false divide-and-conquer dog-and-pony show created by the powers that be to keep the American people divided and distracted.

But this is such an important post that we urge you keep reading past this partisan paragraph ... whatever your politics.</em>]  The people in the Democratic Party who financed the political campaigns of the top Democratic office-holders were the “Democratic” aristocrats. Republican aristocrats financed the political campaigns of all Republican office-holders: that Party was 100% corrupt, but only at the very top level was the Democratic Party 100% corrupt. Most congressional Democrats, for example, are not corrupt. They’re not populists, but they take into account not only the interests of their big financial donors: they care somewhat about the public, too.</p>
<p>The transcript of Nuland’s speech was posted 16 December 2013 at the Department of State, “Assistant Secretary Nuland at U.S.-Ukraine Foundation Conference”. Her exact words there were: “Since Ukraine’s independence in 1991, the United States has supported Ukrainians as they build democratic skills and institutions, as they promote civic participation and good governance, all of which are preconditions for Ukraine to achieve its European aspirations. We’ve invested over $5 billion to assist Ukraine in these and other goals that will ensure a secure and prosperous and democratic Ukraine.” Very funny, that reference to “a secure and prosperous and democratic Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Chris Ernesto at <a href="http://AntiWar.com" target="_blank">AntiWar.com</a> headlined on 15 March 2014, “Brzezinski Mapped Out the Battle for Ukraine in 1997: It’s all about maintaining the US position as the world’s sole superpower.” The plan was to squelch Russia in order to retain the existing mono-polar world: control of all the world’s resources by America’s aristocracy, as the dominant player everywhere. Zbigniew Brzezinski’s decades-long patronage by David Rockefeller was now becoming understandable in a stark light.</p>
<p>The BBC’s “Newsnight” featured a segment on the Ukrainian situation, which was posted 28 February 2014 to youtube as “Neo-Nazi threat in new Ukraine: NEWSNIGHT,” and it interviewed some of the activists who had taken over as armed and organized gangs, and many of whom were unapologetically “National Socialist,” some even overtly pro-Hitler. The U.S. had indirectly (if not directly) placed them in control, after we forced Viktor Yanukovych out.</p>
<p>On 5 March 2014, Russia Today TV, Russia’s English-language news service, issued a tapped phone-conversation between the EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton and the Estonian foreign affairs minister Urmas Paet, in which the latter said that the massacre on 18 February 2014 that Western news media had reported to have been perpetrated by troops for the ousted Ukrainian President Yanukovych and that had sparked his overthrow had actually been perpetrated instead by agents of the pro-Western leaders who were now in power. However, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Ukrainian_revolution" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/<wbr>2014_Ukrainian_revolution</wbr></a> goes beyond this, to document that when Paet’s phone-conversation with Ashton became public, he walked back his degree of certainty that Yanukovych had been framed on this matter.</p>
<p>That wikipedia article is extraordinarily thorough.</p>
<p>On 6 March 2014, Paul Craig Roberts bannered, “The Looting of Ukraine Has Begun,” and he wasn’t referring to the long history of kleptocracy in Ukraine, but only to the Obama Administration’s part in that history. “According to a report in Kommersant-Ukraine, the finance ministry of Washington’s stooges in Kiev who are pretending to be a government has prepared an economic austerity plan that will cut Ukrainian pensions from $160 to $80 so that Western bankers who lent money to Ukraine can be repaid at the expense of Ukraine’s poor. <a href="http://www.kommersant.ua/doc/2424454" target="_blank">http://www.kommersant.ua/doc/<wbr>2424454</wbr></a> It is Greece all over again. &#8230; The austerity plan will cut social services, funds for education, layoff government workers, devalue the currency, thus raising the prices of imports which include Russian gas, thus electricity, and open Ukrainian assets to takeover by Western corporations. Ukraine’s agriculture lands will pass into the hands of American agribusiness.”</p>
<p>Something highly important occurred at that very moment: Iskra News in Russian, and also the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee, reported, on 7 March 2014, that “At 2 a.m. this morning &#8230; an unmarked transport plane was on the runway at Borosipol Airport” near Kiev in the west, and that, “According to airport staff, before the plane came to the airport, four trucks and two Volkswagen minibuses arrived, all the truck license plates missing.” This was as translated by Michel Chossudovsky at Global Research headlining on 14 March, “Ukraine’s Gold Reserves Secretly Flown Out and Confiscated by the New York Federal Reserve?” in which he noted that, when asked, “A spokesman for the New York Fed said simply, ‘Any inquiry regarding gold accounts should be directed to the account holder.” The load was said to be “more than 40 heavy boxes.” Chossudovsky noted that, “The National Bank of Ukraine (Central Bank) estimated Ukraine’s gold reserves in February to be worth $1.8 billion dollars.” It was 36 tons. The U.S., according to Nuland had invested aroud $5 billion in the coup. Was Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk cleaning out the nation’s gold reserves in order to strip the nation so that the nation’s steep indebtedness for Russian gas would never be able to be repaid to Russia’s oligarchs? Or was he doing it as a payoff for Nuland’s having installed him? Or both? In any case: Russia was being squeezed by this fascist Ukrainian-U.S. ploy.</p>
<p><a href="http://Metal.com" target="_blank">Metal.com</a>, the Shanghai Metals Market, headlined on March 14th, “Ukraine Gold Reserves Reported To Be Hastily Aircrafted To U.S.” Nobody would say anything about it, and U.S. “news” media blacked out the matter. However, U.S. sources said that it was done in order to protect Ukraine’s gold in the event that Russia were to invade and steal it.</p>
<p>Raul Illargi headlined at The Automatic Earth, “Debt Rattle Mar 9 2014: Big Oil and Gas Wars,” and linked to recent news reports about international oil companies’ efforts to push Russia’s state oil company Gazprom out of Ukraine and replace Russian with Western oil companies’ production. Headlines included: “EU leaders draw up plans to send gas to Ukraine if Russia cuts off supply,” “Ukraine crisis is about Great Power oil, gas pipeline rivalry,” “Ukraine Plans to Cut Russian Gas Imports, Raise EU Supply,” and “Ukraine&#8217;s Naftogaz slashes Russian gas imports in February.” The machinations by rightist politicians to shove aside Gazprom were already at a fever-pitch throughout the weeks leading up to the overthrow of Ukraine’s pro-Russian President Victor Yanukovych, especially the last week of February in 2014, when he was replaced by Arseniy Yatsenyuk.</p>
<p>So: that’s why the Russian-speakers who live in Ukraine are terrified and are hoping for Russia’s protection of them, and why Ukraine’s neo-Nazis are being unleashed against them. It’s just one gang of aristocrats trying to muscle another gang of aristocrats off to the side. And we’ll see who wins. But, clearly, the public, throughout Ukraine, will lose, big-time: “collateral damage” from the struggle between two rival gangs of aristocrats.</p>
<p>It’s just history repeating itself, for the millionth time.</p>

The US State Dept, CIA, USAID, FBI are clearly employed to sustain, support and create corporate profit.   We see the Banks, the Oil Companies once again driving conflict because it makes them wealthy. The same thugs are here in the USA, and when the time is right we will see nationalistic brownshirts take up arms to defend corporations while shouting about freedom, the constitution and so-called Gov&#8217;mint tyranny. Someone needs to tell the US redneck that the US Government currently exists to provide services to the rich and powerful, including cattle ranchers like Koch.

<p>here is what happened:<br />
the &#8216;pro russians&#8217; ambushed a unity march of soccer fans (odessan and kharkiv), shooting at them.<br />
here is that fat guy shooter, and he&#8217;s been a shooter at other &#8216;anti-maidan&#8217; events, but he and his tiny group were backed into an alleyway&#8211;he&#8217;s shooting at the street where the unity protesters are.<br />
the pictures are out there of this guy and those areound him wear armbands like the yellow/red ones of other anti-maidan people.</p>

<p>you propagandists/useful idiots are being played to be fools.  that vid the propagandist posted is at ground level.  here is the video shot from above, so you can see the shooter and the red banded pro russians are  in an alley by the street where the ukraine unity marchers were, the soccer/football fans of odessa and kharkiv.</p>

<p>These plants needed something to distinguish them from the real pro-Russian protesters to the police and to the other Right Sector thugs, off course. There were hundreds of them with their faces mostly covered, so some kind of &#8216;uniform&#8217; to avoid &#8216;friendly fire&#8217; was required.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;and as such an identification, why didn&#8217;t the russians and their thugs then turn on them and shoot them?</p>
<p>By the time the pro-Kiev thugs moved into the square with the pro-Russian camp they had already removed their St. George&#8217;s ribbons and dissolved into the crowds and the surrounding city. Additionally. there is no evidence anywhere, photo, video, or in the local police reports, that shows that the real pro-Russian protesters had guns. There is, however, a lot of evidence that the pro-Kiev thugs had plenty of weapons.</p>

so—mass demonstrations began on Maidan Square in Kyiv. </p>
<p>The protests, which began as a largely apolitical show of<br />
opposition to the change in the country’s international course away<br />
from the EU, changed in January 2014. Following repression of<br />
protestors by the government, calls for European integration were<br />
replaced by slogans against corruption and appropriation of the state<br />
by Yanukovych’s team (Ukraine ranked 144 out of 177 countries in<br />
terms of corruption perception, according to the Corruption<br />
Perceptions Index 2013). </p>
<p>Following unsuccessful attempts by the government to break up the protests on Maidan using Berkut special forces, in February deadly force was deployed. Almost 100 people were killed during an operation by snipers intended to disperse the protestors. This violent repression of protestors in<br />
Kyiv precipitated the process of political transformation. </p>
<p>On 21 February, Yanukovych signed an agreement with opposition<br />
leaders. The next day, he disappeared from Kyiv and protestors took<br />
over presidential administration buildings. Parliament voted to<br />
remove the president from power and set a date for presidential<br />
elections. It named parliamentary Speaker Olexander Turchynov as<br />
interim president. With Russia and its sympathisers in the east and<br />
south of the country disgruntled by the situation in Kyiv,<br />
pro-Russian gunmen and protestors occupied government buildings<br />
in Crimea and later in the eastern part of Ukraine, including<br />
Slavyansk, Donetsk and Lugansk. </p>
<p>But the recent revolution in Ukraine is not the first time a former Soviet republic has undergone a revolutionary change of its political system since the fall of the USSR in 1991. So-called colour revolutions have taken place in<br />
Georgia in 2003 (the “Rose Revolution”), Ukraine in 2004 (the “Orange Revolution”), and Kyrgyzstan in 2005 (the “Tulip Revolution”). Similar attempts at regime change have also taken place—though unsuccessfully—in Belarus and Russia.&#8221;<br />

<p>Look at their hero Stepan Bandera. This hero in World War II killed thousands of Ukrainians, Poles, Jews and Russian people.<br />
Do you think that decent people willing to support this movement? </p>
<p>And what do you think, did the decent people come to power through a military coup? I wish you a journey to Ukraine now that to see the horror that country imposed illegitimate government.<br />

your parents must be one of those people that benefited from the corrupt putin-puppet, so now they are mad that they may have to be just like everyone else and not special.  what did your parents do for yanukovch?  were they the ones that beat up the people protesting his corruption?  what about those policemen that raped that woman?  were your parents secret police for yanukovch?</p>
<p>the country where your parents liked to live and were happy was rated<br />
144th in non-corrupt countries, right down there with central afican<br />
dictatorships, so your family must have been getting some good stuff,<br />
helping repress people there.</p>
<p>your pro-putin friends and family?  where they the ones that were holding all those placards of stalin and flags of the soviet union before they ran away from normal ukrainians who didn&#8217;t want to live under another soviet dicatorship?</p>
<p>where do you live now?  crimea?  why not move to crimea?  or russia?<br />
you do know your neo-soviet buddies that took over crimea are now sending dissenters to moscow for interrogation don&#8217;t you?  that&#8217;s how you want others to live, huh?</p>
<p>a small portion of the protesters were bandera supporters, but you continue to concentrate on that few, just like the good little putin-gandist that you are.<br />
are you getTing paid for this?  if putin and his criminals can take over russia again, will your parents get a lot of money?  will they be appointed mayor of some town, then be able to rip it off and run it like, well, like yanukovch ran ukraine before he fled to russia?</p>
<p>oh, and you don&#8217;t like bandera?  why, because he fought both the germans and your friends, the russians?  why because he wanted to have ukraine for ukranians?  you want ukraine to be for neo-soviet russians&#8230;..</p>
<p>you are either lying for free, lying as part of the 12,000 ruble putin-ganda army, or are exceeding ignorant and being used as a useful idiot.</p>
<p>here are your paid kolorado protesters in eastern ukraine.<br />
are they paying you in this picture?  your family getting that cash?</p>

Yes? No? I say we did not authorize any of the overthrows of nations all over the world.</p>
<p>BUT, are we are responsible for our government? Is it our duty to stop the people who are fleecing us of our wealth (taxes) and using that wealth for their world domination plans? Of course it is. The constitution says so. Common sense says so. YOU do know, they are billing the tab to us, the USA debt. We own the cost of our leaders running rampart all over the world. Man alive, you would think the Generals and other military leaders would stand up and get the people involved. YES? </p>
<p>Where will this insanity stop? I read in another comment on another press release yesterday, concerning homosexual marriage ,  one writer said, the Christians need to rounded up and sent to some island. I can see Christians being persecuted as the prophecy says. OMG!</p>
<p>So, my question is this? Will there come a day when Christians ( the men and women fighting for decency) will be run into buildings and burnt or even into ditches and shot? Will it happen? Most people know the powers that be (the Illuminati gangs run by the Rothschild, Morgan, Chase and Rockefeller Banksters) are causing the American people to be broker, poorer, and unable to earn a living. The consolidation of everything to farming (largely foods coming from China and tainted with lead, arsenic, etc) , manufacturing sent to China, India, etc. which is done by slave labor (communist) , etc. The spying on everyone 24/7 and poisoning us by sky spraying and chemicals in the water, etc.</p>
<p>The New World Order Folks solution?, make the USA a communist nation ( the new world order) and hence, bring back some manufacturing and farming. Everybody will be required to be tagged (666) and monitored 24/7. YOU slave and them Master, welcome to the NEW AGE!</p>
<p>What&#8217;s going on in the world right now is all a plan, a hundred plus year old plan. There are thousands of books written and many insiders confessed to these atrocities caused by the monstrosities (DNA defective bio-electric humans) who run the world, the Lucifer worshipers. Don&#8217;t think so? Look up Alex Jones and the Bohemian Grove, your leaders dress up in long robes, naked and gay men shipped in, and then they toss a baby into a burning fire. LOOK this up! OMG!</p>
<p>One has to wonder how the human race got so diseased? Has it been infected by the reptilian DNA, the so called aliens visiting earth? Hey? I am just asking? YOU, are you asking how &amp; why ?<br />
Don&#8217;t you even care? What decent human would not care? Only a soulless human or maybe a human possessed by demons? The world on the street is , (many say) yes, it&#8217;s all true but there is nothing we can do, so let&#8217;s just party til it happens. Yes, that&#8217;s what I have heard said. YOU? Is this what YOU think? One lady, holding her grandchild, said, I&#8217;ll be dead before it happens. HUH? What about the child I thought? What about the next generations? Don&#8217;t people care? HUH?</p>
<p>I know, many good people out there see this also. YOU need to stand up and say wrong is wrong.<br />
The concept of the hunger games movie is insane? Miley Cryus ( the children&#8217;s cartoon star) tuned porno queen, riding a wreaking ball naked and placed on youtube for your children to see, is insane.<br />
Forcing homosexuality and bisexuality, adultery on is all is insane? Yes?</p>
<p>The people in the Ukrain who are murdering their neighbors will pay the price. No one gets off Earth alive. We all answer to our maker. Standing by and doing nothing is almost as bad as being the perpetrators. If NOT YOU and I, all of us, then who stands up for the people&#8217;s rights and fights the wrong doers? WHO? Will some one fight our battle for us? There is one! God! Turn to God and pray.</p>

<p>I saw the live streams, from the first clashes in the streets of Odessa till the arrest of the survivors of the fire. Yes, most of the shooting I have seen came from the pro-Russian side. A few times I thought it was justified, like when they were surrounded from three sides, the Ultras were throwing petrol bombs and then they drove a fire engine into the the pro-Russian side. At that moment I was thinking: shoot that driver or it will be a massacre. Then two guys appeared on the roof and fired a few shots at the crowd which retreated. Police arrived, seemed like it was over, then in the next street they came across a guy leaving the building, he was stopped by the police, don&#8217;t know if he made it out alive, five police men and a crowd of hundreds throwing punches at him, the cameraman (woman?) decided to go film somewhere else.<br />
Later other video like the one above came to light showing more shooting from the pro-Russian side. </p>
<p>If it had stopped there, they would have been to blame for all the deaths. But the Ultras decided to &#8220;clean Odessa&#8221;, and they went to the union building, attacking people, most of whom weren&#8217;t involved in the earlier clashes, they burned the tents, chased them inside, and threw literally hundreds of petrol bombs at the building. People on the roof threw a few as well, and there was gun fire, but from both side. For the Kiev government to claim that one petrol bomb started the fire and killed all these people is a cynical scam, these people were going to burn, if someone had managed to put out the first ten fires inside, it still wouldn&#8217;t have made a difference. And what happened in those last few hours was the most sickening spectacle I&#8217;ve ever seen. Cheering when people burned, when they jumped, the ones who survived the fall were clubbed to death, people who wanted to help, who received phone calls from inside the building were attacked, and when finally they were allowed to help, the wounded were beaten and kicked, interrogated, and pushed in police vans. Not one of the other side was arrested. </p>
<p>All the dead were Ukrainians, among the 172 arrested there were only five foreigners. So please don&#8217;t give me that bulls**t about good Ukrainians vs. bad Russians, </p>
<p>i saw 13 year old girls collecting stones for the pro-Ukrainian side, I saw older girls pouring petrol bombs, I saw scum celebrating while people burned, just like their ancestors did in Khatyn and hundreds of other villages. That was their speciality, lock all the villagers in a barn and set it on fire, shoot the ones that manage to get out. And every year in Lviv, they have a parade to remember those Ukrainian SS battalions. I don&#8217;t want those people to walk my streets, they should never be allowed to join the EU.</p>

<p>for non putin-gandists and useful idiots, stuff like this shouldn&#8217;t be that hard to figure out:</p>
<p>1.  ukraine was very poor due to their extremely pro putin<br />
government.<br />
2.  ukrainians wanted no more living under soviet style repression and abuse.<br />
3.  the revolted and booted out their corrupt govt, that fled back to moscow.<br />
4.  russia is a large mexico, corrupt to the core whose biggest exports are gas and their youth.<br />
5.  russia wants the energy resources from ukraine and a percentage of the profits from the corruption going on down there.<br />
6.  if ukraine breaks free of the corrupt soviet style domination from russia, so will belarus and possibly other nations that russia thwarted before (chechnya, georgia) or new ones (khazakstan. etc/ .</p>
<p>that&#8217;s this fight, nothing more, nothing less.</p>

<p>I understand and agree that Ukraine is trying to break free from a very oppressive Russia and they should be able to do that. I also worry about who is trying to help them though. Have you thought about the possibility that maybe the propaganda from both sides is right? That maybe even though the Russians are guilty, so is the west? I think it&#8217;s interesting that people on both sides accuse the other of listening to the &#8220;obviously completely false&#8221; propaganda of the other and so they don&#8217;t even bother looking into it. I feel like a lot of people on this site are only pro-Putin because they look at the west side and see it as wrong so by default Putin must be right. I think you should look into the idea that both sides against the best interests of Ukraine. If it&#8217;s the case then you would be able to convince people that Russia is a bad guy while staying on their side (something that makes people actually listen instead of just argue). </p>
<p>Just my two cents. I see everywhere people arguing on the internet and half the time they want the same thing they just don&#8217;t realize they are on the same side.</p>

yes, i have thought there could be propaganda on both sides.  that is why i take into consideration the sources for the information out there.  i know anything out of russia is propaganda due to how putin and his pet duma (congress) have turned the screws down on outside information and their media are in fact owned by the government, which is putin and his organization.<br />
do some research on it and you can find out how and many examples of how not to trust russian media.</p>

<p>anyway, i try to default to people on the local level and have been conversing with some of them there.  looking at the situation there, i&#8217;ll stick to what the ukrainian nationalist believe, &#8220;ukraine for ukrainians&#8221;.  let them decide and being a possession of putin&#8217;s russia will do nothing but enslave them.</p>

I sometimes think that it would be worthwhile to make a comprehensive report on as many new sites as possible, telling what subjects each outlet will tell the truth on, and what each outlet will propagandize. Then I remember how long it would take and that I wouldn&#8217;t get paid and scrap the Idea.</p>
<p>I agree though, &#8220;Ukraine for Ukrainians&#8221; is probably the best bet, they were obviously being controlled by russia before the revolution. I just worry that the people freeing them from russia will turn out to be just as bad if not worse.</p>

<a href="http://larussophobe.wordpress.com/putinmurders/" rel="nofollow">http://larussophobe.wordpress.com/putinmurders/</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Ukraine for Ukrainians&#8221; is probably the best bet, they were obviously being controlled by russia before the revolution.&#8221;</p>
<p>i always default to the individual and their nation.  iirc, ukraine is on their third &#8216;revolution&#8217; and i think they will finally get the structure (political) set up right and get good people in there as they&#8217;ve never had their corrupt government do this much beatings and killings en masse (maidan).</p>
<p>i trust nothing out of russia as they&#8217;ve clamped down so much on the the media there, they own it.  well, come to think of it, they do.  and they have filters for their own people viewing the internet, just like china does.</p>
<p>i know there are paid putin-gandists on the internet.  they&#8217;re referred to as the 12,000 ruble army as that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re paid.  i have a link to them.</p>
