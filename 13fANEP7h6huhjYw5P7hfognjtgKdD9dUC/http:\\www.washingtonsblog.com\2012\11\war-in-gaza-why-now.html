<h3 style="color: #000099;">Election Politics?</h3>
<p>It was widely <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/28/us-iran-nuclear-israel-idUSBRE88R0GJ20120928">reported</a> that Israel agreed to delay any war against Iran until after U.S. elections.</p>
<p>A little over a week after the election, Israel launched a &#8220;targeted assassination&#8221; against the leader of Hamas (who Haaretz called <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-killed-its-subcontractor-in-gaza.premium-1.477886/israel-killed-its-subcontractor-in-gaza.premium-1.477886">Israel&#8217;s subcontractor in Gaza</a>). That is what started the current round of fighting.</p>
<p>Professor Michel Chossudovsky <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-invasion-of-gaza-part-of-a-broader-us-nato-israel-military-agenda-towards-a-scenario-of-military-escalation/5311957">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>On November 14,  Hamas military commander Ahmed Jabari was murdered in a Israeli missile attack. In a bitter irony,  barely a few hours before the attack, Hamas received  <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israeli-peace-activist-hamas-leader-jabari-killed-amid-talks-on-long-term-truce.premium-1.478085">the draft proposal of a permanent truce</a> agreement with Israel.</p>
<p>“Hours before Hamas strongman Ahmed Jabari was assassinated, he received the draft of a permanent truce agreement with Israel, which included mechanisms for maintaining the cease-fire in the case of a flare-up between Israel and the factions in the Gaza Strip.”(<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israeli-peace-activist-hamas-leader-jabari-killed-amid-talks-on-long-term-truce.premium-1.478085">Haaretz, November 15, 2012</a>)</p>
<p>The targeted assassination  of  Ahmed Jabari was followed by an extensive bombing campaign under Operation Pillar of Cloud.  The latter consists of a carefully planned military endeavor.</p>
<p>F-16 fighter planes, Apache helicopters and unmanned drones were deployed. Israeli naval forces deployed along the Gaza shoreline were  involved in extensive shelling of civilian targets.</p>
<p>Israel’s defense minister Ehud Barack has confirmed a scenario of military escalation, blaming Palestine for having committed acts of aggression: .</p>
<p>“[t]he provocations we have suffered and the firing of rockets to the southern settlements within Israel have forced us to take this action. I want to make clear that Israeli citizens will not suffer such actions. The targets are to hit the rockets and to harm the organization of Hamas.”</p>
<p>The Israeli attacks were followed by the firing of dozens of rockets by Hamas against Israel.</p>
<p>Palestine’s response was known to Israeli war planners. The resulting Israeli civilian casualties are now being used to justify military escalation on humanitarian grounds.</p>
<p>What we are dealing with is a carefully planned operation, a clear act of provocation. The deaths of Israeli civilians (envisaged and foreseen by IDF military planners) are being used to muster the support of the Israeli  public.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Israeli attack is casually portrayed by the Western media as part of a legitimate counter-terrorism agenda.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Rabbi Arthur Waskow agrees that Israel <a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/Gaza-Israel-Violence-The-by-Rabbi-Arthur-Wasko-121116-181.html">started the fighting</a>.  Glenn Greenwald notes that America&#8217;s targeted assassination policy is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/15/israel-gaza-obama-assassinations">identical</a> to that of Israel.  This could escalate quickly.  Not only are Israel and Hamas exchanging rocket fire &#8211; with casualties of children on both sides -  but Israel is calling up <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4306867,00.html">75,000 reserve soldiers</a> ahead of a possible ground invasion of Gaza.)</p>
<p>Israel is holding its own elections in January.  Many commentators <a href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2012/11/16/272655/israel-unleashes-terror-as-vote-looms/">say</a> that the attacks on Gaza are a cynical ploy by the Israeli Prime Minister to win re-election:</p>
<blockquote><p>Netanyahu was accused by left-wing opposition Hadash party MP Mohammed Baraka [the leader of the Israeli <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/hadash-party-reelects-barakeh-as-chairman/">Hadash</a> opposition party] of &#8220;making another round in a circle of blood for cynical political interests&#8221; and &#8220;speculating in the blood of the Palestinian people.&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn denounced the regime, saying that &#8220;once again Israel has wantonly attacked the people of Gaza, bombing and killing.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is effectively a first world state attacking a poor and largely defenceless population. It looks like a rerun of Operation Cast Lead,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The timing is interesting and it looks like Netanyahu is creating a crisis to ensure his re-election”, the MP added.</p></blockquote>
<p>Leading German newspaper Spiegel <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-hidden-risks-of-israel-s-offensive-in-the-gaza-strip-a-867484.html">reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hoping the offensive in the Gaza Strip wins his Likud party more votes in January&#8217;s election.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>&#8220;When the cannons roar, we see only Netanyahu and Barak on the screen, and all the other politicians have to applaud them,&#8221; wrote the daily <em>Haaretz</em> in a commentary published Thursday. &#8220;The assassination of (Hamas&#8217; top military commander Ahmed) Jabari will go down in history as another showy military action initiated by an outgoing government on the eve of an election.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, one can conclude that the most recent offensive against militants in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip&#8211; which started Wednesday with the killing of Jabari &#8212; has been conceived as more of a show fight for the Israeli public than the beginning of a decisive battle.</p></blockquote>
<p>And Asia times <a href="http://atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/NK17Ak04.html">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>So why snuff out al-Jabari? Simple. Israel goes to the polls in January. Thus emerges Bibi&#8217;s political campaigning in full-action mode. Campaign motto: Let&#8217;s kill Palestinians. With such thrills on offer, any other Israeli political voice &#8211; even slightly dissenting &#8211; is drowned. </p></blockquote>
<h3 style="color: #000099;">Precursor to War with Iran?</h3>
<p>The top British Rabbi &#8211; when asked by the BBC on his thoughts on what’s really going on in Gaza right now &#8211; replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think it has got to do with Iran, actually.</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/r8mdCWNY-g8" frameborder="0" width="725" height="408"></iframe></p>
<p>Why Iran?</p>
<p>Anti War <a href="http://antiwar.com/blog/2012/11/14/is-israel-escalating-war-on-gaza-to-foil-us-iran-deal/">lays out</a> one theory:</p>
<blockquote><p>This escalation occurs just days after widespread reports about newly reelected Obama mulling a grand bargain with Iran over its disputed nuclear program. Barbara Slavin and Laura Rozen at Al-Monitor <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2012/al-monitor/usirantalks.html">reported</a> on Monday that US officials told them Washington was considering offering a “more for more” deal with Iran, based on the fuel swap deal from Obama’s first term.</p>
<p>So what does Israel’s impending war on defenseless Gaza have to do with Iran diplomacy? Here’s <a href="https://twitter.com/thomaserdbrink/status/268745034973708289">a tweet</a> from the Tehran bureau chief for the <em>New York Times</em>, Thomas Erdbrink:</p>
<blockquote><p>Forget ANY <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23Iran">#Iran</a>-US talks if conflict in Gaza escalates</p>
<p>— Thomas Erdbrink (@ThomasErdbrink) <a href="https://twitter.com/ThomasErdbrink/status/268745034973708289" data-datetime="2012-11-14T15:59:44+00:00">November 14, 2012</a></p></blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://twitter.com/thomaserdbrink/status/268748021574017025">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23Iran">#Iran</a> leaders can never be seen as talking to US, while its “eternal” ally Israel assassinates Iran’s ideological allies</p>
<p>— Thomas Erdbrink (@ThomasErdbrink) <a href="https://twitter.com/ThomasErdbrink/status/268748021574017025" data-datetime="2012-11-14T16:11:36+00:00">November 14, 2012</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I suspect this point was not lost on the Israeli leadership, either. So, is Netanyahu knowingly escalating military tensions in order to avoid a successful diplomatic overture? I’m speculating, but it isn’t far fetched. We know from extensive reporting, mainly in Israeli media, that in 2010 – just as President Obama requested a freeze on Jewish settlements in the West Bank with the aim of resuming peace talks – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu <a href="http://antiwar.com/blog/2012/11/08/netanyahu-sought-to-provoke-iran-war-drag-in-us-in-2010/">tried to provoke Iran into a war with Israel</a> that would eventually drag in the United States.</p>
<p>It reminds me of what former CIA Middle East analyst Paul Pillar <a href="http://www.nationalinterest.org/blog/paul-pillar/netanyahus-game-the-two-gulfs-7721">referred to this week as</a> “Netanyahu’s tension-stoking brinksmanship: to divert attention from continued Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory and inaction on the festering Israeli-Palestinian conflict.” “[T]he Iran issue,” Pillar has <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/blog/paul-pillar/the-increasingly-transparent-us-israeli-conflict-interest-6712">previously written</a>, provides a “distraction” from international “attention to the Palestinians’ lack of popular sovereignty.” Now the situation seems reversed: Israel is escalating war with Gaza to maintain deadlock with their favorite scapegoat, Iran.</p>
<p>Israel, lest we forget, <a href="http://antiwar.com/blog/2012/11/11/israels-latest-assault-on-gaza-the-lie-of-who-started-it/">instigated</a> this resumption of missile exchanges last week when two Palestinian civilians were shot and killed and Israeli tanks intruded into Gaza, prompting Gaza militants to respond by targeting Israeli soldiers, which then gave Israel an excuse to unleash successive airstrikes. And Israel had numerous chances to pacify the situation, considering Hamas publicly <a href="http://news.antiwar.com/2012/11/12/gaza-factions-call-for-permanent-armistice-with-israel/">offered to establish a total ceasefire</a> and Egypt <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/14/us-palestinians-israel-hamas-idUSBRE8AD0WP20121114">appeared about to broker a truce</a> between the two. Israel has intentionally inched towards escalation from the beginning. Are we to believe this isn’t strategic?</p></blockquote>
<p>A second theory is that this is a prelude to an Israeli attack on Iran.   Specifically, some theorize that Israeli is trying to assassinate top Hamas militants before hitting Iran &#8230; so that Iran&#8217;s proxy Hamas cannot retaliate.</p>
<p>A third theory is that Israel is <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/09/will-israel-launch-a-false-flag-against-iran-to-start-war.html">trying to drag Iran into a war</a>.  Given that Israeli treatment of Palestinians is perhaps the key source of hostility towards the current Israeli administration in the Arab world, starting a war in Gaza may be an attempt by Israeli to drag Iran into war.</p>
<p>After all, Iran backs Hamas, and Israel just assassinated a top Hamas leader after making an overture of peace to him.  So some believe that Israel is attempting to poke the hornet&#8217;s nest in an attempt to justify wider war.</p>
<p>By provoking Hamas into attacking, Israel might point to Hamas-backer Iran. Specifically, Israel may claim that pre-emptive strikes on Iran are &#8220;necessary&#8221; to undermine Hamas and make sure it doesn&#8217;t obtain &#8220;weapons of mass destruction&#8221;.</p>

This started with the attack in Sudan &#8211; a facility supposedly funded by Iran that produced and stored longer range Fajr missiles for Hamas. What is going on here is Hamas was coming into possesion of longer range missiles that Israel viewed as a strategic threat, and this operation was undertaken to prevent this. There was also pressure building on Netanyahu to restore some sense of normalcy to life for the residents of the South of Israel, people who have been living a nightmare for far too long. While Netanyahu lost some ground in the polls recently, he was still quite a shoe-in for PM in the next election. Just weeks ago he was boasting how he avoided getting Israel involved in any wars. He was dragged into this by circumstances.</p>

The Palestinians have been enduring a 64 year Holocaust with no end in sight . There will never be a peace treaty because of Israels intention to restore the Biblical Borders of the Kingdom of David and Solomon . [ Clearly stated by Prime Minister  David Ben Gurion in 1956 and again by P.M. Ariel Sharon in 1993. ]  Therefore non stop  WAR is necessary .

For a smart guy with the financials, you&#8217;re not too smart on the historical and political.  You&#8217;ve bought the narrative from the leftists and holywoodites spewing their false rhetoric and imbecile knowledge of the Israel-Arab relationship.  Palestine, by the way was never on Jewish land nor did they ever have a right to it.  It was unoccupied from 1917-1948 when the UN declared Israel a state.  Better bone up on this issue and stop towing the liberlals&#8217; biased and dangerous rhetoric</p>

Somehow in the last few decades it has come to mean (to most people who settle for education by mass media) a ficticious area of Israel supposedly settled by Arab-only Palestinians. Archaeology shows that the area was settled by Jews. Yes both Jews and Arabs have lived there as nomadic peoples for centuries but it was settled and cities were built and the land was cultivated by Jews. Arab peoples have freedom and can vote as Israeli citizens in democratic Israel. Let a Jew go to pretty much any of the surrounding Islamic countries and try to participate and see what happens.</p>

Why not tell the world the truth and admit that you will never rest until Israel is destroyed. By the way it is rabbis and not rabies. This whole conflict can be resolved if only the idiot Muslim fanatical fringe admits that Israel has a right to exist. Israel will be more than happy to work hand in hand with Palestinians for each others mutual benefit. Will this happen? No! Why? Because the lunatics that call for the destruction of Israel control the thoughts of the majority of well intentioned Palestinians who want nothing more than peace and a right to have a safe and peaceful life for their children. It&#8217;s funny that in 1948 there was a two state solution that was refused by the Palestinians at the urging of their so called brothers in arms. You would think that after all these years the Palestinians would &#8220;get it&#8221; and realize that the solution was always in front of them. Break away from the fanatical fringe of the Muslim world and work hand in hand with Israel. Israel would be more than happy to work with Palestinians if their safety was assured.</p>

They GIVE UP terrorist prisoners to try to buy peace. They THROW their own peoples off their land and out of their houses to try to buy peace. BUT the palestinians who are in the radical minority wont have any part of it. they and hamas and other groups want Israel destroyed and that is their goal. IF their goal was peace, it is right in front of them. Just agree that Israel has a right to exist. Simple. And yes I have been there. And yes i have seen the many evidences of LONGTIME settlement there by the Jewish people</p>

day. But every body knows it, even though western media fails to report about<br />

You&#8217;re the one that needs to wake up. Israel clearly wants to dominate the mid-east and re-establish an empire that existed there 2,000 years ago, probably even world-wide. That&#8217;s the whole political and philosophical underpinning of the Israeli state and that&#8217;s why they went there to begin with. In order to survive as a nation, Israel will have to become more radical and more militarized as their population grows within confined borders. That&#8217;s an essential part of Jewish identity and without that belief there&#8217;s no reason for Israel to exist.</p>

<p>“Israel cannot do to Iran what Bibi wants done to Iran. Only Obama can. If there is no US attack on Iran by November, and Obama wins, there may never be a US attack on Iran. No wonder Bibi is frustrated,” Patrick J. Buchanan, Anti-War, April 17, 2012. </p>
<p>“Israel does not want to do it. For as long as I can remember, the Israelis have been trying to get US to do it, because they have long believed that Iran was so big that only a big country could successfully take on the mullahs in a direct confrontation. So Israel’s Iran policy has been to convince us to do whatever the Israelis think is best. And while they’re willing to do their part, they are very reluctant to take on the entire burden,&#8221; Michael Leeden, Zionist historian and co-founder of JINSA.</p>

In 1948 when Israel was established, a few things happened. 1:  About 700,000 Jews across the whole middle east were promptly thrown out of their homes and their property confiscated.   They were allowed by Israel to move there instead and become citizens.   2: About 800,000 Arabs in Israel were told to leave by the surrounding arab countries, who told them that the Jews would kill them all if they stayed, and promising to arm them and support them in driving the Jews back into the sea.   3.  The effort to invade Israel failed.   The arabs that had been misled by their fellows were then kept in those border camps by their arab allies.   They were not allowed citizenship or allowed to move to any of the other Arab countries that had promised them help.  4.  The Arabs that had stayed in Israel however, became full citizens.   They mix freely in society, they can vote, the serve in the Knesset, their women can drive cars and walk around without their husbands, and gays are not executed.</p>

They remind me of die hard racists in Apartheid South Africa who blindly justified their human rights abuses with similar vitriol. From what I can gather from other sources, Obama is in negotiations with Iran to drop sanctions and the Pentagon is against war with Iran. I do believe this is the core motivation behind Israel&#8217;s aggression. There is also a growing anti- Israel sentiment in the USA. where people are very tired of being led by the nose by Zionists in their congress and controlling their banking system and using Americans and American military to fight senseless wars under false pretenses in the Middle East. Iran would be such an example following on from the 9/11 lie which led to Afghanistan and the WMD lie which led to Iraq. Gaza and the West bank are no more and no less that a Holocaust perpetrated against a people whose only crime is to have lived in Palestine for many, many generations, going back thousands of years. The Zionists on the other hand, Eastern European Khazar converts to  Judaism have no such claim.</p>

The fact is that yes they do smuggle weapons into Gaza and yes they do and have been firing rockets into Israel almost non stop. I have been there and have seen it for myself. There is also another fact that somehow goes unreported. If it were not for Israel allowing Palestinians into Israel to work on a daily basis there would be even more poverty in so called Palestine. There is a large arab population in Israel that have full rights including the right to vote. They are represented in the Kinnesset.The arab majority has even elected a Jewish mayor in one town. Does this sound like they have problems in Israel? The simple fact is that all the Palestinians have to do is allow Israel the right to exist and work hand in hand with Israel to make for a better life for all. I have a better solution for this mess and I am amazed that nobody has thought about this. Take everybody who is a so called Palestinian out of the West Bank and Jerusalem and give them land equal in size connected to Gaza and make that their homeland. Jerusalem will always be an open city if it is controlled by Israel and the simple fact is that it would not be if it were controlled by Muslims. This is a much more simple solution to the Arab Israeli problem. If you giive Palestine land that is connected along Gaza and they have acces to the sea then they can have deep water ports to allow for their success.</p>

The recent dramatic shift in the Egyptian political regime is not to be overlooked here, especially when geography clearly illustrates access from Egypt to Gaza.  In addition is a much more vague perspective that has to do with the unfolding back story of what actually happened in Ben Gazi on 11-Sep-2012 (we may never know the truth).  It seems that one comment down-thread from the contributor called &#8221; In and out of the safe room&#8221;  alludes to a particular supply chain out of Sudan &#8212; I for one would like to see more information on that as it might provide better insight into what is actually happening from the larger perspective.  All of that said, I am inclined to think that the focus of GW&#8217;s article (including embedded supporting links) is plausible from a political and timing perspective.</p>

And yes, they can see the missiles coming from the backyards of the mosques and kindergartens and hospitals and private residences, but can&#8217;t take them out for fear of harming civilians. (That&#8217;s what a ground incursion will be designed to fix.)  Hamas knows this and has no qualms at all about putting their civilians in harm&#8217;s way, but they also know that Israel won&#8217;t target civilians and civilian infrastructure like they do.  The bombers are terrorists because they do not target military installations.  They shoot into residential neighborhoods and shopping districts for no other reason than to terrorize the civilian population.</p>
<p>I am one Israeli who is not proud of my government&#8217;s warped sense of morality and &#8220;purity of arms.&#8221;  I think it&#8217;s sick that they prefer our own innocents to suffer.  The Gazans voted for Hamas and they are culpable for what Hamas does from their backyards.

Of far more interest to me is the plethora of pro-zionist comments (filling up the screen) on a site that has consistently shown itself to be anti-zionist. i.e. it indicates an ORGANIZED CAMPAIGN, designed to manage &#8220;the debate,&#8221; sustain the propaganda, and so on.</p>

I am not pro anything other than pro peace. I am not a shill for Zionists but I am a proud American. The simple fact is that I have been to the Middle East and have witnessed for myself the simple fact that in Israel arabs have a right to vote and have representation in the Kinnesset. Can the same be said for Jews living in Muslim countries? Oh wait! There were 840000 Jews living in Muslim countries that had no rights and were persecuted on a daily basis. They lived in fear for their lives and had to risk life and limb to get the hell out of these idiotic countries. By the way there were 725000 so called Palestinians that were offered a two state solution in 1948 and they refused it. Most of these so called Palestinians were from Jordan and were kicked out and for whatever reason the world seems to feel that they are from Palestine. It amazes me that there are Americans who side with a people who want nothing more than the destruction of Israel and Americans for one reason and one reason only. Their belief in another deity. </p>
<p> Before you allow your hatred for Jews to enter into your argument I challenge you to go to Israel and see the situation for yourself. Do you think that you would be allowed to visit Jerusalem and practice your faith (if you have one) if the Muslims controlled it? With Israel in control of Jerusalem the whole  world has the freedom to visit the area that is the birth of the major religions of the world. I am not a religious zealot (I am an agnostic) but I do recognize this is one fact that cannot be denied. Give the authority over Jerusalem to Muslims and there will be no Jerusalem for the other religions of the world.</p>

Trying to see things from a different perspective occasionally is refreshing.  I guess it&#8217;s &#8220;simple&#8221; because you&#8217;ve been there&#8230;. Its not simple to get clean drinking water in Gaza. Not simple to get basic pregnancy medication and hospital equipment.

Israel waited and watched as the Hamas fired rockets exploded in the Israeli countryside and picked them out of the air with the Iron Dome until Hamas started targeting the most heavily populated area in Israel, Tel Aviv with newer longer range Iranian designed missiles. Israel cannot reason with Hamas as Hamas does not recognize Israel and only wants to kill the Israelis. How can you have a legititmate and productive conversation with someone who only wants to kill you? Have you ever wondered why the Palestinian supporters (Iran, Saudi Arabia&#8230;) have the money to send weapons, but not to provide the Palestinans with education and job skills that could be used to produce a positive effect on their society? Because if the Palestinians had happy, productive lives, they would not have their eternal discontent, calling for the eradication of Israel.

<p>The Kerem Shalom crossing between the Negev and Gaza will be open Sunday to trucks bringing medicine and food into Gaza.</p>
<p>Prior to the latest round of terrorist attacks Israel was working to boost Gaza exports through its Negev crossings. However, crossings were forced to a limited-activity status due to the security situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let them bring it through the tunnels to Egypt!! Feeding your enemy while you&#8217;re at war with them is the best way to prolong the pain.  If you&#8217;re going to fight a war, fight it and be done with it!  Bring Hamas and those who voted it into power in Gaza to its knees and make them beg for peace.  That&#8217;s how you fight a war!  War is not pretty and it&#8217;s not &#8220;humanitarian.&#8221;  It&#8217;s no kindness to enable war to go on endlessly without a clear resolution  &#8211; a clear victor and a clear loser.</p>

Israel and Jerusalem, in particular, is God&#8217;s covenant land given to the heirs of Abraham, that would be us in the land of America.  The Arabs are the instigators as well as the perpetrators who believe they will make their Mahdi messiah come quicker by provoking the Jews.  When you use only your secular mind to analyze this issue, you will always do so incorrectly.  Get biblically educated!</p>
