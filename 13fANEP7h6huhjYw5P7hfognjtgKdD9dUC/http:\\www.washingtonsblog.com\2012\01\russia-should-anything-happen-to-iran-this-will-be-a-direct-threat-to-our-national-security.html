<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Russia and China Would Consider An Attack On Iran &#8211; Or Syria &#8211; As An Attack On Their National Security<br />
</h3>
<p>RT <a href="http://rt.com/politics/syria-iran-nato-rogozin-749/">notes</a>:</p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>The escalating conflict around Iran should be contained by common  effort, otherwise the promising Arab Spring will grow into a “scorching  Arab Summer,” says Dmitry Rogozin, Russia’s deputy prime minister and  former envoy to NATO.</p>
<p>­“<em style="font-weight: bold;">Iran is our close neighbor, just south of the Caucasus. Should  anything happen to Iran, should Iran get drawn into any political or  military hardships, this will be a direct threat to our national  security</em>,” stressed Rogozin.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Rogozin is talking about (notice how close the Southern tip of Russia is to Northern Iran):</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="http://www.pakalertpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/China_Iran_Russia.jpg" src="http://www.pakalertpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/China_Iran_Russia.jpg" height="495" width="600" />
</div>
</p>
<p/>A Chinese general has also allegedly said that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-3xeP7NFRE">China would launch World War III if Iran is attacked</a>. And <a href="http://www.eutimes.net/2011/12/china-joins-russia-orders-military-to-prepare-for-world-war-iii/">see this</a>.</p>
<p>While many Americans still believe that our government would not be crazy enough to attack Iran, <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/09/does-the-american-government-consider-economic-rivalry-to-be-a-justification-for-war.html">economic</a> &#8211; not national security &#8211; considerations <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/01/are-the-middle-east-wars-really-about-forcing-the-world-into-dollars-and-private-central-banking.html">may be driving</a> the warmongers.</p>
<p>In addition, Iran and Syria have had a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/feb/17/usa.syria">mutual defense pact</a> for years. And <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/11/is-the-u-s-about-to-invade-syria-and-pick-a-fight-with-china-and-russia.html">China and Russia</a> might also defend Syria if it is attacked. So an attack on Syria could draw Iran into the war &#8230; followed by China and Russia.</p>

<p>Iran target of &#8216;false flag&#8217; strategy?</p>
<p>Perry asserts: “[an] Iranian attack on an American military vessel will serve as a justification and a pretext for a retaliatory move by the US military against the Iranian regime.” However, Perry identifies “a US aircraft carrier” as the likely target of this imagined Iranian attack.</p>
<p>We beg to differ. There are major indications that the vessel of choice is to be the USS Vincennes. The fourth USS Vincennes (CG-49) is a US Navy Ticonderoga class Aegis guided missile cruiser. On July 3, 1988, the ship shot down Iran Air Flight 655 over the Persian Gulf, killing all 290 civilian passengers on board, including 38 non-Iranians and 66 children. </p>

This was issued after Aceh, from the PLA General officer in charge of the Military Academy. </p>
<p>Fukushima may not have been natural, but it is not clear that the perpetrator was the same as in Aceh. The increased reliance of Japan on hydrocarbon fuel is noted.</p>
<p>Project Seal discovered much of the mechanics of tsunami propagation in 1945, preparatory to invading Japan. </p>

This is a war that could cause a billion or more to die.<br />
Let&#8217;s write to our heads of state/country and ask them to make a compromise. Decommission a certain number of missiles, make statements with Russia, and ensure that the world will stay in peace. Tell them that we overplay the economic situations and that things would be much, much worse in a world war.<br />
We can&#8217;t destroy ourselves before technology has a chance to truly bring us together. Tell Russia to back down on this bluff, that we need to work together.<br />
Have Obama say that he is determined to be a peacetime president. Our current wars are against terror. Yes, we go there to protect energy reserves, but we do it to ensure that terror groups don&#8217;t stop production so our world economy stays strong. We have the interests of the world in mind. We&#8217;re not going to succeed in invading each-other. Most countries have great legal systems in place that, while dissidents might tell you otherwise, are keeping the world in one of the best eras of human production ever witnessed.<br />
If we can get Obama to make another world peace speech we might get some more global credence and usher in a new era.<br />
Have him say (to make other nations take him seriously in this) that what seems like hypocrisy is the natural development of our government evolving out of our bloody human history. Then have him quote some of Carl Sagan&#8217;s &#8220;A pale Blue Dot.&#8221;</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-63735" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Russia has technology comparable to the US, they&#8217;re not a country to just simply throw bodies in the fray and hope something can be done.  There&#8217;s a reason Russia has always been regarded as a rival to the US in military might even after the fall of the Soviet Union (albeit that Russia was very much weaker after the Soviet Union&#8217;s dissolution, but Russia has come a long way since then).</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t however disregard the capability of the US, the US is capable of taking on and most likely winning any conventional war with any country.  However taking into consideration that in order to fight Russia and or China.  The US would have to cross the Atlantic or the Pacific or Both (depending on the country, such as if it&#8217;s fighting Russia it would/could cross both oceans to attack Russia)  to attack either of those nations.  The cost to get the supplies to maintain a war would be huge, as China would probably attack Japan if Japan allows itself to become a part of the war, thus the US has to maintain a strong presence there to keep Japan safe, it also has to protect Taiwan.  China has military numbers comparable to the US and I&#8217;m willing to bet tons more in reserve.  And let&#8217;s also remember that China&#8217;s military isn&#8217;t going to be charging at the US soldiers while waving the guns in the air.  Chinese soldiers are strong and capable and don&#8217;t forget well trained.  Can we compare China&#8217;s military training to the US&#8217;s military training.  That&#8217;s hard to do as China&#8217;s military ability is often kept secret, and only shown from what I&#8217;m able to find in controlled media.  The only thing that China doesn&#8217;t have to credit it&#8217;s arsenal as you said is technology, but that disadvantage is closing fast.  However if the US gets into a war with Russia as well there&#8217;s nothing stopping the two countries from working close together, which means China in a short period of time would have Russia&#8217;s designs and knowledge on the Sukoi T-50, and several other Russian techs that could close that advantage gap in technology that the US has.</p>
<p>But ultimately your right when you say that a war with Russia and China wouldn&#8217;t be a conventional war, it would be straight nuclear.</p>
<p>But ultimately I don&#8217;t think there will be a war at all as there are things that will keep those three nations from fighting each other.  One Russia, China and the US have a large enough nuclear arsenal to turn the world into a glass bulb.  Second China has a lot of US debt, and the US can&#8217;t simply just say &#8220;ah it&#8217;s no big deal&#8221; as simply putting that up in the market would crash the economy but that wouldn&#8217;t be good for both China or the US.  And ultimately the US&#8217;s financial situation wouldn&#8217;t allow it to survive such a large and catastrophic war.</p>

China and Russia have been building up their militarys for decades, while keeping quiet on the sidelines waiting for the time is right. China,  Russia, and Iran have been making trial runs at sabotaging the US infrastructures. If they succeed in destroying the US power grid first, then well, chaos and total collapse within the US. Then China and Russia&#8217;s militarys can invade at will. It can happen more ways than one, however, if they choose to take on the US and its Allies head on toe to toe, well it most likely won&#8217;t end well for China, Russia, and Iran.</p>

China has a 200 million man army with the largest war budget in the world. The Chinese actually practice with grenades a Hop Potato to train my Army vet said, something we don&#8217;t even do. They have their martial arts down pact as that&#8217;s their skill to begin with. Russia has a larger army than America&#8217;s, though lots of them are at older age. Russia has the largest cell group in the world if it mattered to them. Iran is friends with Venezuela and Cuba. Cuba is 60 miles from Florida (where I&#8217;m located) and has a missile pointed at us if we invade. This is just naming what we know publicly. It will be a great fight but I give it to Eastern Civilization, sorry.</p>

You only have to look at the history of the Yanks, Brits and Israelites, etc down the years to see this tactic in action. Personally, I&#8217;d prefer it if the Iranians had it. It might just make the military option that much too had to carry out and force the belligerents to the negotiation table. I heard George Galloway once say that it was infinitely better to &#8221;Jaw, jaw than to war, war&#8221;. I agree with him.</p>

I personally have not seen any evidence of an illegal nuclear weapons program in Iran, not even enough to substantiate a claim of probable cause and the issuance of a search warrant. Read the November 18, 2011 report from the IAEA and you&#8217;ll find only speculation and reference to an unknown &#8220;member state&#8221; that supplied an unknown cache of &#8220;documents&#8221; that raise &#8220;concnern&#8221;. One would think that the standard of proof for armed invasion would be much raise to a level higher and greater than speculation, conjecture, anonymous allegations, and unfounded accusations. Unfortuntely, things are sometimes only learned the hard way and I don&#8217;t see this ending well.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, Iran is not a nation of poor dim witted uneducated goat herders.<br />
They are a wealthy oil rich modern technologically advanced nation, capable of taking over and landing America&#8217;s most modern and sophisticated surveillance drone.</p>
<p>America always makes the mistake of attacking small defenseless countries that have massive support from larger countries. Vietnam was a perfect example, and so was  Iraq.</p>
<p>Iraq was totally destroyed by Desert Storm and had no functioning military when Bush illegally invaded .  The mighty conquering US military machine should have rolled up Iraq in one week.<br />
But a few rag head insurgents fought back and WON after ten years of warfare.<br />
How ???   Because every nation on earth was pouring money, food, weapons, training, medical aid into Iraq which went directly to the insurgents.<br />
Even countries like Australia and Canada were pouring aid into Iraq which directly put Americans into body bags.  You will never read about that in the US press, but internet research will prove the real truth of the situation in Iraq.<br />
Only Americans were sniped and road bombed, Australians and Canadians and all the other 27 nations that had uniformed military in Iraq were never attacked by insurgents.</p>
<p>An attack on Iran will just be a replay of Vietnam and Iraq.</p>
<p>China and Russia will pour money, weapons and aid into Iran even if they never become directly involved fighting the US military.  It will go on for years, and will not be the sudden overwhelming victory Americans expect it to be.</p>
<p>If the whole thing goes nuclear, both Israel and America will cease to exist.<br />
And so will every other nation on planet Earth.<br />
And all because of Zionist plotting and lies, and the gullibility of the US public.</p>
<p>Is it really worth it ?</p>

You should not be smoking that stuff.<br />
&#8220;Neither Russia or Chinas army can match the highly advanced US forces&#8221;<br />
America has not won a war in at least 65 years, (and in that one they had the Russians to thank for the eastern front, otherwise they would still be fighting the Germans.) You could not even beat the Somalis.Iran is not Grenada.<br />
There are 324 million &#8220;women&#8221; in the PLA, now add the men and see what you think will happen.<br />
Russia took just 3 days to invade and sort out Georgia, including the American and Israeli mercenaries.<br />
With the whole of NATO and over 11,00 bombing missions, you needed Qatari forces and Al Quaeda to beat the Libyan people, and it  took more than 6 months.<br />
 I know that  it is nice and warm, and makes you feel safe with your head stuck up your A****, but take it out for a while, it significantly improves your vision.</p>

The only way to make Americans want to stop war if their cities were firebombed. If the US forces were tied upand they could hit with bombers and submarines and hit New York City they could make the Americans see what war war all about. We have bases all over the place in Europe. China and Russia have none in this hemisphere and we probably wouldn&#8217;t allow any. If we wouldn&#8217;t allow any I don&#8217;t know why they allow us to put all those bases in Europe.</p>

&#8211;66 years later instead of mutual cooperation with russia, on space exploration, tech medicine ect.. they still want to take over its vast resources.

<p>It has however been involved in wars where America has been aided by other nations and won.<br />
Desert Storm is the most recent example of that.<br />
Fifty nations under the UN flag booted Saddam out of Kuwait, a great victory.  But when America invaded and occupied Iraq a second time aided only for a short time by Britain, America has now lost that war too.<br />
Yet Americans imagine their military (portrayed by Hollywood) as being invincible, the real truth of history is very different. </p>
<p>These days America is without friends or allies anywhere. Even Britain has now had enough, and cowardly little Israel has never fought beside America in any of it&#8217;s wars&#8230;&#8230; ever.</p>
<p>Do you seriously believe that America can successfully wage war against Iran, China, and Russia combined ?<br />
Both Russia and China have pledged military support for Iran, and that pledge should not be taken lightly.  The combined resources of those three huge technically advanced nuclear armed nations should not be underestimated.</p>

If your country doesn&#8217;t have a privately owned central bank you are a target. The public in the west has been programmed and dumbed down to the point they cannot figure out that the globalists have looted their countries through the banks and corrupted finanical system. At some point they will figure it out and that is why the globalists are formenting small wars to provoke a third world war. A huge war will rally the masses around their leaders and flag and make them forget about the pillaging of their respective nations. The masses need to be distracted and culled by a war so that the globalist program can reach it&#8217;s logical conclusion of a one world government. The globalists have been at this game for decades if not centuries and are quite prepared to tough it out in underground cities financed and paid for by the masses. This all plays into their philosophy of order out of chaos.</p>

There are a lot of dissatisfied Iranians right now that want the current regime gone but do you know what will cause them to unite behind their leaders?  An attack by the U.S. or Israel on Iran which will also draw in China and Russia.  The U.S. should work with the dissident groups and support them.

Our only salvation comes through Jesus Christ, God&#8217;s only Son, who was willing to die on the cross for us and pay for our sins so that we can have eternal life in Heaven.  Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sin.  Jesus paid that price.  I didn&#8217;t say this.  God said it in His Word, the Bible.

Lets bring out &#8220;Revelations.&#8221; If the same kind of stuff was in the the texts of other religions, you&#8217;d call it &#8220;fanciful&#8221; or &#8220;mythology.&#8221; And I&#8217;ve heard Christians claim Hindus are weird because they believe in a multiverse.

This enabled US influence and control over the oil supply in Iran., that the democratically elected nationalist Prime Minister was a threat to. This later in turn resulted in the overthrow of the Shah and the rise of the Ayatolahs. Who removed US control of the Iranian oil industry. They then backed and armed Saddam Hussein, who attacked Iran. After not being able to bring that war to a satisfactory conclusion, Saddam attacked Kuwait, threatening US oil supplies ultimately from Saudi Arabia and the other Emirates. So the Americans removed him. Now they are returning to the biggest resistance to US domination of the Middle East and it&#8217;s oil supply, Iran. Call me cynical if you like. hypnohotshot</p>

<p>When I read your comment I did not know whether to laugh or cry.<br />
Are you being deliberately provocative or are you abysmally misinformed? Iran has never threatened Israel or America, except in &#8220;if you attack Iran, you will suffer significant grief, as we will carry the war to you wherever you are.&#8221; (One cleric said that he wants the Zionist Regime to be wiped from the memory of man, and dumb Americans translated that to Wipe Israel off the map.)<br />
Al Qaeda was created and funded by  the CIA, it is still being used for USA purposes in Libya and Syria.<br />
The court ruling on Iran and 911 has been pilloried by every American paper and TV channel, it is a joke.<br />
South Africa had 6 atomic bombs, and did not attack anyone, Russia has thousands of nuclear weapons and has not attacked anyone, North Korea, China, Pakistan, India, Israel, France and Britain all have nuclear weapons, and have not used them. The only country to use nuclear weapons is the USA (and I include the Battle of Bagdad Airport) The only country that cannot be trusted with Nuclear Bombs is America.</p>
<p>Please do some research, beyond listening to your mainstream zionist media.<br />
Islam is not a threat to world peace, IMF, BIS, Exxon, Bank of America (and their cohorts) are the problem.</p>

<p>Let me just clarify though that civilians anywhere are not the cause of this mess. The majority of us know what we are taught, and thanks to the internet (I could side branch here about SOPA and the same warmongers are behind that but I wont) people are finally being able to branch out and really learn about the tyranny of this world. Any intelligent citizen of the United States should by now know that their country is being led by THE MONEY and in the interests of MONEY. </p>
<p>The people aren&#8217;t the problem, and of course, nobody wants to die in a war (it&#8217;s coming unfortunately whether we like it or not), but there comes a time when we as the human race: the average man needs to stand up and do something.  We can prevent this war&#8230;  but I daresay not enough people believe its coming.</p>
<p>This article is straight up PROOF that it is coming. And I&#8217;ve known about the Pact between Iran, China and Russia for months now. If America &#8211; and by America I mean the Billingburg group aka &#8220;The Company&#8221; does what history tells us they are going to do&#8230; well fuck, there goes the world as we know it.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-39940" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I was reading through the comments and saw references to America&#8217;s invasions of Vietnam, Iraq, etc, and how we apparently lost these wars.  I just wanted to make clear that invading countries like Vietnam and Iraq is different than going to war with countries like China, Russia, and Iran.  In Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan, we are fighting more-or-less against guerrilla tactics &#8211; enemies running around in a country filled with relatively complacent civilians and weak bogus central governments.  If America wanted to, it could light up these entire countries within a couple of days and &#8220;win the war&#8221;.  However, we don&#8217;t do so due to civilians, etc.  We are not fighting the country as a political entity &#8211; we are fighting insurgents.  On the other hand, Iran, China, and Russia are all developed, prominent countries with strong governments and that do have a lot to lose.  Therefore, going to war with them (hopefully not) would be a different matter and would be more like a conventional war.  And the fact of the matter is that America has the edge in terms of conventional warfare.</p>

<p>Maybe if America had nuked China in the early 50s they might have been on to something. But there&#8217;s nothing America can do about China now. It&#8217;s like standing next to a younger, bigger boned brother blessed with better genes, who&#8217;s still smaller than you now, but who&#8217;s definitely going to grow much bigger than you in a few years time. It&#8217;s just a gone case. You&#8217;re doomed to inferiority ultimately. Face it.</p>
<p>Stop wasting time and resources trying to contain China. America will only bankrupt itself faster doing that. Just start learning some humility and submit to destiny. Like Britain once did.</p>

I live in Alabama. Does this make me an illiterate redneck? The mass media is losing its hold on us rapidly. CNN, FOX, and even local news stations are seeing, on average, a 50% or more decrease in viewers as of late. We are awake. We are not as ignorant as you might like to believe. The war machine is run by China, Russia, and the corporations, as well as the U.S. and Europe. It&#8217;s not about who could win the war. The reality is that everyone loses. Except, of course, the illuminati. Or whatever the hell they go by. The only way to fight it is to stick it to those evil corporations and corrupt governments. Here&#8217;s just a few that I, as an American, know of; The Monsanto Food Corporation, the World Heath Organization, The United Nations, Big Pharmaceuticals, the Mainstream Media, Congress, and the Senate. I&#8217;m sure that you in your respective countries can name a few more localized to you. Why not lead this divided conversation into a much more intelligent, united dialogue? </p>
<p>      As a  post-script note, I am a Christian (Damn proud to be). I would like to encourage you all to look into religion. God is God no matter what the book. It&#8217;s not about your bible as much as it&#8217;s about the relationship you have with Him. You don&#8217;t need a book to feel Him. When you have Him in your life, the line between good and evil that has been distorted by those who wish to control and abuse becomes vividly clear.</p>

History&#8217;s oppressors, the pharoes, romans, where did they migrate to? When &#8216;leaders&#8217; of nations proclaim supremacy, might, de facto rulers of the World, well my friends, we only have to look at history to see what happened to their predecessors.<br />
Anyone who still defies the existence of the supreme creator is a plain ignorant and stupid creature. Now you wanna believe you came, or &#8216;evolved&#8217;, from apes, I say those that defy seem to have been derailed a few stages back in their so called &#8216;evolution&#8217;. And to say something came out of nothing? Well, why even go there!<br />
Iran is very rational and those who say otherwise are irrational, as it seems a lot of their so called &#8216;facts&#8217; come from the well-proven and corrupt, spoon feeding media. All those who want to believe Russia, China and Iran are weak, well, just wait for it. The battle between good and evil has played since known time.<br />
Who was it that had the mighty, 9000 year old Persian empire and the long standing powerful eastern Roman Byzantine empire on their knees simultaneously? The 2 superpowers of their day who were crushed by a nation who brought to the World the Golden Age. They were known as the nomads from the desert, which has spread into the greatest and fastest growing nation in the World. Just a factual proven reference to illustrate.<br />
Israel will need to advance it&#8217;s borders to the biblical frontiers and then we shall see the emergence of their awaited one.<br />
Events now will unfold into their endgame soon, something that was set into motion centuries back. And do not underestimate the followers of the ultimate Sovereign One, followers who also annihilated the Mongolian advance and the barbaric Crusaders. It is destiny. Peace to all those true People of the Book, and the rest, well hope they find purpose soon!</p>

If there was a proper invasion they wouldn&#8217;t play games like we are doing, they wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about what the world said. Like if we were to use tanks against citizens of Iraq that wanted us out. When use of small arms by us soldiers against protesters are international incidents.</p>

First of all, Russia could not have came close to Berlin had their not been the second front openng in Normandy that divided the German forces, not to mention the contribution  of equipment and money the US provided Russia. In a 1 to 1 battle between just Russia and Germany. Russia loses or perhaps a draw! The US on the other hand, unlike Russia was fighting two major world powers at the same time. The Third Reich and the Japanese Empire! In the modern age, the US has over 500 global bases including forward operating bases on the borders of both Russia and China, China who lost a border war with Vietnam has a navy that is more like a glorified coast guard that has not been able to keep the global blue water fleet of the U.S that is larger then the next 15 nations combined from making the South China Sea it&#8217;s own private lake! In war China would first have to deal with all the us allies on it&#8217;s borders, each of which would give China it&#8217;s own personal Vietnam type wars before challenging the US. forget an invasion of the US because it would be a logistical nightmare for China! The first thing that would happen is a naval blockade of all eastern Chines ports, air superiority by the US over China would soon follow from US forward operating bases. All Chinese assets in the US would be frozen. All out nuclear is highly unlikely because all sides would get it and China&#8217;s biggest concern is economic. Nuclear war would destroy that and all their efforts! They also would have to deal with India and others! There is a lot of other details I could mention but my advise to you is to pick up a book and try some critical thinking. It will make you appear brighter then simply spitting out Anti-American propaganda like any first grader can do! As far as Afghanistan goes, that&#8217;s really not a gauge  of how powerful a nation is. The Soviet Union lost there  far more then the US I might add, they also lost in small Chechnia as well! Your entire argument is flawed! Go back to school!</p>

Many other countries would be forced into pick sides and many of the Russia-China allies are located in Asia.  So a successful invasion of China is unlikely.  China may have not be as advanced as the U.S. but there man power is far superior.  Look at the Russians in WW2, they had terrible technology compared to the Germans but if 200,000 Russians died it didn&#8217;t mean much.  When you have some 3 billion people there technology can only do so much.  In Afghanistan the Russians suffered so many losses because of the U.S. supporting the Afghanistan rebels.<br />
When the U.S. entered the Afghanistan rebels didn&#8217;t receive as much support from the Russians making it easier for the U.S.&#8217;s &#8220;peacekeeping&#8221;.  I personally feel that if China and the U.S. had a trade embargo the U.S. would be the one that suffered.  If you look around your house take a look at what countries makes most of your items, the Chinese.<br />
As for the Russian technology look back at the cold war, the Russians were genius in there inventions.  If you look at it who were the first people into space, Russia.  Who took 11 tries (aprox.) to succeed in space travel?  The U.S. This is a war that would result in major losses for both sides.  No one would win, there would just be a side with a lower death toll.</p>

Keep pouring out your hollow words because you don&#8217;t have anything to back it. You hide behind the keybaord, typical third world punk. At the end of the day the thing you and the kind of people like you cannot escape is our dominance, our clear control over everything you can rest your eyes on. But, the most ironic part of this cler and obvious dominance over you is that we allow you to breath, spill your idiological bs, and still we tolerate you. When in fact, we could silence you, your nation, and your entire world as you know it. Why then do you and those like you continue to waste your energy on this? Simple, you are so confused that it frustrates you as to why our quality of life is 100 times better, why we have some of the top educational systems in the world, why we take vacations and spend our hard earned money. The truth is we make that money off your back, off your family, off your future generations because you will never be in a psoition to capitalize on &#8220;good-fortune&#8221; or comprehend true captialism. It doesn&#8217;t matter if we&#8217;re wrong, right, or evil. What matters is we own it, we control it, and we will continue to dominate the weak, while at the same time taking care of them. Billions of our hard earned money goes to nations just like yours, to care for people just like you, &#8220;rocky&#8221;. Poor, poor Rocky, Kosh, and so many other sad examples of third world punks. You have no recourse, no standing, no leverage to engage any US Citizen. Your words fall of deaf ears, the strong have no tolerance for the self deprecated and useless skin-bags like yourselves. You&#8217;ll never know freedom, justice, or life. Because your world is closed and shrouded by an ideological facade. A painting with you in it, that is nothing more than you bowing to us, not by force, but out of pure fear.</p>

Then there&#8217;s the other half of it&#8217;s citizens who are intelligent, have the ability to think for ourselves and are aware that our government is not always looking out for our best interests and that we have many problems to deal with&#8230;the main one being ignorance and self importance which seems to be prevalent among the less educated among us.  We are all citizens of this world and I wish there could be a solution for world peace and honest mutual respect for each other despite our differences. Face it, most of us want to live in peace, prosper and see our children grow up and prosper and do better than we did.  I know I want my children to leave this earth a better place than they found it.<br />

<p>Yeah answer me then whitey, why does the US have bases all over the ME, let alone the world. If your so liberal and democratic what are you doing in the ME when the people don&#8217;t want you. </p>
<p>Also tell me yankee, tell me when you guys were fighting in WWI claiming to fight for democracy you still had segregation ongoing right. In fact it continued after WWII. I think people like you need to realise, that we don&#8217;t want to stomach your crap anymore. America is surrounded by enemies, more so than the Israelis. I think White American people like you need to be REMOVED from the decision making process and everything will be fine:)</p>

<p>The fact is that Russia did acquired many german scientists after the WW2. There were some that escaped to US and most of them escaped to South America.</p>
<p>America&#8217;s ingenuity is unmatched and almost all technological advancements are invented by Americans and it&#8217;s a fact. America became number 1 because of that. America accomplished in less than 400 years than all countries in all their pathetic existence. Also another reason that America became super-power is because it was forced to join the war which America didn&#8217;t want to. And then it was fighting on two fronts unlike other countries. And you still criticize? Fuck you! Funny thing about that is that when europeans start a war is everyone&#8217;s problem but when America starts a conflict (because that&#8217;s not even close to what europeans and everyone else in the world did) it&#8217;s America&#8217;s problem&#8230; who&#8217;s the bigot and hypocrite now you stupid foreign pig.</p>
<p>And one more thing you fucking bigot. China and India are where their are because of AMERICA. It&#8217;s their products and inventions that they make. It is proven that China is the biggest thief in the world without stealing from everyone around them (mostly from Americans) they would still live in shit-holes.</p>
<p>So shut you shit-trap you dumb, uneducated, ignorant, arrogant subhuman piece of shit. But what do you expect would come out of kosh&#8217;s whore pig mother&#8230; a fucking piece of pig-shit like kosh.</p>

South Korea officially claims that they did not send any combat troops. So if you want to say the government sent some engineers and secretly they were troops, then I could buy that, but as I said the South Korean people are not interested fighting wars abroad.</p>

If we go on the offensive it becomes an act of war. Now, every potential adversary or enemy knows how to attack us for effect. Just as the Christians invaded Rome until a Caesar saw a cross of a sword Al Qaeda merely goes underground in our country the way our Revolutionary &#8216;Minutemen&#8217; waited with explosives under colonial bridges for the British to march across and be blown up. Why should we be the world&#8217;s lab rats anyway.  I say to Hell with everyone but us and if anyone wants freedom that badly they can fight for it like our forefathers did. STAY LOUT OF MY COUNTRY.</p>

No nation, country, or alliance should dictate humanity. We should work together as one conscious for our goals, not squander at what our corrupt leaders portray. Your opinions are all based on generalization, your saying because a few are bad they&#8217;re all bad. Yeah countries dominate others, they rape them of freedom and resources, but, when hasn&#8217;t that happened? When there were no countries! This is what we need one conglomerate state, a state of humanity and peace. A place to prosper and succeed and further our survival as a species.</p>

This is just big talk and no action. Do you think Israel will just sit back and let The usa be attacked and do nothing/ wrong if the Usa goes dowm so does Israel and they know that. Also same goes for France, and for sure England and even Germany. Russia and China will be asking for the end of all wars if they fire any shots at the usa, These countries want to survive and enjoy the power and might they have and they do not give a rats ass about Iran other than the money they get and make from them, but not enough to start world war 3 over. Iran better stop while their ahead meaning while they still have them attached to their bodies, what have Russia and china done when Israel bombed syria ?????? Nothing at all other then to complain about it. it is not their fight</p>

They all showed how ignorant ans arrogant they are. Firstly, it&#8217;s funny how they all think that US would be alone in this. They would not. And how Russia and China would have all that support. They would not. And if there was a WW3 every country would be pulled in, Russians and Chinese are stupid but not that stupid. Not to mention that China, according to research made by many companies from around the world, is the biggest polluter and the most hated country today&#8230; this is a fact. So not very many would actually support them. China is in pissing contest with many countries including Russia. Secondly, since this article was posted, Russia signed many agreements with the US and very few with China. Not to mention also Russia has all the military exercises with the US and none with China. Russia was also supporting the US in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan, most people don&#8217;t even know it. Putin actually said all that on television in an interview. Thirdly, US military alone is far superior to the Chinese and Russian combined. And forthly, people talk about propaganda in US but they are the ones with nothing BUT propaganda. In fact in comparison US has much less propaganda than any other country. They are so brainwashed that they believe everything they told by the propaganda filled media. At least Americans are intelligent and smart to question what they hear and see on TV unlike Chinese and Russians and pretty much everyone else in the world. And I know a bit more that anyone that posted here since I&#8217;ve lived in 6 countries in Europe, 4 countries in Asia, 5 countries in South and North America and Australia. And when I say lived I mean lived and not visited them on vacation. And of all the countries I lived in I prefer US and the Americans because, even with some faults, they are still the best people. Actually the world would be much better if everyone was like Americans. And I&#8217;m talking about people and not the government since America is the people and not its government.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-103796" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Good thing writer of article is clueless about military or the title would be frightful.</p>
<p>Truth is; Russia is on a leash and hates it. Russia know it can&#8217;t invade a NATO nation &amp; the States will in fact attack Iran before Obama leaves office &amp; there is not much Russia or China can do about it.</p>
<p>This Congress and the one to come including the President have no intention of allowing Iran to gain nukes as was allowed in North Korean. It&#8217;s know what a mistake it was allowing North Korea to build nukes while the States invaded Iraq without reason. Iraq didn&#8217;t even have a military and certainly had nothing to do with 911. Saddam was like Hitler but he was also a coward &amp; would never had done something on purpose he knew would have lead to his death.</p>
<p>The US, Russia &amp; China know that even in a world war; nukes can&#8217;t be used. This is just old fact because no one survives. Russia &amp; the States know a Cold War never really ended. Russia had less money than the States so the USSR went broke first, the States is doing so now and China reaps the rewards of that. Russia expects the States to breakup through the political division it promised it would cause in the early 60s through what most know of as talk radio and of course political divided news arguments on US TV. If the political division continues in the States; Russia might get its way on that</p>
<p>As for a world war; if one did happen it would NOT be the States attacking Iran or Syria. Israel just attacked Syria and there is no world war so case closed on that one HOWEVER; if Russia were to make the mistake of invading a NATO nation or makes the mistake of a military buildup that looks as if that is intended or the States gets trigger happy and makes a mistake there would be a world war.</p>
<p>What would happen during a real world war and who if anyone would win? To know the answers to this one must use statistics and some knowledge of who has what in military conventional means.I happen to know both these facts as do many Americans because it&#8217;s not a big secret but is hard to find. The States alone is ten times more powerful than Russia in conventional military strength while Russia has one of the best Marine force on earth. The States also has a somewhat secret defense system to prevent most ICBMs or sub launched nukes from detonating in an area that would cause more than 15% of Cities to be destroyed and remember, nukes that do damage do it in the air not hitting the ground. The most dangerous weapon is electromagnetic impulse which leaves all buildings standing but not even a car battery working for a thousand years so forget computers or electricity if that happened. That is a WMD that would not be used. 200 million Americans would die the first year.</p>
<p>In a world war; NATO, the States vs Russia, China, Iran &amp; North Korea since Syria &amp; Israel as destroyed week one. Those are the two nations that are not left standing. The Queen would declare war and only she can for UK &amp; its territories which would be on side of States &amp; NATO. The US coastal Cities would take hits like England did in WW2 with some major damage in some inland Cities such as Atlanta but not mid nation. 30 million Americans would die during such a war with the US military heavily damaged. Above ground military bases would be destroyed on coastal areas. Russia would have its military totally destroyed other than that that prevents invasion and the same with China with 50% of population of Russia taken out and 20% of that of China. Iran would be in rubble as would North Korea. Both Russia &amp; China would have more damage than they have ever had in any war but so would the States. It would last 4-5 years and Martial Law would be in effect in the States. At the end of the war; Russia and China would come out with the strength Iran has now and economies about that of Iran. The States would prevail and reconstruction would cause a boom and financial glory within the ten years post war. The States would be the only superpower and it would be called the Americas since the States would at that time rule the entire continent. All people would have rights in Americas to vote in elections that would have more than on President but all three working together. It would be the last world war and a time of peace would start and continue. There would be no major problems in the Middle East. There would not even be an Israel or Syria to bicker.</p>
<p>It would be horrible during the war but the outcome would be one Russia and China would not want and since they know how it ends there will not likely be a world war.</p>
