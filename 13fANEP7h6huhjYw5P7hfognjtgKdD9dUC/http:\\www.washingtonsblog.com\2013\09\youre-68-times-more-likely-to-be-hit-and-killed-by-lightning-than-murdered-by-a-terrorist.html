<h3 style="color: #000099;">Calm Down … You Are Much More Likely to Be Killed By Boring, Mundane Things than Terrorism</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State reports that only <em><strong><a title="17" href="http://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2011/195556.htm" target="_blank">17</a></strong></em> U.S. citizens were killed <em>worldwide</em> as a result of terrorism in 2011. That figure <em>includes</em> deaths in Afghanistan, Iraq and all other theaters of war.</p>
<p>In contrast, the American agency which tracks health-related issues – the U.S. Centers for Disease Control – <a title="rounds up" href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_06.pdf" target="_blank">rounds up</a> the most prevalent causes of death in the United States:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/CDC-Mortality-CHart.jpg" target="_blank"><img title="CDC Mortality CHart" src="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/CDC-Mortality-CHart.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="439.8" /></a></p>
<p>Comparing the CDC numbers to terrorism deaths means:</p>
<blockquote><p>– You are <a title="35,079" href="https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;gs_rn=11&amp;gs_ri=psy-ab&amp;gs_mss=596339%20divided%20by%2017%20&amp;tok=duUe66lgoeLquEDcDRFVGQ&amp;pq=596339%20divided%20by%2017%20&amp;cp=4&amp;gs_id=1ri&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=596,339+divided+by+17&amp;es_nrs=true&amp;pf=p&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;oq=596,339+divided+by+17+&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.45645796,d.cGE&amp;fp=4fb34227f337626b&amp;biw=933&amp;bih=421" target="_blank">35,079</a> times more likely to die from heart disease than from a terrorist attack</p>
<p>– You are <a title="33,842" href="https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;gs_rn=11&amp;gs_ri=psy-ab&amp;gs_mss=596%2C339%20divided%20by%2017%20&amp;tok=duUe66lgoeLquEDcDRFVGQ&amp;pq=596%2C339%20divided%20by%2017&amp;cp=7&amp;gs_id=1z0&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=575,313+divided+by+17&amp;es_nrs=true&amp;pf=p&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;oq=575,313+divided+by+17&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.45645796,d.cGE&amp;fp=4fb34227f337626b&amp;biw=933&amp;bih=421" target="_blank">33,842</a> times more likely to die from cancer than from a terrorist attack</p></blockquote>
<p>(Keep in mind when reading this entire piece that we are consistently and substantially <em>understating</em> the risk of other causes of death as compared to terrorism, because we are comparing deaths from various causes within the United States against deaths from terrorism <strong><em>worldwide</em>.)</strong></p>
<p>Wikipedia <a title="notes" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">notes</a> that obesity is a a contributing factor in <strong>100,000–400,000</strong> deaths in the United States per year. That makes obesity <em></em><a title="5,882" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=100,000+divided+by+17&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sei=Fdh8UczeI8GCjAKZkoDoAQ&amp;gbv=2" target="_blank">5,882</a> to times <a title="23,528" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=3,177+divided+by+17&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sei=mWB9UYb2KYetigKSxoHQCw&amp;gbv=2#client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&amp;gbv=2&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=5%2C882+times+4&amp;oq=5%2C882+times+4&amp;gs_l=serp.3...89576.91713.0.91876.9.8.0.0.0.0.212.1093.1j6j1.8.0...0.0...1c.1.11.psy-ab.dZ5B4cwiF2U&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.45645796,d.cGE&amp;fp=4fb34227f337626b&amp;biw=933&amp;bih=383" target="_blank">23,528</a> more likely to kill you than a terrorist.</p>
<p>The annual number of deaths in the U.S. due to avoidable medical errors is as high as <a title="100,000" href="http://www.hhs.gov/secretary/about/opeds/phillainquirer20110425.html" target="_blank">100,000</a>. Indeed, one of the world’s leading medical journals – Lancet – <a title="reported" href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2811%2960520-5/fulltext?rss=yes" target="_blank">reported</a> in 2011:</p>
<blockquote><p>A November, 2010, document from the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services reported that, when in hospital, one in seven beneficiaries of Medicare (the government-sponsored health-care programme for those aged 65 years and older) have complications from medical errors, which contribute to about <strong>180 000</strong> deaths of patients per year.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s just Medicare beneficiaries, not the entire American public. Scientific American <a title="noted" href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=deaths-from-avoidable-medical-error-2009-08-10" target="_blank">noted</a> in 2009:</p>
<blockquote><p>Preventable medical mistakes and infections are responsible for about <strong>200,000</strong> deaths in the U.S. each year, according to an investigation by the Hearst media corporation.</p></blockquote>
<p>And a new <a href="http://journals.lww.com/journalpatientsafety/Fulltext/2013/09000/A_New,_Evidence_based_Estimate_of_Patient_Harms.2.aspx">study in the current issue</a> of the Journal of Patient Safety says the numbers may be up to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/781687-john-james-a-new-evidence-based-estimate-of.html#document/p1/a117333">440,000</a> each year.</p>
<p>But let’s use the lower – 100,000 – figure. That still means that you are <em><a title="5,882" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=100,000+divided+by+17&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sei=Fdh8UczeI8GCjAKZkoDoAQ&amp;gbv=2" target="_blank">5,882</a></em> times more likely to die from medical error than terrorism.</p>
<p>The CDC says that some <a title="80,000" href="http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm" target="_blank">80,000</a> deaths each year are attributable to excessive alcohol use. So you’re <a title="4,706" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=80%2C000+divided+by+17&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" target="_blank"><em>4,706</em></a> times more likely to drink yourself to death than die from terrorism.</p>
<p>Wikipedia notes that there were <a title="32,367" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year" target="_blank">32,367</a> automobile accidents in 2011, which means that you are <em><a title="1,904" href="https://www.google.com/#output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=32%2C367+divided+by+17&amp;oq=32%2C367+divided+by+17&amp;gs_l=hp.3...1250.4280.0.4760.15.15.0.0.0.0.184.1780.7j8.15.0...0.0...1c.1.11.psy-ab.jPKlgO7qB3M&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.45645796,d.cGE&amp;fp=4fb34227f337626b&amp;biw=933&amp;bih=421" target="_blank">1,904</a></em> times more likely to die from a car accident than from a terrorist attack. As CNN reporter Fareed Zakaria <a title="writes" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/fareed-zakaria-a-better-way-for-america-to-integrate-muslims/2013/04/24/9e1ca588-ad12-11e2-b6fd-ba6f5f26d70e_story.html" target="_blank">wrote</a> last month:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Since 9/11, foreign-inspired terrorism has claimed about two dozen lives in the United States. (Meanwhile, more than 100,000 have been killed in gun homicides and more than 400,000 in motor-vehicle accidents.) “</p></blockquote>
<p>President Obama <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/08/president-obama-the-odds-of-dying-in-a-terrorist-attack-are-a-lot-lower-than-they-are-of-dying-in-a-car-accident.html">agreed</a>.</p>
<p>According to a 2011 CDC report, poisoning from prescription drugs is even <a title="more likely to kill you" href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db81.htm" target="_blank"><em>more likely</em> to kill you</a> than a car crash. Indeed, the CDC stated in 2011 that – in the majority of states – <a title="your prescription meds are more likely to kill you" href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db81.htm" target="_blank">your prescription meds are more likely to kill you</a> than <em>any other source of injury</em>. So your meds are <em>thousands of times</em> more likely to kill you than Al Qaeda.</p>
<p>The number of deaths by suicide has <a title="also surpassed car crashes" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/24/suicide-leading-cause-death-us_n_1909772.html" target="_blank">also surpassed car crashes</a>, and many connect the increase in suicides <a title="to the downturn in the economy" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/24/suicide-leading-cause-death-us_n_1909772.html" target="_blank">to the downturn in the economy</a>.

<blockquote><p>[The risk of being killed by terrorism] <a title="compares annual risk of dying" href="http://danger.mongabay.com/injury_death.htm" target="_blank">compares annual risk of dying</a> in a car accident of 1 in 19,000; <strong>drowning in a bathtub</strong> at 1 in 800,000; dying in a building fire at 1 in 99,000; or <strong>being struck by lightning</strong> at 1 in 5,500,000. In other words, in the last five years you were <strong>four times more likely to be struck by lightning than killed by a terrorist</strong>.</p>
<p>The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) has just published, <a title=" Background Report: 9/11, Ten Years Later" href="http://www.start.umd.edu/start/announcements/BackgroundReport_10YearsSince9_11.pdf" target="_blank"> Background Report: 9/11, Ten Years Later</a> [PDF]. The report notes, excluding the 9/11 atrocities, that fewer than 500 people died in the U.S. from terrorist attacks between 1970 and 2010.</p></blockquote>
<p>Scientific American <a href="blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/2011/09/07/did-the-u-s-overreact-to-the-911-attacks-undoubtedly/">reported</a> in 2011:</p>
<blockquote><p>John Mueller, a political scientist at Ohio State University, and Mark Stewart, a civil engineer and authority on risk assessment at University of Newcastle in Australia &#8230; contended, “a great deal of money appears to have been misspent and would have been far more productive—saved far more lives—if it had been expended in other ways.”</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/files/2011/09/risk.chart_2.jpg"> <img class="aligncenter" title="risk.chart" src="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/files/2011/09/risk.chart_2.jpg" alt="chart comparing annual fatality risks" width="750" height="770" /></a>Mueller and Stewart noted that, in general, government regulators around the world view fatality risks—say, from nuclear power, industrial toxins or commercial aviation—above one person per million per year as “acceptable.” Between 1970 and 2007 Mueller and Stewart asserted in a separate paper published last year in <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/66186/john-mueller-and-mark-g-stewart/hardly-existential?page=3"><em>Foreign Affairs</em></a> that a total of 3,292 Americans (not counting those in war zones) were killed by terrorists resulting in an <strong>annual risk of one in 3.5 million</strong>. Americans were more likely to die in an accident involving a bathtub (one in 950,000), a home appliance (one in 1.5 million), <strong>a deer (one in two million)</strong> or on a commercial airliner (one in 2.9 million).</p>
<p>The global mortality rate of death by terrorism is even lower. Worldwide, terrorism killed 13,971 people between 1975 and 2003, an annual rate of one in 12.5 million. Since 9/11 acts of terrorism carried out by Muslim militants outside of war zones have killed about 300 people per year worldwide. This tally <strong>includes</strong> attacks not only by al Qaeda but also by <strong>“imitators, enthusiasts, look-alikes and wannabes,”</strong> according to Mueller and Stewart.</p>
<p>Defenders of U.S. counterterrorism efforts might argue that they have kept casualties low by thwarting attacks. But i<strong>nvestigations by the FBI and other law enforcement agencies suggest that 9/11 may have been an outlier—an aberration—rather than a harbinger of future attacks</strong>. Muslim terrorists are for the most part “short on know-how, prone to make mistakes, poor at planning” and small in number, Mueller and Stewart stated. Although still potentially dangerous, terrorists hardly represent an “existential” threat on a par with those posed by Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>In fact, Mueller and Stewart suggested<strong> </strong>in Homeland Security Affairs, <strong>U.S. counterterrorism procedures may indirectly imperil more lives than they preserve</strong>: “Increased delays and added costs at U.S. airports due to new security procedures provide incentive for many short-haul passengers to drive to their destination rather than flying, and, since driving is far riskier than air travel, the extra automobile traffic generated has been estimated to result in 500 or more extra road fatalities per year.”</p>
<p>The funds that the U.S. spends on counterterrorism should perhaps be diverted to other more significant perils, such as industrial accidents (one in 53,000), violent crime (one in 22,000), automobile accidents (one in 8,000) and cancer (one in 540). “Overall,” Mueller and Stewart wrote, <strong>“vastly more lives could have been saved if counterterrorism funds had instead been spent on combating hazards that present unacceptable risks.”</strong> In an e-mail to me, Mueller elaborated:</p>
<p>“The key question, never asked of course, is what would the likelihood be if the added security measures had not been put in place? And, if the chances without the security measures might have been, say, one in 2.5 million per year, were the trillions of dollars in investment (including overseas policing which may have played a major role) worth that gain in security—to move from being unbelievably safe to being unbelievably unbelievably safe? Given that al Qaeda and al Qaeda types have managed to kill some 200 to 400 people throughout the entire world each year outside of war zones since 9/11—including in areas that are far less secure than the U.S.—there is no reason to anticipate that the measures have deterred, foiled or protected against massive casualties in the United States. If the domestic (we leave out overseas) enhanced security measures put into place after 9/11 have saved 100 lives per year in the United States, they would have done so at a cost of $1 billion per saved life. That same money, if invested in a measure that saves lives at a cost of $1 million each—like passive restraints for buses and trucks—would have saved 1,000 times more lives.”</p>
<p><strong>Mueller and Stewart’s analysis is conservative, because it excludes</strong> the most lethal and expensive U.S. responses to 9/11. Al Qaeda’s attacks also provoked the U.S. into <strong>invading and occupying two countries</strong>, at an estimated cost of several trillion dollars. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have resulted in the deaths of more than 6,000 Americans so far—more than twice as many as were killed on September 11, 2001—as well as tens of thousands of Iraqis and Afghans.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In 2007 New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said that people are more likely to be killed by lightning than terrorism. “You can’t sit there and worry about everything,” Bloomberg exclaimed. “Get a life. Actually, according to Mueller and Stewart, <strong>Americans’ annual risk of dying from lightning, at one in seven million is only half the risk from terrorism</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed,  the Senior Research Scientist for the Space Science Institute (Alan W. Harris) estimates that the odds of being killed by a terrorist attack is about the same as being hit <a href="http://politicalscience.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/HARRIS.PDF">by an <em>asteroid</em></a> (and <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/02/asteroid-odds/">see this</a>).</p>
<p>Terrorism pushes our emotional buttons. And politicians and the media tend to blow the risk of terrorism out of proportion. But as the figures above show, terrorism is a <em>very</em> unlikely cause of death.</p>
<p>Indeed, our <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2013/07/27/how-dangerous-america/TrzB0skxcsJH8yjAlslZCL/story.html">spending</a> on anti-terrorism measures is <a href="http://thinkbynumbers.org/government-spending/anti-terrorism-spending-disproportionate-to-threat/">way out of whack</a> &#8230; especially because <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/04/americas-anti-terrorism-policies-since-911-have-been-a-dismal-failure.html">most of the money has been wasted</a>.  And see <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/11/twelve-years-after-911-we-still-have-no-idea-how-to-fight-terrorism-2/">this article</a>, and this 3-minute video by professor Mueller:</p>
<p><center><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/KWF5WUskgyM" frameborder="0" width="750" height="422"></iframe></center></  br></p>
<p>Indeed, mission creep in the name of countering terrorism actually makes us <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/08/top-security-expert-treating-everyone-like-a-potential-terrorist-weakens-our-ability-to-protect-america.html"><em>more vulnerable</em> to terrorist attacks</a>.</p>
<p>Note: The U.S. is <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/04/the-u-s-is-engaged-in-a-muslim-religious-war-on-the-side-of-the-muslim-jihadis.html">supporting the most extreme and violent types of Muslims</a>.  Indeed, the U.S. has <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/obama-waives-ban-on-arming-terrorists-to-allow-aid-to-syrian-opposition/article/2535885?custom_click=rss">waived the prohibitions of arming terrorist groups</a> in order to topple the Syrian government &#8230; even though the <em>head</em> of the Syrian rebels has <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/09/head-of-syrian-rebels-calls-for-terrorist-attacks-on-america.html">called for Al Qaeda to carry out<em> new</em> attacks on America</a>.</p>
<p>Does that sound like a smart way to try to reduce the minimal risks we currently face from terrorism?</p>

Neither fiscal expenditure is producing a positive result.  Both efforts are startlingly negative, startlingly.  Open your eyes, people.</p>
<p>In fact the premise of the article is that the future can be foretold by the statistics of the past.  The premise is quite obviously wrong, and just an untenable and unwarranted stretch of the statistician&#8217;s imagination.  Read the numbers!  They mean virtually nothing.</p>
<p>The truth is, very few people have died from nuclear-power-plant-exposure-to-radiation.  A much better prediction of the future can be made here than statistics alone would provide.  The statistics concerning nuclear-power-plant-exposure-to-radiation deaths obviously are currently changing.  But if anyone says, they can predict the impact of Fukushima on these death statistics, we&#8217;d have to give their credibility a wide berth both plus and minus.</p>
<p>Honestly, NO ONE can predict the future.  Those who write articles that profess to predict the future are liars and charlatans.  We can however, authentically weigh and measure what is categorically true.  Everyone involved knew there was not only a risk of danger in nuclear technology industries.  Everyone knew there was also the sure likelihood of such a disaster -due to human nature.  Homer Simpson is not a real fella.  But the human nature story he depicts in caricature is very real.</p>
<p>The phenomenon same is true of terrorism.  Terrorism is a reasonable human response to certain impersonal stresses that have arisen in our stressful world.  And terrorism deaths could skyrocket with just a single event.  It is however, a much wiser course to address the root causes of -the threat of terrorism-, than it ever could be to try to address -acts of terrorism-.</p>
<p>When an act of terrorism has occurred, it is seemingly too late to do anything proactively about it.  The anti-terrorism approach that might provide the greatest efficacy possible, is to reduce the stresses that cause people to conduct acts of terrorism.</p>
<p>Globalization is causing terrorism in our world today, folks, globalization and the increasingly heinous scientific and bureaucratic intrusion into and interference in all of our lives.  When the anti-science terrorists realize their wider popular potential, there will be a likely adjustment to what we all expect out of life.</p>

For a person who wants to appear to be knowledgeable about truth , you certainly play fast and loose with facts&#8230;</p>
<p>First off, there is no more proof that &#8220;very few people have died from nuclear power plant exposure&#8221; than &#8220;very many people have died from nuclear power plant exposure&#8221; &#8211; because the truth of the matter is suppressed.</p>
<p>The fact that nuclear accidents large and small are very aggressively concealed is strong evidence that whatever the facts on the danger and deaths from nuclear power are, they are not fit to be revealed to the public, and thus worse than acknowledged.   </p>
<p>And before you try to argue for one second that concealment does not occur, I offer you to take a look at the Fukushima webcams:  The country that can produce HDTV cameras that fit in the palm of your hand and take crystal clear video of your family on vacation &#8211; that country cannot take anything but blurry, shaky, unreliable video of the worst nuclear disaster in history. </p>
<p>Now, on the topic of terrorism and &#8220;security&#8221;.   The recent Syria fiasco has, in my opinion, awakened the American public to the fact that they are being manipulated for political means.   That video of the guy taking on John McCain and calling him guilty of treason and the crowd turning on him must have run through the Capital like a wildfire.   I bet none of them would admit having seen it, and every one of them saw it.  I think it neutralized McCain on the topic and will probably destroy him in the next election.</p>
<p>The article above merely points out that a distortion of the facts: namely severely overhyping the terrorist threat far above other much more dangerous threats, has allowed the government to write itself a &#8220;blank check&#8221; to do whatever it desires in the name of terrorism. </p>
<p>I believe this activity is not only unethical, immoral and downright despicable, it also has virtually ground our economy to a halt.   When Americans believe foreigners are &#8220;terrorists&#8221; they aren&#8217;t likely to engage in commerce with them at home or abroad.   </p>
<p>When American businessmen and women are sick and tired of being poked and prodded at the airport, they stop flying and stop collaborating on innovative ideas, which create products and jobs .  </p>
<p>When trillions of dollars in American tax money is diverted to secret domestic spying operations, those dollars aren&#8217;t used publicly to create products and ideas and education for the public, which will multiply in the economy.  Furthermore, it gives tremendous economic leverage to certain individuals if they are willing to engage in nefarious activities with that data &#8211; and it certainly appears that there are folks already engaged in that activity.  </p>
<p>When Americans are so afraid of their government that they feel the need to arm themselves to the hilt, it creates an environment of distrust, negativity and despair.  </p>
<p>When Americans see their President obviously lie to them about bombing another country for reasons that are not revealed to them &#8211; then it sets a poor ethical standard that devolves the entire society.</p>
<p>I believe for the reasons above, and probably several others, we in America, to use an aviation term, have entered a stall/spin attitude.   Can we recover?  I don&#8217;t know, but failure to acknowlege the seriousness of the situation is a pretty bad sign in my opinion</p>

<p>You say, &#8221; Without it [science] a large percentage of the 7 billion people now on earth will die.&#8221;</p>
<p>You are as much a shill as Mr. Meyers.  You are saying science is necessary for the survival of humanity, or at least a large percentage of humanity.  Unfortunately, this sort of shilling goes on, and has gone on, endlessly.  You are arguing, that we need science to fix the problems science has created on this earth, the world over.</p>
<p>Let me explain something to you ONCE, &#8220;Voice of Reason&#8221;.</p>
<p>You are articulating the democratic notion, that society needs to protect a large proportion of the current population from their sure destruction at the hands of their dependence on scientific support mechanisms.  Unfortunately, very unfortunately, your logic is insufficient.  Your logic is insufficient, because science is not up to the task to which you appoint it.</p>
<p>A very large proportion of humanity is going to die off, because science has no real answers.  Science merely has been inculcating half-fixes for many decades now, many decades during which the scientifically-dependent population has exploded a hundred-fold.</p>
<p>Those half-fixes have reached a complexity level where these are crumbling faster than new half-fixes can be instituted.  This is due to the nature of our infinitely complex reality, from which we can easily deduce that with this ever greater complexity also comes an ever more rapid deterioration of the efficacy of these scientific half fixes due to a rising number of anomalies concurrently throwing a monkey wrench into the interdependent works.  That should sound very familiar to everyone, because this is where we are today.  Societies are crumbling under the weight of deteriorating scientific half fixes.</p>
<p>Now, concerning your feeble moral notion that we cannot let such a large proportion of the population fall into the scientific abyss that has been created, you are not considering an even larger number of people that demand our moral attention even more.  Those are the people who are coming in the future into this world.</p>
<p>And those future people, if I may be so bold as to surmise for them, they do not want those of us who are already basking in the warm sun on the beach at the grand party that is life, to risk their habitable future on planet earth with any more idiotic science such as Mr Meyers and you are shilling for.</p>
<p>Science has no real solutions.  Science only can provide half fixes.  This is due to the nature of empirical knowledge, which does not focus on the whole problem, and cannot focus on the whole problem.</p>
<p>Science is the dead-end we have arrived at due to the faulty knowledge base that has been built by science.  We either learn from our scientific mistakes, or we shut the door completely for the future humanity of the world, those that would replace us in their time.  Morally, only they matter, when their yet-unborn lives are at stake.  And that is exactly what is at stake, the unborn lives of countless human beings who are going to be shut out by any continued scientific delusion such as you and Mr. Meyers possess, e.g., that science can make a better world, or, fix the existing one.  It&#8217;s just not true, Mr. Reason.</p>
<p>Science has not made the world better.  Science has steadily marched our captured humanity ever faster in the direction of destroying the world.  Not recognizing this problem is simply not logical.  Nor is it reasonable.  Continuing down the scientific path is suicidal.  Shilling for science is deviltry.</p>
<p>Take a look around.  Is the world better?  No, the world is not better for science.  The whole path of science has been a huge, untenable gamble.  And as it turns out, any faith in science is like putting your faith in the devil.</p>

business.  Science is what enables us to<br />
see that “Houston,<br />
we have a problem”.  Science or just<br />
logic and common sense is what tells us not to place all our bets on one<br />
horse.  In my book the right to life<br />
(i.e. the right of those now living as opposed to the right to spawn yet more<br />
life) trumps the right to make money.</p>
<p>You may well be correct about the fait awaiting a very large<br />
proportion of humanity.  But it isn’t<br />
because science is not up to the task – though it is getting very late in the<br />
day.  It will be because people like you<br />
don’t like the answers that it provides.<br />
If there is a right to life, there is also a trade off between the<br />
absolute minimum of resources required to sustain that life in the narrowest<br />
biological sense and the resources required to provide what many of us believe<br />
are required to give that life some meaning, some value.</p>
<p>For people like you however, it appears to be easier to<br />
condemn the complexities involved in difficult ethical and technical problems –<br />
to condemn and reject the tool than to use it to address the challenges.  You seem to be saying that humanity’s<br />
problems began with the discovery of fire and will not be solved until we<br />
abandon its use.  The proper use of<br />
science has indeed made the world a better place.  The Nobel Prize winning chemist Frederick<br />
Soddy summed up the problem.  “Science<br />
has become the handmaiden of business.”<br />
The dead-end at which we may have arrived is not due to science but a<br />
failure to heed its warnings.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-84052" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Mr. Reason-</p>
<p>I am thankful for your response.  It shows you are actually reading and comprehending what I am saying.  Your ability is rare.  Your patience even rarer.  Still, let me add to what I already have said, and we&#8217;ll see what you think then, having digested where I really do draw the line in the sand, as opposed to where you, a thinking person, might attempt to draw such a line for me, before all the arguments are in.</p>
<p>You must admit, the average person does not have your reading and comprehension skills.  Most, the vast majority in fact, will never be able to climb the heights of this erudite discussion.  There&#8217;s the bugger.  That&#8217;s why the line is drawn in the sand for me, where it is, and not where you put it for me.</p>
<p>You see, the knowledge sets of science are not just available to you and I.  (And I actually have no faith you or I should have access to these scientific knowledge sets.  We too are human.)  These scientific knowledge sets, and the fruits of applied science, are however, available to these unthinking cretins (for want of a better word).  Even were these dangerous knowledge tools kept locked-up however, you must admit, upon some small bit of reflection, that there is scientific knowledge no one should have at hand.   Such is human nature, variable throughout a lifetime.  And here  too, we find another line I draw in the sand, where others might not think to draw it for me.</p>
<p>For these cretins, those who generally sign-on to endorsing the endless and futile search for the next scientific breakthrough, supposed breakthroughs that will solve all the world&#8217;s problems, the line where the pursuit of scientific knowledge crowds the capacity of these cretins to reflect and comprehend.  Draw the line there for me.  I do not endorse the idea of scientific gods who can make a better world, or repair the one science has provided the tools for these cretins to dismantle and destroy piecemeal.</p>
<p>I may think you are capable of being persuaded by a logical discussion against certain scientific knowledge experiments.  But you are a rarity.  The vast majority would of course say, throw the switch.  We&#8217;ll pick up the pieces afterwards, if there are any left.  This is the unfortunate scientific ethic equivalent of letting God sort them all out, on a grand scale, indeed.</p>
<p>I see no differentiation between the immoral steps business takes, when those steps would never have been made possible were it not for science.  Scientists are not fools, not to the last one anyway.  Enough scientists recognize their work is both dangerous in the wrong hands, and -sure- to be misused.  The retrospective analysis of scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project is a classic historical case of this phenomenon.  But, you are certainly clever enough to recognize, such a perspective does not require a retrospective view of the results.</p>
<p>Humanity is at that precipice right now, or more likely, off and well over that precipice.  The scientific game is over.  Still, there are other knowledge sets, other than science, knowledge sets that make science seem as primitive as science once made superstitious knowledge sets appear.  I have written here of such a knowledge set before, Categorical Knowledge.</p>
<p>Categorical Knowledge supersedes science completely.  Categorical Knowledge is that knowledge that is true in every instance, without any exception.  Categorical Knowledge alters logic, forcing the investigator to return back to the beginning as every other step of any logical process, to ensure no contradictions have arisen in the logical process.</p>
<p>There are very view Categorical-Knowledge-set logical statements at present.  But these are very powerful.  These have been arrived at by reflecting upon the long history of human thought, accomplishments and consideration about what is the truth.</p>
<p>Consider the importance to logic on just one categorically true knowledge statement.  Just one such true statement is immensely important.</p>
<p>I give you two.</p>
<p>1) Reality is infinitely complex.</p>
<p>2) The moral imperative of life is to live a life that detracts not at all from the lives available to those who will follow us into this world.</p>
<p>Proper consideration of these two categorically true statements is not to be done in a single lifetime.  To get to the fruit of their logical implications, will take a millennium.  Pray humanity has that millennium left to expend upon such erudite reflection.</p>
<p>In the mean time, enjoy the party that is life.  Unlike most in this world, you deserve it.  Life doesn&#8217;t get any better than it is right now, to share it in a fruitful conversation free of belligerence and animosity.</p>

the process of producing nuclear power will remain toxic to all forms of life<br />
we know about for the expected lifetime of our planet&#8230;.</i></p>
<p>I remember reading that fairies live at the bottom of my garden.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to address this sort of ignorance in a few sentences, but you should note that highly radioactive elements are only highly radioactive because they are disintegrating, and therefore becoming less dangerous as time goes on. Typically, the period that they are highly dangerous for is a few hundred years at maximum.</p>
<p>However, some elements, such as arsenic, are dangerous for chemical reasons. They will remain dangerous to life for the lifetime of the planet, and beyond. Interestingly, Plutonium, which is often touted as &#8216;the most toxic material on Earth&#8217; is mildly chemically toxic as well as mildly radioactive. In the 1940s some 26 workers at US nuclear weapons facilities became contaminated with plutonium. Intensive health checks of these people have revealed no serious consequence and no fatalities that could be attributed to the exposure. In the 1990s plutonium was injected into and inhaled by some volunteers, without adverse effects. In the 1950s Queen Elizabeth II was visiting Harwell and was handed a lump of plutonium (presumably Pu-239) in a plastic bag and invited to feel how warm it was.</p>
<p>There are certainly dangers associated with radioactive substances, as there are with all industrial substances. People have died through radiation accidents &#8211; they have also died through chemical accidents. No one is saying that radiation is perfectly safe. But it is stupid to exaggerate these dangers for political reasons, and use pointless rhetorical exhortations which are straightforward lies&#8230;</p>
