<p><em>Preface: Fundamentalist Christians, Jews and Muslims all think they are in a &#8220;holy war&#8221; against the other guy. As shown below, fundamentalists are being manipulated by the powers-that-be &#8211; many of whom are actually atheists &#8211; as part of a divide-and-conquer strategy to disempower people.</em></p>
<h3 style="color: #000099;">The 2,000 Year Old Strategy</h3>
<p>The strategy of dividing and conquering one&#8217;s foes is ancient.</p>
<p>Ancient Roman emperor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_rule">Julius Cesar</a> successfully used it thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>The application of the strategy in controlling one&#8217;s own people &#8211; divide and rule &#8211; has been used for just as long. As Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_rule">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Elements of this technique involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>creating or encouraging divisions among the subjects to prevent alliances that could challenge the sovereign</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>aiding and promoting those who are willing to cooperate with the sovereign</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>fostering distrust and enmity between local rulers [or groups]</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>encouraging meaningless expenditures that reduce the capability for political [organization or opposition] &#8230;..</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In discussing the use of &#8220;divide and rule&#8221; in the U.S., Wikipedia discusses the &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_rule#United_States_of_America">Use of left-right politics</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Indeed &#8211; even though the <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/07/the-founding-fathers-tried-to-warn-us-about-the-threat-from-a-two-party-system.html">Founding Fathers warned us against the danger of a two-party system</a> to divide the nation &#8211; left-right partisan divisions have successfully been deployed to distract and weaken the American people for centuries.</p>
<p>Religion has been used <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2007/10/02/religion-and-foreign-policy/">for the same purpose</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>England invaded Ireland in 1170, but for the first 439 years it was a conquest in name only. In 1609, however, James I founded the Plantation of Ulster, imported 20,000 Protestant settlers, and introduced religious strife as a political tactic. By favoring Protestants over the native Catholics in politics and economics-the so-called &#8220;Ulster Privilege-<strong>the English pitted both groups against one another.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The tactic was enormously successful, and England used it throughout its colonial empire</strong>. Nowhere were the British so successful in transplanting the Irish model than in India.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><strong>As prime minister [Churchill] once said that he hoped that the tension between Hindus and Muslims would remain &#8220;A bulwark of British rule in India.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The British were not alone in using religion as a tactic to divide and conquer. The French employed it quite successfully in Lebanon and Vietnam. In the former, Paris favored Maronite Christians over Muslims (and Sunni Muslims over Shiite Muslims), and in the latter, Catholics over Buddhists.</strong></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Exploiting religious differences hardly ended with the demise of the great colonial empires.</p>
<p><strong>The French continue to exploit religious divisions in Lebanon, and the U.S. is currently trying to cobble together a Sunni united front to confront Washington’s three opponents in the Middle East: Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Syria is mostly Sunni, but Bashar al-Assad’s regime is dominated by Alawites, a variety of Shiism. Some 60 percent of Lebanon is Shiite</strong>.</p>
<p>But Shiites only constitute about 12 percent of Islam, and while Washington talks of a &#8220;Shiia crescent&#8221; as if it constituted some kind of united front, in fact there are enormous differences between Arab Syria and Lebanon, and non-Arabic speaking Iran.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Religion is increasingly being used to ramp up the fear factor in international politics.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, ramping up hatred and fear of other religions is an easy way for any government to consolidate power and rationalize war.</p>
<p>“Why of course the people don’t want war … But after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship … Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.”<br />
- Hermann Goering, Nazi leader</p>
<p>No wonder the powers-that-be in the U.S., Israel and Saudi Arabia do everything possible to whip up fear of foreign religions.</p>
<h3 style="color: #000099;">Atheist War Hawks Manipulate Believers to Beat the Drums of War</h3>
<p>But wait, you may say &#8230;.</p>
<p>Perhaps the leaders of the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Israel really <em>believe</em> that we are really in a holy war?</p>
<p>That can&#8217;t be the case because &#8211; as shown above &#8211; U.S. and Israeli leaders have backed fundamentalist <em>Muslim</em>s, and Saudi Arabia is working hand-in-hand with the U.S. and Israel in numerous endeavors.</p>
<p>Moreover, history reveals the cynicism of those manipulating people of faith to reach their goals.</p>
<p>For example, while the Saudi royal family pushes the most strict and fundamentalist form Islam, the Saudi royal family&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcPw0uzrrpI&amp;list=PLA9F8BC740184BDF9&amp;index=1">debauchery</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7-A-ImHhjA&amp;list=PLA9F8BC740184BDF9">corruption</a> is <a href="http://www.equaltimes.org/in-depth/saudi-blogger-blows-cover-on-royal-corruption">legendary</a>. The monarchs &#8211; while pushing strict Wahabism as the official state religion &#8211; don&#8217;t practice it.</p>
<p>Many orthodox Israeli Rabbis are <a title="against Zionism" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22jews+against+zionism%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" target="_blank">against zionism</a> as being antithetical to traditional Jewish values. As such, many Jews say that criticizing zionism is <a title="not anti-semitism" href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=mOR&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CE4QvwUoAQ&amp;q=not+anti-semitic+to+criticize+zionism&amp;spell=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;biw=853&amp;bih=519&amp;ech=1&amp;psi=XXwuUNWiN6akiQLkuIC4Cg.1345223774638.3&amp;emsg=NCSR&amp;noj=1&amp;ei=XXwuUNWiN6akiQLkuIC4Cg&amp;sei=l3wuUMW2HueBiwLm0oDIDg&amp;gbv=2" target="_blank">not anti-semitism</a>. … and some zionists themselves admit that <a title="even non-Jews" href="http://mondoweiss.net/2011/12/liberal-zionists-at-last-say-non-jews-have-a-right-to-criticize-israel.html" target="_blank">even non-Jews</a> have the right to criticize Israel. (This post will not get into the debate about whether zionism is a good or bad political philosophy. We are only pointing out that the Israeli government&#8217;s statements about religion are disputed by many Orthodox Rabbis; and many Israelis claim that the government is cynically pushing a view of religion only because it promotes the government&#8217;s geopolitical desires).</p>
<p>In the U.S., Leo Strauss was the father of the Neo-Conservative movement, including many leaders of both the Bush and Obama administrations.</p>
<p>Indeed, many of the main neocon players &#8211; including <span style="color: black;">Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle, Stephen Cambone, Elliot Abrams, and Adam Shulsky </span><span style="color: black;"> &#8211; </span>were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Strauss#Notable_students_and_Straussians">students of Strauss </a>at the University of Chicago, where he taught for many years.</p>
<p>The people pushing for war against Iran are the <span style="font-style: italic;">same </span>neocons who pushed for war against Iraq. See <a title="this" href="http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=105499" target="_blank">this</a> and <a title="this" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/11/2011111113135678844.html" target="_blank">this</a>. (They planned both wars <a title="at least 20 years ago" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/11/neoconservatives-planned-regime-change-throughout-the-middle-east-and-northern-africa-20-years-ago.html">at least 20 years ago</a>.) For example, Shulsky <span style="color: black;">was the director of the Office of Special Plans &#8211; the Pentagon </span>unit responsible for selling <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/05/12/030512fa_fact">false intelligence</a> regarding Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction. He is now a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Directorate#Membership">member</a> of the equivalent organization targeting Iran: the Iranian Directorate.</p>
<p>Strauss, born in Germany, was <a href="http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/06/06/19/10047882.html">an admirer of Nazi philosophers and of Machiavelli</a>. Strauss believed that a stable political order required an external threat and that <strong>if an external threat did not exist, one should be <em>manufactured</em></strong>. Specifically, Strauss <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/15935/">thought that</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A political order can be stable only if it is united by an external threat . . . . Following Machiavelli, he maintained that if no external threat exists then one has to be manufactured</p></blockquote>
<p>(the quote is by one of Strauss&#8217; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312217838/sr=8-2/qid=1151020176/ref=sr_1_2/002-7685563-5380010?%5Fencoding=UTF8">main biographers</a>).</p>
<p>What does this have to do with religion?</p>
<p>Strauss <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=C4h&amp;q=strauss+neoconservative+religion&amp;btnG=Search">taught</a> that religion should be used as a way to <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">manipulate</span></strong>people to achieve the aims of the leaders. But that the leaders themselves <strong>need not believe</strong> in religion.</p>
<p>As Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoconservatism">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the late 1990s Irving Kristol and other writers in neoconservative magazines began touting anti-Darwinist views, in support of intelligent design. Since these neoconservatives were largely of secular backgrounds, a few commentators have speculated that this – along with support for religion generally – may have been a case of a &#8220;noble lie&#8221;, intended to protect public morality, or even tactical politics, to attract religious supporters.</p></blockquote>
<p>So is it any surprise that the folks who planned war against Iraq and Iran <a title="at least 20 years ago" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/11/neoconservatives-planned-regime-change-throughout-the-middle-east-and-northern-africa-20-years-ago.html">at least 20 years ago</a> are pushing religious disinformation to stir up the evangelical community?</p>
<p>Talking heads in Saudi Arabia, Israel and the U.S. are all promoting the Straussian playbook: stir up religious sentiment &#8211; even if you are personally an atheist &#8211; to create and demonize an &#8220;enemy&#8221;, so as to divide and conquer their people and other countries &#8230;</p>
<h3 style="color: #000099;">The 3 Governments Support the Hard-Liners of &#8220;Enemy&#8221; Religions In Other<em></em> Countries</h3>
<p>But aren&#8217;t Christianity, Judaism and Islam mortal enemies? Isn&#8217;t there a holy war &#8230; which must be fought and won for our religion?</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s true, how come the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia &#8211; the leaders of fundamentalist Christian, Islam and Judaism, respectively &#8211; are all very close allies?</p>
<p>Specifically, <a title="85% of the American population identifies itself as Christian" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/28/AR2006032801632.html" target="_blank">85%</a> of the American population identifies itself as Christian. The largest concentration of Evangelicals in the world can be found in the United States, where roughly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism"><em>a quarter</em> of the world&#8217;s Evangelicals live (over 90 million)</a>. The U.S. is the seat of the most violent fundamentalist Christians (abortion clinic bombers, etc.)</p>
<p>Israel is obviously the center of the Jewish religion, and the seat of the most fundamentalist Jews.</p>
<p>And Saudi Arabia is the center of the most radical, fundamentalist and terror-prone branch of Muslims … the “Wahhabis” (also called “Salafis”). As Frontline <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/saudi/analyses/wahhabism.html">reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For more than two centuries, Wahhabism has been Saudi Arabia&#8217;s dominant faith. It is an austere form of Islam that insists on a literal interpretation of the Koran. Strict Wahhabis believe that all those who don&#8217;t practice their form of Islam are heathens and enemies. Critics say that Wahhabism&#8217;s rigidity has led it to misinterpret and distort Islam, pointing to extremists such as Osama bin Laden and the Taliban. Wahhabism&#8217;s explosive growth began in the 1970s when Saudi charities started funding Wahhabi schools (madrassas) and mosques from Islamabad to Culver City, California.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The religious curriculum in Saudi Arabia teaches you that people are basically two sides: Salafis [Wahhabis], who are the winners, the chosen ones, who will go to heaven, and the rest. The rest are Muslims and Christians and Jews and others [and these non-Salafis] are supposed to be hated, to be persecuted, even killed.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Wahhabism is] sort of an extreme orthodoxy that historically has not been shared by a majority of Muslims, particularly nobody outside of the Arabian Peninsula.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the U.S. has long backed Saudi Arabia &#8230; and the Madrassa schools within Saudi Arabia which <em><a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/09/sleeping-with-the-devil-how-u-s-and-saudi-backing-of-al-qaeda-led-to-911.html">teach radical, violent Wahabi beliefs</a></em>.</p>

<p>The U.S. also <em>directly arms, funds and otherwise supports</em> <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/04/the-u-s-is-engaged-in-a-muslim-religious-war-on-the-side-of-the-muslim-jihadis.html">the most violent fundamentalist Muslim terrorists &#8211; including Al Qaeda</a> &#8211; against the more <em>moderate</em> Muslims and <em>secular</em> Arabs. Indeed, the U.S. backs Islamic terrorists who are <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/08/u-s-government-is-prosecuting-christians.html">persecuting <em>Christians and Jews</em></a>.</p>
<p>As one example, Jimmy Carter’s National Security Adviser &#8211; Zbigniew Brzezinski &#8211; <a title="National Security Adviser admitted" href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/coldwar/interviews/episode-17/brzezinski1.html" target="_blank">admitted</a> on CNN that the U.S. <a title="supported Bin Laden and the other originators of “Al Qaeda” in the 1970s" href="http://www.thenation.com/article/blowback-prequel" target="_blank">organized and supported Bin Laden and the other originators of “Al Qaeda” in the 1970s</a> to fight the Soviets.</p>
<p>Brzezinski told Al Qaeda’s forefathers, the Mujahadin:</p>
<blockquote><p>We know of their deep belief in god – that they’re confident that their struggle will succeed. That land over – there is yours – and you’ll go back to it some day, because your fight will prevail, and you’ll have your homes, your mosques, back again, because your cause is right, and <strong>god is on your side</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The U.S. not only strongly supports Israel, many of the most fundamentalist American Christians support the most fundamentalist, hard-line, radical Israeli Jews. And the Israeli government supports the Christian fundamentalists.</p>
<p>For example, Dr. Timothy Webber – an evangelical Christian who has served as a teacher of church history and the history of American religion at Denver Seminary and Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Vice-President at Northern Baptist Theological Seminary in Lombard, IL, and President of Memphis Theological Seminary in Tennessee – <a title="notes" href="http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Christianity/End-Times/On-The-Road-To-Armageddon.aspx" target="_blank">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Almost one out of four Americans believes that 9/11 was predicted in the Bible, and nearly one in five believes that he or she will live long enough to see the end of the world. Even more significant for this study, over one-third of those Americans who support Israel report that they do so because they believe the Bible teaches that the Jews must possess their own country in the Holy Land before Jesus can return.Millions of Americans believe that the Bible predicts the future and that we are living in the last days. Their beliefs are rooted in dispensationalism, a particular way of understanding the Bible’s prophetic passages &#8230;. <strong>They make up about one-third of America’s 40 or 50 million evangelical Christians</strong> and believe that the nation of Israel will play a central role in the unfolding of end-times events. In the last part of the 20th century, dispensationalist evangelicals become Israel’s best friends-an alliance that has made a serious geopolitical difference.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>During the early 1980s <strong>the Israeli Ministry of Tourism recruited evangelical religious leaders for free “familiarization” tours. In time, hundreds of evangelical pastors got free trips to the Holy Land</strong>. The purpose of such promotional tours was to enable people of even limited influence to experience Israel for themselves and be shown how they might bring their own tour group to Israel. The Ministry of Tourism was interested in more than tourist dollars: here was a way of building a solid corps of non-Jewish supporters for Israel in the United States by bringing large numbers of evangelicals to hear and see Israel’s story for themselves. The strategy caught on.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Shortly after the Six-Day War, elements within the Israeli government saw the potential power of the evangelical subculture and began to mobilize it as a base of support that could influence American foreign policy. <strong>The Israeli government sent Yona Malachy of its Department of Religious Affairs to the United States to study American <a id="08558de2-42bc-427f-afc4-9b28698233e3" title="fundamentalism" href="http://www.beliefnet.com/faiths/islam/2001/09/fractured-fundamentalisms.aspx" target="_blank">fundamentalism</a> and its potential as an ally of Israel</strong>. Malachy was warmly received by <a id="943628e8-c345-4d8e-97f7-bc93632d9530" title="fundamentalists" href="http://www.beliefnet.com/faiths/islam/2001/09/fractured-fundamentalisms.aspx" target="_blank">fundamentalists</a> and was able to influence some of them to issue strong pro-Israeli manifestos. By the mid-1980s, there was a discernible shift in the Israeli political strategy. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the Jewish state’s major lobbying group in Washington, D.C., started re-aligning itself with the American political right-wing, including Christian conservatives. Israel’s timing was perfect. It began working seriously with American dispensationalists at the precise moment that American fundamentalists and evangelicals were discovering their political voice.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><strong>In their commitment to keep Israel strong and moving in directions prophesied by the Bible, dispensationalists are supporting some of the most dangerous elements in Israeli society. They do so because such political and religious elements seem to conform to dispensationalist beliefs about what is coming next for Israel. By lending their support-both financial and spiritual-to such groups, dispensationalists are helping the future they envision come to pass</strong>.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Their convictions have led them to support the aims and actions of what most Israelis believe are <strong>the most dangerous right-wing elements in their society, people whose views make any compromise necessary for lasting peace impossible</strong>. Such sentiments do not matter to the believers in Bible prophecy, for whom the outcome of the quarrelsome issue of the Temple Mount has already been determined by God.</p>
<p>Since the end of the Six-Day War, then, dispensationalists have increasingly moved from observers to participant-observers. They have acted consistently with their convictions about the coming Last Days in ways that make their prophecies appear to be self-fulfilling.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As Paul Boyer has pointed out, dispensationalism has effectively conditioned millions of Americans <strong>to be somewhat passive about the future</strong> [the goal of divide-and-conquer efforts] and provided them with lenses through which to understand world events. Thanks to the sometimes changing perspectives of their Bible teachers, dispensationalists are certain that trouble in the Middle East is inevitable, that nations will war against nations, and that the time is coming when millions of people will die as a result of nuclear war, the persecution of Antichrist, or as a result of divine judgment. Striving for peace in the Middle East is a hopeless pursuit with no chance of success.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>For the dispensational community, the future is determined. The Bible’s prophecies are being fulfilled with amazing accuracy and rapidity. They do not believe that the Road Map will-or should-succeed. According to the prophetic texts, partitioning is not in Israel’s future, even if the creation of a Palestinian state is the best chance for peace in the region. Peace is nowhere prophesied for the Middle East, until Jesus comes and brings it himself. The worse thing that the United States, the European Union, Russia, and the United Nations can do is force Israel to give up land for a peace that will never materialize this side of the second coming. <strong>Anyone who pushes for peace in such a manner is ignoring or defying God’s plan for the end of the age</strong>.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As [one dispensationalist group's] advertisement read, “Don’t just read about prophecy when you can be part of it.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Israel and Saudi Arabia also now support each other. For example, the Sunday Times reported that <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel-denies-saudis-gave-idf-airspace-clearance-for-iran-strike-1.267118">Saudi Arabia has tested the ability to stand down its air defenses to allow an Israeli strike on Iran to pass through its airspace</a>. After the Arab Spring, Israel views the Saudi government as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/07/world/europe/07germany.html?_r=0">&#8220;guarantor of stability&#8221;</a>, according to the New York Times. In 2011, Israel approved a German sale of 200 Leopard tanks to Saudi Arabia. The approval came from Uzi Arad, <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-merkel-doctrine-tank-exports-to-saudi-arabian-signal-german-policy-shift-a-791380-2.html">the national security advisor</a> to Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>These 3 countries &#8211; centers of 3 different religions &#8211; are also all fighting on the same side in various wars. For example, the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/04/us-expanding-support-to-syrian-rebels/">U.S.</a>, <a href="http://world.time.com/2012/09/18/syrias-secular-and-islamist-rebels-who-are-the-saudis-and-the-qataris-arming/">Saudi Arabia</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/04/world/middleeast/syria.html">Israel</a> are <em>all</em> fighting against the Syrian government, and backing <a title="Al Qaeda and Muslim Brotherhood" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/02/u-s-fighting-on-the-same-side-as-three-terrorist-groups-in-syria.html">Al Qaeda and Muslim Brotherhood</a>. (Indeed, the New York Times <a title="reports" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/world/middleeast/islamist-rebels-gains-in-syria-create-dilemma-for-us.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">reported</a> last week that <em>virtually all</em> of the rebel fighters are Al Qaeda terrorists.)</p>
<p>As Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/03/05/070305fa_fact_hersh?currentPage=all" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Bush Administration has decided, in effect, to reconfigure its priorities in the Middle East.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A by-product of these activities has been the bolstering of Sunni extremist groups that espouse a militant vision of Islam and are hostile to America and sympathetic to Al Qaeda.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><strong>The policy shift has brought Saudi Arabia and Israel into a new strategic embrace</strong> &#8230;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, what does it mean that the centers of fundamentalist Islam, fundamentalist Judaism and fundamentalist Christianity are all backing the <em>same group of terrorists</em> to promote certain geopolitical goals?</p>
<p>It means that religion is being used by the U.S., Saudi and Israeli governments to divide and conquer the rest of the world &#8230; and to divide and rule their own people.</p>
<p>Postscript 1:   I agree with Christian writer and psychiatrist M. Scott Peck, who argued that there are different stages of spiritual maturity, and that fundamentalism – whether it be Muslim, Christian, Jewish (or any another religion&#8217;s) fundamentalism – is an <a title="immature stage" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/06/america-like-iran-is-run-by-religious.html">immature stage</a> of development.</p>
<p>Specifically, Peck believed that fundamentalism is a pendulum swing 0ver-reaction to the anarchy and chaos of lawlessness and hedonism.  Peck believed that fundamentalism is a desperate attempt to impose order and consistent, unchanging rules in an unstable, chaotic situation.</p>
<p>Postscript 2: Many Christians and Jews assume that Islam is the most violent religion. But <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/05/muslims-only-carried-out-2-5-percent-of-terrorist-attacks-on-u-s-soil-between-1970-and-2012.html">the FBI and other official U.S. sources</a> say that Christian and Jewish extremists carry out <em>more</em> terrorist attacks in the U.S. than Muslims.</p>
<p>And Muslim scholars &#8211; such as University of Michigan professor Juan Cole &#8211; say that <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2013/04/islamic-forbids-terrorism.html">Islamic law <em>forbids</em> terrorism</a> &#8211; but that the radical Wahabis are twisting Islam into something different &#8230; a violent religion. Given that (as discussed above) the U.S., Saudi royal family and Israel have backed Wahabis and fought against moderate Muslims and secular Arabs, they are at least partly responsible for the spread of these violent extremists.</p>
<p>While it is easy to point out passages of the Koran which appear to be a call to violence, terrorism or honor killings, it is equally easy to do <em>the same</em> with the Bible. By way of example only:</p>
<p>Leviticus 21:9</p>
<blockquote><p>A priest&#8217;s daughter who loses her honor by committing fornication and thereby dishonors her father also, shall be burned to death.</p></blockquote>
<p>Isaiah 13:15-18</p>
<blockquote><p>Anyone who is captured will be run through with a sword. Their little children will be dashed to death right before their eyes. Their homes will be sacked and their wives raped by the attacking hordes. For I will stir up the Medes against Babylon, and no amount of silver or gold will buy them off. The attacking armies will shoot down the young people with arrows. They will have no mercy on helpless babies and will show no compassion for the children.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ezekiel 9:5-7</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Then I heard the LORD say to the other men, &#8220;Follow him through the city and kill everyone whose forehead is not marked. Show no mercy; have no pity! Kill them all &#8211; old and young, girls and women and little children. But do not touch anyone with the mark. Begin your task right here at the Temple.&#8221; So they began by killing the seventy leaders. &#8220;Defile the Temple!&#8221; the LORD commanded. &#8220;Fill its courtyards with the bodies of those you kill! Go!&#8221; So they went throughout the city and did as they were told.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Jeremiah 51:20-26</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You are my battle-ax and sword,&#8221; says the LORD. &#8220;With you I will shatter nations and destroy many kingdoms. With you I will shatter armies, destroying the horse and rider, the chariot and charioteer. With you I will shatter men and women, old people and children, young men and maidens. With you I will shatter shepherds and flocks, farmers and oxen, captains and rulers. &#8220;As you watch, I will repay Babylon and the people of Babylonia for all the wrong they have done to my people in Jerusalem,&#8221; says the LORD. &#8220;Look, O mighty mountain, destroyer of the earth! I am your enemy,&#8221; says the LORD. &#8220;I will raise my fist against you, to roll you down from the heights. When I am finished, you will be nothing but a heap of rubble. You will be desolate forever. Even your stones will never again be used for building. You will be completely wiped out,&#8221; says the LORD.</p></blockquote>
<p>Deuteronomy, Chapter 2, 32-37</p>
<blockquote><p>And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land. 32 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz. 33 And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people. 34 And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain. 36 From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us</p></blockquote>
<p>As such, the claim that Islam is a uniquely violent religion has been greatly exaggerated for geopolitical reasons.</p>

Whoever the moron is who wrote this article, finally mentions the violence of the Koran at the end of the article, then he or she makes the truly idiotic dribbling mind-numbing comparisons to the Bible. To the author, idiot, moron, twit, the violent passages in the Old Testament were directed at one specific people, the Israelites, and for those specific times, thousands of years BC. IDIOT, MORON, TWIT, THE VIOLENCE OF THE KORAN, WRITTEN IN THE 7TH CENTURY AD, IS ONGOING, PERMANENT, AND IT IS COMMANDED OF ALL MUSLIMS, AND IS AGAINST ALL NON-MUSLIMS, TODAY AND FOREVER INTO THE FUTURE UNTIL ISLAM REIGNS AND ALL OTHER RELIGIONS ARE GONE AS WELL AS ALL NON-SHARIA GOVERNMENTS. That any human being intelligent to read and write, intelligent enough to write an article, does not grasp the difference here, is truly disturbing and reveals why it is so unlikely if not impossible for the West to survive.</p>
<p>“Preface: Fundamentalist Christians, Jews and Muslims all think they are in a “holy war” against the other guy. As shown below, fundamentalists are being manipulated by the powers-that-be – many of whom are actually atheists – as part of a divide-and-conquer strategy to disempower people.”</p>
<p>ISLAM, THE KORAN, AND THE EXAMPLE OF MUHAMMAD, ALL ARE BY DEFINITION, BY THEIR WRITINGS, BY THEIR ACTIONS, BY THEIR ESSENCE, AT WAR WITH ALL NON-MUSLIMS, what is so hard to understand about that? Any non-Muslim that wants to deny that, is a fool. You may not be at war with Islam but it is at war with you. Islam separates the whole world into two, the House of Islam and the House of War! It is sickening the morons write articles like this, and that silly twits believe it. </p>
<p>For the past 1400 years the West knew the truth about Islam and fought to keep it out of the West, now, fools in the West think Islam is no threat, what morons.</p>

<p>It is impossible philosophically to remove the inferred animist god from our thinking.   (The animist god is that god that looks over our shoulder and prevents us from making a fatal mistake at every single turn we make.  You may just keep your fingers crossed.)</p>
<p>Why is this impossible?  Because reality -at the end of the day- is still infinitely complex and way beyond our logical and even our observational abilities.  So, every human being has to have -some faith-, just to proceed forward -day to day-.  Without that faith, as so many philosophers since the Enlightenment have figured out, there is no reason NOT to just commit suicide.</p>
<p>After all, what would be the point of living?  Curiosity, Schopenhauer?  Are you really curious to find out what it feels like to experience your body slowly degrading over the decades until you meet your surely predictable demise?</p>
<p>It is -furthermore- those subtle faiths that are the most dangerous.  It is -in fact- the very subtle faith in science that is the most dangerous -BELIEF- on the planet today.</p>
<p>So, get a life, Superman.  You&#8217;re nothing but mortal after all.  Denying your belief in even an animistic god -does not make you immortal -nor- omniscient.</p>
<p>In fact, your irrational statements make you look for all the world to see, the fool for proclaiming you know so much -that you cannot possibly know.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-76363" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&#8212;&gt;&gt;&gt; Implicitly, you&#8217;re arguing I have to &#8220;know everything&#8221; before I can make<br />
 any conclusions about the likelihood of a god (either the way religious<br />
 people define theirs or in general).  I estimate probabilities every<br />
day about many things.  I call it &#8220;using my brain&#8221;.  I see no reason not<br />
 to use it on this subject.  So, I think your argument here is<br />
ridiculous.</p>
<p>The commonly accepted -infinite- complexity of reality infers that no matter how much you know, it&#8217;s far less than enough to make your guesses, -using your organic, simian brain- to come up with another personal faith-based-system of beliefs that have absolutely no history with which to judge the efficacy of such a system.  And history is ripe with the sometimes laughable and sometimes tragic failure of such attempts.</p>
<p>The problem you do not comprehend is that your making guesses, (with your brain -woo-hoo!-), may or may not get you over one small hurdle.   BUT that guess-paradigm (pragmatism) will pose future hurdles that never would have arisen hadn&#8217;t you bothered to make a guess in the first place.</p>
<p>You are implicitly -believing- you have the right to guess wrong, and destroy the world by your supposedly logical errors.   Mankind is the crucible of scientific trial and error.   No -human being- can justify the implicit god-like hubris inherent to science.  It cannot be done.</p>
<p>A lot of things make perfect logical sense.   (Go read about the Greek philosopher, Zeno, who was run out of Athens for repeatedly making speeches that logically proved one side of an argument one day.  And the next day, making another speech -that logically proved the other side of the same argument.)</p>
<p> Logical reasoning does not mean any of these logical-aberrations are worth risking the re-invention of our conception of reality -to see if things might work out better.  Why?  Because things are NOT working out better.  Scoundrels who are very adept at manipulating the beliefs of naive fools are ruling the planet.  That much is clear.  And the species-extermination scenarios that have arisen due to science are multiplying every day.</p>
<p>And it is only some subconsciously-supposed animistic god kindly looking over the shoulder of every scientist that keeps these mad scientists  tinkering merrily and madly away in every scientific field of endeavor (including the environmental sciences, medicine, economics and politics).</p>
<p>My point is, you look and read like, the cartoon that featured the character Mighty Mouse to me.  If you want to advocate something cogent, then justify something within the current system, or from some system gone past that has been fruitlessly abandoned.</p>
<p>Thinking up new approaches to make conjectures about new solutions to old problems commonly painful, and , such an approach is the source of too many new problems.  Your juvenile pragmatic approach is as common and appealing as a pack of boisterous adolescents walking clumped-together down the pedestrian sidewalk.</p>
<p>You simply have nothing to say.</p>

For someone today to just randomly point to a passage and say, there, that is what me must do now, is idiotic. In particular, and this is critical with regard to Islam, the passages that call on the Israelites to destroy entire tribes such as the Canaanites in the Holy Land, are one time events, specific for a reason at that time, thousands of years BC. Those tribes were truly evil, sacrificing babies for instance to their gods. But there is no way any sane person could then say the Jews today should annihilate this or that tribe because those passages are in the Old Testament. NOW GET THIS, IT IS CRITICAL &#8211; in the Koran, the passages that call for killing and fighting the infidels (non-Muslims) ARE PERMANENT AND APPLY TODAY. YOU, LOOK IN THE MIRROR, ARE THE TRIBE THAT MUST BE ANNIHILATED, to make the comparison to the Old Testament! That is an &#8220;important&#8221; difference to say the least! Unlike the Bible which contains all sorts of allegory and history and poetry and threads running through centuries, the Koran is blunt and direct, no subtlety or &#8220;interpretation&#8221; can be applied, it is like a drill sergeant screaming at you at the top if his lungs to kill kill kill. This is why in the entire 1400 year history of Islam it has been at war with all of the civilizations it has encountered.</p>

There were NEVER any &#8216;hebrews&#8217; captive in Egypt and they never got kicked out. The Egyptians were meticulous record keepers. The ONLY group they ever expelled were the Hyksos. And if the Hebrews WERE the Hyksos, they deserved to be kicked out because the debased and destabilized the Egyptian society. </p>
<p>The &#8216;wandering in the desert never happened. It&#8217;s a LIE. There is no archaeological record of ANY PEOPLE EVER inhabiting the areas described in the desert &#8211; EVER. Not a stick, not a stone, not a bone. Nothing. </p>
<p>The parting of the Red Sea never happened. It&#8217;s a LIE. We don&#8217;t need to go into the physics of the Sea parting any more then we need to ask how 110 story buildings fall into their own footprints at the speed or gravity. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s no historical record of any Moses having existed either other than the fabulous jewish fables.  So, what do we really base these &#8216;beliefs&#8217; on?  A book of fabrication forgery, falsehood, fables and LIES?    Hmmmm&#8230; sounds like the Federal Reserve.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-76459" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>It wouldn&#8217;t be smart to so easily dismiss the stories of the Old Testament. The &#8220;threads&#8221; running through the various books, written by different people, in different times, without access to what the others wrote, yet forming a cohesive whole, is a miracle in and of itself. That the tomb of Jesus was empty is one of the most documented facts of history, with some historians reporting it without any reference to him &#8220;rising from the dead&#8221; yet offering no possible explanation of how it could have happened, given all the circumstances. Yet many deny that happened, that it is fable, fairy tale, bizarre freaky beliefs cooked up by insane people, written down, and believed to this day by many insane people, people so stupid they should have just been aborted in the womb to save the earth their pitiful existence. That the apostles were willing to die for the fable made up phony hoax story, is really amazing, yet they did that just to make the myth more believable? Whatever the full story surrounding Exodus is, there are plenty of concrete cold hard historical facts, and archeology, for the Jewish people existing in the Holy Land for thousands of years, evidence that the so-called &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; continue to destroy, to this day.</p>
