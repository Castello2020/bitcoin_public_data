						<p><a href="http://stormcloudsgathering.com/police-military-was-your-oath-sincere">3-minute video</a>: Police, Military &#8211; Was your Oath sincere?</p>
<p>As I wrote <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/us-supreme-court-law-repugnant-to-the-constitution-is-void">last year</a>, a useful place for Americans to stand is with the US Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0005_0137_ZO.html">one of its most cited decisions</a>:</p>
<p><strong><em>Anything passed as law in obvious violation of the US Constitution is not law, but void.</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://thelawdictionary.org/void/">Void as a legal term</a> means the alleged “law” has zero legal force; that “void things are as no things.” A court <em>decision</em> has root in the word <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/decide"><em>decide</em></a>, meaning to cut off or kill all other options.</p>
<p>Supreme Court Chief Justice Marshall’s crystal-clear wording is below.</p>
<p>This definitive legal ruling empowers Americans acting upon or enforcing such non-laws to reject them in full confidence of their <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/us-military-defend-americans-don-t-ndaa-disappear-them">Oaths to support and defend the US Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.waitingforthestorm.com/police-military-was-your-oath-sincere">The 3-minute video</a> asks police, military, and other law enforcement:</p>
<p><strong><em>When you signed-up to serve the US Constitution, was your Oath sincere?</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/valkyrie-movie-for-today-s-us-military-to-arrest-us-war-criminals">US military are authorized</a> by their Oath of Enlistment and training to refuse unlawful orders, with officers authorized to arrest those who issue them. Given that <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/how-a-government-teacher-easily-proves-occupy-s-claim-of-us-war-crimes">US wars are unlawful because</a> the US is treaty-bound to only use our military if under attack by another nation’s government, <strong>all current war orders are unlawful and should be refused</strong>. Military of civilian “leadership” who issue such orders should be arrested to immediately stop War Crimes.</p>
<p>Our peaceful and lawful <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/this-2nd-american-revolution-simply-affirms-us-laws-ideals">2nd American Revolution</a> points to other “emperor has no clothes” obvious void laws and criminal acts:</p>

</ul>
<p>Here is the US Supreme Court’s ruling (my parenthetical notes and emphases):</p>
<p><strong><em>The powers of the Legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten, the Constitution is written</em></strong><em>. To what purpose are powers limited, and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing, if these limits may at any time be passed by those intended to be restrained? </em><strong><em>The distinction between a government with limited and unlimited powers is abolished if those limits do not confine the persons on whom they are imposed</em></strong><em> &#8230;</em></p>
<p><em>Between these alternatives (limited and unlimited government) there is no middle ground. The Constitution is either a superior, paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means, or it is on a level with ordinary legislative acts, and, like other acts, is alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it.</em></p>
<p><em>If the former part of the alternative be true, then a legislative act contrary to the Constitution is not law; if the latter part be true, then written Constitutions are absurd attempts on the part of the people to limit a power in its own nature illimitable.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Certainly all those who have framed written Constitutions contemplate them as forming the fundamental and paramount law of the nation, and consequently the theory of every such government must be that an act of the Legislature repugnant to the Constitution is void.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>&#8230; So, if a law be in opposition to the Constitution, if both the law and the Constitution apply to a particular case, &#8230; those, then, who controvert the principle that the Constitution is to be considered in court as a paramount law are reduced to the necessity of maintaining that courts must close their eyes on the Constitution, and see only the law.</em></p>
<p><em>This doctrine would subvert the very foundation of all written Constitutions. It would declare that an act which, according to the principles and theory of our government, is entirely void, is yet, in practice, completely obligatory. It would declare that, if the Legislature shall do what is expressly forbidden, such act, notwithstanding the express prohibition, is in reality effectual. It would be giving to the Legislature a practical and real omnipotence with the same breath which professes to restrict their powers within narrow limits. It is prescribing limits, and declaring that those limits may be passed at pleasure.</em></p>
<p><em>That it thus reduces to nothing what we have deemed the greatest improvement on political institutions &#8212; a written Constitution, would of itself be sufficient, in America where written Constitutions have been viewed with so much reverence, for rejecting the construction. But the peculiar expressions of the Constitution of the United States furnish additional arguments in favour of its rejection.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>&#8230; Why otherwise does it direct &#8230; an oath to support it?</em></strong><em> This oath certainly applies in an especial manner to their conduct in their official character. How immoral to impose it on them if they were to be used as the instruments, and the knowing instruments, for violating what they swear to support!</em></p>
<p><em>The oath of office, too, imposed by the Legislature, is completely demonstrative of the legislative opinion on this subject. It is in these words:</em></p>
<p><em>I do solemnly swear that I will administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich; and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge all the duties incumbent on me as according to the best of my abilities and understanding, agreeably to the Constitution and laws of the United States.</em></p>
<p><em>Why does a judge swear to discharge his duties agreeably to the Constitution of the United States if that Constitution forms no rule for his government?</em></p>
<p><em>&#8230; If such be the real state of things, this is worse than solemn mockery. To prescribe or to take this oath becomes equally a crime.</em></p>
<p><em>It is also not entirely unworthy of observation that, in declaring what shall be the supreme law of the land, the Constitution itself is first mentioned, and not the laws of the United States generally, but those only which shall be made in pursuance of the Constitution, have that rank.</em></p>
<p><em>Thus, the particular phraseology of the Constitution of the United States confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential to all written Constitutions, that </em><strong><em>a law repugnant to the Constitution is void, and that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by that instrument (the US Constitution).</em></strong></p>
<p>And as Abraham Lincoln stated:</p>
<p><em>“The people — </em><strong><em>the people</em></strong><em> — are the rightful masters of both Congresses, and courts — not to overthrow the Constitution, but </em><strong><em>to overthrow the men who pervert it.</em></strong><em>” &#8211; &#8220;</em><a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=mal&amp;fileName=mal1/018/0189300/malpage.db&amp;recNum=0"><em>Abraham Lincoln, [September 16-17, 1859] (Notes for Speech in Kansas and Ohio)</em></a><em>,&#8221; </em><a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=mal&amp;fileName=mal1/018/0189300/malpage.db&amp;recNum=1"><em>Page 2</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>But lawsuits are expensive, and big money has a huge advantage in the courts. We need to start fighting these unconstitutional laws in a new way.</p>
<p>Instead of relying on donations to fund small teams of attorneys, we as individuals need to directly petition our government for redress. We need to bring our complaints to the courts as pro se litigants.</p>
<p>While we’ll lose at the beginning, we’ll have the advantage of a very low cost per lawsuit. That means we can bring them sequentially, one after the other, in coordinated ways. All while learning as we go. (court cases are public record, so every legal theory that’s put forward will be responded to by the court, giving insights into how we can win the next case).</p>
<p>Of course, all of this assumes that we still have justice in our justice system. Either way, we need to know. Comments welcome …</p>

<p> While there may be others, I for one am working on it.  </p>
<p>You can read the background here:  <a href="http://proseaction.org/about.htm" rel="nofollow">http://proseaction.org/about.htm</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently suing Bank of America as a pro se litigant for all of the illegal and unethical things they have done to myself and others.  So far, I have lost all 13 of my initial claims. My case is currently in reconsideration.  If that fails, I can then file an appeal.  Win or lose, I will learn a ton in the process.</p>
<p> For a good overview of what&#8217;s currently at issue, I suggest reading <a href="http://proseaction.org/BoALawsuit/FenelloMoToReconBrf.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://proseaction.org/BoALawsuit/FenelloMoToReconBrf.pdf</a></p>
<p>While still early in the process, I do believe this strategy is strong, even if I don&#8217;t win my case.  </p>
<p>While other forms of activism can feel like begging for crumbs, bringing an issue before a judge can make things happen.  It can change the world.</p>
<p>Jay.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-79489" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The Anti-foreclosure Network is (afnetwork.org). along with many other allied groups. They use a pro-se strategy to bypass the legal establishment, which tends to give the banksters a free ride on their way to getting free houses. In complicity with quasi-government agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with the assistance of foreclosure mills (masquerade as law firms), the banksters operate collection agencies (which call themselves &#8220;loan servicers&#8221; while pretending to be banks) to confiscate homes for which they never loaned money. Where did the &#8220;money&#8221; come from? There was no money. Credit was extended via bookkeeping entries which created new &#8220;money&#8221; from the signatures on fraudulent documents. Mortgages and Deeds of Trust were converted to investment bonds, most of which were void soon after their creation. When investors saw through the fraud and stopped buying the bad paper, the banksters got Congress to bail them out. Now the Fed buys this paper at face value with money they create from nothing, so the banks can pretend they&#8217;re not bankrupt. But, you already know this, and have shown us the way out. Meanwhile, everyone with a mortgage (or Deed of Trust) should be filing a Quiet Title suit to compel the banksters to prove that they own the debt. When they can&#8217;t, the homeowners get their houses back.</p>

they can not dismiss all at one time,    All for one and one for all,  works well</p>
<p>I have followed cases with the courts,   filing pro-se for 10 years on the same serial rape / child homicide case&#8230;.one person filing Pro-Se  is simply   dismissed.</p>
<p>I have 10 years of court orders  ,  dismissing rape and murder of multiple women and children.    I paid 450 dollar appeal fees,   seven times,<br />

<p>Like Jay,   you can prove indisputably ,   the law was broken,    and lose  all 13 cases&#8230; when you are a person   fighting BOA..</p>

I filed as  a pro se litigant,   case after case,  for 10 years,   trying to put a man out of the workplace for felony rape of his office workers,  multiple homicides on the case&#8230;&#8230;.He is still in business.</p>
<p>Filing US Code with the courts, as a Pro Se litigant,     is an exercise in futility,    rape and murder do not count against big corporate money&#8230;.</p>
<p>But I am certain that large groups,    filing Pro Se,   federal statute law,  will  make them enforce the laws they write&#8230;.it should not cost anyone   one dime,    to make the government and the courts enforce the laws we have,      but it is just not working that way presently,    firms,  corporations,  have the &#8220;people power&#8221; ,    Pro Se&#8217;s  are just dismissed,   one at a time&#8230;.</p>
<p>Forming a Pro Se organization,   with a core team to do the actual work of preparing and filing cases&#8230;&#8230;is a very good idea..</p>

Upon filing, he stated:   “I spent many years in countries where the military had the power to arrest and detain citizens without charge.  I have been in some of these jails. I have friends and colleagues who have ‘disappeared’ into military gulags. I know the consequences of granting sweeping and unrestricted policing power to the armed forces of any nation. And while my battle may be quixotic, it is one that has to be fought if we are to have any hope of pulling this country back from corporate fascism.”</p>
<p>Initially, he won an injunction to stop those provisions of the NDAA, but that was quickly put on hold pending appeal.  Today, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the case, giving 60 pages of reasons why they ruled this way.  Now, Chris and his co-filers will have to decide whether to appeal this decision to the Supreme Court, or not.  (there&#8217;s no guarantee the Supreme Court would even hear this case, and it takes a large commitment of time and dollars to do so).</p>
<p>Whether they appeal or not, another person can now file another lawsuit designed to stop these provisions again.  This time, the suit can be filed in another Circuit, where the laws may be interpreted differently.  Best of all, the new case can address all of the shortcomings of the prior case … as neatly described in the 60 page Judge&#8217;s opinion.</p>
<p>Similar but different strategies work at the state level as well.</p>

<p>They have grown into a criminal operation,  using the courts for the sole purpose of  &#8220;generating the  revenue&#8221;  they need to survive.    Laws do not count for much with the courts anymore,   they only thing any Judge is counting is money hidden in their &#8220;sealed&#8221;  civil dockets.</p>
<p>While Jay&#8217;s  suits are routinely dismissed and denied,   bet your bottom dollar the  court transacted funds,     refused to enforce the laws of the United States,  then   &#8220;dismissed&#8221;   Jay&#8217;s case,   refusing to pay plaintiff&#8230;</p>
<p>I have filed volumes of federal statute laws with the courts, and the US Govt.<br />
to no avail.            Both my daughter and I have been badly brutalized,  over &#8220;lawsuit money&#8221;  issued to us.  The courts consider lawsuit money as their &#8220;revenue&#8221;</p>
<p>Courts will only pay out pennies on a dollar,  they call it  &#8220;forced settlements&#8221;  of lawsuit money &#8230;<br />
.I have had State police in my house,  refusing to arrest for rape in progress,<br />
we were charged with crimes.    Police &#8220;sued us&#8221;   for our lawsuit money,  they want that money as  &#8220;revenue&#8221;&#8230;<br />
That is against the law,  so ,  again filing suit,  demanding to be paid on our own lawsuits,       police started  using other people,  to &#8220;sue&#8221;  us, even assault us,     for that lawsuit money&#8230;taking a small portion of that money,  leaving the balance for the courts as their &#8220;revenue&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>There exists a dire need,   for the people to demand immediate downsize of the government,     they have become dangerous , the tax base can no longer support the government,  and they have degenerated into a well organized, criminal operation.</p>
<p>Our laws are not working in the courts,  Judges don&#8217;t even read the laws I filed with their courts,      It all comes down to money,  even in a case of serial rape and murder of women and kids&#8230;</p>
<p>File suits to demand  government downsize  ,  before they eat us alive..</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-81212" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hi Beverly,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry you&#8217;re having trouble in the federal court system.  </p>
<p>If it&#8217;s any consolation, many of the biggest corporations in the world have also had trouble getting their cases heard in federal court.  This is because the federal system as it is currently implemented only allows cases that have some chance of winning to go to trial.  Who decides if your case has some chance of winning?  Your federal judge.</p>
<p> While every profession has unethical players, I refuse to believe that every federal judge is corrupt. In fact, I know from recent rulings that some federal judges are fair, and are willing to make brave decisions that go against established interests.  Judge Rakoff in New York, and Judge Totenberg in Georgia, are two that come to mind.</p>
<p> To keep judges honest in their actions, each of their rulings are subject to review by one of 12 circuit Court of Appeals.  You can find which one you belong to here: <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/images/CircuitMap.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/images/CircuitMap.pdf</a></p>
<p> If you are not finding justice in the federal courts, it could be the result of: 1) bad rulings, 2) bad law, or 3) bad representation.  The first two can be addressed through appeal.  For the last one, we can learn from each other to minimize the impact of our lack of experience and specialized knowledge.</p>
<p> State court is another powerful option.  Just like the federal system, each state has its own court system, constitution, constitutional protections, and rules against murder, theft, fraud, etc.  In other words, most of the charges you can make in federal court, you can also make in state court.  </p>
<p> The challenge as I see it, is how to use the legal system to fix what&#8217;s going on in the world today.  While you and I may end up losing our respective cases, the things we learn along the way will be of great benefit to the next people who want to challenge the status quo.</p>

I proved,  federal Judges perjured themselves in court filed orders&#8230;deliberately covering up serial rape and murder&#8230;I filed volumes of federal statute law,   I filed against the Judges,  several pages of violations under the Judicial Conduct Act&#8230;Title 28 USC</p>

<p>The courts have been letting corporations rape women as a revenue source to the government for many years&#8230;.and all of that is against the laws of the United States&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>My daughter and I have suffered brutally,   because we wanted the courts,  government,  USDOJ,  police,  politicians,   to simply enforce the laws of the United States,   and they have refused to do so,  for the past  15 years&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.when it comes to rape and murder of women and kids&#8230;.no one should have to fight the entire US FED,   all the way to Joe Biden&#8217;s office&#8230;for Justice&#8230;</p>

<p>Sirica was removed as Executive Chair of the Judicial Conference,  removed as Chief Justice at the USCA in Philadelphia,    during the Judicial Misconduct Complaints..</p>
<p>Exposing utter corruption in the Judicial System,   the government,  the USDOJ,     nearly cost me the life of my daughter&#8230;they nearly killed her for the six to seven figures the courts are running on cases&#8230;..</p>
<p>I have filed in many courts,   volumes of laws,   crimes and civil cases&#8230;only to suffer brutal victim abuse,  of my self and my daughter&#8230;over all that &#8220;case money&#8221;&#8230;.<br />
It should be a crime to rape a woman in HER workplace,  in the United States of America,   a crime for a priest to rape a child&#8230;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see how the victim reporting these serious crimes can &#8220;lose a case&#8221;&#8230;.<br />
The government has been allowing corporations to rape women as a &#8220;revenue source&#8221;   for many years&#8230;.federal cases run six to seven figures&#8230;<br />
Rape and murder of women and kids should not be some &#8220;high dollar game&#8221;  run by our court system, and the USDOJ.<br />
&#8220;losing a case&#8221; ???  &#8230;.they damn near killed my daughter over all that money,  and exposing utter corruption,  with a solid paper trail,   all the way to the White House&#8230;</p>
<p>It should be a crime to rape women and kids,  here in America,   try telling that to Joe Biden&#8230;</p>
<p>It is the US FED ,   letting them rape women and kids&#8230;they are making money at this.<br />
No incarceration costs,   no crime stats&#8230;and six to seven figures in &#8220;revenue&#8221;   for a single case of priest sex abuse or a woman raped on her job&#8230;</p>
<p>AT this point,  I am afraid they will kill me or my daughter or both&#8230;.<br />
How does a  victim &#8220;lose a case&#8221;  for reporting serial rape, homicide,  extortion,  priest sex abuse,   to the US FED ????</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-79756" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Thank you Carl,  I am hoping that is true,   efforts of people like you, and Jay,   may produce results,   that is why I go out to organizations,  other people&#8230;.my daughter and I were brutally abused over all that &#8220;lawsuit&#8221;   money the courts are running&#8230;.as Jay stated,  big corporate money is the only thing counting in our courts,     and I don&#8217;t know how they call it &#8220;lawsuit money&#8221;  when the courts are taking money to cover up rape and murder,   but that is what they did&#8230;.</p>
<p>The US Fed has been allowing corporations to rape women,  as a &#8220;revenue source&#8221;  for as long as Joe Biden has been writting &#8220;rape policy&#8221;  from his seat in the Senate.   They are getting six to seven figures per case,  for a single case of a woman raped on her job.        </p>
<p>Fighting this issue all the way to Joe Biden&#8217;s office,   resulted in years of brutal abuse of me and my daughter..they targeted both of us for rape and abuse,  over all that &#8220;lawsuit&#8221;  money,   but moreso,    because we exposed absolute corruption,   in government,  to include the Supreme Court&#8230;..</p>
<p>I am scared they will kill either me or my daughter (or both of us)  over this issue&#8230;so I go out to others because no one wants a woman in their family,  raped on her job,  as &#8220;revenue&#8221; to Obama.       </p>
<p>Priest sex abuse cases are &#8220;high dollar&#8221;  as well&#8230;.</p>
<p>Churches are pure money,  received by &#8220;donations&#8221;  ,  and the fed can not get their hands on that money any other way,  because ,  they are tax exempt&#8230;.so they let them rape kids..(I am not making this up,   that is how our case started,  I reported priest sex abuse of my daughter to the authorities)&#8230;.</p>
<p>They are running six and seven figures on cases through the federal circuits,  State courts as well,     and they are NOT  going to pay out  that kind of money to victims&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>Some else has to fight this&#8230;..we all have women and kids,  in our families&#8230;<br />
Reporting rape gets very victim abusive,   and Justice does not happen,  </p>
<p>When rape stops,   so does all that federal &#8220;case money&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Revenue by Rape&#8221;   should not be happening in America,    telling that to Joe,  nearly cost me the life of my daughter&#8230;</p>
<p>Someone else has to fight this,   I am afraid they will go after my daughter again&#8230;</p>

<p>These monsters go after targets on purpose, in your family&#8217;s case, and for their sense of &#8220;fun.&#8221; There is no safe place on this Earth, it seems. I, for one, see no better plan than to act for all the families these psychopaths harm and kill.</p>

<p>Without these &#8220;monsters&#8221; ,  Joe&#8217;s &#8220;revenue by rape&#8221;  money goes away.<br />
and they are making serious money,  letting corporations  rape women that were just trying to work and earn a living&#8230;letting priests rape kids..<br />
Six to seven figures per case&#8230;.</p>
<p>In my case,  25 prior rape victims before me.    He is still in business,  and so is the priest that raped my kid&#8230;<br />
somehow,  all of this just comes down to money<br />
and I have lost count of the dead rape victims on this case,   </p>
<p>They should put the rapist in prison for free ,  but again,  that is when Joe&#8217;s &#8220;revenue&#8221;  dries up&#8230;</p>
<p>One &#8220;hoody&#8221;  gets shot and the Nation is in an uproar,    Joe and BO are making billions annually,   letting corporations rape women, letting priest&#8217;s rape kids and no one seems to be upset about that&#8230;..</p>
