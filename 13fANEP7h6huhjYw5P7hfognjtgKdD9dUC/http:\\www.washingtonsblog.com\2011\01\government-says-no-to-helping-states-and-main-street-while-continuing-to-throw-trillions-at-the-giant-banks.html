<p>The Wall Street Journal <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704739504576067602380461160.html">noted</a> last week:</p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday ruled out a central bank  bailout of state and local governments strapped with big municipal debt  burdens, saying the Fed had limited legal authority to help and little  will to use that authority.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no expectation or intention to get involved in state and local  finance,&#8221; Mr. Bernanke said in testimony before the Senate Budget  Committee. The states, he said later, &#8220;should not expect loans from the  Fed.&#8221; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Congress has also discontinued the Build American Bond program, which was significant in temporarily financing California and other states&#8217; budgets. See <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703296604576005193570602926.html?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTWhatsNewsCollection">this</a>, <a href="http://blogs.barrons.com/focusonfunds/2010/12/07/muni-etfs-fall-as-build-america-bond-extension-left-out-of-tax-cuts-plan/?mod=rss_BOLBlog">this</a>, <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2010/12/muni-bonds-bab-build-america-obama-congress-tax-free-yields.html">this</a> and <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/faros-special-report-severe-consequences-build-america-bond-program-expiration">this</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s unfortunate, given that many states and big cities are in a <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/12/2011-year-cities-go-bust.html">dire financial situation</a>, and given that Keynesian economists <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/02/which-stimulus-programs-have-most-bang.html">say</a> that aid to the states is one of the best forms of stimulus.</p>
<p>In any event, as Steve Keen <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/09/steve-keen-out-thinks-larry-summers.html">points out</a>, giving money to the <span style="font-style:italic;">debtors </span>is much better for stimulating the economy than giving it to the <span style="font-style:italic;">lenders</span>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as I will demonstrate below, virtually the <span style="font-style:italic;">entire</span> government economic policy is to throw trillions of dollars at the biggest banks.</p>
<p>Because there are so many rivers and streams of bailout money going to the big banks, I will start with the specifics and end with broader monetary policies.</p>
<p><u>Tarp: a Preview of Things to Come</u></p>
<p>The $700 billion dollar TARP bailout was a <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/02/mccain-paulson-and-bernanke-promised.html">massive bait-and-switch</a>.  The government <span style="font-style:italic;">said </span>it was doing it to soak up toxic assets, and then switched to saying it was needed to free up lending.  It <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/04/mega-banks-which-received-bailouts.html">didn&#8217;t do that</a> either. Indeed, the Fed <a style="font-style:italic;" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/03/m1-money-multiplier-still-crashing-each.html">doesn&#8217;t want</a> the banks to lend.</p>
<p>As I <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/03/bailout-money-instead-of-stabilizing.html">wrote</a> in March 2009:
</p>
<blockquote><p>The bailout money is just going to line the pockets of the wealthy,  instead of helping to stabilize the economy or even the companies  receiving the bailouts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bailout money is being used to <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/watchdog-no-hank-you-didnt-get-a-good-deal-for-the-taxpayer">subsidize</a>  companies run by horrible business men, allowing the bankers to receive  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;hs=foF&amp;pwst=1&amp;ei=8siMSarqEIG0sAPOtIn5CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=bailout+bonuses&amp;spell=1">fat  bonuses</a>, to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;hs=PRa&amp;ei=U8iMScWqIImMsAOS47mFCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=bailout+redecorate+office&amp;spell=1">redecorate</a>  their offices, and to buy <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matt-littman/john-thains-35000-toilet_b_162350.html">gold  toilets</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Frawstory.com%2Fnews%2F2008%2FWall_Street_CEOs_investment_bankers_charged_0206.html&amp;ei=PciMSdGcIZmMsQPbj6mSCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHLQKoP0h0UEVYhKRJVQncNg8mngw&amp;sig2=UC50MCbhFlmOQbS5ajilMw">prostitutes</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A  lot of the bailout money is going to the failing companies&#8217; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/29/AR2008102904533_pf.html">shareholders</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Indeed,  a leading progressive economist <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/02/leading-economist-says-true-purpose-of.html">says</a>  that the true purpose of the bank rescue plans is &#8220;a massive  redistribution of wealth to the bank shareholders and their top  executives&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Treasury Department <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2008/10/giant-companies-are-using-your-money-to.html"><span style="font-style:italic;">encouraged</span></a> banks to use the  bailout money to buy their competitors, and <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2008/10/even-the-new-york-times-calls-paulson-a-liar.html">pushed  through an amendment to the tax laws</a> which rewards mergers in the  banking industry (this has caused a lot of companies to bite off more  than they can chew, destabilizing the acquiring companies)</li>
</ul>
<p>And  as the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/06/business/economy/06insure.html?8au&amp;emc=au">notes</a>,  &#8220;Tens of billions of [bailout] dollars have merely passed through  A.I.G. to its derivatives trading partners&#8221;.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In  other words, through a little game-playing by the Fed, taxpayer money is  going <span style="font-style:italic;">straight in</span><span style="font-style:italic;">to</span> the pockets of investors in AIG&#8217;s  credit default swaps and is not even really stabilizing AIG.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the TARP bailout is <span style="font-style:italic;">peanuts </span>compared to the numerous other bailouts the government has given to the giant banks.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m not referring to the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aY0tX8UysIaM">$23  trillion</a> in bailouts, loans, guarantees and other publicy-disclosed programs  that the special inspector general for the TARP program mentions.  I&#8217;m talking about more covert  types of bailouts.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Mortgages and Housing</span></p>
<p>Most independent experts say that the government&#8217;s housing programs have been a failure.  That&#8217;s too bad, given that the housing slump is now &#8211; according to Zillow&#8217;s &#8211; <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/01/housing-slump-worse-than-great.html"><span style="font-style:italic;">worse </span>than during the Great Depression</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, PhD  economists <a href="http://www.hussmanfunds.com/wmc/wmc100104.htm">John  Hussman</a>   and <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-heres-the-real-reason-fannie-and-freddie-are-losing-so-much-money-its-2010-5">Dean    Baker, fund manager and financial writer Barry Ritholtz</a> and New York Times&#8217; writer <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/business/09gret.html?_r=1">Gretchen Morgenson</a>  say  that the only reason the government keeps giving billions to  Fannie and   Freddie is that it is really a huge, ongoing, back-door  bailout of the   big banks.   </p>
<p>Many also accuse Obama&#8217;s foreclosure relief programs  as being backdoor bailouts for the banks.  (See <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=adtt9PpAA4fQ">this</a>,  <a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/2010/03/30/obamas-new-initiatives-help-for-homeowners-or-banks-9246/">this</a>, <a href="http://www.pdamerica.org/articles/news/2010-05-01-12-28-16-news.php">this</a> and <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/08/guess-who-benefits-most-from-foreclosure-abatements/">this</a>).</p>
<p><u>Commercial Real Estate, Mortgage Backed Securities, Cars and Student Loans<br /></u></p>
<p>Some pretty sharp writers allege that the government is also secretly bailing out the banks by  supporting everything from <a href="http://www.mybudget360.com/the-shadow-bailout-of-the-commercial-real-estate-industry/">commercial real estate</a>, to <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/buried-deep-within-files-federal-reserve-released-thier-mbs-purchase-program-we-found-tarp-2">mortgage-backed securities</a>, <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=22679">car loans and student loans</a> (and don&#8217;t forget <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/12/fed-data-shows-b-of-and-wells-fargo.html">McDonald&#8217;s and Harley</a>).</p>
<p><u>Derivatives</u></p>
<p>The government&#8217;s failure to  rein in  derivatives or break up  the giant banks also constitute  enormous  subsidies, as it allows the  giants to make huge sums by  keeping the  true price points of their  derivatives secret.  See <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/04/who-would-not-want-transparency-for.html">this</a>  and <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/04/yet-another-reason-to-break-up-too-big.html">this</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Foreign Bailouts</span></p>
<p>The  big banks &#8211;  such as <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?sid=a7h1lGnar8Gg&amp;pid=20601087">JP     Morgan</a>  &#8211; also benefit from foreign bailouts, such as the  European bailout, as  they are some of the largest creditors of the bailed out countries, and  the bailouts allow them to get paid in full, instead of having to write  down their foreign losses.  So when the Fed bails out <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/12/fed-data-shows-b-of-and-wells-fargo.html">foreign banks</a>, it is a bailout for American banks as well.</p>
<p><u>Toxic Assets and Accounting Shenanigans<br /></u></p>
<p>The PPIP program &#8211; which was supposed to reduce the toxic assets  held by banks &#8211; actually <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/01/ppip-even-worse-than-i-thought.html">increased</a>  them (at least in the short-run), and just let the banks make a quick buck.</p>
<p>In   addition, the government suspended mark-to-market valuation of the   toxic assets held by the giant banks, and is allowing the banks to value   the assets at whatever price they desire.  This constitutes a huge   giveaway to the big banks.</p>
<p>As Forbes&#8217; Robert Lenzner <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/robertlenzner/2011/01/12/us-banks-reporting-phantom-income-on-1-4-trillion-delinquent-mortgages/?boxes=Homepagechannels">wrote</a> recently:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight:bold;">The  giant US banks have been bailed out again from  huge potential  writeoffs by loosey-goosey accounting</span> accepted by the accounting  profession and the regulators.</p>
<p>They   are allowed to accrue interest on non-performing mortgages ”  until  the  actual foreclosure takes place, which on average takes about  16   months.</p>
<p>All the phantom interest that is not actually collected   is booked as  income until the actual act of foreclosure. As a  resullt,   many bank  financial statements actually look much better than they   actually are.  At foreclosure all the phantom income comes off the   books of the banks.</p>
<p>This means that Bank of America, Citigroup,   JP Morgan and Wells  Fargo, among hundreds of other smaller   institutions, can report   interest due them, but not paid, on  an   estimated $1.4 trillion of face  value mortgages on the 7 million homes   that are in the process of being  foreclosed.</p>
<p>Ultimately, these   banks face a potential loss of $1 trillion on  nonperforming loans,   suggests Madeleine Schnapp, director of  macro-economic research at   Trim-Tabs, an economic consulting firm 24.5%  owned by Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p> The potential writeoffs could be even larger should home prices continue to weaken&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>And as one writer <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/700-billion-ha-real-costs-bailouts-are-much-higher#comment-351093">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>By   allowing banks to legally disregard mark-to-market accounting rules,   government allows banks to maintain investment grade ratings.</p>
<p>By   maintaining investment grade ratings, banks attract institutional  funds.  That would be the insurance and pension funds money that is  contributed  by the citizen.</p>
<p>As institutional money pours in, the stock price is propped up &#8230;.</p>

<p><u>Fraud As a Business Model</u></p>
<p><strong>If you stop and think for a moment, it is obvious that failing to prosecute fraud is a bailout.<br /></strong>
<p>Nobel prize-winning economist George Akerlof <a href="http://www.examiner.com/economic-policy-in-national/nobel-prize-winning-economist-described-the-root-of-the-financial-crisis-1993">demonstrated</a> that if big companies aren&#8217;t held responsible for their actions, the government ends up bailing them out.  So failure to prosecute directly leads to a bailout.</p>
<p>Moreover, as I <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/12/letting-fraud-continue-will-not-restart.html">noted</a> last month:</p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>Fraud benefits the wealthy more than the poor, because the big banks  and big companies have the inside knowledge and the resources to  leverage fraud into profits.     Joseph Stiglitz <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/2009/09/17/exclusive-nobel-winner-joseph-stiglitz-predicts-recessions-end/">noted</a>  in September that giants like Goldman are using their size to  manipulate the market.   The giants (especially Goldman Sachs) have also  used high-frequency program trading  (representing up to <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/10/yes-70-of-us-equity-trades-are-high.html">70% of all stock trades</a>) and high proportions of <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/10/high-frequency-traders-might-be.html">other trades</a> as well).  This not only <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/paul-wilmott-high-frequency-trading-may-increasingly-destabilize-market">distorts the markets</a>,  but which also lets the   program trading giants take a sneak peak at  what the real traders are buying and selling, and then trade on the  insider   information. See <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/whoa-glitch-hft">this</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/07/corporate-media-spotlights-distortion-of-market-by-high-frequency-trading.html">this</a>, <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/taxonomy_vtn/term/8356">this</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/07/what-is-high-frequency-trading-and-how.html">this</a>  and <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=18809">this</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley together hold <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/07/96-of-credit-derivative-risk-held-by-5.html">80% of the country&#8217;s derivatives risk, and <span style="font-style:italic;">96%</span> of the exposure to credit derivatives</a>. They use their dominance to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/business/12advantage.html">manipulate the market</a>.  <span><span><br /></span></span><span></span></p>
<p>Fraud disproportionally benefits the big players (and <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/04/alford-why-dismantling-too-big-to-fail-firms-makes-economic-sense.html">helps them to become</a> big in the first place),   increasing inequality and warping the market.
<p>[And]  Professor Black <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/09/austrian-economics-does-not-require.html">says</a> that fraud is a <span style="font-style:italic;">large part </span>of the mechanism through which bubbles are blown.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Finally, failure to prosecute mortgage fraud is arguably worsening the housing crisis.  See <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/12/double-dip-in-housing-largely-caused-by.html">this</a> and  <a href="http://www.tavakolistructuredfinance.com/FHFA1282010.pdf">this</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong></strong>The government has not only turned the other cheek, but aided and abetted the fraud.  In the words of financial crime expert William K. Black, the government &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/11/fraud-started-at-very-top-with.html">created an intensely criminogenic environment</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>And this environment is ongoing today.  See <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/12/fed-trying-making-it-harder-for.html">this</a>, for example.
<p><u>Settling Prosecutions For Pennies on the Dollar</u></p>
<p>Even when the government has prosecuted financial crime (because public outrage became too big to ignore), the government has settled for pennies on the dollar.</p>
<p>Nobel prize winning economist Joe Stiglitz <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/11/another-nobel-economist-says-we-have-to.html">says</a> about the way that the government is currently prosecuting financial crime:<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>The system is designed to actually encourage that kind of thing, even with the fines [referring to <strong>former  Countrywide CEO Angelo   Mozillo, who recently paid tens of millions of  dollars in fines, a small   fraction of what he actually earned,  because he earned hundreds of   millions.</strong>].  <strong></p>
<p>***</strong><strong></strong><br /><strong></strong><span><br /></span><strong>So the system is set so that even if you&#8217;re caught, the penalty is just a small number relative to what you walk home with.</strong></p>
<p>The  fine is just a cost of doing business. It&#8217;s like a parking fine.   Sometimes you make a decision to park knowing that you might get a fine   because going around the corner to the parking lot takes you too much   time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bloomberg <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-11/sec-watchdog-probes-enforcement-chief-over-citigroup-settlement.html">noted</a> on Monday:</p>
<blockquote><p>The    U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s internal  watchdog is    reviewing an allegation that Robert Khuzami, the agency’s  top    enforcement official, gave preferential treatment to Citigroup Inc.     executives in the agency’s $75 million settlement with the firm in July.</p>
<p>Inspector    General H. David Kotz opened the probe after a request from  U.S.    Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, who forwarded an  unsigned    letter making the allegation. Khuzami told his staff to soften   claims   against two executives after conferring with a lawyer   representing  the  bank, according to the letter….</p>
<p>According to  the letter, the   SEC’s staff was prepared to file fraud  claims against  both  individuals.  Khuzami ordered his staff to drop the  claims after   holding a “secret  conversation, without telling the staff,  with a   prominent defense  lawyer who is a good friend” of his and “who  was   counsel for the  company, not the individuals affected,” according to  a   copy of the  letter reviewed by Bloomberg News.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And  Freddie and Fannie&#8217;s  recent settlement with Bank of America &#8211; a couple  of  billions &#8211; has  been criticized by many as being a bailout.</p>
<p>In &#8220;BofA Freddie Mac Putbacks Resolved for 1¢ on $&#8221;, Barry Ritholtz <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/01/bofa-putbacks-freddie-mac/">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bank of America settled numerous claims with Fannie Mae for an astonishingly cheap rate, according to a Bloomberg report.</p>
<p>A  premium of $1.28 billion was paid to Freddie Mac to resolve $1  billion  in claims currently outstanding. But the kicker is that the deal  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">also covers potential future claims on $127 billion in loans sold by Countrywide through 2008</span>. That amounts to 1 cent on the dollar to Freddie Mac.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In &#8220;Is Fannie bailing out the banks?&#8221;, Forbes&#8217; Colin Barr <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2011/01/03/is-fannie-bailing-out-the-banks/">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Someone must be getting bailed out, right?</p>
<p>Why  yes, say critics of the giant banks. They charge that Monday&#8217;s  rally-stoking mortgage-putback deal between Bank of America (BAC) and  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is nothing more than a backdoor bailout of  the nation&#8217;s largest lender. It comes courtesy, they say, of an  administration struggling to find a fix for the housing market while  quaking at the prospect of another housing-fueled banking meltdown.</p>
<p>Monday&#8217;s  arrangement, according to this view, will keep the banks standing &#8212;  but leave taxpayers on the hook for an even bigger tab should a weak  economic recovery falter. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Edward]  Pinto says truly holding BofA responsible for all the mortgage mayhem   tied to its 2008 purchase of subprime lender Countrywide would likely  drive it into the arms of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which has  enough problems to deal with. Though BofA would surely dispute that  analysis, it&#8217;s easy enough to see where the feds don&#8217;t want that  outcome.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>But how sharp is Freddie if all it can do is  squeeze a $1.28 billion payment out of a giant customer in exchange for  relinquishing fraud claims on $117 billion worth of outstanding loans?  The very best its million-dollar executives can do is claw back a penny  on each bubbly subprime dollar?</p>
<p>That seems pretty weak even given that this is Congress&#8217; favorite subsidy dispenser we&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p>&#8220;How  Freddie can justify this decision to settle &#8216;all outstanding and  potential&#8217; claims before any of the private-label putback lawsuits have  been resolved is beyond comprehension,&#8221; says Rebel Cole, a real estate  and finance professor at DePaul University in Chicago. &#8220;This smells to  high heaven and they should be called out.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In &#8220;Bank Of America Just Admitted That Its Fannie And Freddie Settlement Was A Bailout&#8221;, Business Insider&#8217;s Joe Weisenthal <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bank-of-america-just-admitted-that-its-fannie-and-freddie-settlement-was-a-bailout-2011-1">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bank of America has basically confirmed that the critics are correct: It was the beneficiary of a bailout.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-05/bofa-says-fannie-mae-mortgage-deal-a-necessary-step-in-housing-recovery.html">According to Bloomberg</a>,   BofA&#8217;s Jerry Dubrowski said: “Our agreements with Fannie Mae and   Freddie Mac are a necessary step toward the ultimate recovery of the   housing market.”</p>
<p>Get it? This was not about settling mortgage  putback exposure at the  legal level. It was about helping the greater  good. It&#8217;s the same  too-big-to-fail logic all over again: What&#8217;s good  for Bank of America is  good for America.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the Washington post <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/03/AR2011010304495.html">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This  is a gift” from the government to the bank, said Christopher  Whalen of  Institutional Risk Analytics. “We’re all paying for this  because it  will show up in the losses from Fannie and Freddie,” he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Congresswoman Waters <a href="https://waters.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=218846">said</a>:
<p><span class="middlecopy"><span class="middlecopy"><br />
<blockquote>I’m  concerned that  the settlement between  Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and  Bank of America over  misrepresentations in  the mortgages BofA  originated may amount to a  backdoor bailout that  props up the bank at  the expense of taxpayers.   Given the strong  repurchase rights built  into Fannie Mae and Freddie  Mac’s contracts with  banks, and the recent  court setback for Bank of  America in similar  litigation with a  private insurer, I’m fearful that  this settlement may  have been both  premature and a giveaway.  The fact  that Bank of  America’s stock  surged after this deal was announced only  serves to fuel  my suspicion  that this settlement was merely a slap on  the wrist that  sets a bad  example for other negotiations in the  future.</p></blockquote>

<p><u>Guaranteeing a Fat Spread on Interest Rates</u></p>
<p>Bloomberg <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=a15fJjgCvhSw">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span>“<span>The  trading profits of the  Street is just another way of measuring the  subsidy the Fed is giving to  the banks</span>,</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">”</span><span> said  Christopher Whalen, managing director of Torrance,  California-based</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span>Institutional Risk Analytics.  “It’s a transfer from  savers to banks.”  </span><span>
<p>The  trading  results, which helped the banks report higher quarterly   profit than  analysts estimated even as unemployment stagnated at a   27-year high,  came with a big assist from the Federal Reserve. The U.S.   central bank  helped lenders by holding short-term borrowing costs  near  zero, giving  them a chance to profit by carrying even 10-year  government  notes that  yielded an average of 3.70 percent last quarter.</p>
<p>The  gap between  short-term interest rates, such as what banks may pay  to  borrow in  interbank markets or on savings accounts, and longer-term   rates, known  as the yield curve, has been at record levels. The   difference between  yields on 2- and 10-year Treasuries yesterday  touched  2.71 percentage  points, near the all-time high of 2.94  percentage  points set Feb. 18.</p>
<p></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Harry Blodget <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-wall-street-2010-5#ixzz0npcmAWA7">explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The   latest quarterly reports from the big Wall Street banks revealed a    startling fact: None of the big four banks had a single day in the    quarter in which they lost money trading.</p>
<p>For the 63 straight   trading days in Q1, in other words, Goldman Sachs  (GS), JP Morgan   (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), and Citigroup (C) made  money trading for   their own accounts.</p>
<p>Trading, of course, is supposed to be a  risky  business: You win some,  you lose some. That&#8217;s how traders  justify  their gargantuan  bonuses&#8211;their jobs are so risky that they  deserve to  be paid millions  for protecting their firms&#8217; precious  capital. (Of  course, the only thing  that happens if traders fail to  protect that  capital is that taxpayers  bail out the bank and the  traders are paid  huge &#8220;retention&#8221; bonuses to  prevent them from leaving  to trade  somewhere else, but that&#8217;s a  different story).</p>
<p>But these days,  trading isn&#8217;t risky at all. In fact, it&#8217;s safer than  walking down the  street.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because  the US government is lending money to  the big banks at  near-zero  interest rates. And the banks are then  turning around and  lending that  money back to the US government at  3%-4% interest rates,  making 3%+  on the spread. What&#8217;s more, the banks  are leveraging this  trade,  borrowing at least $10 for every $1 of  equity capital they have,  to  increase the size of their bets.  Which  means the banks can turn   relatively small amounts of equity into huge  profits&#8211;by borrowing from   the taxpayer and then lending back to the  taxpayer.</p>

<p>The  government&#8217;s  zero-interest-rate policy, in other words, is the   biggest Wall Street  subsidy yet. So far, it has done little to increase   the supply of  credit in the real economy. But it has hosed  responsible  people who  lived within their means and are now earning  next-to-nothing  on their  savings. It has also allowed the big Wall  Street banks to print  money  to offset all the dumb bets that brought  the financial system to  the  brink of collapse two years ago. And it  has fattened Wall Street  bonus  pools to record levels again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Paul Abrams <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-abrams/congress-should-regulate_b_574453.html">chimes in</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>To  get a clear picture of what is going on here, ignore the  intermediate  steps (borrowing money from the fed, investing in  Treasuries), as they  are riskless, and it immediately becomes clear that  this is merely a  direct payment from the Fed to the banking  executives&#8230;for nothing.   No nifty new tech product has been created.   No illness has been  treated.  No teacher has figured out how to get a  third-grader to  understand fractions.  No singer&#8217;s voice has entertained  a packed  stadium.  No batter has hit a walk-off double. No &#8220;risk&#8221;has  even been  &#8220;managed&#8221;, the current mantra for what big banks do that is so   goddamned important that it is doing &#8220;god&#8217;s work&#8221;.</p>
<p>Nor has any  credit been extended to allow the real value-producers to  meet payroll,  to reserve a stadium, to purchase capital equipment, to  hire  employees.  Nothing.</p>
<p>Congress should put an immediate halt to this  practice.  Banks should  have to show that the money they are borrowing  from the Fed is to  provide credit to businesses, or consumers, or  homeowners.  Not a penny  should be allowed to be used to purchase  Treasuries.  Otherwise, the Fed  window should be slammed shut on their  manicured fingers.  </p>
<p>And, stiff criminal penalties should be  enacted for those banks that  mislead the Fed about the destination of  the money they are borrowing.   Bernie Madoff needs company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Interest Paid on Excess Reserves</u></p>
<p>The Fed has been paying the big banks interest on the &#8220;excess reserves&#8221; which those banks deposit at the Fed.  </p>
<p>Specifically, the Fed is intentionally paying the banks a <span style="font-style:italic;">higher </span>interest rate to park their money at the Fed than they would make if they loaned it out to Main Street.  This is money going to the big banks.</p>
<p>(Moreover, top Fed officials have publicly stated that this policy of paying interest on excess reserves deposited at the Fed is intentionally aimed at <span style="font-style:italic;">reducing loans</span> to Main Street, as a way  to fight inflation.)</p>

<p><u>Quantitative Easing</u></p>
<p>As I <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/08/quantitative-easing-wont-help-economy.html">noted</a> last August:</p>
</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>[The] Treasury Department <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2008/10/giant-companies-are-using-your-money-to.html"><span style="font-style:italic;">encouraged</span></a> banks to use the  bailout money to buy their competitors, and <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2008/10/even-the-new-york-times-calls-paulson-a-liar.html">pushed  through an amendment to the tax laws</a>  which rewards mergers in the  banking industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-reich/why-cheaper-money-wont-me_b_698485.html">pointed out</a> that quantitative easing won&#8217;t help the economy, but will simply fuel a new round of mergers and acquisitions:</p>
<blockquote><p>A  debate is being played out in the Fed about whether it should  return  to so-called &#8220;quantitative easing&#8221; &#8212; buying more mortgage-backed   securities, Treasury bills, and other bonds &#8212; in order to lower the   cost of capital still further.  </p>
<p>The sad reality is that cheaper  money won&#8217;t work. Individuals aren&#8217;t  borrowing because they&#8217;re still  under a huge debt load. And as their  homes drop in value and their jobs  and wages continue to disappear,  they&#8217;re not in a position to borrow.  Small businesses aren&#8217;t borrowing  because they have no reason to  expand. Retail business is down,  construction is down, even  manufacturing suppliers are losing ground.</p>
<p>That leaves large  corporations. They&#8217;ll be happy to borrow more at  even lower rates than  now &#8212; even though they&#8217;re already sitting on  mountains of money.</p>
<p>But  this big-business borrowing won&#8217;t create new jobs. To the  contrary,  large corporations have been investing their cash to pare back  their  payrolls. They&#8217;ve been buying new factories and facilities abroad   (China, Brazil, India), and new labor-replacing software at home.</p>
<p>If  Bernanke and company make it even cheaper to borrow, they&#8217;ll be   unleashing a third corporate strategy for creating more profits but   fewer jobs &#8212; mergers and acquisitions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, Yves Smith <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/08/japans-experience-suggests-quantitative-easing-helps-financial-institutions-not-real-economy.html">reports</a> that quantitative easing didn&#8217;t really help the Japanese economy, only <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">big</span> Japanese companies:</p>
<blockquote><p>A few days ago, <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/08/more-debate-on-qe.html">we noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When an economy is very slack, cheaper money is not going to induce much in the way of real economy activity. </p>
<p>Unless  you are a financial firm, the level of interest rates is a  secondary  or tertiary consideration in your decision to borrow. You will  be  interested in borrowing only if you first, perceive a business need   (usually an opportunity). The next question is whether it can be   addressed profitably, and the cost of funds is almost always not a   significant % of total project costs (although availability of funding   can be a big constraint)…..</p>
<p>So cheaper money will operate  primarily via their impact on asset  values. That of course helps  financial firms, and perhaps the Fed hopes  the wealth effect will  induce more spending. But that’s been the movie  of the last 20+ years,  and Japan pre its crisis, of having the  officialdom rely on asset price  inflation to induce more consumer  spending, and we know how both  ended. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/08/the-data-on-japanese-quantitative-easing.html">Tyler Cowen points</a> to a <a href="http://www.boj.or.jp/en/type/ronbun/ron/wps/wp06e10.htm">Bank of Japan paper by Hiroshi Ugai</a>, which looks at Japan’s experience with quantitative easing from 2001 to 2006. Key findings:</p>
<blockquote><p>….these  macroeconomic analyses verify that because of the  QEP, the premiums on  market funds raised by financial institutions  carrying substantial  non-performing loans (NPLs) shrank to the extent  that they no longer  reflected credit rating differentials. This  observation implies that  the QEP was effective in maintaining financial  system stability and an  accommodative monetary environment by removing  financial institutions’  funding uncertainties, and by averting further  deterioration of  economic and price developments resulting from  corporations’  uncertainty about future funding.</p>
<p>Granted the positive above  effects of preventing further  deterioration of the economy reviewed  above, many of the macroeconomic  analyses conclude that the QEP’s  effects in raising aggregate demand and  prices were limited. In  particular, when verified empirically taking  into account the fact that  the monetary policy regime changed under the  zero bound constraint of  interest rates, the effects from increasing the  monetary base were not  detected or smaller, if anything, than during  periods when there was no  zero bound constraint. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yves here,  This is an important conclusion, and is consistent with the<a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/03/japan-says-us-financial-crisis-worse.html"> warnings the Japanese gave to the US during the financial crisis</a>,   which were uncharacteristically blunt. Conventional wisdom here is  that  Japan’s fiscal and monetary stimulus during the bust was too slow  in  coming and not sufficiently large. The Japanese instead believe,   strongly, that their policy mistake was not cleaning up the banks. As   we’ve noted, that’s also consistent with an<a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/09/new-imf-study-of-banking-crises.html"> IMF study of 124 banking crises</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Existing  empirical research has shown that <span style="font-weight:bold;">providing  assistance to banks and  their borrowers can be counterproductive,  resulting in increased losses  to banks, which often abuse forbearance to  take unproductive risks at  government expense</span>. The typical result of  forbearance is a deeper hole  in the net worth of banks, crippling tax  burdens to finance bank  bailouts, and even more severe credit supply  contraction and economic  decline than would have occurred in the absence  of forbearance.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Cross-country  analysis to date also shows that accommodative policy  measures (such  as substantial liquidity support, explicit government  guarantee on  financial institutions’ liabilities and forbearance from  prudential  regulations) tend to be fiscally costly and that these  particular  policies do not necessarily accelerate the speed of economic  recovery. </span> Of course, the caveat to these findings is that a  counterfactual to the  crisis resolution cannot be observed and therefore  it is difficult to  speculate how a crisis would unfold in absence of  such policies. Better  institutions are, however, uniformly positively  associated with faster  recovery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But (to put it charitably) the Fed sees  the world through a  bank-centric lens, so surely what is good for its  charges must be good  for the rest of us, right? So if the economy  continues to weaken, the  odds that the Fed will resort to it as a  remedy will rise, despite the  evidence that it at best treats symptoms  rather than the underlying  pathology.</p>

<p><u>Buying Bonds</u></p>
<p>So quantitative easing in general favors the big guys &#8211; by encouraging mergers and acquisitions, allowing them to take risky gambles and engage in other shenanigans &#8211; and doesn&#8217;t help the economy as a whole.</p>
<p>But quantitative easing also provides a more direct bailout for the big banks.</p>
<p>Specifically, the current round of quantitative easing involves the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/business/economy/11fed.html">Federal Reserve buying U.S. treasury bonds from the &#8220;primary dealers&#8221;</a> &#8211; i.e. the biggest banks.</p>
<p>The Fed announces well in advance how much of what bonds it will be buying, and also buys the bonds in it&#8217;s own name (not anonymously or through a proxy).  That ensures that the banks can charge more for the bonds.</p>
<p>For example, as the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/business/economy/11fed.html">notes</a>:</p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>“A buyer of $100 billion a month is always going to be paying top  prices,” [Louis V. Crandall, the chief economist at the research firm Wrightson ICAP] said of the Fed. “You can’t be a known buyer of  $100 billion a month and get a good price.”        </p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, people such as Jonathan Loman <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/fed-gifting-primary-dealers-monthly-commission-fee-over-5-billion">argue</a> that the Fed is actually &#8220;gifting&#8221; the primary dealers with $5 billion dollars per month by <span style="font-style:italic;">intentionally </span><span style="font-style:italic;">overpaying </span>for the bonds.</p>
<p><u>Too Big As Subsidy</u></p>
<p>The fact that the giant banks are &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; <a href="http://www.examiner.com/examiner/x-8198-Economic-Policy-Examiner%7Ey2009m5d4-Nobel-prizewinning-economist-described-the-root-of-the-financial-crisis-in-1993">encourages them to take huge, risky gambles</a> that they would not otherwise take.  If they win, they make <span style="font-style:italic;">big</span> bucks. If they lose, they know the government will just bail them out.  This is a gambling subsidy.</p>
<p>For example, as the Special Inspector General of the Troubled Asset Relief Program <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN139537020110113">said</a> today:<span id="articleText">
</p>
<blockquote><p>When the government assured the world in 2008 that it would not let Citigroup fail, it did more than reassure the troubled markets &#8212; it encouraged high-risk behavior by insulating risk-takers from the consequences of failure.</p></blockquote>
<p></span></p>
</p>
<p>And as former International Monetary Fund chief economist Simon Johnson <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2011/01/06/why-is-the-us-taxpayer-subsidizing-facebook-%E2%80%93-and-the-next-bubble/">wrote</a> last week:</p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>Any financial institution with such access to such government support is  likely to take on excessive risk – this is the heart of what is  commonly referred to as the problem of “moral hazard.”  If you are fully  insured against adverse events, you will be less careful.</p></blockquote>
<p>The  very size of the too big to fails also decreases the ability of the   smaller banks to compete.  And &#8211; since the government itself helped make   the giants even bigger &#8211; that is also a subsidy to the big boys (see <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/10/debunking-the-too-big-to-fail-myth.html">this</a>).</p>
<p>The monopoly power given to the big banks (technically an &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/09/zandi-the-oligopoly-has-tightened.html">oligopoly</a>&#8220;) is a subsidy in other ways as well.  For example, Nobel prize winning economist Joseph  Stiglitz <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/2009/09/17/exclusive-nobel-winner-joseph-stiglitz-predicts-recessions-end/">said</a>  in September that giants like Goldman are using their size to  manipulate the market: </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The   main problem that Goldman raises is a question of size: &#8216;too big to   fail.&#8217; In some markets, they have a significant fraction of trades. Why   is that important? They trade both on their proprietary desk and on   behalf of customers. When you do that and you have a significant   fraction of all trades, you have a lot of information.&#8221;</p>
<p>Further,   he says, &#8220;That raises the potential of conflicts of interest, problems   of front-running, using that inside information for your proprietary   desk. And that&#8217;s why the Volcker report came out and said that we need   to restrict the kinds of activity that these large institutions have. If   you&#8217;re going to trade on behalf of others, if you&#8217;re going to be a   commercial bank, you can&#8217;t engage in certain kinds of risk-taking   behavior.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The giants  (especially Goldman Sachs) have also used high-frequency program trading   which not only <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/paul-wilmott-high-frequency-trading-may-increasingly-destabilize-market">distorted  the markets</a>  &#8211; making up more than 70% of stock trades &#8211; but which  also let the  program trading giants take a sneak peak at what the real  (aka “human”)  traders are buying and selling, and then trade on the  insider  information. See <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/whoa-glitch-hft">this</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/07/corporate-media-spotlights-distortion-of-market-by-high-frequency-trading.html">this</a>,  <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/taxonomy_vtn/term/8356">this</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/07/what-is-high-frequency-trading-and-how.html">this</a>   and <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=18809">this</a>.  (This is  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_running">frontrunning</a>,   which is illegal; but it is a lot bigger than garden variety   frontrunning, because the program traders are not only trading based on   inside knowledge of what their own clients are doing, they are also   trading based on knowledge of what all other traders are doing).</p>
<p>Goldman also <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/07/goldman-sachs-admits-its-software-can.html">admitted</a>   that its proprietary trading program can &#8220;manipulate the markets in   unfair ways&#8221;. The giant banks have also allegedly used their <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=SLE&amp;q=%22counterparty+risk+management+policy+group%22&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=g3">Counterparty  Risk Management Policy Group</a> (CRMPG) to exchange secret information  and formulate coordinated mutually beneficial actions, all with the <a href="http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/bank/hba57791.000/hba57791_0f.htm">government&#8217;s  blessings</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, the giants receive <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2009/10/6/a_hidden_34_billion_bank_subsidy">many billions in subsidies</a>  by receiving government guarantees that they are &#8220;too big to fail&#8221;,  ensuring that they have to pay lower interest rates to attract  depositors.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">These are just a few of the secret bailouts programs the government is giving to the giant banks.   There are many other bailout programs as well.  If these bailouts and subsidies are added up, they amount to many tens &#8211; or perhaps even hundreds &#8211; of trillions of dollars.<br /></span>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;"> And then there is the cost of debasing the currency in order to print money to fund these bailouts.  The cost to the American citizen in less valuable dollars could be truly staggering. From another perspective, running up our national debt to pay for the bailouts is costing us dearly by <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/01/us-will-hit-94-debt-to-gdp-ratio-next.html">reducing our economy&#8217;s growth</a> (and see <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/bank-international-settlements-sees-us-debtgdp-over-400-2040">this</a>).<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">And it is the top executives who reap the benefit of the bailouts through huge bonuses. Since the big banks continue to engage in highly-leveraged, risky, speculative activities, the bailouts have not made them any more stable.  See <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/business/economy/26trade.html?_r=1">this</a>, for example.</span></p>
