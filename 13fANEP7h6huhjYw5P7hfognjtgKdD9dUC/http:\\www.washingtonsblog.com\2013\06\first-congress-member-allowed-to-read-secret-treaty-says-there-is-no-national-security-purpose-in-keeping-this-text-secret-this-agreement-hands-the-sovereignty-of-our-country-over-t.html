<h3 style="color: #000099;">Corporations Push to Overrule National Laws</h3>
<p>We <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/06/international-treaty-negotiated-in-secret-even-hiding-the-terms-from-congressmen-with-every-reason-to-see-them-threatens-to-destroy-national-sovereignty.html">reported</a> last year:</p>
<blockquote><p>Democratic Senator Wyden – the head of the committee which is supposed to oversee it – is so furious about the lack of access that he has <a title="introduced legislation" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/23/trans-pacific-partnership-ron-wyden_n_1540984.html" target="_hplink">introduced legislation</a> to force disclosure.</p>
<p>Republican House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa is so upset by it that he has <a title="leaked a document" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/16/darrell-issa-trans-pacific-partnership-trade-deal_n_1521035.html" target="_hplink">leaked a document</a> on his website to show what’s going on.</p>
<p>What is everyone so furious about?</p>
<p>An international treaty being negotiated in secret which would not only <a title="crack down on Internet privacy" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/01/acta-would-usurp-congressional-authority-threatens-numerous-public-interests-a-backroom-special-interest-deal.html">crack down on Internet privacy</a> much more than SOPA or ACTA, but would actually<strong><em> destroy the sovereignty</em></strong> of the U.S. and all other signatories.</p>
<p>It is called the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).</p>
<p>Wyden is the <em>chairman</em> of the trade committee in the Senate … the committee which is supposed to have <em>jurisdiction over</em> the TPP. Wyden is also on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and so he and his staff have high security clearances and are normally able to look at classified documents.</p>
<p>And yet Wyden and his staff have been denied access to the TPP’s text.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, the decision to keep the text of TPP secret was <em>itself</em> classified as secret:</p>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.democracynow.org/embed/story/2012/6/14/breaking_08_pledge_leaked_trade_doc" frameborder="0" width="740" height="416.901408452"></iframe></center></  br></p>
<p>(I have also received a tip from a credible inside source that TPP contains provisions which would severely harm America&#8217;s national security. Specifically, like some <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/news/9243-murtha-sees-security-threat-in-trade-deal">previous</a>, <a href="http://www.citizen.org/documents/MurthaOmanStatement_1.pdf">ill-conceived</a> treaties, TPP would allow foreign companies to buy sensitive American assets which could subject us to terror attacks or economic blackmail.)</p>
<p>Yesterday, Congressman Alan Grayson (who knows how to read legislation &#8230; he was a successful lawyer before he was elected to Congress, and has written and co-sponsored numerous bills himself including the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/25/federal-reserve-audit-bill_n_1702879.html">bill to audit the Federal Reserve</a> and &#8211; most recently &#8211; the <a href="http://www.mindyourownbusinessact.com/">“Mind Your Own Business Act”</a> to stop NSA spying) announced that he had been allowed to read the text of TPP &#8211; and that it is  <a href="http://alangraysonemails.tumblr.com/post/53325968066/i-saw-the-secret-trade-deal">an anti-American power grab by big corporations</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Last month, 10,000 of us submitted comments to the United States Trade Representative (USTR), in which we objected to new so-called free trade agreements. We asked that the government not sell out our democracy to corporate interests.</p>
<p>Because of this pressure, the USTR  <strong>finally let a member of Congress </strong>– little ole me, Alan Grayson [anyone who's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJqM2tFOxLQ">seen Grayson in action</a> knows that he is formidable] –<strong> actually see the text</strong> of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The TPP is a large, secret trade agreement that is being negotiated with many countries in East Asia and South America.</p>
<p>The TPP is nicknamed “NAFTA on steroids.”  Now that I’ve read it, I can see why. I can’t tell you what’s in the agreement, because the U.S. Trade Representative calls it classified. But I can tell you two things about it.</p>
<p><strong>1)    There is no national security purpose in keeping this text secret. </strong></p>
<p><strong> 2)    This agreement hands the sovereignty of our country over to corporate interests.</strong></p>
<p>3)    What they can’t afford to tell the American public is that [the rest of this sentence is classified]<em>.</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I will be fighting this agreement with everything I’ve got. And I know you’ll be there every step of the way.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Courage,</p>
<p>Congressman Alan Grayson</p></blockquote>
<p>Grayson also <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/18/alan-grayson-trans-pacific-partnership_n_3456167.html">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is ironic in a way that the government thinks it&#8217;s alright to have a record of every single call that an American makes, but not alright for an American citizen to know what sovereign powers the government is negotiating away.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Having seen what I&#8217;ve seen, I would characterize this as a gross abrogation of American sovereignty. And I would further characterize it as a punch in the face to the middle class of America. I think that&#8217;s fair to say from what I&#8217;ve seen so far. But I&#8217;m not allowed to tell you why!</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember that one of the best definitions of fascism – the one used by Mussolini – is the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=hoE&amp;q=fascism+merger+of+state+and+corporate+power&amp;btnG=Search">“merger of state and corporate power&#8221;</a>. Our nation has been <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/10/capitalism-socialism-or-fascism.html">moving in that direction</a> for a number of years, where government and giant corporations are becoming more and more intertwined in a <a title="malignant, symbiotic relationship" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/10/conservatives-and-liberals-agree-end-the-malignant-symbiotic-relationship-between-big-government-and-big-corporations.html">malignant, symbiotic relationship</a>.   TPP would be the nail in the coffin for free market economics and democracy.</p>

The Constitution is supreme in law, so how can a secondary oath supplant the primary oath to defend it?</p>
<p>Thing done in secret to subvert the Constitution are inherently treasonous. No one made a so-called trade representative Queen. We didn&#8217;t elect him. His office is not elected. And Congress cannot excuse the continued success of this secret, transnational power by saying &#8220;we didn&#8217;t know, &#8220;we weren&#8217;t informed,&#8221; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t read it,&#8221; etc. It must be stopped, and their oath and office says their loyalty to secrecy is misplaced.</p>

<p>10 million rabid gun owners couldn&#8217;t take over the federal government, much less 3 million. They might be able to take over a state house &#8211; for about three days. Then they would be slaughtered.</p>
<p>More likely is that a small insurrection like this would provide the cause with martyrs, then the rest might have some guts to make a few more hits on local governments. Eventually these people would also be mowed down. Realizing the takeover of government buildings is fruitless, this &#8220;patriot&#8221; movement would venture into guerrilla warfare, murdering politicians and others that speak against them. The public would then turn hard against these patriots, and the movement would die a quick death (but only after we give up more of our privacy rights to catch them).</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to hear your idea how an armed insurrection is going to solve the problems of the USA.</p>

<p>Practically every militarily significant weapon made in the last 100 years has sold. 4.6 million weapon sales in 30 days and empty ammo shelves is not a panic – it’s battlespace preparation.</p>
<p>The second mistake they make is to try to assert that this trend is about racism because Obama is half-black. That’s a cop-out used to demonize and divide – It’s an easy excuse to ignore another person’s points, and justify doing bad things to them; it&#8217;s an attempt to convince people that those who oppose the regime&#8217;s policies and actions are evil or deranged.</p>
<p>Their final mistake is to assume that the military and law enforcement agencies will follow orders to disarm their fellow Americans.  The military and police are a sub-section of the total population, and will break along the same ideological lines.</p>
<p>Some police and military members will follow orders.  Many,  probably most, will disobey, desert, and rebel against orders to attack, imprison, or murder their families, neighbors, and fellow patriots to prop up a corrupt and tyrannical regime.</p>
<p>This has been played out time and time again in human history.</p>
<p>Statist politicians should not assume an insurrection will end easily, nor that those they&#8217;ve  demonized will go quietly into the dark night, nor that they personally will not suffer if it blows up.</p>
<p>Never let your government disarm you and render you defenseless against their excesses.</p>
<p>It will be up to the American people to solve the problems the tyrants and banksters have created as a means to steal our wealth and strip us of our liberty.</p>
<p>After the tyrants are removed from power, they and their partners in crimes against the Constitution and the American people need to be tried in a modern day version of the Nuremberg Trials, here on American soil, by American citizens who are loyal to the Constitution, then punished according to their crimes.  Treason is punishable by death.   Keep the faith, justice will ultimately be served.</p>
<p>And remember, it&#8217;s not treason to oppose forces that seek to subvert the Constitution.</p>

4G warfare, first used by Clinton in the former Yugoslavia, also takes the fight directly to the head of the snake (or headS of the hydra).  That seems to have a deleterious effect on both command structure and political will, which speeds the fall of the oppressors.</p>

If you are a Marxist, or collectivist of any stripe, that is your chief concern, not some mooslim terrorist. A little terror just reminds people how much they need their dear government to protect them.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, there are still some Americans that are willing to kill for their country, just like our Founders. And their numbers are growing right along with all the gun sales since Obama took office.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the American Revolution, the active forces in the field against the King&#8217;s tyranny never amounted to more than 3% of the colonists. They were in turn actively supported by perhaps 10% of the population. In addition to these revolutionaries were perhaps another 20% who favored their cause but did little or nothing to support it. Another one-third of the population sided with the King (by the end of the war there were actually more Americans fighting FOR the King than there were in the field against him) and the final third took no side, blew with the wind and took what came.</p>
<p>Three Percenters today do not claim that we represent 3% of the American people, although we might. That theory has not yet been tested. We DO claim that we represent at least 3% of American gun owners, which is still a healthy number somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 million people. History, for good or ill, is made by determined minorities. We are one such minority. So too are the current enemies of the Founders&#8217; Republic. What remains, then, is the test of will and skill to determine who shall shape the future of our nation.&#8221; &#8211; from &#8220;The Three Percenters&#8221; by Mike Vanderboegh, Sipsey Street Irregulars blogspot dot com.</p>
<p>There are now about 100 million gun owners in the United States. In military matters, quantity has a quality all its own.</p>

See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism</a> for more. Using the word &#8220;fascism&#8221; as a non-specific smear is worthless and pointless. Know your enemy, and be able to describe what&#8217;s happening correctly. Understand its antecedents and its underlying motives. These people are not fascists. They are capitalists, and they are buying and dismantling our government.</p>

Yes, they ARE fascists.

<p>This is the tipping point of where the political class have won the battle against the country class. And they did it without any resistance, because they OUTLAWED the chance to resist!</p>
<p>I would definitely support any member of Congress who proposed a bill that would make all treaty negotiations public. Also anyone that proposes a bill to make all treaty documents open to public view for one year before the Senate is allowed to take a vote on the treaty.</p>
<p>Our nation&#8217;s political class is selling the nation down the river. We have definitely reached the point where the political class is making the decisions, while the country class suffers with the consequences. Another example of this is the current battle over immigration, when we see Senators cross party lines &#8220;just to see that we get something done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why are we always being treated to this crisis mentality in Washington? People do not make good decisions in times of crisis. When you have leadership that FORCES crisis upon everyone, just to make something happen, then you get the most dangerous situation possible. This was how a thug in Germany took over a whole nation in the 1930&#8242;s.</p>

As John Lennon said, &#8220;once you become violent, the government knows how to handle you.&#8221; The 2nd revolution will be won through peaceful civil disobedience. Imagine what would happen if everyone suddenly stopped working, stopped paying bills, stopped paying taxes, stopped showing up for court, started ignoring all of their silly rules (laws). When our dollar finally collapses, don&#8217;t fall for the same old tricks. So no to centralized banks, fractional reserves and fiat money. Don&#8217;t let those who engineered this fiasco come up with the solutions. Remember, those at the top have only one direction to travel. Same with those at the bottom. It&#8217;s time to stop giving away our power, and start taking responsibility for our own actions! It is time to grow up, stop competing with each other and start working together!</p>
<p>Sorry about the rant. I had to get that off my chest. I fell better now&#8230;</p>
