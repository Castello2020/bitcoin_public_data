<h3 style="color: #000099;">Nouriel Roubini, Davos Speakers, Kyle Bass, Larry Edelson, Charles Nenner, James Dines, Jim Rogers, Marc Faber, Jim Rickards and Martin Armstrong Warn of Wider War</h3>
<p>Well-known economist Nouriel Roubini <a href="https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/426258599804166144">tweeted</a> from the gathering of the rich and powerful at the World Economic Forum in Davos:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many speakers compare 2014 to 1914 when WWI broke out &amp; no one expected it. A black swan in the form of a war between China &amp; Japan?</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/426258248690593792">And</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Both Abe and an influential Chinese analyst don&#8217;t rule out a military confrontation between China and Japan. Memories of 1914?</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/10/top-economic-advisers-forecast-war-and-unrest-3.html">Many other economists have forecast war</a>.</p>
<p>Kyle Bass <a title="writes" href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2012-11-17/kyle-bass-falacies-such-mmt-are-leading-sheep-slaughter-and-we-believe-war-inevitabl" target="_blank">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Trillions of dollars of <a id="_GPLITA_0" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Text-Enhance" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/11/top-economic-advisers-forecast-widespread-war.html#">debts</a> will be restructured and millions of financially prudent savers will lose large percentages of their real purchasing power at exactly the wrong time in their lives. Again, the world will not end, but the social fabric of the profligate nations will be stretched and in some cases torn. Sadly, looking back through economic history, <strong>all too often war is the manifestation of simple economic entropy played to its logical conclusion</strong>. <strong>We believe that war is an inevitable consequence of the current global economic situation.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Larry Edelson wrote an email to subscribers entitled “What the “Cycles of War” are saying for 2013″, which states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since the 1980s, I’ve been studying the so-called “cycles of war” — the natural rhythms that predispose societies to descend into chaos, into hatred, into civil and even international war.</p>
<p>I’m certainly not the first person to examine these very distinctive patterns in history. There have been many before me, notably, Raymond Wheeler, who published the most authoritative chronicle of war ever, covering a period of 2,600 years of data.</p>
<p>However, there are very few people who are willing to even discuss the issue right now. And based on what I’m seeing, the implications could be absolutely huge in 2013.</p></blockquote>
<p>Former Goldman Sachs technical analyst Charles Nenner – who has made some big accurate calls, and counts major <a id="_GPLITA_2" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Text-Enhance" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/11/top-economic-advisers-forecast-widespread-war.html#">hedge funds</a>, banks, brokerage houses, and high net worth individuals as clients – <a title="says" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/former-goldman-sachs-analyst-charles-nenner-major-war-2012-dow-5000-2011-3" target="_blank">says</a> there will be “a major war starting at the end of 2012 to 2013”, which will drive the Dow to 5,000.</p>
<p>Veteran investor adviser James Dines <a title="forecast" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dines-prophesies-war-2012-05-28?Link=obinsite">forecast</a> a war is epochal as World Wars I and II, starting in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Billionaire investor Jim Rogers <a title="explains" href="http://www.moneynews.com/StreetTalk/rogers-Europe-bailouts-war/2012/06/22/id/443184" target="_blank">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A continuation of bailouts in Europe could ultimately <a id="_GPLITA_1" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Text-Enhance" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/11/top-economic-advisers-forecast-widespread-war.html#">spark</a> another world war, says international investor Jim Rogers.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Add debt, the situation gets worse, and eventually it just collapses. <strong>Then everybody is looking for scapegoats. Politicians blame foreigners, and we’re in World War II or World War whatever</strong>.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Marc Faber <a title="says" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/08/marc-faber-says-america-will-launch-more-wars-to-distract-from-bad-economy.html">says</a> that the American government will start new wars in response to the economic crisis:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="“The next thing the government will do to distract the attention of the people on bad economic conditions is they’ll start a war somewhere.”" href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/the-alex-jones-show-l-i-v-e-june-23rd-with-marc-faber.html" target="_blank">“The next thing the government will do to distract the attention of the people on bad economic conditions is they’ll start a war somewhere.”</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a title="“If the global economy doesn’t recover, usually people go to war.”" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&amp;sid=aa4KTmib46Uw&amp;refer=asia" target="_blank">“If the global economy doesn’t recover, usually people go to war.”</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We’re in the middle of a <a title="global currency war" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22currency+war%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" target="_blank">global currency war</a> – i.e. a situation where nations all compete to devalue their currencies the most in order to boost exports. And Brazilian president-elect Rousseff <a title="said" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/326a6d62-e83d-11df-8995-00144feab49a.html" target="_blank">said</a> in 2010:</p>
<blockquote><p>The last time there was a series of competitive devaluations … it ended in world war two.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jim Rickards <a title="agrees" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/next-global-crisis-currency-wars-already-begun-rickards-142124909.html" target="_blank">agrees</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Currency wars lead to trade wars, which often lead to hot wars. In 2009, Rickards participated in the Pentagon’s first-ever “financial” war games. While expressing confidence in America’s ability to defeat any other nation-state in battle, Rickards says the U.S. could get dragged into “asymmetric warfare,” if currency wars lead to rising inflation and global economic uncertainty.</p></blockquote>
<p>As does <a title="says" href="http://rt.com/usa/news/china-trade-currency-bill-053/" target="_blank">Jim Rogers</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Trade wars always lead to wars.</p></blockquote>
<p>Martin Armstrong <a title="wrote" href="http://armstrongeconomics.com/2013/08/21/as-the-war-cycle-turns-up-middle-east-is-going-nuts/" target="_blank">wrote</a> in August:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our greatest problem is <strong>the bureaucracy wants a war</strong>. This will distract everyone from the NSA and justify what they have been doing. <strong>They need a distraction for the economic decline that is coming</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Armstrong argued last month that war plans against Syria are really about <a title="debt and spending" href="http://armstrongeconomics.com/2013/09/03/14202/" target="_blank">debt and spending</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Syrian mess seems to have people lining up on Capital Hill when sources there say the phone calls coming in are overwhelmingly against any action. The politicians are ignoring the people entirely. This suggests there is indeed a secret agenda to achieve a goal outside the discussion box. That is most like <strong>the debt problem and a war is necessary to relief the pressure to curtail spending</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>And given that many influential economists <a title="wrongly believe" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/02/debunking-the-myth-that-war-is-good-for-the-economy-once-and-for-all.html">wrongly believe</a> that war is good for the economy … many are <a title="overtly" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123008280526532053.html" target="_blank">overtly</a> or quietly pushing for war.</p>
<p>In addition, historians say that the risk of world war is rising <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/01/risk-world-war-rising.html">because the U.S. feels threatened by a rising China</a> &#8230; and the U.S. government considers <a title="threatening war against any nation which becomes an economic rival" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/09/does-the-american-government-consider-economic-rivalry-to-be-a-justification-for-war.html">economic rivalry to be a basis for war</a></p>
<p>Moreover, former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said that <a title="the Iraq war was really about oil" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071116211434/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article2461214.ece" target="_blank">the Iraq war was really about oil</a>, and former Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill <a title="says" href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/01/10/oneill.bush/" target="_blank">says</a> that Bush planned the Iraq war before 9/11. And see <a title="this" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/secret-memos-expose-link-between-oil-firms-and-invasion-of-iraq-2269610.html" target="_blank">this</a> and <a title="this" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/10/the-wars-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa-are-not-just-about-oil-theyre-also-about-gas.html">this</a>. If that war was for petroleum, other oil-rich countries might be invaded as well.</p>
<p>And the American policy of <a title="using the military to contain China’s growing economic influence" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/01/the-war-on-terror-spreads-to-africa-u-s-sending-troops-to-35-african-nations.html">using the military to contain China’s growing economic influence</a> – and of considering <a title="threatening war against any nation which becomes an economic rival" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/09/does-the-american-government-consider-economic-rivalry-to-be-a-justification-for-war.html">economic rivalry to be a basis for war</a> – are creating a tinderbox.</p>
<p>Finally, multi-billionaire investor Hugo Salinas Price <a title="told" href="http://kingworldnews.com/kingworldnews/KWN_DailyWeb/Entries/2011/10/27_Multi-Billionaire_Salinas_-_Gaddafi_Killed_Over_Gold_Currency.html" target="_blank">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What happened to [Libya's] Mr. Gaddafi, many speculate the real reason he was ousted was that he was planning an all-African currency for conducting trade. The same thing happened to him that happened to Saddam because the US doesn’t want any solid competing currency out there vs the dollar. You know Gaddafi was talking about a <a id="_GPLITA_2" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Text-Enhance" href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/01/are-the-middle-east-wars-really-about-forcing-the-world-into-dollars-and-private-central-banking.html#">gold</a> dinar.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, senior CNBC editor John Carney <a title="noted" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/42308613/Libyan_Rebels_Form_Their_Own_Central_Bank" target="_blank">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is this the first time a revolutionary group has created a central bank while it is still in the midst of fighting the entrenched political power? It certainly seems to indicate how extraordinarily powerful central bankers have become in our era.</p>
<p>Robert Wenzel of <a title="Economic Policy Journal thinks" href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2011/03/libyan-rebels-form-central-bank.html" target="_blank" data-nodeid="4387582">Economic Policy Journal thinks</a> the central <a id="_GPLITA_1" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Text-Enhance" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/42308613/Libyan_Rebels_Form_Their_Own_Central_Bank#" target="_blank">banking</a> initiative reveals that foreign powers may have a strong influence over the rebels.</p>

He has seemingly forgotten Korea, Vietnam and the Los Angeles Rodney King riots when a black American was videotaped throwing a brick from behind into the head of an unsuspecting truck driver, Reginald Denny, and was found not guilty of the assault.  Justice is not a logical path in world affairs.</p>
<p>There will be no war between Japan and China. Why?  Because even the mention of Japan getting militarily involved, and three quarters of the Chinese and most of Southeast Asia will die of stark fright.  The former President of Singapore, ninety year old Lee Kuan Yew, made mention of his own fear of the Japanese returning while being interviewed in the Charlie Rose Show some years back.  The fear is more than palpable.  It&#8217;s the stuff of nightmares for well more than a billion and a half people in Asia.</p>
<p>It is not beyond the ken of most Americans to envision the U.S. arming Japan with nuclear weapons, to keep the balance of power in Asia stable, and everyone leaning in the right direction.</p>
<p>No, there will not be a war between Japan and China.  This is all about how those countries that can, will and are, lining-up behind the American Empire.  The list is very long, and more are asking to get on the list every day&#8230;</p>
<p>Even Iran is volunteering to line up behind the United States right now.</p>
<p>China is being sent a powerful message about dominance in the world.  And China will listen with a keen ear, even though the U.S. CIA and Wall Street are playing havoc with China in every way imaginable.</p>
<p>In this world, you do not get away with laughing at the U.S Secretary of the Treasury, when he has bothered to come to your country to let you know how things REALLY work.  And Timmy Geithner is not going to let the opportunity to laugh at the ruined Chinese pass by.</p>
<p>Mark these words.  China&#8217;s run is well over.  China is crumbling.  And now China is crumbling in terror at the thought that the Japanese will be marching into town, again.</p>
<p>Those who remember history, know best how to use it.</p>

However a careful study of the history of the United States shows a connection between the private central bankers and wars, assassinations, and other major events.</p>
<p>The war of 1812, as one example, was launched by Great Britain at the urging of the Bank of England when the US Congress refused to renew the charter for the First Bank  of the United States. Andrew Jackson, the only US President to actually pay off the national debt, ran for his second term in office on a pledge to shut down the Second Bank of the United States. Shortly after succeeding, there was an attempted assassination which failed. </p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-93692" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Of course all wars are bankers&#8217; wars.  That&#8217;s like saying, all wars are fought with armaments. </p>
<p>Aplomb during the Civil War era was about getting to the battle with the most and bravest men.  But now it&#8217;s all about getting to the battle with the most and the most penetrating guns.</p>
<p>While the Chinese recently sent a cute little EverReady Bunny to the moon, (it&#8217;s about the size of a miniature poodle), the U.S. recently put a massive orbiting neutron-bomb gunship into orbit.    This is not the first such orbiting gunship the U.S. military has launched.  And now the US has a space-based gunship array from which the US can completely defend all vantage points everywhere on earth and in space.  And, this is just a redundant backup system, redundant to the ground based systems that are also redundantly designed.  Checkmate.</p>
<p>If anyone is serious about talking about how history teaches lessons to the naive, they ought look at the history of sneak attacks on the U.S., both real and feigned.  -Don&#8217;t Tread on Me- used to be just a defensive threat.</p>
<p>Now it is a horrifying and often-used offensive weapon in the arsenal of the American Empire prosecuting its war on terror military exercises.  Furthermore, when the US says to Japan (or Russia for that matter) &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to let them do that to you!&#8221;  You can bet, neither Japan or Russia will hesitate for a second to assert their outrage at the implied indignity, even if impugned, and no matter who actually perpetrated the affair.</p>
<p>The American soldiers are in part, other nations eager to do the bidding of the American Empire now.</p>
<p>The American Empire has coordinated the ongoing worldwide economic depression for a reason.  This depression is going to firmly establish the pecking order for the entirety of the 21st Century and beyond. Literally the only other country that has seriously stepped out of line, is China.</p>
<p>And now China has realized its mistake.</p>
<p>But realizing the mistake alone is not enough.  The Chinese oligarchs have begun to flee China because too many promises were made that have not been and cannot be kept in China.  Why cannot these promises be kept?   Because this American-manufactured worldwide depression has effectively closed worldwide markets to Chinese exports.  That was the point of creating this worldwide depression.</p>
<p>No one is buying Chinese junk anymore, or at least not enough of it to keep the Chinese economy solvent.</p>
<p>So, revolution is coming again to China, and in a very big way.  The CIA is making sure revolution is coming to China.  Wall Street is making sure revolution is coming to China.  How does anything think the Chinese oligarchs feel about having the NSA recording and listening in on all their communications?  It must be terrifying, because the Chinese are a deceitful and dishonest people.  Their ethics are not western ethics.</p>
<p>And of course, if revolution does not come to China, THEN, the Japanese are going to be coming to China.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, the robotic revolution is rapidly coming to Japan, Europe and the US, a revolution that will quite literally obliterate any inherent advantage found in the feverishly toiling masses of China.</p>
<p>The Chinese toiling masses are going to be very disappointed in the Chinese government that has promised too much.  It will not be the dollar that collapses and goes valueless.  It will be the Yuan.  Why?  Because modern China has always had a corrupt centrally planned economy.  And the overhead of it is growing daily.</p>
<p>When the few rich Chinese sell their gold to international speculators in order to eat, they will be selling it for about $200 an ounce, -American-, and maybe much less than that.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t believe it?  Imagine the logistics problem of trying to feed a centrally planned economy of people numbering well more than a billion, when the paper currency upon which they rely collapses and goes completely valueless.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s almost nothing the Chinese have not learned to eat.  This has come about due entirely to necessity.  This is what it means to be Chinese.</p>

Talked to any Germans lately? They think USA is a joke. Russia is maneuvering around USA at ever turn. Putin is one smart guy who USA cannot touch him.<br />
  China crumbling? It&#8217;s USA that&#8217;s crumbling. Ever been to a downtown of ANY USA city lately? Seen hundreds of thousands of homeless all over? Brazil, China, Russia are on the march, while USA is falling behind. USA&#8217;s middle class is dying and without a middle class nobody will be there to pay taxes and buy all the useless garbage being produced.<br />
Iran are trying to play nice, while still having their cake. They are<br />
still doing stuff in secret underground facilities nobody knows about.<br />
Iran is still making deals with the Chinese. Iran will survive.</p>
<p>And if the Chinese are dumb enough to go to war over a few islands that have some mineral deposits then they DO deserve to be wiped out. The Chinese KNOW USA will back Japan in a war. If China&#8217;s run&#8217;s is over then Russia will be net then. Havent you noticed how the center of power has been circling the globe and is now in Asia? NO matter what USA does(short of a nuclear war that they are desperate enough to start) USA&#8217;s run is over.</p>

Brazil, China and Russia all have homeless and destitute populations vastly larger than anything EVER seen in the US.  And the destitute numbers in these countries continue to grow faster than in the U.S.  There is simply no comparison.</p>
<p>The only shining light today among these three is Russia, which is only shining because the US has given Russia what it asked for a few decades ago, a chance to be on the list of those countries 100% behind the US.  As a reward, Russia&#8217;s oil and gas industries literally have been given dominance over most of Europe.</p>
<p>That was wholly an American gift.  It&#8217;s not even a quid pro quo.  It&#8217;s a straight up gift, because the Russians are indeed good and deserving friends.  The American/Russian/Japanese alliance is completely indomitable worldwide.  This alliance ensures the New American Century.</p>
<p>All this was well-thought-out by the wire pullers as things developed decades ago.  You just have not been clued-in as things been developed.  But hey!  What the hell have you got to know for?</p>
<p>So, keep believing all the bullshit being slung at you at such great expense.</p>
<p>BTW, the real revelation about NSA NOT GIVEN TO US BY Edward Snowden or Julian Assange is the vast army of disinformation specialists in the media and on the Internet who are waging a disinformation campaign that is most astonishing and unique in the history of the world.  It truly is the Eight Wonder of the World, especially as one fathoms the extent to which the &#8220;alternative media&#8221; has been completely co-opted by a network of disinformation-spreading government agencies.</p>
<p>Go read What Really Happened, critically.  You&#8217;ll soon realize the extent to which information in this world today is mostly disinformation being fed to populations worldwide by the NSA and the CIA.</p>

Turning: What the Cycles of History Tell Us About America&#8217;s Next Rendezvous<br />
with Destiny (1997) that predicted a Fourth Turning (&#8220;a Crisis, a decisive<br />
era of secular upheaval, when the values regime propels replacement of the old<br />
civic order with a new one&#8221;) would occur shortly after 2005&#8211;think 2008<br />
financial crisis. As a result of this event, political and economic trust would<br />
implode. </p>
<p>Within the next twenty years, they expected the States would<br />
&#8220;pass through a great gate in history, commensurate with the American<br />
Revolution [1773-1794], Civil War [1860-1865] and twin emergencies of the Great<br />
Depression and World War II [1929-1946]. The risk of catastrophe will be very<br />
high. The nation could erupt into insurrection or civil violence, crack up<br />
geographically, or succumb to authoritarian rule. If there is war, it is likely<br />
to be of maximum risk and effort&#8211;in other words, a total war. Every Fourth<br />
Turning has registered an upward ratchet in the technology of destruction, and<br />
in mankind&#8217;s willingness to use it. In the Civil War, the two capital cities<br />
would surely have incinerated each other had the means been at hand. In World<br />
War II, America invented a new technology of annihilation, which the nation<br />
swiftly put to use. This time, America will enter a Fourth Turning with the<br />
mean to inflict unimaginable horrors and, perhaps, will confront adversaries<br />
who posses the same.&#8221; </p>
<p>They present a fairly convincing argument that historic events<br />
occur in regular patterns based upon generational cycles. And, while history<br />
may not repeat itself, it certainly does rhyme. And rhymes with a consistent<br />
beat and tempo; the Fourth Turning crisis occurring about every 80-100 years,<br />
the length of a long human life. Looks like we&#8217;re about due. </p>

Because everything that&#8217;s in print isn&#8217;t necessarily worth the paper it&#8217;s written on.  Naomi Kline is another often quoted, but ignorant writer of a similar genre as Strauss &amp; Howe.  So is Ayn Rand, from a generation past.  The publishing industry in the U.S. is completely corrupt.  And the vast majority of its chosen and hyped authors have no more merit than Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Phish or Edward Snowden for that matter.  These people are all colossal fakes pimped to the public like cheesecake and Budweiser beer.</p>
<p>The Internet is a great place to get criticism, like what you just got, which fortunately one can brush off as coming from just some anonymous asshole.  So, don&#8217;t let your (online) ego get up its gander and walk away pouting.  Think about how you can do something important for yourself first, and others second, instead of parroting mindless garbage that comes from the popular and peddled main stream media entertainment industry.</p>
<p>By and large the Internet is full of it.  And reading comments should leave one shaking their head, because anyone can leave a comment.  And the average posting-schmuck has nothing new or important to say.  But everyone has succumbed to the the ubiquitous marketing hype that pollutes our much-much fairer real world.</p>

The book is one of the few (besides some scanty unpublished more recent revelations) about the unlovely life of Basil Zaharoff (M. Sachar) detailing some of his murders,etc. One overlooked aspect of Zaharoff&#8217;s career was his prescient observation of the likelihood of WW1 being longer and costlier than everyone was expecting. It wasn&#8217;t his intimate knowledge of modern weapons alone, however, for this accurate projection, but being able to overule French generals during the conflict who wished to retake the critically strategic border town of Briey (and Thionville, etc.) along with the German occupied former French armaments factory (which continued producing artillery shells till war&#8217;s end for Germany) and nearby, Germany&#8217;s only source of Nickel. His thinnest lie (accompanied no doubt by fat wads of cash) was the factory was needed to remain intact to provide employment for French workers after the war, although he later brazenly gloated about his &#8216;being able to shorten the conflict&#8217; and specifically mentioned Briey. The India-Pakistan-China area, though most heavily populated, may as well not exist in most Western pundits thoughts. All areas of conflict are potentially dangerous. Any one can escalate out of &#8216;control&#8217;. Under the guiding influence of unregistered foreign agent AIPAC corrupted politicians, among others, there is great cause to worry. Many Americans had to learn this the hard way in Iraq. Looking at UK MP&#8217;s investments in Vickers, etc., before World War One you&#8217;d think any sensible government would move immediately to remove this flagrant (and very dangerous) conflict of interest. Mr. Rivero&#8217;s site has noted some of the current sitting members of Congress appalling &#8216;investments&#8217; in this area.</p>

<p>2000–2015 World War III</p>
<p>&#8220;World War III was a nuclear war,<br />
 occurring sometime between 2000 and 2015 (in episode &#8220;DU &#8211; 33&#8243; it is<br />
suggested that the war ended sometime around 2002). While very little is<br />
 still revealed about the events that occurred to cause the war,<br />
evidence shows that the war started from a series of nuclear exchanges<br />
across Eurasia.</p>
<p>Nuclear bombing of Tokyo: The seat of government was temporarily transferred to Niihama (Kobe) before permanent relocation to Fukuoka, Kyūshū. Central Tokyo was submerged under water.</p>
<p>Nuclear bombing of Okinawa</p>
<p>Nuclear bombing of Berlin, capital of Germany&#8221;</p>
<p>Rise of the American Empire</p>
<p>&#8220;After World War III ended, the American Empire had become an<br />
[openly] imperialist government, in an attempt to regain world power by<br />
conquering new areas in North and South America.<br />
 Due to a battered economy and weak political position, the American<br />
Empire entered into a security pact with Japan. The pact reaffirms Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution in prohibiting Japan from both deploying its army overseas and possessing nuclear weapons.&#8221;</p>

Unfortunately war has already broken out with an ongoing proxy war spilling out from Africa to the Middle East and beyond which ultimately maybe a conflagration between Iran and Saudi Arabia.  I am not sure that the Chinese are more than painting their paper tiger red.  It would be absurd for the US to actively involve it self as an ally of either party.  Who would attack pearl harbor this time ?  The Chinese?  Not likely.  They are minor creditors to the US and would lose a few trillion dollars and their best customer.  The Chinese are not that stupid and China is not historically known for major wars to gain territory&#8211;it was Mongolians on horse back who did most of that. Japan is a lot like Great Britain, an island nation , with some protections  thus.</p>
