<h3 style="color: #000099;">Are Emergency Plans Meant Only for Nuclear War the Real Justification for Spying?</h3>
<p>To understand the scope and extent of government spying on all Americans &#8211; and the reasons for such spying &#8211; you have to understand what has happened to our Constitutional form of government since 9/11.</p>
<h3 style="color: #000099;">State of Emergency</h3>
<p>The United States has been in a declared state of emergency from September 2001, to the present. Specifically, on September 11, 2001, the government declared a state of emergency. That declared state of emergency was <a title="formally put in writing" href="http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:7sIfEMO_tkoJ:www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode50/usc_sec_50_00001621----000-notes.html+%22Consistent+with+section+202%28d%29+of+the+National+Emergencies+Act+%2850+U.S.C.+1622%28d%29%29,+I+am+continuing+for+1+year+the+national+emergency+I+declared+on+September+14,+2001,+in+Proclamation+7463,+with+respect+to+the+terrorist+attacks+at+the+World+Trade+Center+Rebuilding-Ground-Zero+,+New+York,+New+York,+the+Pentagon,+and+aboard+United+Airlines+Business-Travel-Looks-Ahead-to-2008+flight+93,+and+the+continuing+and+immediate+threat+of+further+attacks+on+the+United+States.&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a" target="_blank">formally put in writing</a> on 9/14/2001:</p>
<blockquote><p>A national emergency exists by reason of the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center, New York, New York, and the Pentagon, and the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks on the United States.</p>
<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, I hereby declare that the national emergency has existed since September 11, 2001 . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>That declared state of emergency has continued in full force and effect from 9/11 to the present. President Bush kept it in place, and President Obama has also.</p>
<p>For example, on September 9, 2011, President Obama <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/50C34.txt">declared</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>CONTINUATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARED BY PROC. NO. 7463</p>
<p>Notice of President of the United States, dated Sept. 9, 2011, 76 F.R. 56633, provided:</p>
<p>Consistent with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency previously declared on September 14, 2001, in Proclamation 7463, with respect to the terrorist attacks of<br />
September 11, 2001, and the continuing and immediate threat of<br />
further attacks on the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Because the terrorist threat continues, the national emergency declared on September 14, 2001, and the powers and authorities<br />
adopted to deal with that emergency must continue in effect </strong>beyond September 14, 2011. Therefore, I am continuing in effect for an additional year the national emergency that was declared on September 14, 2001, with respect to the terrorist threat.</p>
<p>This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and<br />
transmitted to the Congress.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Washington Times <a title="wrote" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010918184425/www.washtimes.com/national/20010918-1136.htm" target="_blank">wrote</a> on September 18, 2001:</p>
<blockquote><p>Simply by proclaiming a national emergency on Friday, President Bush activated some 500 dormant legal provisions, including those allowing him to impose censorship and martial law.</p></blockquote>
<p>The White House has kept substantial information concerning its presidential proclamations and directives hidden from Congress. For example, <a title="according to" href="http://niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ask_this.view&amp;askthisid=00321" target="_blank">according to</a> Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists Project on Government Secrecy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of the 54 National Security Presidential Directives issued by the [George W.] Bush Administration to date, the titles of only about half have been publicly identified. There is descriptive material or actual text in the public domain for only about a third. In other words, there are dozens of undisclosed Presidential directives that define U.S. national security policy and task government agencies, but whose substance is unknown either to the public or, as a rule, to Congress.</p></blockquote>
<h3 style="color: #000099;">Continuity of Government</h3>
<p>Continuity of Government (“COG”) measures were implemented on 9/11. For example, according to the 9/11 Commission Report, at page 38:</p>
<blockquote><p>At 9:59, an Air Force lieutenant colonel working in the White House Military Office joined the conference and stated he had just talked to Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley. <a title="The White House requested " href="http://books.google.com/books?id=JufWziTyNnIC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=%22The+White+House+requested+%281%29+the+implementation+of+continuity+of+government+measures%22&amp;ei=zM-vR-LqCKeGtgPl3pmIBg&amp;sig=AIK2hH5iFOWGXrQfQi8WTDOQrHI" target="_blank">The White House requested </a><a title="(1)" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=JufWziTyNnIC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=%22The+White+House+requested+%281%29+the+implementation+of+continuity+of+government+measures%22&amp;ei=zM-vR-LqCKeGtgPl3pmIBg&amp;sig=AIK2hH5iFOWGXrQfQi8WTDOQrHI" target="_blank">(1)</a><a title=" the implementation of continuity of government measures" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=JufWziTyNnIC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=%22The+White+House+requested+%281%29+the+implementation+of+continuity+of+government+measures%22&amp;ei=zM-vR-LqCKeGtgPl3pmIBg&amp;sig=AIK2hH5iFOWGXrQfQi8WTDOQrHI" target="_blank"> the implementation of continuity of government measures</a>, (2) fighter escorts for Air Force One, and (3) a fighter combat air patrol over Washington, D.C.</p></blockquote>
<p>Likewise, page 326 of the Report states:</p>
<blockquote><p>The secretary of defense directed the nation’s armed forces to Defense Condition 3, an increased state of military readiness. For the first time in history, all nonemergency civilian aircraft in the United States were grounded, stranding tens of thousands of passengers across the country. <a title="Contingency plans for the continuity of government and the evacuation of leaders had been implemented." href="http://books.google.com/books?id=JufWziTyNnIC&amp;pg=PA326&amp;dq=%22Contingency+plans+for+the+continuity+of+government+and+the+evacuation+of+leaders+had+been+implemented%22&amp;ei=F9CvR5TzAabutAORrZiABg&amp;sig=bf8Cb56WVwmlBb-PxcWO4pW8POY" target="_blank">Contingency plans for the continuity of government and the evacuation of leaders had been implemented.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The Washington Post <a title="notes" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A42754-2002Jan26?language=printer" target="_blank">notes</a> that Vice President Dick Cheney <em></em>initiated the COG plan on 9/11:</p>
<blockquote><p>From the bunker, Cheney officially implemented the emergency continuity of government orders . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>(See also footnotes cited therein and <a title="this webpage" href="http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/context.jsp?item=a81cogexercises#a81cogexercises" target="_blank">this webpage</a>.)</p>
<p>CNN <a title="reported" href="http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/03/01/bunker.government/index.html" target="_blank">reported</a> that – 6 months later – the plans were <strong>still in place</strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Because Bush has decided to leave the operation in place, agencies including the White House and top civilian Cabinet departments have rotated personnel involved, and are discussing ways to staff such a contingency operation under the assumption it will be in place indefinitely, this official said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Similarly, the Washington Post <a title="reported" href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/109965333.html?dids=109965333:109965333&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Mar+1%2C+2002&amp;author=Barton+Gellman+and+Susan+Schmidt&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.01&amp;desc=Shadow+Government+Is+at+Work+in+Secret" target="_blank">reported</a> in March 2002 that “<strong>the shadow government has evolved into an indefinite precaution</strong>.” The same article goes on to state:</p>
<blockquote><p>Assessment of terrorist risks persuaded the White House to remake the program as a <strong>permanent feature of ‘the new reality</strong>, based on what the threat looks like,’ a senior decisionmaker said.</p></blockquote>
<p>As CBS <a title="pointed out" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/03/01/attack/main502530.shtml" target="_blank">pointed out</a>, <strong>virtually none of the Congressional leadership knew</strong> that the COG had been implemented or was still in existence as of March 2002:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Key congressional leaders say they didn’t know President Bush had established a “shadow government,”</strong> moving dozens of senior civilian managers to secret underground locations outside Washington to ensure that the federal government could survive a devastating terrorist attack on the nation’s capital, The Washington Post says in its Saturday editions.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.) told the Post he had not been informed by the White House about the role, location or even the existence of the shadow government that the administration began to deploy the morning of the Sept. 11 hijackings.</p>
<p>An aide to House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) said he was also unaware of the administration’s move.</p>
<p>Among Congress’s GOP leadership, aides to House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (Ill.), second in line to succeed the president if he became incapacitated, and to Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (Miss.) said they were not sure whether they knew.</p>
<p>Aides to Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W. Va.) said he had not been told. As Senate president pro tempore, he is in line to become president after the House speaker.</p></blockquote>
<p>Similarly, the above-cited CNN article states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-South Dakota, said Friday he can’t say much about the plan.</p>
<p>“We have not been informed at all about the role of the shadow government or its whereabouts or what particular responsibilities they have and when they would kick in, but we look forward to work with the administration to get additional information on that.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, the White House has specifically refused to share information about Continuity of Government plans with the Homeland Security Committee of the U.S. Congress, even though that Committee has proper security clearance to hear the full details of all COG plans.</p>
<p>Specifically, in the summer 2007, Congressman Peter DeFazio, on the Homeland Security Committee (and so with proper security access to be briefed on COG issues), inquired about continuity of government plans, and was refused access. Indeed, DeFazio told Congress that <a title="the entire Homeland Security Committee of the U.S. Congresshas been denied access to the plans" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdfjsS9Wqk8" target="_blank">the entire Homeland Security Committee of the U.S. Congress has been denied access to the plans</a> by the White House.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/QdfjsS9Wqk8" frameborder="0" width="740" height="555"></iframe></center></  br></p>
<p>(Or <a title="here is the transcript" href="http://fas.org/sgp/congress/2007/cog.html" target="_blank">here is the transcript</a>).</p>
<p>The Homeland Security Committee has <em><strong>full clearance</strong></em> to view all information about COG plans.</p>
<p>DeFazio concluded: “<a title="Maybe the people who think there’s a conspiracy out there are right" href="http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/07/21/2678/" target="_blank">Maybe the people who think there’s a conspiracy out there are right</a>”.</p>
<p>University of California Berkeley Professor Emeritus Peter Dale Scott <a title="warned" href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=8864" target="_blank">points out</a> that &#8211; whether or not COG plans are still in effect &#8211; the refusal of the executive branch to disclose their details to Congress means that the Constitutional system of checks and balances has already been gravely injured:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">If members of the Homeland Security Committee cannot enforce their right to read secret plans of the Executive Branch, then the systems of checks and balances established by the U.S. Constitution would seem to be failing.</p>
<p align="justify">To put it another way, if the White House is successful in frustrating DeFazio, then Continuity of Government planning has arguably <strong>already superseded the Constitution as a higher authority</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, <a title="continuity of government plans" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_of_government" target="_blank">continuity of government plans</a> are specifically defined to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Top leaders of the “new government” called for in the COG would entirely or largely go into hiding, and would govern in hidden locations</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Those within the new government would know what was going on. But those in the “old government” – that is, the one created by the framers of the Constitution – would not necessarily know the details of what was happening</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Normal laws and legal processes might largely be suspended, or superseded by secretive judicial forums</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The media might be ordered by strict laws – punishable by treason – to only promote stories authorized by the new government</li>
</ul>

<p>Could the White House have maintained COG operations to the present day?</p>
<p>I don’t know, but the following section from the above-cited CNN article is not very reassuring:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bush triggered the precautions in the hours after the September 11 strikes, and has <strong>left them in place because of continuing U.S. intelligence suggesting a possible threat</strong>.</p>
<p>Concerns that al Qaeda could have gained access to a crude nuclear device “were a major factor” in the president’s decision, the official said. “The threat of some form of catastrophic event is the trigger,” this official said.</p>
<p>This same official went on to say that the U.S. had no confirmation — “and no solid evidence” — that al Qaeda had such a nuclear device and also acknowledged that the “consensus” among top U.S. officials was that the prospect was “quite low.”</p>
<p>Still, the officials said Bush and other top White House officials including Cheney were adamant that the government take precautions designed to make sure government functions ranging from civil defense to transportation and agricultural production could be managed in the event Washington was the target of a major strike.</p></blockquote>
<p>As is apparent from a brief review of the news, the government has, since 9/11, continuously stated that there is a terrorist threat of a nuclear device or dirty bomb. That alone infers that COG plans could, hypothetically, still be in effect, just like the state of emergency is still in effect and has never been listed.</p>
<p>Indeed,  President Bush <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/17/politics/17text-bush.html?pagewanted=print">said</a> on December 17, 2005, <em><strong>4 years</strong></em> after 9/11:</p>
<blockquote><p>The authorization I gave the National Security Agency after Sept. 11 helped address that problem in a way that is fully consistent with my constitutional responsibilities and authorities.</p>
<p>The activities I have authorized make it more likely that killers like these 9/11 hijackers will be identified and located in time.</p>
<p>And the activities conducted under this authorization have helped detect and prevent possible terrorist attacks in the United States and abroad.</p>
<p><strong>The activities I authorized are reviewed approximately every 45 days. Each review is based on a fresh intelligence assessment of terrorist threats to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">continuity</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">our</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">government</span> and the threat of catastrophic damage to our homeland.</strong></p>
<p>During each assessment, previous activities under the authorization are reviewed. The review includes approval by our nation’s top legal officials, including the attorney general and the counsel to the president.</p>
<p><strong>I have reauthorized this program more than 30 times since the Sept. 11 attacks </strong>[45 days times 30 equals approximately 4 years]<strong> and I intend to do so for as long as our nation faces a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">continuing</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">threat</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">from</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Al</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Qaeda</span> and related groups.</strong></p>
<p>The N.S.A.’s activities under this authorization are thoroughly reviewed by the Justice Department and N.S.A.’s top legal officials, including N.S.A.’s general counsel and inspector general.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, it appears that as of December 2005, COG plans had never been rescincded, but had been continously renewed every 45 days.</p>
<p>In 2008, Tim Shorrock <a title="wrote" href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/07/23/new_churchcomm/" target="_blank">wrote</a> at Salon:</p>
<blockquote><p>A contemporary version of the Continuity of Government program was put into play in the hours after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when Vice President Cheney and senior members of Congress were dispersed to “undisclosed locations” to maintain government functions. <strong>It was during this emergency period, Hamilton and other former government officials believe, that President Bush may have authorized the NSA to begin actively using the Main Core database for domestic surveillance</strong> [more on Main Core below]. One indicator they cite is a statement by Bush in December 2005, after the New York Times had revealed the NSA’s warrantless wiretapping, in which he made a rare reference to the emergency program: The Justice Department’s legal reviews of the NSA activity, Bush said, were based on “fresh intelligence assessment of terrorist threats to the continuity of our government.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2007, President Bush issued Presidential Directive NSPD-51, which purported to change Continuity of Government plans. NSPD51 is odd because:</p>
<ul>
<li>NSPD51 was passed <a title="without Congressional input " href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=55824" target="_blank">without Congressional input </a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Even the <a title="New York Times" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/19/opinion/19mon3.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin" target="_blank">New York Times</a> wrote in an editorial:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Beyond cases of actual insurrection, the President may now use military troops as a domestic police force in response to a natural disaster, a disease outbreak, terrorist attack, or to any ‘other condition.’ Changes of this magnitude should be made only after a thorough public airing. But these new Presidential powers were slipped into the law without hearings or public debate.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Everyone from “<a title="conservative activist Jerome Corsi [to] Marjorie Cohn of the [liberal] National Lawyer’s Guild have interpreted [the COG plans contained in Presidential Directive NSPD-51] as a break from Constitutional law …." href="http://www.slate.com/id/2176185/pagenum/3/" target="_blank">conservative activist Jerome Corsi [to] Marjorie Cohn of the [liberal] National Lawyer’s Guild have interpreted [the COG plans contained in Presidential Directive NSPD-51] as a break from Constitutional law ….</a>“</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>As a reporter for Slate <a title="concluded" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071021042906/http://www.slate.com/id/2176185/pagenum/2" target="_blank">concluded</a> after analyzing NSPD-51:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>I see nothing in the [COG document entitled presidential directive NSPD51] to prevent even a “localized” forest fire or hurricane from giving the president the right to throw long-established constitutional government out the window</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe <a title="said" href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2007/06/02/white_house_revises_post_disaster_protocol/?page=2" target="_blank">said</a> that “because of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the American public needs no explanation of [Continuity of Government] plans”</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all the more bizarre when you realize that COG plans were originally created <em>solely</em> to respond to a decapitating nuclear strike which killed our civilian leaders.   (It was subsequently expanded decades before 9/11 into a multi-purpose plan by our good friends Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld. See <a title="this" href="http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0318-14.htm" target="_blank">this</a>, <a title="this" href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=55824" target="_blank">this</a> and <a title="this" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2176185" target="_blank">this</a>.)</p>
<h3 style="color: #000099;">Does COG Explain the Pervasive Spying on Americans?</h3>
<p>5 years ago, investigative reporter Christopher Ketcham <a href="http://www.christopherketcham.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/The%20Last%20Roundup,%20Radar%20Magazine.pdf">disclosed</a> the spying which was confirmed last week by  whistleblower Edward Snowden:</p>
<blockquote><p>The following information seems to be fair game for collection without a warrant: the e-mail addresses you send to and receive from, and the subject lines of those messages; the phone numbers you dial, the numbers that dial in to your line, and the durations of the calls; the Internet sites you visit and the keywords in your Web searches; the destinations of the airline tickets you buy; the amounts and locations of your ATM withdrawals; and the goods and services you purchase on credit cards. All of this information is archived on government supercomputers and, according to sources, also fed into the Main Core database.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given that Ketcham was proven right, let&#8217;s see what else he reported:</p>
<p>Given that Ketcham was right about the basics, let&#8217;s hear what else the outstanding investigative journalist said in 2008:</p>
<blockquote><p>There exists a database of Americans, who, often for the slightest and most trivial reason, are considered unfriendly, and who, in a time of panic, might be incarcerated. The database can identify and locate perceived &#8216;enemies of the state&#8217; almost instantaneously.&#8221; He and other sources tell Radar that <strong>the database is sometimes referred to by the code name Main Core</strong>. One knowledgeable source claims that<strong> 8 million Americans are now listed in Main Core as potentially suspect. In the event of a national emergency, these people could be subject to everything from heightened surveillance and tracking to direct questioning and possibly even detention.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>According to one news report, even &#8220;national opposition to U.S. military invasion abroad&#8221; could be a trigger [for martial law ].</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When COG plans are shrouded in extreme secrecy, effectively unregulated by Congress or the courts, and married to an overreaching surveillance state—as seems to be the case with Main Core—<strong>even sober observers must weigh whether the protections put in place by the federal government are becoming more dangerous to America than any outside threat</strong>.</p>
<p>Another well-informed source—a former military operative regularly briefed by members of the intelligence community—says this particular program has roots going back at least to the 1980s and was set up with help from the Defense Intelligence Agency. He has been told that the program utilizes <strong>software that makes predictive judgments of targets&#8217; behavior and tracks their circle of associations with &#8220;social network analysis&#8221; and artificial intelligence modeling tools</strong>.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A former NSA officer tells Radar that the Treasury Department&#8217;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, using an electronic-funds transfer surveillance program, also contributes data to Main Core, as does a Pentagon program that was created in 2002 to <strong>monitor antiwar protesters and environmental activists such as Greenpeace</strong>.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>If previous FEMA and FBI lists are any indication, t<strong>he Main Core database includes dissidents and activists of various stripes, political and tax protesters, lawyers and professors, publishers and journalists, gun owners, illegal aliens, foreign nationals, and a great many other harmless, average people</strong>.</p>
<p>A veteran CIA intelligence analyst who maintains active high-level clearances and serves as an advisor to the Department of Defense in the field of emerging technology tells Radar that during the 2004 hospital room drama, [current nominee to head the FBI, and former Deputy Attorney General] James Comey expressed concern over how <strong>this secret database was being used &#8220;to accumulate otherwise private data on non-targeted U.S. citizens for use at a future time.&#8221;</strong> [Snowden and high-level NSA whistleblower William Binney have <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/06/top-spying-experts-even-good-people-should-oppose-spying-because-if-someone-in-government-takes-a-dislike-to-you-the-surveillance-can-be-used-to-frame-you.html">since confirmed this</a>] &#8230;. A source regularly briefed by people inside the intelligence community adds: &#8220;<strong>Comey had discovered that President Bush had authorized NSA to use a highly classified and compartmentalized Continuity of Government database on Americans</strong> in computerized searches of its domestic intercepts. [Comey] had concluded that the use of that &#8216;Main Core&#8217; database compromised the legality of the overall NSA domestic surveillance project.&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The veteran CIA intelligence analyst notes that Comey&#8217;s suggestion that the offending elements of the program were dropped could be misleading: &#8220;Bush [may have gone ahead and] signed it as a National Intelligence Finding anyway.&#8221; But even if we never face a national emergency, the mere existence of the database is a matter of concern. <strong>&#8220;The capacity for future use of this information against the American people is so great as to be virtually unfathomable,&#8221;</strong> the senior government official says.</p>
<p>In any case, <strong>mass watch lists of domestic citizens may do nothing to make us safer from terrorism</strong>. Jeff Jonas, chief scientist at IBM, a world-renowned expert in data mining, contends that such efforts won&#8217;t prevent terrorist conspiracies. &#8220;Because there is so little historical terrorist event data,&#8221; Jonas tells Radar, &#8220;there is not enough volume to create precise predictions.&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[J. Edgar Hoover's] FBI &#8220;security index&#8221; was allegedly maintained and updated into the 1980s, when it was reportedly transferred to the control of none other than FEMA (though the FBI denied this at the time).</p>
<p>FEMA, however—then known as the Federal Preparedness Agency—already had its own domestic surveillance system in place, according to a 1975 investigation by Senator John V. Tunney of California. Tunney, the son of heavyweight boxing champion Gene Tunney and the inspiration for Robert Redford&#8217;s character in the film The Candidate, found that the agency maintained electronic dossiers on at least 100,000 Americans that contained information gleaned from wide-ranging computerized surveillance. <strong>The database was located in the agency&#8217;s secret underground city at Mount Weather, near the town of Bluemont, Virginia</strong>. [One of the main <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Weather">headquarter of COG operations</a>.] The senator&#8217;s findings were confirmed in a 1976 investigation by the Progressive magazine, which found that the <strong>Mount Weather computers &#8220;can obtain millions of pieces [of] information on the personal lives of American citizens</strong> by tapping the data stored at any of the 96 Federal Relocation Centers&#8221;—a reference to other classified facilities. According to the Progressive, Mount Weather&#8217;s databases were run &#8220;without any set of stated rules or regulations. Its surveillance program remains <strong>secret even from the leaders of the House and the Senate</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Wired magazine turned up additional damaging information, revealing in 1993 that [Oliver] North, operating from a secure White House site, allegedly employed a software database program called PROMIS (ostensibly as part of the REX 84 plan). PROMIS, which has a strange and controversial history, was designed to track individuals—prisoners, for example—by pulling together information from disparate databases into a single record. According to Wired, &#8220;<strong>Using the computers in his command center, North tracked dissidents and potential troublemakers within the United States</strong>. Compared to PROMIS, Richard Nixon&#8217;s enemies list or Senator Joe McCarthy&#8217;s blacklist look downright crude.&#8221; Sources have suggested to Radar that government databases tracking Americans today, including Main Core, could still have PROMIS-based legacy code from the days when North was running his programs.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Marty Lederman, a high-level official at the Department of Justice under Clinton, writing on a law blog last year, wondered, &#8220;How extreme were the programs they implemented [after 9/11]? How egregious was the lawbreaking?&#8221; <strong>Congress has tried, and mostly failed, to find out</strong>.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>We are at the edge of a cliff and we&#8217;re about to fall off</strong>,&#8221; says constitutional lawyer and former Reagan administration official Bruce Fein. &#8220;To a national emergency planner, everybody looks like a danger to stability. There&#8217;s no doubt that Congress would have the authority to denounce all this—for example, to refuse to appropriate money for the preparation of a list of U.S. citizens to be detained in the event of martial law. But Congress is the invertebrate branch.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>UPDATE [from Ketcham]<strong>:</strong> Since this article went to press, several documents have emerged to suggest the story has longer legs than we thought. Most troubling among these is an October 2001 Justice Department memo that detailed the extra-constitutional powers the U.S. military might invoke during domestic operations following a terrorist attack. In the memo, John Yoo, then deputy assistant attorney general, &#8220;concluded that <strong>the Fourth Amendment had no application to domestic military operations</strong>.&#8221; (Yoo, as most readers know, is author of the infamous Torture Memo that, in bizarro fashion, rejiggers the definition of &#8220;legal&#8221; torture to allow pretty much anything short of murder.) In the October 2001 memo, Yoo refers to a classified DOJ document titled &#8220;Authority for Use of Military Force to Combat Terrorist Activities Within the United States.&#8221; According to the Associated Press, &#8220;Exactly what domestic military action was covered by the October memo is unclear. But federal documents indicate that the memo relates to the National Security Agency&#8217;s Terrorist Surveillance Program.&#8221; <strong>Attorney General John Mukasey last month refused to clarify before Congress whether the Yoo memo was still in force</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Americans have the right to know whether a COG program is  still in effect, and whether the spying on our phone calls and Internet usage stems from such COG plans. Indeed, 9/11 was a horrible blow, but it was not a decapitating nuclear strike on our leaders &#8230; so COG and the state of emergency should be <em>lifted</em>.</p>
<p>If COG plans are <em>not</em> still in effect, we have the right to demand that &#8220;enemies lists&#8221; and spying capabilities developed  for the purpose of responding to a nuclear war be discarded , as we have not been hit by nuclear weapons &#8230; and our civilian leaders &#8211; on Capitol Hill, the White House, and the judiciary &#8211; are still alive and able to govern.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-78140" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>There are a lot of America-haters in the alternative media.  They endlessly predict the demise of the dollar, the American Empire, our constitutional form of government, the dollar as a reserve currency, the American dominance as the world&#8217;s only military super-power, etc., etc., etc.  I will not go on to attempt to debunk all this delusional tripe in one sitting here.  I&#8217;ll only bother to point out how utterly crushed, even broken-hearted, people -like- Michael Rivero over at What Really Happened are going to be, if this New American Century so much effort has gone into, actually comes into fruition.  We are more than a decade into it already, though.</p>
<p>I will point out that most of the analysis concerning spying on Americans (and the world) is retrospective.  It&#8217;s often said that retrospective analysis is 20-20.  It&#8217;s also too often quite delusional, because a retrospective analysis blocks out another possibility, that something new has been born out of what everyone is trying to describe using archaic ideas of the past.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look where we are right now.  The U.S. is clearly the lead dog in the  race to beat the deflation depression the world has run into.  American power has never been greater than it is right now.  Wall Street Banks are manipulating markets worldwide.  And Ben Bernanke is single-handedly levitating commodity prices around the world.</p>
<p>You have to admit, that&#8217;s a pretty impressive roster of accomplishments, given the condition of the world today.  As bad as the world economy is sitting right now, her in the U.S. the real tragedies our population is suffering, mostly are related to dope addiction.  China is on the brink of collapse.  Europe has collapsed.</p>
<p>I am dealing with a Chinese entrepreneur right now.  He is in Beijing.  And he is freaking out, because he just made a misstep that might cost him several hundred dollars.  Several hundred dollars?  Yes.  Several hundred dollars to this guy is an immense amount of money.  The economy really sucks in China right now, and losing several hundred dollars is going to set this guy back six months, if not a year.  He had hoped to buy a car in five or six years.  Most of the roads in Beijing are still dirt roads.  But this guy really wants a car.  God knows, he knows nothing about how expensive it can be to gas-up and even fix a damned car!  He just wants a car so he can drive himself to the moon, I think.</p>
<p>One thing all this spying the government is doing is helping, is it is helping American social engineers to keep the American economy from completely collapsing, like most economies have all over the world.  Whether it is meta data, or spying on American businessmen, the American economy is showing a flailing resilience that is the envy of the entire world.  The dollar is very high, despite that Bernanke has done everything he can to keep it from rising further.</p>
<p>All this spying may just be the key to coming out on top of the dog race the U.S. is in, trying to outpace the rest of the world in beating this deflationary depression.  Understand, I do not buy any of the recovery nonsense.  The books are not just cooked.  The FED obviously has taken an active part if pumping up bubbles throughout the economy -of both the U.S. and the rest of the world.  But none of that negates the fact that we are in a whopper of a worldwide deflationary depression.</p>
<p>I just think, this spying thing is not being measured properly for all the possibilities it lends to the multi-headed hydra we call the United States of America.  There is some good.  There is some bad.  The bad is very bad indeed.  But not one alternative media person has even tried to wrap their head around the possible good that can come from this massive amount of data on what everyone is doing in the U.S. and around the world.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my input on the topic.  I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s good.  I suspect it is very bad.   It is definitely not about terrorism.  I am sure of that.  Spying is about empire.  But, trust me when I say, there are those in the higher echelons of government wire-pullers who are using this data in ways you and I can only imagine.</p>
<p>And no matter what, they&#8217;re not going to give it up.</p>

<p>The eventual failure of the established systems will be extremely bad, and, from a personal point of view, the longer that was postponed, the better that will be for most people. However, the fundamentals are based on backing up frauds with force, and so, those systems are inherently insane, since the violence can never make the lies become true.</p>
<p>The supreme paradox we face is the conjunction of breakthroughs in the paradigms of science, which have enabled technologies to become trillions of times more powerful, while the social pyramid systems are based on maintaining ignorance and fear.  There ARE, and must necessarily be, some murder systems operating death controls.</p>
<p>Those which exist NOW are the result of the maximum possible deceits which were triumphant in the past &#8230; Therefore, the whole world is primarily governed by legalized lies, backed by legalized violence.  Your comments, Tonto, to me indicate some insight into the deeper realities that there MUST be some sort of death and debt controls, because human beings do exist inside of a natural world, which has real limits, which we must adapt to. However, the current systems were necessarily the result of those social systems becoming operated by the ruling classes which are the best at being professional liars and immaculate hypocrites.</p>
<p>The &#8220;alternative media&#8221; in my view are almost totally dominated by reactionary revolutionaries, who reveal the degree to which the ruling classes are actually being deceitful and destructive, BUT, those alternative news media almost never go on to propose better murder systems, backing up better money systems.</p>
<p>Instead, the &#8220;alternative media&#8221; tend to be controlled opposition, that promote the same old solutions, based on false fundamental dichotomies, and impossible ideals. However, impossible ideals always backfire in the real world. Impossible ideals actually make their opposite happen!</p>
<p>I think it is a mistaken over generalization to say that the &#8220;alternative media&#8221; are American haters. Most of them propose that we go backwards, to return to what the American system was originally supposed to be, according to its constitution. However, the bimetallic money system, backed by gold and silver, was destroyed a long time ago. We are now in a runaway system of electronic fiat &#8220;money,&#8221; made out of nothing, as debts, which is backed up by the threats of using weapons of mass destruction, like atomic bombs.</p>
<p>There are no ways to put these genies of electronics and atomic energy back in the bottle. The deepest dilemma that we face is the practical impossibility of operating a more honest murder system, which would back up a more honest money system. At present the growing chasm and contradiction between advances in all other sciences, and related technologies, while our political science, and all other human affairs, are in retrograde motion, is EXTREME.</p>
<p>The source of all our worsening problems is that warfare was the oldest and best developed of social sciences, BUT, success in warfare was based on deceits. Therefore, EVERYTHING we are doing is controlled by HUGE LIES, in which context, the Huge Lies about 9/11 and the responses to those Huge Lies, are the most extreme particular example.</p>
<p>The kinds of paradigm shifts which the &#8220;alternative media&#8221; would have to go through to provide a better system of alternatives would have to include alternative ideas about death controls, in order to sustain alternative systems of debt controls.  Almost nobody within the alternative media that I am aware of being at all popular is doing anything like that. Instead, they continue to mostly propose various kinds of impossibilities, such as going back to the original American Ideals, as being somehow the &#8220;solutions&#8221; to the real problems of the runaway take over of the government of the USA by the best organized transnational crime gangs, whose success is based on being the best at lying about what they were really doing!</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-78143" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Washingtons Blog continues to be quite correct, while presenting shallow views of the social facts.</p>
<p>There is no reasonable doubt that the events on 9/11/2001 were an inside job, false flag attack. From that perspective, the &#8220;emergency powers&#8221; were planned on being implemented by those who planned those acts. There is a much bigger plan at work here, and its potential real solutions also go MUCH DEEPER!</p>
<p>The &#8220;Democratic Republic&#8221; in the USA was already more than 99% destroyed a hundred years ago, when the Federal Reserve Board and Income Tax were implemented. At that point the international banksters already regained control over the government of the USA, and have leveraged the power to legally counterfeit the money supply to recapture control over ALL social institutions, such as education and the mass media.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these things go WAY DEEPER, into the history of warfare, and the real role of death controls and deceits during thousands of years of the history of civilization, of which the current Anglo-American (Zionist) empire is the greatest manifestation, so far &#8230; There are infinite tunnels of deceits operating through society, as the actual control mechanisms, which themselves are being driven insane, through too much &#8220;success&#8221; at controlling society through huge lies, backed up by lots of violence, which are therefore going mad, and so, headed towards psychotic breakdowns.</p>
<p>The basic problem is that human beings get into conflicts, and then, the resolutions of those conflicts occur through fighting, where those who are the best at deceiving others end up prevailing. The paradox is that nobody guards the guardians, and therefore, too much &#8220;success&#8221; achieved in that fashion becomes the reasons for the final failure of that system.</p>
<p>9/11 was merely the single most salient symbol of that process. Welcome to the Bizarro Mirror World, Folks. Since 9/11 was an inside job, false flag attack, the people who ACTUALLY did that, did it BECAUSE they wanted the excuses to start more genocidal wars, and prepare to impose democidal martial law. The real history we are living inside of was the process whereby the history of warfare (in which success depended on being the best at deceiving others) evolved the War Kings, which were the source of the states which have sovereign powers. Those War Kings were then gradually surpassed by the Fraud Kings, which are now the transnational banksters. Thus, the Fraud Kings have taken control over the American government, and they are the ones that need &#8220;emergency powers&#8221; to protect and preserve the systems that they have made and maintained.</p>
<p>As I already wrote above, those Fraud Kings already gained control over the USA when the Federal Reserve Board and Income Tax were enacted back in 1913. They were instrumental before that in undermining the American system by corrupting Congress to demonetize silver back in 1874, Furthermore, they were behind the Civil War, as well as the War of 1812.  The American system recovered, somewhat, through the efforts of President Andrew Jackson. However, after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, everything has been automatically getting worse, faster.</p>
<p>The established debt slavery, backed by wars based on deceits, systems are on automatic exponential growth curves. That means that the debt slavery numbers necessarily become NUTS, since the debt slavery turns into debt insanity, due to the fundamental structure of the monetary and taxation systems, which the Fraud Kings achieved through the systematic application of the methods of organized crime, to take control of the government of the USA.  Those historical events are behind the reasons why 9/11 was staged as an inside job, false flag attack, in order to have an excuse to prepare to impose democidal martial law.</p>
<p>When the last restraint of connecting &#8220;money&#8221; to gold was abandoned, then from the 1970s onwards, there has been a runaway growth of total debts in the USA, since the basic system IS money-as-debts, which was the system that was made by the Fraud Kings, after they applied the methods of organized crime to take control of the American government.  That exponential growth of debts is inherently driven to become madness, since exponential growth of triumphant fraud becomes INSANE. There is nothing that could fix these problems outside of a series of political miracles, which would require enough people understanding them enough.  The basic social realities are that money is backed by murder, and that must necessarily be the case. There is no way that it could ever become otherwise. The debt controls MUST be backed by the death controls, and they WERE, and ARE!</p>
<p>What has actually happened is that the history of warfare was the history of successful deceits, backed by destruction. That enabled the ruling classes to become more and more wealthy and powerful. However, all their wealth and power was based on organized lies, operating organized robberies. Furthermore, the ONLY way that human civilization can exist is as some systems of organized lies operating organized robberies.</p>
<p>The problem is that we are looking at the runaway &#8220;success&#8221; of the current systems, creating extreme disequilibria.  The only good solutions are to manage chronic political problems through better dynamic equilibria between the different systems of organized lies, operating organized robberies.  However, what is happening instead is the &#8220;success&#8221; of the current systems have become runaways on an exponential growth curve, which are headed towards driving themselves towards collapsing into chaos, since they can never sustain that exponential growth of force backed frauds. The &#8220;continuity of government&#8221; IS the continuity of the success of the covertly operating best organized gangs of criminals continuing to control the government of the USA, primarily for their benefit. Their very &#8220;success&#8221; at doing that is actually their worst enemy. </p>
<p>However, it appears practically impossible to resolve those problems any better, since too few Americans are willing and able to understand that they are actually members of an organized crime gang, and must necessarily be. Therefore, they do not understand their realities enough to work towards evolving better dynamic equilibria, rather than continuing to allow the runaway disequilibria &#8230;</p>
