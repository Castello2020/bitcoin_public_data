						<h3 style="color: #000099;"></h3>
<h3 style="color: #000099;">Did Iran Back 9/11 Hijackers? Saudi Arabia? Iraq?  Afghanistan? America? Israel?</h3>
<p>In December, an American court <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/us/ruling-against-iran-in-sept-11-case.html?_r=1">entered a default judgment against <strong><em>Iran</em></strong></a> for allegedly having a hand in the September 11th attacks. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, a 9/11 Commissioner and the Co-Chair of Congressional Inquiry into 9/11 both say in sworn declarations that <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/03/911-commissioner-and-co-chair-of-congressional-inquiry-into-911-say-in-sworn-declarations-that-saudi-government-linked-to-911-attacks.html">the <em>Saudi</em> government is linked to the 9/11 attacks</a>. <sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Then again, right after 9/11, Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/04/5-hours-after-911-attacks-rumsfeld-said.html">accused <strong><em>Iraq</em></strong> of having a hand in the attacks</a>.</p>
<p>People may not remember now, but &#8211; at the time – the supposed Saddam-9/11 link <a title="the Saddam-911 link was at least as important in many people’s minds as a reason to invade Iraq" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0314/p02s01-woiq.html" target="_blank">was at least as important a justification for the Iraq war as the alleged weapons of mass destruction</a>. <sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Of course, the <strong><em>Afghanistan</em></strong> war was largely based upon the allegation that the leaders of that country &#8211; the Taliban &#8211; had harbored Bin Laden and other Al Qaeda terrorists. In other words, the U.S. government treated Afghanistan as being complicit in 9/11 by giving refuge to the 9/11 attackers. <sup>4</sup></p>
<p>At a minimum, <em><strong>America</strong></em> unintentionally <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/09/sleeping-with-the-devil-how-u-s-and-saudi-backing-of-al-qaeda-led-to-911.html">created an atmosphere in which Al Qaeda terrorists could thrive</a>.  But numerous former U.S. military and intelligence officers <a href="http://www.patriotsquestion911.com">think</a> that rogue elements within the U.S.<strong><em></em></strong> government intentionally <a href="http://911summary.com/military.php">allowed or facilitated</a> the attacks.</p>
<p>A government official <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEOecRtBU7U&amp;feature=player_embedded#t=83s">told</a> Fox News:</p>
<blockquote><p>Evidence linking these <strong>Israelis</strong> to 9/11 is classified. I cannot tell you about evidence that has been gathered. It&#8217;s classified information.</p></blockquote>
<p>Israelis were clearly spying on the 9/11 hijackers within America before 9/11.  See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEOecRtBU7U&amp;feature=player_embedded#t=83s">this</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/o17SSuuZDkA&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x234900&amp;color2=0x4e9e00&amp;border=1">this</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/VclAeKYYvBc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x234900&amp;color2=0x4e9e00&amp;border=1">this</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/NVRsmodmCTE&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x234900&amp;color2=0x4e9e00&amp;border=1">this</a> and <a href="http://www.christopherketcham.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/Final%20PDF%20of%20CounterPunch%20article%20re%20Israelis%2001-29-07.pdf">this</a>.</p>
<p>While many people say that Israel only <em>spied</em> on the hijackers &#8211; and didn&#8217;t withhold actionable intelligence from the U.S. government &#8211; others,  including some former military officials (like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Sabrosky">this guy</a>), allege that Israel withheld information from the U.S. or even <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aKj6uJ5Mt4">had a hand in the attacks</a>, pointing to suspicious activities regarding moving vans and explosives on 9/11.  See <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=123885&amp;page=1#.UEmH4MWUyM4">this</a>, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011230192944/http://www.bergen.com/news/2bombvan200109125.htm">this</a>, <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0109/11/se.04.html">this</a>, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031025054027/http://archives.tcm.ie/breakingnews/2001/09/12/story23429.asp">this</a> and <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2011/07/17/911-and-israel-alan-sabroskys-shocking-press-tv-interview/">this</a>.</p>
<p>What does this mean?   We don&#8217;t know for sure which nation or nations backed the 9/11 terror attacks.</p>
<p>But as the Co-Chair of the Congressional Inquiry into 9/11 and former Head of the Senate Intelligence Committee Bob Graham <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/politics/july-dec02/intelligence_12-11.html">told PBS Newshour</a> in 2001, 9/11 was state-sponsored terrorism, and it is vital for America&#8217;s national security that we get to the bottom of who the backing country was (and whether more than one country was involved):</p>
<blockquote><p>[Question]: Senator Graham, are there elements in this report, which are classified that Americans should know about but can&#8217;t?</p>
<p>SEN. BOB GRAHAM: Yes &#8230; I was surprised at the evidence that <strong>there were foreign governments involved in facilitating the activities of at least some of the terrorists in the United States</strong>.</p>
<p>I am stunned that we have not done a better job of pursuing that to determine if other terrorists received similar support and, even more important, <strong>if the infrastructure of a foreign government assisting terrorists still exists for the current generation of terrorists who are here planning the next plots</strong>.</p>
<p>To me that is an extremely significant issue and most of that information is classified, I think overly-classified. <strong>I believe the American people should know the extent of the challenge that we face in terms of foreign government involvement</strong>. That would motivate the government to take action.</p>
<p>[Question]: Are you suggesting that you are convinced that there was a state sponsor behind 9/11?</p>
<p>SEN. BOB GRAHAM: I think <strong>there is very compelling evidence that at least some of the terrorists were assisted not just in financing &#8212; although that was part of it &#8212; by a sovereign foreign government</strong> and that we have been derelict in our duty to track that down, make the further case, or find the evidence that would indicate that that is not true and we can look for other reasons why the terrorists were able to function so effectively in the United States.</p>
<p>[Question]: Do you think that will ever become public, which countries you&#8217;re talking about?</p>
<p>SEN. BOB GRAHAM: It will become public at some point when it&#8217;s turned over to the archives, but that&#8217;s 20 or 30 years from now. And, <strong>we need to have this information now because it&#8217;s relevant to the threat that the people of the United States are facing today</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> The 9/11 Commission Report <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2012-07-31/justice/justice_new-york-judge-9-11_1_al-qaeda-members-iran-and-hezbollah-hezbollah-militants">states</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have found no evidence that Iran or Hezbollah was aware of the planning for what later became the 9/11 attack.</p></blockquote>
<p>The same lawsuit had <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2012-07-31/justice/justice_new-york-judge-9-11_1_al-qaeda-members-iran-and-hezbollah-hezbollah-militants">previously named Iraq</a>  as a culprit, but dismissed Iraq when it became obvious there was no connection (see note 3).</p>
<p>A default judgment &#8211; such as the one against Iran &#8211; means that the defendant doesn&#8217;t appear in court, and so does not present a defense or contrary evidence.  The judge instead often accepts virtually whatever the plaintiff claims, without examining or considering any contrary evidence.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>  The 9/11 Commissioner and the Co-Chair of Congressional Inquiry into 9/11 who say that Saudi Arabia is behind the 9/11 attacks are calling for either a &#8220;<a title="it might take “a permanent 9/11 commission” to end the remaining mysteries of September 11" href="http://georgewashington2.blogspot.com/2009/03/911-commissioner-bob-kerrey-it-might.html" target="_blank">permanent 9/11 commission</a>&#8221; or a <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/03/911-commissioner-and-co-chair-of-congressional-inquiry-into-911-say-in-sworn-declarations-that-saudi-government-linked-to-911-attacks.html">new 9/11 investigation</a> to get to the bottom of it.</p>

So this can be defined as a super-national operation. We suspect those two nuclear suitcases which detonated in the basements of the towers were purchased from the Russian FSB during the 1990s , as a part of a dirty deal with Putin (the current poster boy of certain &#8220;alternative media&#8221; elements in the U.S.) : <a href="http://essential-intelligence-network.blogspot.com/2012/04/north-atlantic-sting.html" rel="nofollow">http://essential-intelligence-network.blogspot.com/2012/04/north-atlantic-sting.html</a></p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-63401" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The invasion of Afghanistan was planned over 10 months ahead of September 11 terrorist attack. So, it could not be Taliban or al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>Like the faked &#8220;Iraqi WMD&#8221;, Iraq was blamed for the 9/11 before it was invaded and occupied on 2003 &#8220;Purim night&#8221;. Later, US officials admitted that Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with the 9/11.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia was suspected of collaborating with the Bush administration &#8211; so that Muslim could be blamed for the terrorism. Howeve, no one had claimed that Saudis &#8220;masterminded the event.</p>
<p>It was on May 19, 2011 &#8211; Benjamin Weiser, a Zionist Jew writer, who brought both Iran and Hizbullah into the 9/11 frame in an article in Ziocon mouthpiece, The New York Times.  “Iranian officials had foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks“. He also claimed that 9/11 Commision Report “found no evidence that Iran or Hezbollah was aware of the planning for what later became the 9/11 attack” – but some how his Zionist guts feeling told him that both Iran and Hizbullah did have pre-knowledge of 9/11.</p>
<p>While the evidence indicates that the Israelis had prior knowledge of 9-11, commonly-held misconceptions about Israel and a general lack of understanding of Zionism’s brutal history of terrorism prevent most people from comprehending the Israeli connection. An ignorance of Zionist history, cultivated by the controlled media, prevents people from understanding the present reality. In order to understand 9-11, it is essential to have a grasp of the history of previous Israeli attacks on the United States, such as, Lavon Affair (1954), JFK assassination (1963), USS Liberty attack (1967), Operation Trojan (Libya 1986), Pan Am bombing (1988) and others.</p>
<p>The Colorado Public Television has produced a documentary, entitled ‘Explosive Evidence – Expert Speak Out’. The documentary interviews over 40 Scientific experts who share their professional insights about the events of September 11, 2001.</p>
<p>The documentary is produced by the Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth features dozens of credentialed experts in architecture, engineering, and other related fields who argue that the World Trade Center (WTC) Twin Towers and WTC Building 7 were not brought down on September 11, 2001, by the office fires ignited by the jetliner impacts, but rather by explosive controlled demolition. Watch the video here. Also watch another video here featuring many of the surviving clips from eyewitnesses and news footage from 9/11 that were only shown once on television and never replayed.</p>

It was purely an invention of the CIA&#8230;.<br />

<p>Alexander Higgins  A BBC documentary on Al Qaeda admits the Bin Laden’s Organization never existed. Instead the US invented it out of thin air to fabricate criminal charges.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-63422" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Thanks for being openly skeptical of the official 9/11 story and the official investigation.    Very few others dare to reveal their doubts for fear of offending a huge crowd of conspiracy skeptics who consider the matter settled.   Yes the conspiracy/truther crowd IS in trouble because they postulate alternative theories,  speculating on specifics about how the attacks occurred and end up in endless debates on technicalities.    Without a proper investigation this approach is doomed,  because supporters of the official story can always win an argument where the proof of the truthers relies on complex speculations.   Lets focus on who the hijackers were,  who knew about them,  who funded them and other elements of the 9/11 timeline that help connect the dots that reveal the official story/investigation to be untenable.</p>

They only stick to the facts and to the laws of science to claim simply that the report from NIST is flawed. That&#8217;s where it needs to start. The main stream needs to hear facts from experts before the accusations of false flag operation. </p>
<p>I personally have come to the conclusion that this was a Mossad/CIA operation based on the American Neoconservative goals set by the Bush administration and Dick Cheney in particular.</p>

However, I do not agree that it claims Israel did it.  Rather it was international Zionism which was behind the attacks, not just the Zionist state.  Israel could be destroyed, and international Zionism would still control the world, because its primarily based in the City of London and NYC, along with Hollywood for mind controlling the masses.  Israel is NOT a &#8220;Jewish state&#8221; no mattter how many times people say it is.  The House of Rothschild created Israel as their Zionist state center of world terrorism, and Jewish people are brainwashed into thinking its their state.  The Ashkenazi Jews who control Israel have no connection to the biblical Jews, and therefore no historic biblical claim on Israel.   International Zionism was created as a psyop to use Jews as scapegoats, and most Jews are not Zionist, while most Zionists are not Jews.  International Zionism, the international bankers who created it, and the illuminati families who control the world are the enemy of all freedom loving people.</p>

You can find pieces of the world trade center on surrounding rooftops in the smallest of crevices and ductwork.  Find undocumented debris, and have it analyzed by a university without telling them where the sample came from.   You will have all the evidence in the world at that point.  US and Israeli weapons leave very specific signatures of chemical composition.  Once that signature is identified in a rock sample from new york.  People will start to hang themselves.</p>

The US capitol, White House, Pentagon and FBI HQ have been protected by defensive missiles since the middle 1990&#8242;s.</p>
<p>Our government knew an attack was coming, and that it would behoove them to have our defenses stand down in order to get a &#8220;New Pearl Harbor&#8221; so they could execute their preplanned war on Iraq.</p>
<p>The surprise to the government was that the three towers were imploded.  Who did it?</p>

I had just about lost all faith in humanity for any hope of being anywhere akin to me, until day 9-11 came along and put pressures on humanity to be as I am.  It&#8217;s been a long time coming, but humanity is proving, very powerefully, that at least a large segment of it is exactly as I am, and embodies the moral characteristics that I cherish, which are all the virtues that the Bible names, among them being truth, honesty, justice and compassion.  It&#8217;s a thrilling prospect for me.  It could at least restore a few kilowatts of my hope in a humanity that has dwindled almost to absolute zero.  The last hope I had was in babies, and then humanity began to slaughter them mercilessly.  I am still contemplating the end of humanity for it.  It is my biggest quandary.   If I decide to end it, humanity will be no more.  And so, a few kilowatts of hope, within me, are important.</p>

Because the official story is what is being taught. People as a whole do not care who is responsible for 9/11. Them  thar Muslims did it and that&#8217;s that.<br />
We lost. Truth lost. It&#8217;s time to get over this and move on.<br />
If one examines the &#8220;Holocaust©&#8221;, it&#8217;s obvious that six million Jews weren&#8217;t killed, or there were not the amount of WMD&#8217;s in Iraq as claimed (or insert your own historical fiction here)&#8230;but you know what&#8230;they own the media and the educational books/system and that&#8217;s that.<br />
People are stupid; get over it and move on.<br />
Just try to be vigilant as to not be caught in one of their schemes.</p>

No-warrant wire taps, indefinite detention of citizens without charges, approval of rendition of prisoners and torture, stop and frisk without probable cause, search and seizure without a warrant, no-knock entry, confiscation and destruction of cameras that might have been used to film police acting illegally, police brutality, police shootings that go without  investigation, managed news, and the civil-rights destroying &#8220;Patriot&#8221; Act.</p>
<p>Acts of police behaving illegally, with shootings, Tasers, and unwarranted violence now appear almost daily.  Rarely are these offenses punished.  Most often &#8220;an investigation&#8221; is claimed, but soon forgotten.</p>
<p>  In addition, the USA, with 5% of the world population, has 25% of all of the prisoners in the world.  That means the USA has the most people in prison of any nation in history.  Even by percentage of residents incarcerated, not just sheer numbers.  USA is # 1  .</p>
<p>Does any of that sound like a free country?</p>
<p>As Dwight D. Eisenhower said about communism, &#8220;It&#8217;s like slicing sausage.  First they out off a small slice.  That isn&#8217;t worth fighting over.  Then they take another small slice that isn&#8217;t worth fighting over.  Then another and another.  Finally, all you have left is the string and that isn&#8217;t worth fighting over, either.</p>
