Popular Question Sep8

Error 403 when git push (multiple github accounts on the same mac)
Why do you even need two github accounts? FWIW authentication is done via the push url (which is normally starting with ssh://)

user.name and user.email have nothing to do with authentication, these are just values which are recorded during commit.

Assign arbitrary MAC address in VirtualBox VM
Downvoters, please leave a comment stating why you think this is a such a bad question. Maybe I can improve it

Assign arbitrary MAC address in VirtualBox VM
No not really. The wikipedia article on MAC addresses states that the broadcast MAC address is all bits 1 (FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF). For multicasts your claim seems to be true however. I think I understand now, thanks!

Assign arbitrary MAC address in VirtualBox VM
Hm yeah. That also comes from the fact, that I mixed up nibbles (characters in the regex) and bytes (pairs of chars in the regex)

Assign arbitrary MAC address in VirtualBox VM
Oh, I mixed up nibbles and bytes (I read the regex wrongly). Okay, a "multiple of 2" (again, I was too fast reading that regex)

How can I find out where a UDP connection fails?
@ott: It's the default example config provided by OpenVPN in /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files. I only updated the values for certificates and the server IP/DNS. And the exact same config works, when I change from proto udp to proto tcp.

My server is in the DMZ of the router (so it should allow any traffic, right?). I don't know about the client. Is there a way to find out? Remember … the client could be anywhere (airport wifi, mcdonalds, umts, etc.)

@LucasKauffman: Something along the lines of "Key exchange failed after 60 seconds" on the client, I don't think the server made any output. I can check again tomorrow (~12 hrs)

@LucasKauffman: no, I'm simply running openvpn server.conf on the server and openvpn client.conf on the client

Setting up a cron job that does a chmod/chown
@David: somename is not a path, but the user name (and should also contain the group name: somename:somegroup) ;)

Just leave it there, maybe someone else has the same problem and will find their solution here.
