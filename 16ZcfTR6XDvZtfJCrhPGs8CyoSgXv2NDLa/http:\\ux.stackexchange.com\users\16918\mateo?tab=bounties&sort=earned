I Like to build and repair computers. I have both a Cubieboard, and Raspberry Pi. I also enjoy refinishing wood furniture.
I like using the terminal, writing basic shell scripts, and sometimes even installing from source :)
Everything I say(type) is not related to anything,
nor does it represent any entity.
The words belong not to anyone.
