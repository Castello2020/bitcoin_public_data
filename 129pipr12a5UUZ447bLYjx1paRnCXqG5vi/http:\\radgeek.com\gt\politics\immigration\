<p class="first">As we approach the New Year, we naturally think of ends, and of beginnings; what has changed, and what we have lost. So hey, libertarians, let&#8217;s all get together and feel sorry about the golden age of Limited Government and Individual Liberty we have lost. Remember the ancient liberties that we all enjoyed only 60 years ago, back in the 1950s? Back when all military-age men were subject to the draft, people were being interrogated before a permanent committee of Congress over their political beliefs, the FBI was conducting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO">massive illegal wiretapping, surveillance and disruption against nonviolent civil rights activists</a>, the National Security Agency was established as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Such_Agency">a completely secret surveillance arm of the federal government</a>, it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griswold_v._Connecticut">illegal for married or unmarried women to buy basic birth control</a>, it was <a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2006/04/13/how_physicians/">made illegal for anyone to buy any scheduled drug without a doctor&#8217;s prescription</a>, government was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment">conducting medical experiments on unwilling human subjects</a><sup>[<a href="#age-bronze-n-1" class="footnoted" id="to-age-bronze-n-1">1</a>]</sup>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_renewal">Urban Renewal</a> was <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20131215/OPINION05/312150060/Black-Bottom-Detroit-I-375-I-75-paradise-valley-removal">demolishing the core of every major U.S. city</a> to build government highways and housing projects, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Wetback">massive community-wide immigration raids were terrorizing undocumented migrants</a> throughout the Southwest.</p>

<p>Or like back in the 1940s when <a href="http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/spending_chart_1900_2015USp_15s1li011lcn_F0xF0fF0sF0l_Spending_In_20th_Century">government spending was over 50% of GDP</a>, <a href="http://www.ameshistory.org/exhibits/events/rationing.htm">nearly the entire consumer economy was subject to government rationing</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_American_internment">Japanese-Americans were forced into internment camps</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project">a secret government conspiracy</a> was building an entire network of secret cities in order to build <a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2012/08/09/1102am-67-years-74000-souls/">atomic bombs to drop on civilian centers</a>.</p>

<p>Or like back in the 1930s when the entire institutional groundwork of the New Deal was being implemented, Roosevelt was making himself president-for-life, government <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102">attempted to seize all gold or silver bullion in private hands</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marihuana_Tax_Act_of_1937">the federal government first instituted the Drug War</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow">Jim Crow was the law of the land</a>, Congress created the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service">INS</a>, Jews fleeing the incipient Holocaust in Europe were being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_St._Louis">turned away by immigration authorities</a>, and psychiatrists were using massive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy">electric shocks</a> or literally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobotomy">mutilating the brains</a> of women and men confined to asylums.</p>

<p>Or like the 1920s when it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States">illegal to buy alcoholic drinks anywhere in the United States</a>, tariff rates were nearly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordney%E2%80%93McCumber_Tariff">40% on dutiable imports</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacco_and_Vanzetti">Sacco and Vanzetti</a> were murdered by the state of Massachusetts, the <q>Invisible Empire</q> Second Era Klan effectively took over the state governments of <a href="http://www.csindy.com/coloradosprings/welcome-to-kolorado-klan-kountry/Content?oid=1119033">Colorado</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=a1eSbL0kxk8C">Indiana</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Politics-Society-Klan-Alabama-1915-1949/dp/0817309845?tag=radgeek-20">Alabama</a>, hundreds of black victims were massacred in race riots in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot">Tulsa</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosewood_massacre">Rosewood</a>, when Congress created the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Radio_Commission">Federal Radio Commission</a><sup>[<a href="#age-bronze-n-2" class="footnoted" id="to-age-bronze-n-2">2</a>]</sup>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Border_Patrol">US Border Patrol</a>, passed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Quota_Act">Emergency [sic] Quota Act of 1921</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1924">Immigration Act of 1924</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_v._Bell">the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the authority of the state to forcibly sterilize women</a> deemed &#8220;feeble-minded&#8221; or &#8220;promiscuous&#8221; for eugenic purposes.</p>

<p>Or the 1910s, when the federal government seized control of foreign-owned companies to facilitate production of chemical weapons, imposed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_Service_Act_of_1917">the first-ever use of federal conscription to fight an overseas war</a>, invaded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_occupation_of_Haiti">Haiti</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_occupation_of_Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_occupation_of_the_Dominican_Republic_%281916%E2%80%9324%29">Dominican Republic</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Honduras#The_Rise_of_United_States_influence_in_Honduras_.281899-1919.29">Honduras</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_occupation_of_Veracruz">Mexico</a><sup>[<a href="#age-bronze-n-3" class="footnoted" id="to-age-bronze-n-3">3</a>]</sup>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_intervention_in_the_Russian_Civil_War">Russia</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_entry_into_World_War_I">Europe</a>, passed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_anarchy">criminal anarchy</a> and criminal syndicalism statutes, <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/iww-trial#">tried and convicted hundreds of people for belonging to radical unions</a>, imprisoned hundreds of people for protesting the draft during World War I (ordered by the President of the United States and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenck_v._United_States">upheld by the Supreme Court in one of its most radical anti-free-speech decisions</a>), deported hundreds of people solely for holding anti-state political beliefs, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann_Act">Mann Act</a> made it illegal to &#8220;transport women across statelines for immoral purposes&#8221; [sic], the <a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2008/04/20/the_ludlow/">Colorado National Guard machine-gunned and burned alive striking miners and their families</a> in order to break a UMWA organizing campaign, and Congress created the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System">Federal Reserve</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_Act_of_1913">Income Tax</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage_Act_of_1917">Espionage Act</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedition_Act_of_1918">Sedition Act</a>.</p>

<p>Or maybe like the 1900s. <span style="white-space: nowrap">&#8230; .</span></p>

<p class="first">At a recent grandstanding speech on immigration <q>reform,</q> in which Barack Obama attempted to pass himself off as a <em>supporter</em> of immigrants while presiding over the unprecedented, relentless deportation of two million, immigrant families and activists confronted him over his record. He responded by passing the buck, and insisting that he was powerless.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><q>Our families are separated,</q> a young man yelled during remarks in San Francisco at the Betty Ann Ong Chinese Recreation Center. <q>Mr. President, please use your executive authority to halt [deportations]. We agree that we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform, but at the same time, you have the power to stop deportations.</q></p>
  
  <p><q>Actually, I don&#8217;t,</q><sup>[<a href="#no-higher-law-n-1" class="footnoted" id="to-no-higher-law-n-1">1</a>]</sup> the president replied, <q>and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re here.</q></p>
  
  <p>Other people in the crowd began to yell as well: <q>Stop deportations. Yes, we can.</q></p>
  
  <p><ins class="ellipsis editorial" title="[Elision by the editor.]">.&#160;.&#160;.</ins> <q>What you need to know, when I&#8217;m speaking as president of the United States and I come to this community, is that if in fact I could solve all of these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so,</q><sup>[<a href="#no-higher-law-n-2" class="footnoted" id="to-no-higher-law-n-2">2</a>]</sup> he said. <q>But we&#8217;re [<span lang="la">sic</span>] also a nation of laws. That&#8217;s part of our tradition.</q></p>
  
  <p><q>So the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our [<span lang="la">sic</span>] laws,</q> he continued.</p>
  
  <p class="attribution">&#8212;&#8201;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/25/barack-obama-hecklers-immigration_n_4338945.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000003">Elise Foley, <cite class="article">Obama Confronts Hecklers At Immigration Speech,</cite> in the <cite>Huffington Post</cite> (25 November 2013)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If laws command injustice, then those laws <em>ought</em> to be violation. <q>A nation of laws</q> is nothing more than a rigid structure of power; and when that power is turned against innocent families, it deserves no respect, and no loyalty. Those who administer that power inflict real evil on helpless victims, and when they excuse themselves for responsibility by pointing to the laws, by pointing to political etiquette, by pointing to the demands of their office, they are doing nothing less, and nothing more, than saying that their political ambitions and political interests are more important to them than the rights of innocent people.</p>

<p>A law that commands injustice should be treated as no law at all. There is no office that can nullify a man&#8217;s conscience, no order that erases moral responsibility. There is no higher law than human rights or common decency. We have here the most privileged man on the face of the earth lecturing disenfranchised immigrant families about how powerless he supposedly is to stop &#8212; the most privileged man on the face of the earth begging that he is supposedly powerless over detention and deportation quotas that <em>he</em> set; begging that he is supposedly powerless to restrain the force of agencies directly responsible to him and his appointees; defending his own political cowardice, and tossing around contemptuous lines about <q>easy ways out,</q> delivered to the victims of his own detestable politically-driven assaults on immigrants.</p>

<p>Barack Obama&#8217;s record on immigration has been shameful. And his endless political excuse-making for record mass deportations, is despicable.</p>

<p>So, just to re-cap:</p>

<p><strong>Conservatarian:</strong> <q>Here&#8217;s all I want: a REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, the harshest possible BORDER FASCISM. GOVERNMENT ENFORCED LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS. A culture of CONSTITUTION FETISHISM, PUBLIC REVERENCE FOR STATE FOUNDERS and LEGALISTIC NATIONALISM. DRUG PROHIBITION and RIGHT-WING SOCIAL ENGINEERING THROUGH THE WELFARE SYSTEM. Also, SAVING THE WELFARE STATE FOR U.S. CITIZENS WHO CONFORM TO MY FAVORED LIFESTYLE CHOICES. And 100% CONFORMITY ON QUESTIONS OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL IMPORT. I&#8217;m for small government!</q></p>

<p>So, seriously conservatarians, if this is what you want, what you want hasn&#8217;t got anything even remotely to do with liberty. If you thought that this did have something to do with liberty, then you need to re-think some of your life choices.</p>

<p>Nationalism is the death of liberty.</p>

<div class="body">
<p class="first">The websites of the <a href="http://c4ss.org/">Center for a Stateless Society</a> and <a href="http://s4ss.org/">Students for a Stateless Society</a> are under attack by an anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant racist, named Olivier Janssens.</p>

<p>The websites have been temporarily suspended by their web hosting company, Bluehost, because of a spurious takedown notice apparently sent by the attorney J. D. Obenberger, apparently on Janssen&#8217;s behalf. According to the lawyer&#8217;s takedown notice to Bluehost, &#8220;Your hosting customer, who operates <a href="http://s4ss.org">http://s4ss.org</a>, decided to embarrass Oliver Janssens<sup>[<a href="#c4ss-under-attack-n-1" class="footnoted" id="to-c4ss-under-attack-n-1">1</a>]</sup> in the worst and most effective way - <strong>by words out of his own mouth.</strong><sup>[<a href="#c4ss-under-attack-n-2" class="footnoted" id="to-c4ss-under-attack-n-2">2</a>]</sup> Words of his own creation which, when  reduced to the tangible medium of a FaceBook page, acquired a copyright. recognized by the United States Copyright Act and international conventions
concerning copyright.&#8221; In other words, Obenberger claims that S4SS (and apparently C4SS, even though C4SS&#8217;s website never even quoted Olivier Janssen&#8217;s name) ought to be legally censored for <em>truthfully reporting the man&#8217;s own words about Muslims and immigrants.</em> Specifically, his words when he wrote &#8212; on Facebook &#8212; &#8220;HHH<sup>[<a href="#c4ss-under-attack-n-3" class="footnoted" id="to-c4ss-under-attack-n-3">3</a>]</sup>has the balls<sup>[<a href="#c4ss-under-attack-n-4" class="footnoted" id="to-c4ss-under-attack-n-4">4</a>]</sup> to say that, thanks to our welfare state, our genetic pool is fucked. Exactly my thoughts. The only reason the Muslim parasite<sup>[<a href="#c4ss-under-attack-n-5" class="footnoted" id="to-c4ss-under-attack-n-5">5</a>]</sup> can breed at a 10 times faster pace than us. Totally love this guy.&#8221;<sup>[<a href="#c4ss-under-attack-n-6" class="footnoted" id="to-c4ss-under-attack-n-6">6</a>]</sup></p>

<p>Olivier Janssens is a bigot, a bully, and now would like to add &#8220;censor&#8221; to his list of credentials, with a lawyer e-mailing legal threats and spurious takedown notices to C4SS and S4SS&#8217;s web host.</p>

<p>Here is a copy of the <a href="http://s4ss.org/470/s4ss-ugent-not-anarchists-or-comrades/">Students for a Stateless Society post</a> that Janssens and his lawyer are trying to censor. <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:IBOUcbrDLioJ:s4ss.org/470/s4ss-ugent-not-anarchists-or-comrades">It was retrieved from Google&#8217;s web cache on September 23, 2013, and represents the page as it appeared on September 13, 2013</a>.

<p>From the inception of Students for a Stateless Society we have strived to provide a space to learn about liberty and engage in projects to further its cause. We seek to provide a networked structure that will allow for maximum autonomy of our chapters while fostering maximum inter/intra-chapter participation, communication and coordination. Although we do not ‘own’ the S4SS ‘trademark’ we feel it is necessary to emphasize that we do decide for ourselves which individuals, groups and chapters we recognize as being part of our network.</p>
<p>For the last few months we have been observing a rapid change of subject and tone in the discussions held at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/452955004728164/?fref=ts">facebook group</a> of the S4SS chapter in Belgium; Students for a Stateless Society UGent. The atmosphere present in that group is becoming increasingly hostile towards fellow liberty-advocates, liberty-oriented organizations, and –most clearly- those of the Islamic faith. In accordance with our <a href="http://s4ss.org/home/">organizational orientation</a> which states:</p>
<blockquote><p>“<i>3. S4SS spaces are </i><a href="http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=496&amp;Itemid=177" target="_blank"><i>safe</i></a><i> and </i><a href="http://c4ss.org/content/10691" target="_blank"><i>valued</i></a><i> spaces. We are dedicated to not only identifying agents of aggression, but dissolving institutions of oppression.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>We feel S4SS U-gent is not representing this orientation in their structure or discussions. In fact we feel they are actively promoting oppression of Muslim minorities, as evidenced by the following facebook-conversations:</p>
<blockquote><p><b><i>Piece 1: </i></b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/452955004728164/permalink/637332409623755/"><i>https://www.facebook.com/groups/452955004728164/permalink/637332409623755/</i></a></p>
<p><a href="http://s4ss.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Piece-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-471" alt="S4SS UGent Facebook 1" src="http://s4ss.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Piece-1-290x300.jpg" width="290" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><b>Everaert:</b> According to Lode Cossaer and his fellow Trotskyists it is “redundant to talk about the problems in the Arab world” and “we should focus ourselves on signs of hope.” I propose sending him on a one way trip to Syria. He can go and ignore the bullets and beheadings (they’re redundant anyway), and look for hope. Surely he won’t return. That kid won’t even survive reality.</p>
<p><b>Arnaert:</b> Cossaer denies reality? Behold the most important attitude of the left!</p>
<p><b>Everaert:</b> Reality is redundant, so not relevant and pointless. Bleri Lleshi = Lode Cossaer <i>(ed. Bleri Lleshi is a leftist Belgian philosopher, documentary filmmaker and political scientist who focuses on things like identity, equality and neo-liberalism)</i></p>
<p><b>Janssens:</b> It would be relevant enough if you know that the SPA/PS <i>(Leftist political parties in Belgium)</i> are growing in power because of the muslims, and that the Arab world is helping them accomplish this. Unless his hope is is ‘not being beheaded in 20 years because he is a Christian’.</p>
<p><b>Verdyck:</b> He has no capital and his ambition to work for the government all his life.</p></blockquote>
<p>Xavier Everaert, Brecht Arnaert, Olivier Janssens and Yannick Verdyck share very islamophobic viewpoints as visible from the above conversation. Let us be clear; We do not believe the Muslim world is helping leftist political parties gain power. Muslims are individuals with their own thoughts, their actions and political beliefs are not a result of their skin color or belief in a certain deity. Additionally:</p>

<p><i>In response to a story involving a recommendation to the government to change public holidays to involve more multi-cultural festivities instead of just Christian ones.</i><i>(</i><a href="http://m.gva.be/nieuws/binnenland/aid988952/pasen-hemelvaartsdag-en-allerheiligen-geen-wettelijke-feestdagen-meer.aspx"><i>http://m.gva.be/nieuws/binnenland/aid988952/pasen-hemelvaartsdag-en-allerheiligen-geen-wettelijke-feestdagen-meer.aspx</i></a><i>)</i> <i>A selection of comments has been translated.</i></p>
<p><a href="http://s4ss.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Piece-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-472" alt="S4SS UGent Facebook 2" src="http://s4ss.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Piece-2-116x300.jpg" width="116" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><b>Janssens</b>: Men, it’s time for revolution</p>
<p><b>Kint</b>: ‘recommendation’</p>
<p><b>Jacobs</b>: Funny how the result of ‘inter-cultural dialogue’ always comes down to giving Muslims more advantages while Catholics get doused in shit every day by our regime’s media.</p>
<p><b>Janssens</b>: Enough is enough.</p>
<p><b>Arnaert</b>: I don’t think they’re taking it far enough. I think western names like John, Peter and Paul are quite upsetting as well.</p>
<p><b>Verdyck</b>: And of course, everyone who thinks this will cause trouble between original-Belgians and muslims is obviously a xenophobe.</p>
<p><b>Everaert</b>: Guns. Guns to kill all those sand-niggers and their servants like Lode Cossaer, just like the animals they are.</p>
<p><b>Verdyck</b>: I have never been able to find the difference between Mein Kampf and the Koran, but according to Lode Cossaer and Joelle Milquet there is definitely a difference. Hitler wrote Mein Kampf in German, that xenophobic nationalist!</p></blockquote>
<p>Let us highlight Everaert’s comment: “Guns. Guns to kill all those sand-niggers and their servants like Lode Cossaer, just like the animals they are.” Do we really need say more? In no way can you call this critical of religion. This is pure racism. S4SS is supposed to provide safe spaces for students of all sorts, including individuals with minority religious and ethnic backgrounds. In addition this comment is a threat to initiate violence against peaceful people; S4SS should not associate itself with people who make threats to the life and liberty of others. If this wasn’t enough, here is more:</p>
<blockquote><p><b><i>Piece 3:</i></b><i>  </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/452955004728164/permalink/628664343823895/"><i>https://www.facebook.com/groups/452955004728164/permalink/628664343823895/</i></a><i></i></p>
<p><b>Janssens</b>: HHH <i>(ed. Hans Herman Hoppe)</i> has the balls to say that, thanks to our welfare state, our genetic pool is fucked. Exactly my thoughts. The only reason the Muslim parasite can breed at a 10 times faster pace than us. Totally love this guy.</p>

<p><b>Kint</b>: Truefax. A virus can’t survive without a host.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Kint</b>: My problem is that mohammedan promise 5 times a day that they will chop my head off, and that I have to pay for them to do this.</p>
<p><b>Kint</b>: Under normal circumstances people like that would be institutionalized, or better yet: deported. Because the kuffar (unbeliever) keeps paying to finance and maintain that fascist death-cult. Stop welfare checks and the problem is solved.</p>
<p><b>Kint</b>: Mohammedans who do not promise this are not good mohemmedans. The ‘existence’ of the so-called moderate muslim is irrelevant in this discussion. The question is: what side will the moderate muslim take when all hell breaks loose?</p>
<p><b>Kint</b>: Servititude is the worst. Breivik had the idea.</p>
<p><i>(ed. Breivik: Anders Behring Breivik <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Behring_Breivik"><i>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Behring_Breivik </i></a>)</i></p>
<p><b>Kint</b>: Mohammedans must practice Jihad in multiple ways. One of the techniques is to soothe the Kuffar to sleep by becoming ‘moderate’ or becoming your friend.</p>
<p><b>Everaert</b>: ‘I know friendly muslims, so there is no problem” , how cute.</p>
<p><b>Everaert</b>: I know how you will defend yourself. You will convert and collaborate and decapitate your mother and father because your moderate friends ask you nicely, just like in Syria.</p>
<p><b>Kint</b>: Collaborators of islamofascists will be the first targets. The fear has to spread to the other side. <a href="http://wiki.artikel20.com/">http://wiki.artikel20.com/</a></p>
<p><b>Kint</b>: Moderate muslims are a fiction created by Mohammed himself. They are the first wave of the Jihad. The anthrax in your carpet. This is where the discussion ends for me, you are in a deep comatose sleep. You won’t care if your head is removed. Insh’allah<i>! (ed. If god wills it!)</i></p>
<p><b>Everaert</b>: First point is to get rid of collaborators like you because we have the suspicion that you will pick their side. Just like the liberals have picked the side of the salafists in the middle-east, is there any reason to think why they won’t do that here?</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, there is no conspiracy of world domination by which ‘the Muslims’ are seeking power. Suggesting that people are automatically part of a plot just because of their religion or ethnic ancestry is racism. Also, posting references to kill-lists set up by racist groups does not qualify S4SS UGent as a safe space, which S4SS chapters should be.</p>
<p>We would like to take the opportunity to point out the continuous hostility towards Lode Cossaer, president of the Murray Rothbard Institute in Belgium. Throughout multiple conversations he has been ridiculed, verbally attacked and his life has been threatened. As S4SS members we feel deeply ashamed that personal attacks like this have happened in a chapter that we consider part of our network. If you’re reading this, Lode, we would like to apologize for not taking action on this at a sooner date. We empathize with the possible fear and under appreciation you feel because of S4SS UGent.</p>
<p>In response to the evidence provided above we have decided to dissociate ourselves with S4SS UGent as well as the members that most prominently voiced racist opinions and threats; Xavier Everaert, Brecht Arnaert, Olivier Janssens, Yannick Verdyck and Peter Kint. We suggest that the members of S4SS UGent who are not part of its racist core to start a different chapter, a safe and valued space, so that the idea of a stateless society may continue to grow in their university and their country.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to provide the opportunity for anyone else to sign this message with or without additional comments. As a closing statement let us reiterate our orginizational orientation:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The Students for a Stateless Society (S4SS) agree to the following four design principles:</em></p>
<p>1. “Student” does not mean subservient, submissive, or subordinate. A student is anyone who desires knowledge. A student can be either a teacher or a learner.</p>
<p>2. A stateless society is anarchy. Students have a right to contribute to and have a voice in the institutions they participate or constitute. As anarchists we will actively pursue and support hierarchy dissolving and mutual aid projects. Our time as students is not a time of passivity or mindless discipline, but a time for activity and creativity.</p>
<p>3. S4SS spaces are <a href="http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=496&amp;Itemid=177" target="_blank">safe</a> and <a href="http://c4ss.org/content/10691" target="_blank">valued</a> spaces. We are dedicated to not only identifying agents of aggression, but dissolving institutions of oppression.</p>
<p>4. All chapters of S4SS, to be considered active, must have at least one volunteer “point of contact” that can be reached by interested students or encouraging chapters. There is no limit to the number of S4SS chapters that can be on any one campus – swarm and take over!</p></blockquote>

<p>Olivier Janssens and his crew deserve to be exposed. They ought to be ashamed of themselves, both for what they said, and for stooping to use the <a href="http://radgeek.com/anticopyright/">state censorship of &#8220;Intellectual Property&#8221; law</a> to retaliate against those who exposed what they said. Please spread the word, and keep copies of this statement alive. We can&#8217;t give in to this kind of shameful legal intimidation and censorship.</p>

<div class="body">
<p class="first">When I read miserable, belligerently statist exercizes in punitive nationalism like <a href="http://personalliberty.com/2013/07/25/u-n-wants-you-to-call-illegal-immigrants-irregular-migrants/">this article</a> (content warning: violent xenophobia, ill-informed conservative legalism, ethnic slurs all over comments threads)<sup>[<a href="#immigration-freedom-personal-liberty-n-1" class="footnoted" id="to-immigration-freedom-personal-liberty-n-1">1</a>]</sup>  at a conservatarian website that calls itself the <q>Personal Liberty Digest,</q> I have to wonder what the words <q>personal liberty</q> mean to them, and what it is about <q>ever more statist policies spawned by globalists and liberals</q> [<i lang="la">sic</i>] that they actually object to. Apparently not much, since whatever <q>personal liberty</q> might have meant goes right into the garbage as soon as some political official says there oughta be a law, or some border cop says <q>Ihre Papiere, bitte.</q> And whatever it is in <q>statist policies</q> that they object to, it doesn&#8217;t, apparently, include the creation and maintenance of a massive police state required to corral millions of people, denying them the most basic freedoms of individual movement, demanding papers and national identification as a permission slip for working, or just for existing within those borders, and then &#8212; if any of the people fenced out by political force should try to evade these purely political restrictions, and assert their ability to peacefully live, work, and move onto property <em>whose owners have opened their doors and welcomed them to come onto</em> &#8212; sending border cops to hunt them down, break into their homes and workplaces with guns drawn, disappear them into hellhole <q>detention centers,</q> put them through <a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2008/01/27/someone_must/">a special due-process free deportation system</a>, and then force them out of their homes and jobs, all for the sake of nothing more than a government-demanded legal status. And when those who try to exercise their personal liberty to move, live and work are attacked and punished by the state, the overwhelming response is to spit in their face and sneer at them for breaking the law.</p>

<p>When I read page after page of conservative commenters, many of whom speak in praise of <q>small government</q> shouting <q>Illegal is illegal!</q> and comparing undocumented immigrants to trespassers<sup>[<a href="#immigration-freedom-personal-liberty-n-2" class="footnoted" id="to-immigration-freedom-personal-liberty-n-2">2</a>]</sup> and toss out sarcastic quips about how <a href="https://www.facebook.com/personalliberty/posts/585783278131583?comment_id=6217583&amp;offset=2500&amp;total_comments=2596"><q>we wouldn&#8217;t want them to feel bad about themselves for breaking the law</q></a>, then I wouldn&#8217;t dare speculate about what <q>we</q> would or wouldn&#8217;t want, but &#8212; speaking only for myself &#8212; I can only say that <em>of course</em> I don&#8217;t want anybody to feel bad for breaking border laws. Nobody should feel bad about that because there is nothing wrong with immigrants, either documented or undocumented, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with breaking unjust or tyrannical laws. <a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2006/04/09/freedom_movement/">Such laws <em>ought</em> to be broken;</a> they deserve no notice at all, except to ridicule them, and to trample them underfoot. Of course, perhaps you don&#8217;t agree that government border laws are unjust or tyrannical; but if not, <a href="http://radgeek.com/gt/2009/06/19/libertarians-against-property-rights/">you ought to give up pretending to care about <q>personal liberty</q> or <q>statism</q> at all</a>, and just take some pride in the bullying, authoritarian big-government nationalism that you evidently enjoy so much.</p>

<p>When I read commenters angrily insisting that <a href="https://www.facebook.com/personalliberty/posts/585783278131583?comment_id=6218238&amp;offset=1950&amp;total_comments=2596"><q>They invaded our country [<i lang="la">sic</i>] by the millions without a shot fired&#8230;</q></a> then I have to wonder what <q>invasion</q> even means to these people. <q>Without a shot fired!</q> Of course, this just means, <q>without force,</q> and hence, <q>without invading.</q> The country is where you are from, homie; it&#8217;s not &#8220;your&#8221; country in the sense of being your personal or exclusive property. Personal liberty means that you get to decide who comes onto your personal property, not that you get to command other people about where else they can go or where else is off limits; immigrants move from one place to another, and in the homes or the apartments they move into, in the places where they work, in the businesses they buy from, the landlord or the boss or the owner has explicitly chosen to open their doors and welcome them onto their property.</p>

<p>When people move from one place to another without using violence, without trespassing on others&#8217; land, and go to places where they&#8217;ve been invited to stay by mutual agreement with the property owner, that&#8217;s not an <q>invasion</q> in any meaningful sense of the word, any more than I <q>invaded</q> Michigan after I graduated from college, or any more than I <q>invade</q> the Waffle House when I go there to get some hash browns.</p>

<p>And when I read commenters trotting out the last-ditch talking point that <a href="https://www.facebook.com/personalliberty/posts/585783278131583?comment_id=6218480&amp;offset=1750&amp;total_comments=2596">undocumented immigrants ought to be punished and stigmatized because they <q>ILLEGALLY entered as opposed to the thousands who are STILL waiting in line to do it LEGALLY!!!!!!!&#8221;</q></a>, I don&#8217;t know what to make of the proposal that if thousands of people are jerked around over the course of more than a decade by cruel, capricious, obviously broken and massively unfair immigration requirements, then everybody else should be jerked around by the same cruel, capricious, obviously broken and massively unfair immigration quotas, no matter what, forever. You know, just to be fair. In reality, telling people to wait in the queue is, for the overwhelming majority of people in the world, telling them to wait forever, because <a href="http://reason.org/news/show/1003252.html">it is literally impossible for most people in the world to successfully gain residency status in the USA</a>.</p>

<p>Ben Bullard, the author of the original post, describes himself in his bio by saying that <q>Reconciling the concept of individual sovereignty with conscientious participation in the modern American political process is a continuing preoccupation</q> for him. Apparently the way that the two are reconciled is to toss out the concept of individual sovereignty in favor of a properly politic notion of national sovereignty, writing &#8212; as far as I can tell completely without irony &#8212; that <q>Immigration — legal or not — is an enormously difficult phenomenon to attempt to control. But if there’s national will to address it as a problem that threatens the foundations of a society, then a Nation has every right to do so.</q> I don&#8217;t know what creeps me out more &#8212; the capitalization of <q>a Nation</q> and the frankly collectivist attempt to speak of a unified subject with <q>rights</q> to command and exclude others; or the unvarnished fascist appeal to solve a systemic political problem by the application of <q>national will.</q></p>

<p>I do know that neither of these has anything at all to do with respecting the personal liberty of individuals.</p>

<p>You can believe in individual liberty, and freedom from arbitrary political restriction; or you can be a nationalist and a bordercrat. You cannot do both together. Choose.</p>

	<li class="footnote" id="immigration-freedom-personal-liberty-n-1"><strong><sup>[1]</sup></strong> It isn&#8217;t particularly relevant to what I actually aim to discuss today, but I&#8217;d be remiss if I didn&#8217;t at least mention that the entire article by Ben Bullard, and the comments that reads have thrown up in response to it, are the worst sorts of belligerently ill-informed ignorance and Right-wing border-baiting. Based on a <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/colinfreeman/100227751/should-illegal-immigrants-be-rebranded-as-irregular-immigrants-the-un-thinks-so/"><cite>Telegraph</cite> reporter&#8217;s bellyaching about a leaflet distributed by a UN refugee commissioner</a> in Malta, asking reporters to avoid the term <q>illegal</q> when describing <em>the specific conditions and activities of north African asylum-seekers and victims of human trafficking in Malta</em>. But Bullard would rather bait his border-policing readers&#8217; sensitivities about being asked to use phrases like <q>undocumented immigrants</q> instead of dehumanizing and politically-charged words like <q>illegals</q> or <q>aliens</q> when they talk about immigration politics &#8212; especially the political targeting of working-class immigrants from Mexico and Central America &#8212; to the United States; and so he portrays this very specific and limited request from one office concerning reporting on the specific situation in Malta as some kind of diktat handed down by <q>the U.N.</q> telling <q>us</q> how <q>we</q> ought to talk about immigration, and immigrants, in general, and then easily segues into a really pretty appalling bit of commentary on <q>the tide of humanity unleashed by the movements of desperate or displaced people.</q> Of course, virtually every single commenter on the post has something to say about Mexican immigration to the U.S., and virtually none have anything to say about the humanitarian situation in north Africa or in Malta. <a class="note-return" href="#to-immigration-freedom-personal-liberty-n-1">&#x21A9;</a></li>
