Surprise exam paradox?
But in fact the teacher doesn't need to be lying, if he has 100 school days and intends to give the exam at say, the 37 day, it will be a surprise, no student would have known that the exam would be at that day. His promise that it'll be a surprise only means he can't use the last few days.
