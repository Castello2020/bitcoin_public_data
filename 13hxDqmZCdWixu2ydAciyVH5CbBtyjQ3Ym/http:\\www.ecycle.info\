<P><DIV CLASS="header">WELCOME</DIV></P>

<P>e-Cycle is the Tri-Valley area's largest and oldest electronics recycling processing center.  We provide electronic waste (e-waste) recycling services for the people of the Tri-Valley area.  We cover Livermore, Dublin, Pleasanton, San Ramon, Danville, Blackhawk, Sunol, and beyond.</P>

<P>e-Cycle is not a business.  It is a private house existing as an eleemosynary ministry for the benefit of the people of the local community.  We are self-supporting.  It is a place where people are welcome to come and be a part of something special, while learning to become unto Liberty.</P>

<P>e-Cycle currently accepts all electronic waste at no cost to you.  Drop-offs are free.  We request a $35 donation for pick-up services.  The donation may be waived for large loads (<U>we reserve the right to define "large"</U>), or for schools, the elderly, or those physically challenged.  Please see our <A HREF="http://ecycle.info/items.php">item list</A> for an example of what we take for recycling.  <I>Please note: we do not do business with banks, therefore we request payment in cash, barter or trade.</I></P>

<P><DIV CLASS="header">LOCATION</DIV></P>

<P>e-Cycle is located at <A HREF="/directions.php">c/o 2082 Research Drive, in Livermore</A>.  We are over by the Lawrence Livermore Labs.</P>

<P><DIV CLASS="header">HOURS</DIV></P>

<P><!--<B>Our temporary winter hours are noon to 5:00pm.  We'll go back to our normal schedule after the solstice.</B>  -->We are generally available from noon to 6:00pm, Monday through Friday, and sometimes on Saturday.  If you don't find anyone here, feel free to leave your items by our door <U>with a note containing your name and phone number in case we need to ask you any questions</U>.  If you prefer you can <A HREF="/appointment.php">make an appointment</A> for a drop-off outside of our normal hours of availability or otherwise.</P>

<P><DIV CLASS="header">ACCEPTABLE STUFF</DIV></P>

<P>e-Cycle accepts any computer or consumer electronic item that runs on electricity or batteries, <U>working or not</U>.  Virtually 100% of all items that we receive are recycled and converted into new products.  Nothing goes to landfill.  In fact, we recover items unlawfully dumped at our local landfill and properly recycle them.  Check out our <A HREF="/items.php">items list</A> to get an idea of the kind of items we take for recycling.</P>

<P>Because re-use is the best way to recycle, e-Cycle refurbishes and provides computers and electronic goods at no cost to local schools and charities upon request.  We do this because we believe in supporting the people of our local community.</P>

<P><DIV CLASS="header">SCRAP METALS, PLASTIC, AND CAR BATTERIES</DIV></P>

<P>We take all scrap metals and electrical/industrial scrap, including plastic scrap.  We also take your old car and lead-acid batteries, as well as any <B>re-chargeable</B> batteries.  Sorry, due to <A HREF="http://assembly.ca.gov/assemblymembers">venal politicians</A>, we can no longer take disposable batteries.</P>

<P><DIV CLASS="header">UNACCEPTABLE STUFF</DIV></P>

<P><B>Under no circumstances do we ever take fluorescent bulbs, chemicals, paint, "disposable" batteries or other "hazardous" materials.</B>  Please take those items to the <A HREF="http://www.stopwaste.org/home/index.asp?page=579">Alameda County Household Hazardous Waste drop-off facility</A> in Livermore.  If they won't take it, bring your items to your <A HREF="http://assembly.ca.gov/assemblymembers">local representative's office</A> and I'm sure they'll be happy to dispose of them for you.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR=RED>We no longer take VHS tapes.</FONT></P>

<H3><A HREF='mailto:info@ecycle.info'>What is "Freedom"?</A></H3>
<P>Do you really know?  In a lawful sense?  Forgive me for being presumptuous, but I doubt it.  Would you like to learn?  Do you want to know what it really means to be "free"?

Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find.</P>

<H3><A HREF='http://ecycle.info/contact.php'>New Day Industrialists Unite!</A></H3>
<P>Are you a backyard metal caster?  A miner or refiner?  A melter or smelter?  Are you looking for a source of good aluminum, brass, bronze, copper, iron, or zinc?  If so, <A HREF="http://ecycle.info/contact.php">contact me!</A></P>

<H3>We Offer Free* Computers to Those Who Cannot Afford One</A></H3>
<P>e-Cycle abhors destroying perfectly good computers, yet we must do so because of the sheer volume of machines that we receive.  Not all are fixable or even worth refurbishing, but many just need some dusting, a RAM and hard drive upgrade, and a new operating system and they are good for another few years of service.

To increase the number of computers that we put back into use rather than render into raw materials, we are going to begin focusing more on providing computers to those who cannot afford one.

We will be giving "free" computers to anyone that can reasonably prove a need.  Yes, "free" is in quotes because there's always a catch ;)  But in this case, we mean free as in money.  You'll still pay, but it'll be in the form of a divine transformation.  Like Daniel <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aYl7N0JPWs">waxing on and waxing off</A>, in the fullness of time spent destroying computers, you will learn how to create them.  Just come in and we'll explain it to you.  Don't be afraid, it's work but it is work that pays.  And hey, you get a free computer!</P>

<B>A BRIEF CIVICS REVIEW FOR PUBLIC SERVANTS AND THE PEOPLE</B>
<HR>
<FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=-1>
"The sovereignty of the state resides in the people thereof..." (California Government Code 100(a))
<BR><BR>
"[T]he Legislature finds and declares that the public commissions, boards and councils and the other public agencies in this State exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business. It is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly.
   The people of this State do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created." (California Government Code 54950)
