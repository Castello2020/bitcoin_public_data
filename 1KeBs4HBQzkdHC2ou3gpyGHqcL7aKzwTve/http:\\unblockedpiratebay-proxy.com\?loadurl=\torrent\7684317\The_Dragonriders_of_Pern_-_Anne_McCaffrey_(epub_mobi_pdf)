===================================================

Finally together in one volume, the first three books 

in the world's most beloved science fiction series, 

THE DRAGONRIDERS OF PERN, by Anne McCaffrey, one of 

the great science fiction writers of all time: 

DRAGONFLIGHT, DRAGONQUEST, THE WHITE DRAGON. Those 

who know these extraordinary tales will be able to 

re-visit with Lessa, F'lar, Ruth, Lord Jaxon, and 

all the others. And for those just discovering this 

magical place, there are incomparable tales of danger, 

deceit, and daring, just waiting to be explored..

===================================================

Dragonflight:


HOW CAN ONE GIRL SAVE AN ENTIRE WORLD?

To the nobles who live in Benden Weyr, Lessa is nothing 

but a ragged kitchen girl. For most of her life she has 

survived by serving those who betrayed her father and 

took over his lands. Now the time has come for Lessa to 

shed her disguise—and take back her stolen birthright. 

But everything changes when she meets a queen dragon. 

The bond they share will be deep and last forever. It 

will protect them when, for the first time in centuries, 

Lessa’s world is threatened by Thread, an evil substance 

that falls like rain and destroys everything it touches. 

Dragons and their Riders once protected the planet from 

Thread, but there are very few of them left these days. 

Now brave Lessa must risk her life, and the life of her 

beloved dragon, to save her beautiful world. . . .

===================================================

Dragonquest:


On Pern, men breed and train great fire-breathing dragons 

to help them fight the deadly silver Threads that fall from 

the sky, destroying all life-forms, whenever the Red Star 

passes near.

===================================================

The White Dragon:


Jaxom, a rebellious young aristocrat, and Ruth, his white 

dragon, fly into another time to retrieve the queen's stolen 

egg, thereby averting a dragonrider war, and find their planet 

threatened once again by a Threadfall.
