BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S - 1961

  Winner of two OscarsÂ®, the romantic comedy that sparkles like diamonds! From the opening strains of Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer's haunting, OscarÂ®-winning song "Moon River," you'll once again be under the alluring spell of that madcap, carefree New York playgirl known as Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) in this 24-carat romantic comedy based of Truman Capote's best-selling novella. George Peppard is the struggling and "sponsored" young writer who finds himself swept into Holly's dizzying, delightfully unstructured lifestyle as she determinedly scours Manhattan for a suitable millionaire to marry. Patricia Neal, Buddy Ebsen, Martin Balsam and Mickey Rooney co-star; Mancini won an additional Academy AwardÂ® for his enthralling musical score.

  Starring: Audrey Hepburn, George Peppard, Martin Balsam, Buddy Epsen, Mickey Rooney.

  Directed by: Blake Edwards.

Excellent video and audio quality. The only slight problem is the aspect ratio is slightly off. As you can see in the description, it says the resolution is 720 x 448 which gives you an aspect ratio of 1.607 but really it's supposed to be 16:9
This can easily be corrected with VLC or Media Player Classic, of course.

or try kmp player. plays all formats and lets you resize to any aspect and lets you print screen, if you decide to. :)
