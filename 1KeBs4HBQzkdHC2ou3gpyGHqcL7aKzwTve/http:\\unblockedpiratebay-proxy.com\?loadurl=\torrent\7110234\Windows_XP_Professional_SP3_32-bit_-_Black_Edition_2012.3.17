Hey LuxLOL, is this version's mswsock.dll safe from being blocked by antivirus???? I had a pain with you January 2012 release, which forced me to use my other XP SP3, which so slow in booting.... I hope you pinpoint this annoyance.... I am using a cracked @v@st Internet Security, the one by Loco... if I remember it correctly, it's the one cracked til 2050.... I hope you can take a look with this mess and release something which will be AntiVirus safe.... tnx..... love the job.... except for the mswsock.dll problem
LuxLOL at 2012-03-23 19:08 CET:
@BiRate8
Can you access to the ISO file from your virtual machine? Looks like the ISO file has been unmounted by your MAC.
@RaionTek
The file "mswsock.dll2 is a system file you should use a better antivirus program that doesn't make false positive on update system files.
Use another antivirus like AVG it's also a lot better then the one you using now.

DO NOT go to the website posted in the information on the torrent, as AVG 2012 Business edition detected a virus called Facebook scam or something like that
LuxLOL at 2012-03-27 23:37 CET:
My AVG detected XzibiL3 as a noob. :-)

Hey LuxLOL, nice work, I love it, runs beautifully! Just a couple quick questions: 1) any way I can get the sleep and hibernate functions; and, 2) any way I can install Outlook Express? (the second questions may seem silly, but I still prefer it over all other email clients)
Cheers
LuxLOL at 2012-03-31 11:15 CET:
If you have no hibernate function then you need to install the mainboard driver, if you have a intel mainboard you find the driver here:
http://downloadcenter.intel.com
IntelÂ® Chipset Device Software (INF Update Utility)
And the free Outlook Express has been replaced by Microsoft by the free Windows Live Mail and the not free Microsoft Outlook 2010

cristi92 at 2012-04-01 10:54 CET:

Hi. I'm a total newbie at this, and I didn't get how to remove the drivers. Is it absolutely necessary? Or I can skip it? Thank you.
LuxLOL at 2012-04-02 05:43 CET:
Remove the drivers O_o? What do you want to do?
If you need help with reinstalling a Windows XP then open the read me file and read the section ->
(o) Infos on how to install Windows XP new:
Itoe at 2012-04-02 16:33 CET:
It's in the 'Help Guides' o_o '(o) Infos on how to Remove the included Drivers and include you own Drivers'
LuxLOL at 2012-04-03 03:20 CET:
Yes you need to do this if the included SATA driver wont work on your computer.
It is not hard simply do what is written in the Guide that's it.
Jared631 at 2012-04-03 21:14 CET:

@bornok
Go to the windows update center and install .NET Framework.
.NET Framework is not pre-installed in WinXP i did included a costume All-in-One NET Framework installer in previous BE versions but i removed it again because it could course some problems with new .NET Framework updates. And a user then would need to reinstall all .NET Framework versions.
So install .NET Framework over the windows update center is the way to do it to avoid any problems.
@chrisb92
Are you sure you have done a format of your hard disk drive before re-installing? other ways you did an upgrade and this you should not do.
@Gh055twr1t3r
Let's see how Win8 will be and then i will see if i do a Win7 or Win8 Black Edition. ;)
chrisb92 at 2012-04-11 18:24 CET:
no, i just downloaded this and put it on a cd and uploaded it, i dont know anyhitng about this its my first time trying, how do i format the hard drive? cheers scarejew_ at 2012-04-12 14:49 CET:
Thanks for upload , works perfect
LuxLOL at 2012-04-12 19:36 CET:
@chrisb92
Read the Read Me file and install VirtualBox to make a test installation.
LuxLOL at 2012-04-12 20:32 CET:
