Thanks tpb!
voltrix128 at 2012-06-18 22:07 CET:
mr_ahmad and tpb_4_ever are the same accounts?
tpb_4_ever at 2012-06-18 22:51 CET:
@voltrix128, mr_ahmad is a very good friend of mine and we both run tpb_4_ever.
bomofoo at 2012-06-18 23:01 CET:
Thank you!
Mercyflush64 at 2012-06-18 23:36 CET:
Does this require the previous upload and fix or is this meant to be a complete replacement for those two uploads?
tpb_4_ever at 2012-06-19 00:59 CET:
@Mercyflush64, You will need to download all three.
Mercyflush64 at 2012-06-19 02:40 CET:
I can't get this to extract without giving me errors
Mercyflush64 at 2012-06-19 03:23 CET:
I got it all fixed up. I had to download a 7z extractor. My winzip wasn't allowing the long path names. I also combined all three into a single zip file that made things a lot easier for me to store.
Thanks yet again for all of the hard work!
harz_er at 2012-06-19 06:48 CET:
Please upload the JHA Wagon Pack from AP for the London-Brighton Scenario.
Many thanks
laryk25 at 2012-06-20 13:03 CET:
Thanks for this guys! Much appreciated.
EAC350 at 2012-06-21 03:06 CET:
Will you upload the Service Pack 1 with a new skidrow included?
tpb_4_ever at 2012-06-21 13:14 CET:
Service pack 1 will not be uploaded because it doesn't really do anything except give you slightly improved sky and light effects, and increase lag.
lolxd17 at 2012-06-21 14:29 CET:
Thanks for this but still can't play the route :( This is what I get when I load a scenario, that's how it looks like:
http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/558693454484360204/100D43E8B8CB2A9665EEC1A345E262853640B3D7/
How do you have to install this and what am I doing wrong? Hope someone can help ;)
TheNemmy at 2012-06-22 12:51 CET:
any chance for service pack 1 update tottrent ? yet
TheNemmy at 2012-06-22 12:52 CET:
sorry didn't read your message about service pack 1, okay then we'll stick to this but won't it be hard to install updates in future if we don't have service pack 1 ?
Vlaxii_BG at 2012-06-24 06:28 CET:
@lolxd17 This DLC is not working on original version of TS 2012. I tried it on my own,and it doesn't work. You need to download SKIDROW version of TS 2012. Download this torrent: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6701439/Railworks_3_Train_Simulator_2012_Deluxe-SKIDROW
lolxd17 at 2012-06-25 12:57 CET:
All right, I see, thank you! :)
Promythyus at 2012-07-06 23:16 CET:
tpb_4_ever, any chance you could upload the missing assets for those of us who own Railworks on Steam (like lolxd17 and I)?
jason0484 at 2012-07-19 16:02 CET:
I am having some issues with finding the .rwp or .rwk file in the unzipped files. Tried using the search tool, but no file comes up. I have .xml, .bin, and other file types, but none that allow me to use RW package manager to install. Any help is appreciated. PM/E-mail me if possible!
weltall2 at 2012-08-28 02:12 CET:
Do we need Railworks 3 London to Brighton and 4CIG Sourthern to be installed before this? (The other torrent)
weltall2 at 2012-08-28 02:13 CET:
Never mind all I had to do was read better the comments XD
pirrik at 2012-10-20 10:53 CET:
