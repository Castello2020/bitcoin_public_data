The Virtual Bay
So, first we ditched the trackers.
We even got rid of the torrents.
Then we left the servers to enter the clouds.
Now, we're about to take the biggest step in our history. As piracy is about to change from sharing of files into the sharing of everything, we're planning our departure from this earthly form. Preparing our final ascension into the transcendence. The final conflux.
No, this is no longer science fiction. With the next version of this humble venture, you'll be able to see, hear and feel everything that is a part of The Pirate Bay. How you use it is up to you.
In cooperation with russian, israeli and japanese neuro scientists, we are developing a device that will embrace your entire mind. Using laser projections directly onto the retina it'll no longer be any resolution but 100%. The sound will be delivered in a range from 12Hz to 79kHz and will cancel all noise from the outside world.
Using a simple plugin into the the brain, you will no longer only be able to see and hear a movie, a game or whatever it is you want. You'll be able to live it. Play the main character. Tweak any story in any way you want.
Using your brain power and nervous system, we will be able to speed things up. Every part of The Pirate Bay will be stored within you and everyone else that dares to participate in this step into the future. The more we are, the faster everything will be. Our scientists calculate that if we become at least 1 333 337 nodes, everything will be shared instantaneously.
Forget about the outside world. This is the new.

PirateBrowser - No more censorship!
Do you know any people who can't access TPB or other torrents-sites because they are blocked? Recommend PirateBrowser to them. It's a simple one-click browser that circumvents censorship and blockades and makes the site instantly available and accessible. No bundled ad-ware, toolbars or other crap, just a Pre-configured Firefox browser.
A nice present to TPB and our users on this day, our 10yr birthday!

Happy X!
Oh look, we made it.
A decade of agression, repression and lulz.
We really didn't think we'd make it this far. Not because of cops, mafiaa or corrupt politicians. But because we thought that we'd eventually be to old for this shit.
But hey, running this ship makes us feel young. And we're gonna stay young til we die.
Thank you for everything. We would not be anything without you.
Love

Happy pirate independence day!
7 years ago, our ISP was raided and the pigs in blue took off with all our servers (and about 100 unrelated servers too). Did we bend over and ask for forgiveness? Hell no, within 3 days we were back. Here's how we put it back then:

here are some reasons why TPB is down sometimes - and how long it usually takes to fix: 
Tiamo gets *very* drunk and then something crashes: 4 days
Anakata gets a really bad cold and noone is around: 7 days
The US and Swedish gov. forces the police to steal our servers: 3 days
.. yawn.
Years come and go and now we're soon about to celebrate our 10th birthday. People have changed, the hardware sure has changed. We're now distributed around a vast number of cloud services and as you might have noticed, we're doing some domain hopping too. Our message is as it's always been: We decide if the site dies or not, no one else.
So today, 7 years after the raid, we celebrate our independence once again. Thank you for being a part of all this!

The Freedom Bay
You probably heard about our recent move to North Korea.
Many of you rightfully bashed us for siding with a dictatorship. We want you to know that we have listened to your critique.
So without further due, we hereby announce that we have moved our servers from the evil North Korea to the greatest fuckin nation in the entire world.
The United States of America, fuck yeah!
We have worked closely with the awesome american government to establish a strong military graded server park that will endure any nuclear attacks that Kim Jong Un and his evil allies will send at Us.
Along with this move to the greatest country in the universe, we will soon remove all torrents from North Korea, China, Iran, France and Islamistan. American torrents will be seeded with extra power, to ensure that you'll get your american dose extra fast.
America, fuck yeah!

PRESS RELEASE, NEW PROVIDER FOR TPB
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, 3 MARCH 102, 평양 (PYONGYANG).
The Pirate Bay has been hunted in many countries around the world. Not for illegal activities but being persecuted for beliefs of freedom of information. Today, a new chapter is written in the history of the movement, as well as the history of the internets.
A week ago we could reveal that The Pirate Bay was accessed via Norway and Catalonya. The move was to ensure that these countries and regions will get attention to the issues at hand. Today we can reveal that we have been invited by the leader of the republic of Korea, to fight our battles from their network.
This is truly an ironic situation. We have been fighting for a free world, and our opponents are mostly huge corporations from the United States of America, a place where freedom and freedom of speech is said to be held high. At the same time, companies from that country is chasing a competitor from other countries, bribing police and lawmakers, threatening political parties and physically hunting people from our crew. And to our help comes a government famous in our part of the world for locking people up for their thoughts and forbidding access to information.
We believe that being offered our virtual asylum in Korea is a first step of this country's changing view of access to information. It's a country opening up and one thing is sure, they do not care about threats like others do. In that way, TPB and Korea might have a special bond. We will do our best to influence the Korean leaders to also let their own population use our service, and to make sure that we can help improve the situation in any way we can. When someone is reaching out to make things better, it's also ones duty to grab their hand.

The Hydra Bay
A typical Whac-A-Mole machine consists of a large, waist-level cabinet with five holes in its top and a large, soft, black mallet. Each hole contains a single plastic mole and the machinery necessary to move it up and down. Once the game starts, the moles will begin to pop up from their holes at random. The object of the game is to force the individual moles back into their holes by hitting them directly on the head with the mallet, thereby adding to the player's score. The quicker this is done the higher the final score will be.
Current score: 0

Today, we filed a police report! :D

PRESS RELEASE FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

The Pirate Bay, the world’s largest site for cultural diversity and file sharing, 
has today (Monday 2013-02-18) reported a suspected crime to the Finnish police. 
The suspected criminals are the Finnish anti-piracy organization CIAPC 
(locally known as TTVK).

The reason is that CIAPC have copied files from which The Pirate Bay is built, 
to produce a fraudulent parody site.

While The Pirate Bay may have a positive view on copying, it will not stand by 
and watch copyright enforcing organizations disrespect copyright.

- It's funny that we have to teach the copyright lobby the meaning of the law. 
The fact that they wrote it doesn’t mean that they are above it, says Winston Bay.

CIAPC is not new to balancing on the edge of what's right and wrong. Last year, 
they initiated a police raid against a 9 year old girl and confiscated her 
Winnie the Pooh laptop.

- CIAPC is like an ugly high school bully without friends. It's time to take a stand. 
Cyber bullying is a serious matter to us all, Winston Bay continues.

The money that CIAPC might have to pay for this crime will however not end up at The Pirate Bay.

- Our hearts are with the victimized 9 year old Finnish girl. Any money that might come 
out of this will fund a new computer for the girl.


Facts:
The Pirate Bay is the world’s largest file sharing site.
It ranks as the world’s 58th largest site.
Since its launch in 2003, it has maintained a strong stance for internet freedom and 
against censorship.
It is run by dozens of individuals from all around the world, all with the same values 
of liberty, kopimi and progressiveness.
