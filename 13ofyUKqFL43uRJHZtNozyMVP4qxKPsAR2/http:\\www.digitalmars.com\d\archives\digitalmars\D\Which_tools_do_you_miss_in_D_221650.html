Which tools do you miss in the D language? it can be from any
language not from C or C++ only but from any language that you
have used and liked (might not liked but increased productivity
anyway)  A very common argument from peoples which do choose
other language than D is lack of your tools for D, even if they
want to get D they say can't switch. The most common tools which
they miss is debuggers/static analyzer/lint and so on. I think
that by sharing this list with community instead of just say it
like a criticizes is good because next time that some people say
that such a x tools isn't available you can say "No, there's a D
version for that". Also, totally new ideas are very welcome. If
you  have had a idea that for any reason you wouldn't implement
yourself, tell us too.

A quality GUI api with a decent GUI builder, something like the 
tools that come with Qt or that Window Builder for Java.

I find GTKD bindings are great but the GTK api itself, IMO, is 
less intuitive than Qt and GTK+Glade is a lot more work compared 
to other RAD tools in C++ or Java.

 I'm probably still a bit new to GTK, but when I started on Qt I
 found it easier to pick up.

 Ever since I used C++ Builder 4 and VCL I've been searching for a
 RAD GUI tool to match it; I haven't found one yet in C++ or Java.

 Some may shudder :D but I really liked the Borland tools and APIs
 back then.

 The Borland tools are great! That's the definition of an IDE.
 One program hosts the GUI builder, compiler, linker, debugger,
 editor with refactoring support, help system and package
 manager. And everything is actually integrated. A double-click
 on a button implements a click-handler, publishing a property
 of a component class and installing it as part of a package
 makes the property available in the GUI builder.
</pre><br>
Yep, that is one reason why I never liked C, having learned Turbo Pascal 
before.

Even on MS-DOS, Borland tooling was already great.

I miss check_expect from racket.

It is used for unit testing

check_expect(expression, result)
Will test if expression equals result
if it is not it print "Got expression but expected result" with file and
line information.

In D making unit tests is more tedious.
When I develop in D I typical start with.

writeln(expression)
writeln(result)

then when the code is working I replace it with
assert(expression==result)

Then if I do some refactoring which don't work I change again
writeln(expression)
writeln(result)

When it is working again
assert(expression==result)

This back and forth process in D is very tedious compared to Racket.

I think the should be a buildin function called test or something
for-filing the same role as check_expect in racket.

 The VC debugger is perfect for C/C++. I can't imagine how it would be
 improved. You can even edit your code and rebuild+relink while it's
 running to make minor runtime tweaks, and continue execution using the
 modified code.
</pre><br>
Cool. I was mostly thinking of go-to definition and autocomplete. The 
debugger in Xcode has a couple of nice features as well. It support a 
bunch of value formatters, which are also customizable. Like if a value 
is an image (I assume NSImage) it will actually render the image.

<pre class="PostingQuote">
 Go-to definition is not perfect, but it works 95% of the time.
 Auto-complete is very good in C/C++ but there are a few rough edges
 (possibly from complex preprocessor mess?),
</pre><br>
Xcode has some problems with the DMD source code. It seems quite random, 
when go-to definition fails or resolves to the wrong symbol. But most of 
the time it works. I would assume it works even better for Objective-C.

<pre class="PostingQuote">
 but C# is the clear benchmark for quality here.

Yeah, I remember Java in Eclipse. It's basically flawless.

<pre class="PostingQuote">
 D doesn't have a preprocessor or a horrible network of text include, it

</pre><br>
It does some other horrible things (from a source code analysis

<pre class="PostingQuote">
 I say 'that always works' above, implying that it sometimes works...
 which is true, but it's in the realm of 30% for me, which is unreliable
 enough to be very annoying. Any time 'class' appears in D, it all goes
 south under VisualD.

I have successfully produced working D compilers on win32, linux32, and 
linux64.

The generated d code preserves comments and is split up into multiple source 
files.

Of the original hundred-and-something patches in 
<a href="https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/dmd/pull/1980">https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/dmd/pull/1980</a> only 4 remain.

- Mangling of long/ulong 
(<a href="https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/dmd/pull/3158">https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/dmd/pull/3158</a>)
- Mangling of templated structs 
(<a href="https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/dmd/pull/3160">https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/dmd/pull/3160</a>)
- Clean up comments so the converter can do something sane with them 
(<a href="https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/dmd/pull/3123">https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/dmd/pull/3123</a>)
- Prevent g++ from emitting a vtable (will not be needed after the visitor 
refactoring)

On top of this, we need to refactor a bunch of virtual function hierarchies 
into visitor classes, unless we want cast.c/optimize.c/interpret.c to 
disappear and expression.d to become enormous (~25000 lines).

Having a working compiler with no outstanding patches on all supported 
platforms within the next month is quite possible, but it will depend on the 
rate at which the pulls get reviewed and merged.

I'm quite serious, this is a true realisation of an unconscious behaviour.

So true for me, too... to the point that I'm sometimes mentally blocked 
from performing some simple kind of refactoring or implementing a little 
feature in C++ because my brain simply refuses to do that in such a 
sub-optimal way :(

With declining frequency of programming in C++ this got much worse (I 
was using D for some hobby projects besides my mostly C++ day job for 
some years until I finally also used it for a project at work before I 
quit and now use D almost exclusively).

I had a similar experience a little over ten years back with C/C++ vs 
Java. I'd been a [relatively] happy C/C++ user, until I tried Java which 
destroyed my ability to tolerate C++'s import system and OOP. But Java 
(this was back around v1.2) came with plenty of its own pains, so I 
became extremely frustrated with programming in general.

Luckily D fixed all that for me (and to a lesser extent, C#, but that 
was before I got fed up with C#'s near-total lack of metaprogramming and 
some other things.) The debugger issues don't really bug [heh] me much 
because I've been in many situations in the past where I didn't have a 
debugger available, that I've become very comfortable with printf-style 
debugging, and usually even prefer it. (Not that a good debugger isn't a 
fantastic thing to have. It certainly is.)

I was also surprised to find an unused variable in my code a day

I'm personally of the opinion that if you're resorting to a 
debugger, that you really don't understand the code you're 
writing and how to debug it.
I've only really needed it in .net languages like c# and vb.net. 
Note my first language was vb.net 7 odd years ago. And I was 
doing c# up to a couple months ago in a course for my degree. I 
have only used one once or twice for e.g. assembly which I don't 
truly understand.

Its strange for me to see people use it so much. Because its such 
a different approach.

So for me auto completion and refactoring is most important. 
Mono-D is quite close for auto completion but it needs to get a 
lot more stable before I'll be happy.

I would also like to point out that for a long time we didn't 
really have a standard build manager. I was designing my own 
based upon Maven when dub came along.

So I'm happy with the way the ecosystem is going for this.

I disagree. Your claim it might be true when:

1. *you* recently wrote the code (last 18 months)
2. your the code base is small &lt; 50 000 LOC
3. You're single threaded.
4. You have no third-party dependencies/libraries.

But that has never been the case for me at work, only for 
personal stuff.

It is so much more efficient to track down problems with a good 
debugger. Good GDB support would be great ... I know it is being 
worked on so I'm happy :D

I don't understand the reliance on IDEs around here. Is there 
something lacking in computer science education at uni nowadays?

Package managers are nice, dub rocks!.

I'd much prefer to see D devs working on improving ARM support 
and improving the GC. Again this is happening already so I cannot 
way to see where it goes.

 In D making unit tests is more tedious.
 When I develop in D I typical start with.

 writeln(expression)
 writeln(result)

 then when the code is working I replace it with
 assert(expression==result)

 Then if I do some refactoring which don't work I change again
 writeln(expression)
 writeln(result)

 When it is working again
 assert(expression==result)

 This back and forth process in D is very tedious compared to 
 Racket.

 I think the should be a buildin function called test or 
 something
 for-filing the same role as check_expect in racket.

I can understand why you think about how I work, the way you do. 
Its like the difference between an introvert and an extravert. 
Its just so different way of working and thinking. Its 
unbelievable.

I have honestly never meet somebody who works even similar to me.

I find GtkD + Glade rather good actually. The problem is that this is
not really a good direction for cross platform working since Gtk isn't a
widely supported framework.

Qt5 on the other hand is making great strides (now that it isn't a
Nokia/Microsoft technology). Go now has QML support and I am finding
this a nice combination.

Having QML support in D would be a good thing.

I haven't had time to work on the various QtD repositories to see if Qt5
and QML are or can easily be supported.

 I made an interesting observation recently... D has kind of ruined my
 career ;)
 Before I started using D a lot, I found C/C++ quite okay as a language.
 But
 after extended time using D, I find C/C++ borderline intolerable, and
 don't
 enjoy writing it at all.
 But the tooling built around C/C++ is pretty good, and as such, I find the
 tooling while working in D borderline intolerable.

 So, before, I generally enjoyed my work, and felt generally productive.
 Now
 days, whenever I do any work in either language, I find one aspect or the
 other borderline intolerable, and I have trouble enjoying spending my time
 programming for long periods before getting frustrated and going and doing
 something else...

 I'm quite serious, this is a true realisation of an unconscious behaviour.
 D ruined C/C++ for me, but my expectations of C/C++'s tooling still
 remains
 a barrier to my enjoyment of writing D code all time time... I'm fucked!
</pre><br>
 I'm personally of the opinion that if you're resorting to a debugger, that
 you really don't understand the code you're writing and how to debug it.
</pre><br>
That's one key point of a good debugger; when you don't understand the code
you're debugging at all, but you need to fix it, like, 3 hours ago.

I've only really needed it in .net languages like c# and vb.net. Note my
<pre class="PostingQuote">
 first language was vb.net 7 odd years ago. And I was doing c# up to a
 couple months ago in a course for my degree. I have only used one once or
 twice for e.g. assembly which I don't truly understand.

 Its strange for me to see people use it so much. Because its such a
 different approach.
</pre><br>
I obviously use many other techniques when a debugger isn't available, but
I don't know any in which I feel similarly as productive as with good
runtime debug and analysis tools.

So for me auto completion and refactoring is most important. Mono-D is
<pre class="PostingQuote">
 quite close for auto completion but it needs to get a lot more stable
 before I'll be happy.

 I would also like to point out that for a long time we didn't really have
 a standard build manager. I was designing my own based upon Maven when dub
 came along.

 So I'm happy with the way the ecosystem is going for this.
</pre><br>
dub doesn't address my needs at all, but I've put crap loads of time/energy
into the D extension for premake, which works well (
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/premakeext">https://bitbucket.org/premakeext</a>), although for some reason has never
really gotten any attention from the D community :(

It generates cross-language build scripts (ie, C/C++ and D code all
together in the same project) for make and many popular IDE's.
I use it for large scale projects that involve C/C++ engine library, D
front end code, and other ancillary libraries bolted on the side.

 How well do these work for you in Visual Studio for C++? I'm finding cases
 in Xcode where it doesn't always work, especially in DMD.
</pre><br>

The VC debugger is perfect for C/C++. I can't imagine how it would be
improved. You can even edit your code and rebuild+relink while it's running
to make minor runtime tweaks, and continue execution using the modified
code.
Go-to definition is not perfect, but it works 95% of the time.
Auto-complete is very good in C/C++ but there are a few rough edges
(possibly from complex preprocessor mess?), but C# is the clear benchmark
for quality here.

D doesn't have a preprocessor or a horrible network of text include, it
should easily be able to match the C# experiences in general.

I say 'that always works' above, implying that it sometimes works... which
is true, but it's in the realm of 30% for me, which is unreliable enough to
be very annoying. Any time 'class' appears in D, it all goes south under
VisualD.

 all
 together in the same project) for make and many popular IDE's.
 I use it for large scale projects that involve C/C++ engine 
 library, D
 front end code, and other ancillary libraries bolted on the 
 side.
</pre><br>
I had a look at it and wow. If I had seen this a year ago I would 
have helped!
Here is my spec for my build system that I was designing back 
then[0].

That's cool, and I might make use of this when mixing D and

 I miss check_expect from racket.

 It is used for unit testing

 check_expect(expression, result)
 Will test if expression equals result
 if it is not it print "Got expression but expected result" with 
 file and
 line information.

 In D making unit tests is more tedious.
 When I develop in D I typical start with.

 writeln(expression)
 writeln(result)

 then when the code is working I replace it with
 assert(expression==result)

 Then if I do some refactoring which don't work I change again
 writeln(expression)
 writeln(result)

 When it is working again
 assert(expression==result)

 This back and forth process in D is very tedious compared to 
 Racket.

 I think the should be a buildin function called test or 
 something
 for-filing the same role as check_expect in racket.

 Which tools do you miss in the D language? it can be from any
 language not from C or C++ only but from any language that you
 have used and liked (might not liked but increased productivity

 other language than D is lack of your tools for D, even if they
 want to get D they say can't switch. The most common tools 
 which
 they miss is debuggers/static analyzer/lint and so on. I think
 that by sharing this list with community instead of just say it
 like a criticizes is good because next time that some people 
 say
 that such a x tools isn't available you can say "No, there's a 
 D
 version for that". Also, totally new ideas are very welcome. If

You can specify compiler options in a project-local file,

I should add, onthe plus side, premake is a single self-contained exe with
no runtime dependencies.
I typically build a binary, and just commit it to my project's bin/ folder,
and it just works, so others that want to build my projects don't have to
stuff around trying to build it.

No, it's much, much harder because of templates and string mixins.

Yeah, good point. I've heard murmurings of kitting DMD frontend out as a
lib for tooling being thrown around as long as I've been trolling here.
It must be really hard... or really really uninteresting :)

Agreed. D is a language that almost seems like it was designed to 
maximize the difficulty of creating a complete autocomplete 
engine. As soon as you hit a line that looks like

mixin (someRandomTemplate!(a, b, c)(d, e, f));

you need a full compiler front-end to provide complete 
autocomplete.

Better tooling is one of the things that makes me write less D Code.

Basically I want Semantic Analysis, code completion, refactoring tools
as good as what I get with KDevelop on Linux and Debugging support
that is better than that.
I really like rdmd but I still get occasional bugs with it.

Yes, that would be nice. They just creep in after a while. Common 
auto-completion (as in Textadept) is not perfect for things like

MyStruct!string("hello"); // It stops after MyStruct

However, given the lack of tools for D (in comparison to other 
languages) it is amazing how far you get in D with only a text 
editor and a Terminal application.

Haha yea and GDB is getting better slowly.
Although I just hit a time when I needed one. Wowzers trying to 
debug string mixins galore and having values escape gah. Been 
porting dvorm to 2.065 beta 2 and adding struct support. A few 
surprises there!
Although I some how doubt any debugger is up for this just yet.

Now if only I had a code beautifier.. damn. Now thats a 
reasonable tool that could be made easily. Oh well no point being 
lazy.

I'm probably still a bit new to GTK, but when I started on Qt I

Ever since I used C++ Builder 4 and VCL I've been searching for a

Some may shudder :D but I really liked the Borland tools and APIs

The Borland tools are great! That's the definition of an IDE.
One program hosts the GUI builder, compiler, linker, debugger,
editor with refactoring support, help system and package
manager. And everything is actually integrated. A double-click
on a button implements a click-handler, publishing a property
of a component class and installing it as part of a package
makes the property available in the GUI builder.

This is a recurring event in the Python world: Java/C++ 
programmers that try Python, find it much more productive and 
nice, and fall in love with it, and then can't use it because at 
work they are forced to use Java/C++ (or sometimes because Python 
is too much slow for their purposes). Sometimes the end result is 
that they are less happy than before in doing their daily work. 
So sometimes they end not suggesting Python to their colleagues 
to avoid them the same sad realization. I remember hearing 
something similar in Haskell community too, that is spoils you 
too much.

That. I really miss the Eclipse shortcut that makes all Java code 
indent the same way, swapping spaces for tabs or tabs for spaces, 
conforming to some max line length. It requires more than a tool 
though, someone needs to sit down and decide what things should 
look like by default. Even if you don't like Sun's style guide, 
it's still infinitely better than no guide and it can be modified 
quite easily.

I'm glad that at least D has a naming convention. I often wish 
for more though.

Uncrustify[1] (and a GUI front-end like UniversalIndentGUI[2]) works
great with D code, I use it all the time. Note that UniversalIndentGUI
typically comes with an outdated version of Uncrustify, so you could
simply swap its version of the uncrustify binary with a new version to
support the latest C++/D syntax.

Having a debugger to make sense of core files is pretty handy.
Also, have you ever tried to sell a language to a team with the
caveat that it doesn't have a working debugger of any sort?
Finally, it's often not possible to re-run an app with additional
logging to figure out a problem.  And if you didn't think to log
something that turns out to be important for diagnosing some bug,
being able to attach to a running process with a debugger is
pretty handy.  Or dtrace or something.  I've been doing printf

 I do the same. There's a enhancement request in bugzilla for having

assertPred took care of this - e.g. assertPred!"=="(lhs, rhs, expected) or 
assertPred!"&lt;"(lhs, rhs, expected) - but it failed the review process with the 
consensus that assert should be changed to do this for you. However, as I 
understand it, it was ultimately decided by those who looked at implementing 
it that that wasn't going to work. std.datetime still uses a stripped-down 
version of it internally as _assertPred, but I'm fairly certain that it's 
introduced too much template bloat as a result and that it's the main cause 
for the large amount of memory that std.datetime requires when compiling its 
unit tests. So, while I like the idea of a templated function which prints out 
what the expected result and actual result on a test failure rather than just 
that the test failed, at this point, I'm not at all certain that it's worth 
the overhead. And if assert can't reasonably be made to take of it itself, a 
templated function like assertPred would pretty much be the way that you'd 
have to go.

About the only thing that I can think of would be a proper debugger that 
actually understood D. gdb kind of works but not all that well. Of course, gdb 
doesn't even properly understand C++, so in that respect, I'm not sure that 
we're all that much worse of than C++ is. But a proper debugger that actually 
understood D arrays and strings and whatnot would be fantastic. Most of the 
other features that folks like to list (like autocompletion, jump to 
definition, or many IDE-specific tools) are exactly the sort of thing that I 
don't even have or bother with in C++ (often because vim can't do them well), 
so while they might be nice to have, I generally don't even think about them 
much.

  My list is the same as Manu.

  For me tools are an intrinsic part of the language, D tools
are so bad that I prefer to write CPP to avoid the anger D IDE's 
instill in me

A debugger integrated into an IDE is the most important feature
I'm missing. Debugging code in C# where I can step into easily,
see all the code I'm in, see all the variables, all graphically,
is extremely useful. In D I have to resort to printf except for
using gdb/lldb to look at the stack-trace in a segfault.

Mono-D works nicely for coding, but I have not had any luck
getting debugging working in it in OSX (but I use OSX Mavericks
which replaces things like gcc with aliases to clang and includes
only lldb by default).
