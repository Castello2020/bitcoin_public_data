Bytehost is great for a monthly subscription. Free hosting, however, I highly super duper recommend ulmb.com. Incredible specs for free.

Your's? Near 1mb per month. HTS I would guess in the GB/month range (not including devs uploading files) and Google in the TB range. That's just off the top of my head.

Did he read the title of the thread? Guess not.And I am still preaching to go with frihost. They "say" you have to be active on their forums, but they could care less.
I study Gotafu.

For example I made a website as a joke for a friend and it was working in 1 hour however I made one the day after and it has been 5 hours with nothing.

I use not that one because that link contained a parked site, I assume you meant http://www.000webhost.comThey have a free plan.Show no adds.Let you use FTP and a FILE UPLOADER.Have no Upload size limits.And have high limits for their Bandwidth and Storage on free accounts (unlimited on paid accounts)The site in my sig is hosted with them!
