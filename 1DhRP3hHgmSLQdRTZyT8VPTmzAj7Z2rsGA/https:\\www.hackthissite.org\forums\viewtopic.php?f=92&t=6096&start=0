That there is a b0rked image.Though nice work. Try to put what you consider your best at the beginning if you are presenting your portfolio.(Which IMHO would be 2 and 4)Keep up the good work.

I like number four. The pic might be to big to upload as an avatar. If I remember they need to be really tiny

I'm really digging some of them, others look a bit amateurish, but all of them are above what I could achieve either way.Overall, Good job! It's not who votes that counts, it's who counts the votesinsomaniacal.blog.com
