Can you return them? I would suggest trying that.

That sounds too advanced for the OP. I suggest a beginning program book. Again, "Learning Perl" is the best computer related book I have read. Excellently written. Not too fast, not too slow. Just like Mary Poppins, practically perfect in every way.
