Okay, I'm trying to implement a homebrew RFID Tracking Network for about three dozen items, it just needs to tell me how close I am to said about.What hardware/software would I need.

Okay, I was think more along the lines of a barnes and noble system, ie a little white tag that be stuck on something instead of a rather bulky box.

Maybe passive hardwired tags are better, cheaper, and more compact, the only drawback is its range. :/

I don't think they have any range or capacity to transmit data on their own.

Passive doesn't need power or any advance stuff though a charge must be induced and the range is limited.(Think about the bus pass or access cards) The other has more range, though limited by the battery/cell that could die when you need it most.

Okay is there a resource or blue print out there for instructions, Or would I have to do it from the ground up?

A solid understanding of electronics, hardware and software is going to be needed. The components may be fairly simple, but their implementation is anything but (if you have no knowledge to begin with). Pick up a book by Forrest M. Mims on basic electronics. His books are straight-forward and read more like notes than a technical manual. There are drawings and plain-English explanations of everything from electron flow to building logic gates.
Assume that everything I say is or could be a lie.1UHQ15HqBRZFykqx7mKHpYroxanLjJcUk
