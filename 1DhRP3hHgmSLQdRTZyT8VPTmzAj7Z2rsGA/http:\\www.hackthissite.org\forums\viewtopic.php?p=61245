Hi, I am trying to learn Python as my first programming language and I am wondering if there are any good video tutorial websites to look at.

http://docs.python.org/tutorial/ << The canonical source for learning python. I learned python there and unless you have a really good ass book, you probably shouldn't learn python anywhere else.

I've been writing Python for 2-3 years now, and that place is an orgasm for learning.
