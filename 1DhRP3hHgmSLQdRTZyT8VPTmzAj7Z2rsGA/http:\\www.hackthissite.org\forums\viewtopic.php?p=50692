Good web hosts (preferably free)? Post a reply

I'd like recommendations for good hosts that will give me complete control over the design of my site (problem with Free Webs, Yola, Wix, etc. is that you have to use their site-builders). It would also be nice if they're free or at least low-cost. I just want to make a site so I can keep practicing my HTML skills so I don't get rusty.

Set up an account at www.bshellz.net. You'll be able to manually upload html files.110mb.com let's you use ftp for directly uploading files as well.

bshellz seems like kind of a pain. I can't get onto their IRC channel, plus their method of registering and "keeping" your username also seems unnecessarily hard. Is 110MB just as good?

I used 110mb for a dump page before, and they seemed fairly reasonable. They add some scripts to your pages that display their ads, but in my brief experience it was good.http://www.solidwebhost.com also allows for FTP access, and they allow you to create 2 mysql databases as well, something which 110mb makes you pay for I think.

Never heard of them before, to be honest.

fabianhjr wrote:No one had ever heard of http://heliohost.org/? 0_oThat actually looks pretty good. My question though is what the maximum individual file size limit it for that host?For the one I suggested it is 12MB I think. But you get 5500 MB of space, and 200GB bandwidth. As compared to that one which you said, you get 250MB space and 2500 GB bandwidth. The actual space though isn't so much a concern though, since I do most of the large file hosting from my own PC when friends need files.
