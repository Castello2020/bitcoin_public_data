        was largely ridiculed for making these declarations, but today, large
        doses of Vitamin C are used by many practitioners for cancer patients
        in nutritional therapies, who believe Pauling was right and that vitamin
        C is indispensable to the body in its fight to regain health from <a href="../conditions/detoxification-to-fight-cancer.htm">cancer</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Linus
        Pauling wrote the book, &quot;How to Live Longer and Feel Better&quot;.
        (He also wrote &quot;Vitamin C and the Common Cold&quot;) . I had heard
        of Linus Pauling and since living longer and feeling better sounded desirable,
        I bought the book. I was captivated. Pauling presents the case for Vitamin
        C supplementation so well and backs it up with so much evidence that this
        is a book I highly recommend. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">To find
        out what Linus Pauling, 2-time Nobel Prize laureate, thought about vitamin
        C supplementation, let's look at an excerpt from an interview with Linus
        Pauling and Tony Edwards for QED BBC Television.</font></p>
      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Q: What do
      you feel about the major criticism that anything over 100mg of vitamin C
      is a waste of money and goes down the drain because it's eliminated by the
      body? </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">A: The
        evidence shows that this is just not true. I myself, 20 years ago or more,
        read this statement, probably made by Fred Stare, professor then at Harvard
        School of Public Health, and I decided to check. I was taking 10 grams
        per day of vitamin C. I collected my urine for 24 hours and analyzed it
        myself for the vitamin C content. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Instead
        of nearly 10,000mg being eliminated in the urine, 9850mg, I found only
        1,500mg, 15% of the dose that I was taking during this trial, so the statement
        just is not true. Of course, some of the ingested ascorbate remains in
        the intestinal contents and doesn't get into the blood stream. It may
        be as much as 1/3. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Some evidence
        indicates that perhaps as much as 1/3 remains in the intestinal contents.
        Well, this does good, protecting the lower bowel against cancer by destroying
        carcinogens that are present in the fecal material and also does good
        because of the laxative effect of bringing water into the bowel so that
        the volume of the waste material is larger. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">There's
        also a smaller surface area which helps speed up the process of elimination
        of this material. The rest of it, 2/3 perhaps 6.5 grams when I was taking
        10 grams a day, gets into the blood stream but only 1.5 grams is eliminated
        in the urine. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">So we can
        ask what happens to the other 5 grams? The answer I'm sure, in fact we
        have direct experimental evidence for it, is that vitamin C is rapidly
        converted into other substances, oxidation products and these other substances,
        these oxidation products have been shown to have greater value against
        <a href="../conditions/detoxification-to-fight-cancer.htm">cancer</a>
        than vitamin C itself. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">So if you
        take large doses of vitamin C you produce large amounts of these other
        substances, the value of which is still under investigation. We have been
        studying it for fifteen years.</font></p>
      <p></p>
      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Q: How do
      you decide how much vitamin C is right for you and, if you take 3 grams
      should it be split throughout the day? </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">In my opinion
        adults should be taking at least 2 grams a day. There is much evidence
        about increased health with 2 grams a day, and of course even more with
        4 or 6 grams a day. Even an extra 60mg had been shown to add value in
        cutting down the death rate from <a href="../conditions/heart-disease.htm">heart
        disease</a>, <a href="../conditions/detoxification-to-fight-cancer.htm">cancer</a>
        and other diseases. Now my feeling is as people grow older they ought
        to be increasing their vitamin C and perhaps they should follow the policy
        that I have followed of increasing the intake. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">It can
        be either one chunk, one dose in the morning, or even better 3 doses throughout
        the day, increasing the intake until a laxative effect is observed, speeding
        up the rate of elimination of waste material from the bowel. So my suggestion
        is every person who wants to have the best of health should increase the
        intake of vitamin C to somewhat less than the amount that causes significant
        looseness of the bowel.</font></p>

        a recently published long-term study (5). &quot;To my knowledge, this
        is the first prospective study to make the correlation between vitamin
        C in the bloodstream and incidence of stroke,&quot; says author Tetsuji
        Yokoyama, M.D., research associate in epidemiology at the Medical Research
        Institute of Tokyo Medical and Dental University. The risk of stroke was
        inversely related to vitamin C in the bloodstream in this study. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">It is important
        to realize that ideally we should get our vitamin C from the foods we
        eat. Using supplements as a substitute for whole foods and expect to get
        healthy is delusional. You must consume whole unprocessed foods to maximize
        your health. Good sources of vitamin C are green leafy vegetables, citrus
        fruits, tomatoes, berries, guavas, melons, papayas, etc.</font> </p>
      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Can vitamin
        C help to prevent or treat cancer?</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Over the
        years, many studies have found that vitamin C is an effective anti-cancer
        agent. Vitamin C works in the following ways to help the body fight <a href="../conditions/detoxification-to-fight-cancer.htm">cancer</a>
        cells:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Studies
        suggest that vitamin C's antioxidant mechanisms may help to prevent cancer
        in several ways. Vitamin C combats the peroxidation of lipids, for example,
        which has been linked to degeneration and the aging process. One study
        of elderly people found that 400 mg of vitamin C per day (for a one-year
        period) reduced serum lipid peroxide levels. Vitamin C can also work inside
        the cells to protect the DNA from the damage caused by <a href="../conditions/free-radicals.htm">free
        radicals</a>. In several studies, report the researchers Gaby and Singh,
        vitamin C reduced the level of potentially destructive genetic alterations
        or chromosome aberrations.(6)</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Many of
        the pollutants which now pervade our environment can cause carcinogenic,
        toxic or mutagenic effects. Vitamin C may be able to combat these harmful
        effects, in part by stimulating detoxifying enzymes in the liver. In another
        study, vitamin C was shown to block the formation of fecal mutagens.(7)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Finally,
        vitamin C can reduce the development of nitrosamines from nitrates, chemicals
        which are commonly used in processed foods. Once formed, nitrosamine can
        become carcinogens. In several human studies(8), in which the subjects
        consumed a nitrosamine precursor, the urinary levels of nitrosamines were
        significantly reduced by vitamin C. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">As far
        back as the 1940s, researchers began to note a connection between the
        incidence of <a href="../conditions/detoxification-to-fight-cancer.htm">cancer</a>
        and low blood levels in the body or a dietary deficiency of vitamin C.
        Studies conducted in the past 10 years have confirmed that link. According
        to 2 studies from the early 1980s, 2 to 5 grams of vitamin C per day can
        correct these low serum levels and, in some patients, improve the defenses
        put up by the <a href="../conditions/colostrum.htm">immune system</a>.(9)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Based on
        numerous studies, it seems clear that there is a strong relationship between
        a person's vitamin C intake and cancer risk. In 1991, the American Journal
        of Clinical Nutrition conducted a comprehensive analysis of some 45 studies
        on vitamin C's protective effects against various types of cancer. Of
        these, 32 studies reported a significant link between vitamin C intake
        and the incidence of cancer. In fact, a high intake of vitamin C offered
        twice the protection of a low intake. Many of these studies defined a
        &quot;high intake&quot; as a daily dosage of 160 mg or more per day; a
        &quot;low intake&quot; generally was less than 70 mg.(10)</font></p>

        a lot of time researching the best prices for supplements on the internet.
        In my opinion the best prices for vitamin C on the internet are <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=2sO3HF3YmRA&offerid=137425.28627&type=2&subid=0">here</a><img alt="icon" width="1" height="1" src="http://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=2sO3HF3YmRA&bids=20052.95459605&type=10&subid=">.
        I also like Puritan Pride's special <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=2sO3HF3YmRA&offerid=116038.3160&type=2&subid=0" target="_blank">&quot;Buy

        properties, it is best to take vitamin C with the other antioxidants,
        as there is strong evidence of synergy between various antioxidants. Vitamin
        C can be taken in many different forms, which will be the subject of another
        article. Vitamin C in powder and crystals form, Ester C, buffered vitamin
        C, vitamin C in chewable form, in liquid form, etc. The important thing
        is to make sure vitamin C is part of your diet.</font></p>
