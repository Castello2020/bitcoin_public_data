      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The control
        of plaque is the key to maintaining healthy gums</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">GINGIVITIS
        is the inflammation of the gums around the teeth due to improper cleaning
        of the teeth. Although systemic factors and general health can modify
        the tissue reactions to local irritants, gingivitis at all ages is caused
        primarily by local irritants. Gingivitis is nearly always reversible.
        The usual signs of gingivitis are gums which are swollen and bleed during
        brushing. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Failure
        to rinse the mouth after meals and brush the teeth results in a thin layer
        of food and bacteria covering the tooth surface. This bacterium is the
        chief culprit behind the inflammation known as gingivitis. The gums during
        this stage of infection become soft, spongy and swollen.</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Is bleeding
        of the gum a serious problem?</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Yes, bleeding
        gums is a serious problem. It is either indicating the beginning of the
        destructive process involving the supporting tissue around the tooth or
        some serious underlying systemic problems. Gum disease is caused by plaque,
        a sticky film of bacteria that constantly forms on the teeth. These bacteria
        create toxins that damage the gums. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The adage
        &#147;To keep your teeth, take care of your gums.&#148; has a basis in
        reality. </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Gingivitis
        is one of the most common forms of gum (periodontal) disease. Gingivitis
        affects the tissues that surround and support your teeth. The bacteria
        which causes gingivitis, can turn into tartar buildup, irritate your gums
        and lead to bleeding. Left unchecked, gingivitis can lead to a more serious
        form of gum disease called periodontitis. This long-term infection can
        eventually cause loss of your teeth. Gum disease - not decay - is the
        #1 cause of tooth loss. Gum disease generally doesn&#146;t hurt. You may
        have it for years before you feel discomfort. Don&#146;t wait until you
        feel the pain.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">When plaque
        has hardened on your teeth, it will be necessary for a dental hygienist
        or a dentist to scrape this material off your teeth. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Good oral
      hygiene is the best way to prevent bleeding gums, gingivitis and periodontitis.

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Recent
        research in Europe and the U.S. have proven a link between an increase
        in oral sulfur compounds in the mouth, which then initiate gum disease
        and bleeding gums (which are truly open wounds in your mouth). These open
        bleeding sites allow other dangerous toxins to enter the body's bloodstream.
        And as we will examine later in this page, this infiltration of the bloodstream
        can eventually to systemic problems such as <a href="heart-disease.htm">heart
        disease</a>, <a href="stroke-prevention.htm">strokes</a>, and pneumonia.
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Anaerobic
        bacteria produce sulfur compounds. These sulfur compounds allow toxins
        to enter your blood stream through swollen gums.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">These anaerobic
        bacteria have the ability to extract sulfur compounds from proteins which
        are produced when your gums are swollen and bleeding. Some of these sulfur
        compounds are classified as &quot;Thiols&quot;. These dangerous sulfur
        compounds have recently been found to allow other bacteria &#150; and
        the toxins they produce &#150; to infiltrate below the gumline. It is
        argued that these bacterial toxins may get into your bloodstream and travel
        throughout your body, most significantly to your brain - increasing the
        risk for <a href="stroke-prevention.htm">strokes</a>, or to the heart
        - increasing the risk for heart attacks!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Professors
        Robin Seymour and James Steele of the University of Newcastle Dental School
        in England say that you are less likely to get <a href="heart-disease.htm">coronary
        heart disease</a> if you have healthy gums. In fact, these 2 specialists
        reviewed 10 studies dating back to 1965. Two of the larger studies, done
        here in the U.S., showed striking evidence proving this point. Their analysis
        was reported to the British Dental Journal. Their article stated that
        periodontal disease (gum disease) may be a factor as significant as smoking
        and high cholesterol when it comes to heart disease!</font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Professors
        Robin Seymour and James Steele suggested that periodontal disease should
        be looked at as a chronic infection. They stated that there is a lot of
        evidence now indicating that chronic infections may be an important trigger
        for &quot;atheroma&quot; formation (degenerative changes in the arteries).
        The link between <a href="heart-disease.htm">heart disease</a> and <a href="stroke-prevention.htm">strokes</a>
        and bleeding gums appears most obvious in men aged 40-50 years old.</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">More research
        about gum disease - this time from the U.S.</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">According
        to a recent study at the University of Minnesota, 2 kinds of bacteria
        breeding in dental plaque around inflamed gums can bring about &quot;blood
        clumping&quot;. This is technically speaking the first step towards forming
        a clot that can trigger a heart attack.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">At the
        university, experiments on rabbits found that these bacteria, which originate
        in the mouth, also caused abnormalities in the heart. Again, it appears
        that we should add &quot;periodontal disease&quot; to the standard risk
        factors like high cholesterol, lack of exercise, poor diet, and being
        overweight.</font></p>
      <p></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Research
        was done in Finland which presented evidence in 1989 that even when conventional
        risk factors for <a href="stroke-prevention.htm">strokes</a> and <a href="heart-disease.htm">heart
        attacks</a> were taken into account, dental infections were associated
        with strokes (1) and heart attacks (2). Another study examining 9,760
        men during a period spanning 1971-1987, confirmed the conclusions of the
        Finnish study which linked coronary artery disease and gum disease (3).
        The most noteworthy finding was that gum disease and poor oral hygiene
        are stronger indicators of risk of total mortality than were coronary
        artery disease. Other research has shown a strong association between
        bone loss from gum disease and both fatal coronary heart disease and strokes
        (4). </font></p>

            Studies show that the oral bacteria, &quot;Streptococcus sanguis&quot;

            first stage in the development of a blood clot -- the cause of a heart
            attack. The periodontal infection would reduce the health of the lining
            of the gum tissues which, in turn, can allow bacteria from the mouth

      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">What about
        mouth rinses for gum disease?</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">For reducing
        plaque and gingivitis, mouthrinses containing chlorhexidine (such as &quot;Peridex&quot;
        and &quot;Perioguard&quot;) appear to be the most effective. Dr. Sebastian
        Ciancio, chairman of the Department of Periodontics at SUNY Dental School
        in Buffalo, did a survey of studies involving anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis
        products. In 3 long-term studies of chlorhexidine, Dr. Ciancio found that
        patients using this product showed a reduction in plaque by 55% and a
        reduction in gingivitis by 45%. Chlorhexidine appears to kill bacteria
        by altering the permeability of the cell membrane of the bacteria. This
        alteration causes the bacterial cell to leak, which eventually kills the
        bacteria. Chlorhexidine mouthrinses are available by prescription only.
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">However
        there are drawbacks to the use of chlorhexidine:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Chlorhexidine
        may stain teeth. A &quot;change in taste&quot; is one of the side effects

        the public is often unaware of the ingredients in products they use on
        a daily basis. For instance, many toothpastes contains an ingredient which
        has been proven to dry out the mouth, and is now scientifically linked
        to <a href="canker-sores.htm">canker sores</a>. It's called &quot;Sodium Lauryl Sulfate&quot; (SLS),
        and is put into toothpaste (and some mouthwashes) in order to create foaming!
        &quot;Sodium Lauryl Sulfate&quot; does nothing significant from an oral

        Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) acts just like a detergent. It is used in the laboratory
        as a membrane de-stabilizer and solubilizer of proteins and lipids. Sodium
        Lauryl Sulfate is used in toothpaste to emulsify (mix) oil and water-based
        ingredients together. In your toothpaste Sodium Lauryl Sulfate creates
        the foam you get while brushing. Because it is classified as a soap, you

        -1!). Historically, scientific papers refer to many cases of accidental
        Sodium Chlorate Poisoning. Consequently, oral products containing chlorates
