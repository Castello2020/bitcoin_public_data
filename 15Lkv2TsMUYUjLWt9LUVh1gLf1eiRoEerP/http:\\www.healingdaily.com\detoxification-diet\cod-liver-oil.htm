        looking at the dietary ratio of <a href="healing-fats.htm">omega-6 to
        omega-3 fatty acids</a> suggest that in early human history the ratio
        was about 1:1, however the typical American's ratio is around 20:1 to
        50:1! Generally our diet contains far too much omega 6 fats. For most
        of us, this means greatly reducing the omega-6 fatty acids we consume
        and increasing the amount of omega-3 fatty acids. </font></p>

        or partially hydrogenated fats, no <a href="healing-fats.htm">margarine</a>,
        no shortening, no vegetable oil. These oils are full of omega-6 fats and
        will only worsen your omega 6/omega 3 ratio. You want to emphasize high

        need to be concerned with the quantity of fat in your diet, rather you
        need to be concerned with the TYPE - and saturated fat is not the enemy.
        Saturated fats, found mostly in animal products like butter, cheese and
        fatty meats, are not as dangerous as you may believe. Saturated fats offer
        a number of health benefits and play many important roles in the body.
        Some vegetable oils (coconut and palm) also contain saturated fat. <a href="coconut-oil.htm">Coconut
        oil</a> is a particularly healthy choice.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Trans-fatty
        acids, formed through a process called &quot;hydrogenation&quot;, are
        found in processed foods and fried foods. Trans-fatty acids are much worse
        for you than saturated fats. Not only can they raise LDL (bad) cholesterol
        levels and lower HDL (good) cholesterol, but they have also been linked
        to <a href="../conditions/heart-disease.htm">heart disease</a>.</font></p>

        2 fatty acids, EPA and DHA which are essential in preventing and fighting
        both physical and mental illness - can be found only in fish. Unfortunately,
        however, I would advise you against consuming a lot of fish, whether naturally-caught
        or farm-raised, because fish of all varieties from any waters are now

        difference between fish oil and cod liver oil is that cod liver oil is
        high in vitamin D. The cod liver oil has the advantage of providing vitamin
        D, which is necessary for most of us in the United States in the cold
        months of winter, when we don't get very much sun exposure on our skin
        in order to make vitamin D.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Many people
        get confused about the difference between fish oil liquid and cod liver
        oil. You can consider cod liver oil as fish oil+. The 2 are the same except
        that cod liver oil contains natural vitamin D and A. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">I would
        recommend limiting your fish consumption and I suggest you consider replacing
        it with cod liver oil. This is NOT the cod liver oil which typically comes
        to mind, from many decades ago. </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Most
        cod liver oil from the past was rancid and tasted terrible because it
        was improperly processed. It is now easy to find flavored cod liver oil
        and fish oil which have a much more pleasant taste.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">An additional
        way to increase omega 3 fats in your diet would be to use freshly ground
        <a href="flaxseed.htm">flax seeds</a> (just use an inexpensive coffee

        patients had already tried <a href="../conditions/pharmaceutical-companies.htm">prescription
        drugs</a> before enrolling in the study, including selective serotonin
        reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as Zoloft, Paxil and Prozac, or drugs
        from an older family of drugs called tricyclic antidepressants, all of
        which are considered standard treatments for depression.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Previous
        studies have suggested that the balance of omega-3 fatty acids in the
        brain may be skewed in people with depression, and earlier studies have
        shown that cod liver oil and fish oil supplements can help alleviate the
        symptoms of depression and schizophrenia.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">If you
        suffer from depression, I would also recommend you look into <a href="../conditions/sam-e-1.htm">SAM-E</a>
        which has been used for 20 years in Europe to treat depression and is
        very effective.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">If
              the relationship between depression and omega 3 fatty acid interests
              you, I would highly recommend Dr. Stoll's book &quot;The Omega-3
              Connection&quot;. Dr. Stoll is a Harvard psychiatrist who has done
              a good job of compiling the evidence supporting the use of cod liver
              oil and fish oil to treat depression. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">If
              you take your omega 3 in liquid form, as opposed to capsules, the
              dose for both the cod liver oil or fish oil liquid should be about
              1-2 teaspoons per day. This is a good initial dose for most people
              but if you notice any belching, it is likely that your <a href="../liver-detoxification.htm">gallbladder</a>
              is not digesting the oil properly and you may need to take a high
              potency enzyme with plenty of the <a href="enzymes.htm">fat digesting
              enzyme lipase</a>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Ideally,
              you would want to measure your vitamin D levels. Unfortunately very
              few doctors do this. But if you overdose on vitamin D you can actually
              cause hardening of your arteries and osteoporosis as it causes a
              reverse effect. In short, I would recommend you take cod liver oil
              during the winter months when our exposure to the sun is minimal,
              and fish oil during the summer months.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">
              If you use beneficial products like cod liver oil without doing
              blood tests to check your vitamin D levels, you should keep the
              dose at 1 to 2 teaspoons per day to prevent overdosing </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">or
              switch to plain fish oil (which contains no vitamin D).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Use
              1 teaspoon per day for a child. When you give your child cod liver
              oil, you will also be supplying them with essential omega-3 fatty
              acids which will maximize their brain development.</font></p>
