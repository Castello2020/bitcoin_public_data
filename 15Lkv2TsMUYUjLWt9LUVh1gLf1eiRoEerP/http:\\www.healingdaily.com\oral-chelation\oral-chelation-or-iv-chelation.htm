        which condemn EDTA chelation as ineffective for treating vascular disease,
        often quote the Danish and New Zealand studies, mentioned earlier, to
        support their position. What they fail to mention is that the Danish studies
        were criticized by the Danish Committee for Investigation into Scientific
        Dishonesty because of improper randomization and double-blinding, as well
        as premature breaking of the blinding code, which amounted to a deliberate
        bias. When the results of the New Zealand study were examined by 2 independent
        statisticians, it was concluded that the trial actually supported the
        efficacy of EDTA.</font></p>

        unlikely that any other issue in modern medicine has been more highly
        politicized than that of EDTA chelation therapy, and it is clear that
        most of the opposition to EDTA is due to the threat this therapy represents,

      they threaten to diminish the income of a significant portion of the medical

      65 patients who were treated with I.V. EDTA while they were waiting for
      coronary bypass surgery surgery, 58 (89%) no longer required the procedure.
      At $50,000 per procedure not done, that means that surgeons and hospitals
      gave up nearly $3 million just for these few patients. Now remember, that

        Chelation And The Medical Profession</font></h1>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Given
        these figures, it's not hard to understand why the medical profession
        is so in love with coronary bypass surgery and related procedures. As one physician noted,
        &quot;It pays the bills.&quot; So enamored are they of these procedures
        that they perform them even when they are not necessary. In an article
        published in no less prestigious a publication than the &quot;Journal
        of the American Medical Association&quot;, the authors concluded that
        only 56% of the surgeries performed were for appropriate reasons, 30%
        for equivocal reasons, and 14% for inappropriate reasons. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The percentage
        of appropriate surgeries varied from 37% in some hospitals to 78% in others.
        When you consider that even when it is &quot;appropriate,&quot; coronary
        bypass surgery surgery is no better than conventional medical treatments
        for improving survival, you have to wonder whether the real &quot;miracle&quot;
        of heart surgery does not entail bringing people back from death's door,
        as much as turning a common chronic degenerative disease into a source
        of outrageous fortune. If you needed one example of why the cost of health
        care - disease care, really - has gone into earth orbit, you need look
        no further than the conventional treatment of <a href="../conditions/heart-disease.htm">heart
        disease</a>. Health spending in the U.S. is examined in more detail <a href="../conditions/health-spending.htm">here</a>.</font></p>

        coronary bypass surgery and the politics of heart disease <a href="../conditions/heart-disease.htm">here</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Given
        these figures, it's also not very hard to understand why the medical profession
        has reacted so violently against physicians who practice chelation therapy,
        often attempting to put them out of business. Because EDTA has long been
        approved for treating heavy metal poisoning, and because physicians are
        free to use any &quot;approved&quot; medication for any use they see fit,
        as long it does not endanger the patient, EDTA chelation therapy is perfectly
        legal. This has not stopped medical boards in a number of states from
        bringing charges against physicians who prescribe EDTA chelation for vascular
        disease, smearing them as &quot;quacks,&quot; and attempting to restrict
        the use of this therapy. Fortunately, most of these attempts have failed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> You can
        be certain that if EDTA had a <a href="../conditions/pharmaceutical-companies.htm">large
        pharmaceutical company</a> advocating its use, these problems would quickly
        evaporate. But since the patent for EDTA ran out nearly 30 years ago,
        there are no huge profits to be made from marketing it. With no pot of
        gold at the end of the EDTA rainbow, no one is going to put up the hundreds
        of millions of dollars required to do the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
        clinical trials required to get the FDA to approve EDTA for vascular disease.
        And with few large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
        trials to refer to, the conventional medical establishment feels justified
        in condemning EDTA therapy as &quot;unproven.&quot; It's a familiar &quot;Catch
        22&quot; that faces all natural or unpatentable therapies. </font></p>

          <a href="garry-gordon.htm">Dr. Garry Gordon</a>,
            whose own life was saved by EDTA and who has been a leader in chelation
            therapy since the early 1960s. &quot;I have taken on patients who
            were inoperable, who had already had every known form of bypass surgery,
            who had no more veins in their legs to strip out and put into their
            heart, and who were sent home to die, and I could get those people
            back to full functioning,&quot; says Dr. Gordon. </font></td>

    <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Because EDTA
      removes heavy metals from the body, it is important to supplement your diet
      with a good multi-mineral supplement while taking EDTA, to avoid any mineral
      deficiency, especially in zinc. I recommend you supplement your diet with
      a multi-vitamin/mineral supplement, as well as a calcium-magnesium-zinc
      supplement. The EDTA product I recommend can be found <a href="id=2sO3HF3YmRA&offerid=137425.24050&type=2&subid=0" target="_blank">here
