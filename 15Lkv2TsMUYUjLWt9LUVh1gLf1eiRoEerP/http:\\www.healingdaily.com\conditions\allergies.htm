        treatment of allergies is most commonly directed at blocking the immune
        response, or in more severe cases, at suppressing the entire immune function
        with steroids, both systemic and topical. While this approach can provide
        symptomatic relief, it does nothing to address the<br>
        underlying cause of the problem. Patients often become dependant on their
        medication, they suffer from numerous side effects, and more importantly,
        they worsen their overall health by constantly suppressing their <a href="colostrum.htm">immune
        system</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">In October
        2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported that Pfizer's
        blockbuster antihistamine frug &quot;Zyrtec&quot; had gained a supplemental
        U.S. approval for use in children as young as 6 months old. Zyrtec (cetirizine
        hydrochloride), which is currently indicated to relieve symptoms of allergic
        rhinitis - nasal inflammation - and to treat itching and hives in adults
        and in children age 2 and older, has been cleared for those 2 indications

        in <a href="../detoxification-diet/healing-fats.htm">margarine</a> are
        believed to promote the formation of prostaglandin E2, a substance which
        promotes inflammation and causes the <a href="colostrum.htm">immune system</a>
        to release a protein which triggers allergic reactions. Remember that
        butter is a natural food, while margarine is one of the worst things you

        common cause of multiple food allergies, according to many allergies experts,
        is having a 'leaky gut' - increased intestinal permeability. Small openings
        can develop in the lining of the intestine, which allow large molecules
        of undigested or incompletely digested foods to enter the bloodstream.

            make them &quot;friendly&quot;. If the quantity of incompletely digested
            foods which enters the bloodstream is too great for the liver to 'clear'
            almost immediately, the <a href="colostrum.htm">immune system</a>
            then recognizes these molecules as being foreign to the body and produces
            antibodies against them. </font></td>

        food is eaten again and again and passes into the bloodstream undigested
        or only partially digested, the antibodies bind with the food. These antibody-food
        complexes can travel through the bloodstream to any part of the body where
        they then cause problems. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">There are
        many causes of 'leaky gut'. Babies for example are born with higher intestinal
        permeability than older children or adults. Therefore, ideally infants
        should consume only breast milk for the first several months of life and
        other foods should be introduced cautiously.(4) If breast feeding is not
        possible, a completely hydrolyzed formula such as &quot;Nutramigen&quot;
        should be used because it is already broken down into simple <a href="../detoxification-diet/sugar.htm">sugars</a>,
        free amino acids, and other very small units.(5) Cow�s milk is highly
        allergenic and should not be given to babies. Neither should <a href="../detoxification-diet/soy.htm">soy
        formula</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Internal
        factors in a patient's body can cause or contribute to a leaky gut. These
        include nutritional deficiencies, inflammatory bowel disease, <a href="../detoxification-diet/enzymes.htm">poor
        digestion</a>, and food allergies. There is a vicious cycle involved with
        these internal factors since the leaky gut also causes them or contributes
        to their severity.(6)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Finally,
        unfriendly organisms present in the digestive tract can cause increased
        intestinal permeability. These infections can involve protozoan <a href="../colon-kidney-detoxification/parasites.htm">parasites</a>,
        yeasts such as Candida albicans, bacteria which are conventionally considered
        &#147;pathogens&#148; such as Salmonella or an overgrowth of bacteria
        usually considered nonpathogenic, such as Klebsiella or Pseudomonas. Hence
        the importance of maintaining a <a href="../detoxification-diet/probiotics.htm">healthy
        intestinal flora</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"><a href="../colon-kidney-detoxification/parasites.htm">Parasitic
        infestations</a> are on the increase because of changes in our lifestyles
        which have occurred over the last few decades. International travel is
        now commonplace. If you are not a traveler, the world and its parasites
        will come to you, brought in by imported produce from countries where
        sanitation is sub-standard. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">A common
        cause of bacterial or fungal problems in the intestine is often the repeated
        or long term use of antibiotics. Antibiotics kill both the bacteria you
        want them to kill AND the 'friendly' bacteria in the intestine. This leaves
        these areas open to be colonized by unfriendly bacteria, yeast, and parasites.
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Alcoholic
        beverages, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs - NSAIDs - (aspirin, ibuprofen,
        ketoprofen, naproxen, prescription arthritis medications, etc) cause increased
        intestinal permeability and can compound the problem of 'leaky gut' and
        contribute to food allergies..(7)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Nonsteroidal
        anti-inflammatory drugs - NSAIDs - are now being sold without a prescription
        and without much warning about their side effects. This is very unfortunate,
        as is the sometimes seemingly indiscriminate prescribing of these drugs.
        For anyone with the possibility of compromised intestinal health, even
        a single dose of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug can increase intestinal
        permeability tremendously.(8)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The Physician's
        Desk Reference warns about the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding,
        ulceration, and perforation when using nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs,
        and reports that 1 arthritis drug can lead to the development of inflammatory
        bowel disease.(9) In my opinion, you would be wise to avoid nonsteroidal
        anti-inflammatory drugs to prevent such problems. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Because
        we may not absorb nutrients from foods to which we are allergic, and because
        these foods contribute to the irritation of our intestine and decrease
        absorption even further, the first thing to consider in planning your
        diet is that you do not eat foods to which you are allergic.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> If you
        have multiple food allergies, the offending foods must be eliminated and
        all other foods should be eaten at intervals of 4 to 5 days or longer.
        This is known as a 'rotation' diet. Rotation diets are necessary for people
        with multiple allergies because if you have overt allergies to many foods,
        it is likely that you have slight, subclinical allergies to many other
        foods which you consider safe. Eating these foods on a rotated basis reduces
        your exposure to them and hopefully will help preserve your tolerance
        for them. </font></p>
      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Food allergies
        and impaired digestion</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Many people
        with food allergies suffer from <a href="../detoxification-diet/enzymes.htm">impaired
        digestion</a>. Incomplete digestion of foods which then pass through a
        leaky gut into the bloodstream is a major contributing factor to the problem
        of food allergies.(10) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Dr. William
        Philpott, in his book &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0879835486/healingdailyc-20" target="_blank">Victory
        Over Diabetes</a>&quot;, recommends the rotation of digestive enzymes
        on a 4-day cycle.(11) This can be accomplished by using pancreatin (from
        pork and beef), plant enzymes (from Aspergillus orazeae), bromelain (from
        pineapple), and papain (from papaya). Bromelain and papain are active
        in the digestion of protein only. Studies have shown them to be much less
        potent than pancreatin. More about digestive enzymes <a href="../detoxification-diet/enzymes.htm">here</a>.</font>
        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">I spend
        a lot of time researching the best prices for supplements on the internet,
        and in my opinion the lowest price for high quality digestive enzymes
        can be found <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=2sO3HF3YmRA&offerid=20052.100032770&type=10&subid=" target="_blank">here</a><img alt="icon" width="1" height="1" src="http://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=2sO3HF3YmRA&bids=20052.100032770&type=10&subid=">.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"><a href="../detoxification-diet/vitamin-c.htm">Vitamin
        C</a> is a general anti-allergy vitamin. We experience allergic symptoms
        when an allergen-antibody complex causes mast cells to release histamine
        and other allergy mediating chemicals. Vitamin C helps to stabilize mast
        cells so they are less likely to release these substances. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">If people
        with food allergies avoid harmful substances and address the factors at
        the root of their allergy problems, such as <a href="../detoxification-diet.htm">nutrition</a>,
        digestion, <a href="../colon-kidney-detoxification.htm">intestinal health</a>,
        their allergies can be overcome. It may take time, but good health is
        possible. </font></p>
