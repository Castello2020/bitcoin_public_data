      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">That's
        good news, because glucose hanging around in the blood is dangerous stuff.
        It can stick to proteins and destroy their ability to do their job. Kidney
        damage, blindness, and amputations may result.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">But insulin
        has many other vital roles. After a meal, insulin stops the liver from
        releasing any fat, a potential metabolic fuel, into the blood. Why after
        a meal? It turns out that just like glucose, these fats, released as <a href="../conditions/triglycerides.htm">triglycerides</a>,
        are dangerous if they hang about in the blood too long. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">In some
        organisms, insulin plays the role of controlling their lifespan. What
        is the purpose of insulin in humans? If you ask your physician, they will
        say that the role of insulin is to lower blood sugar and you must learn
        right now, that is one of insulin's many roles. </font></p>
      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Insulin,
        sugar, and glycogen</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">When your
        body notices that the sugar level is elevated, it is a sign that you have
        more sugar than you need right now, your body is not burning it and therefore
        it is accumulating in your blood. So insulin is released to take that
        sugar and store it. How does it store it? Glycogen? Your body stores very
        little glycogen at any one time. All the glycogen stored in your liver
        and muscles would not last you through 1 active day. Once you have filled
        up your glycogen stores, that sugar is stored as saturated fat. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">So the
        idea of medical professionals recommending a high complex-carbohydrate,
        low-saturated-fat diet is absolutely a mistake. A high complex-carbohydrate
        diet is nothing more than a high-glucose diet, or a <a href="sugar.htm">high-sugar
        diet</a>. Your body is just going to store it as saturated fat, and the
        body makes it into saturated fat quite readily. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Your body's
        principal way of getting rid of sugar, because it is toxic, is to burn
        it. The sugar which your body can't burn will be rid of by storing it
        as glycogen, and when those glycogen reserves are full, sugar gets stored
        as fat. If you eat sugar your body will burn it and you stop burning fat.
        Another major effect of insulin on fat is it prevents you from burning
        it. What happens when you are insulin resistant and you have all this
        insulin floating around all the time? You wake up in the morning with
        an insulin level of 90. </font></p>

            Intra-cellular magnesium relaxes muscles. What happens when you can't
            store magnesium because the cell is resistant? You lose magnesium
            and your blood vessels constrict. This causes an increase in blood

        is another potential problem resulting from insulin resistance. Insulin
        is a master hormone which controls many anabolic hormones such as growth
        hormone, testosterone, and progesterone. In insulin resistance, the anabolic
        process is reduced. Bone is built upon the command of such hormones. When
        these hormones are reduced, the amount of bone building is reduced, and
        the amount of calcium excreted is increased.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">4.
              Intestinal bloating. Most intestinal gas is produced from carbohydrates
              in the diet. Insulin Resistance sufferers who eat carbohydrates
              suffer from gas, lots of it. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">5.
              Sleepiness. Many people with Insulin Resistance get sleepy immediately
              after eating a meal containing more than 20% or 30% carbohydrates.
              This means typically a pasta meal, or even a meat meal which includes
              potatoes or bread and a sweet dessert. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">6.
              Increased weight and fat storage. For most people, too much weight
              is too much fat. In males, a large abdomen is the more obvious and
              earliest sign of Insulin Resistance. In females, it's prominent
              buttocks. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">7.
              <a href="../conditions/triglycerides.htm">Increased triglycerides</a>.
              High triglycerides in the blood are often found in overweight persons.
              But even those who are not overweight may have stores of fat in
              their arteries as a result of Insulin Resistance. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">These
              triglycerides are the direct result of carbohydrates in the diet
              being converted by insulin. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">8.
              Increased blood pressure. It is a fact that most people with hypertension
              have too much insulin and are Insulin Resistant. It is often possible
              to show a direct relationship between the level of insulin and blood
              pressure: as insulin levels elevate, so does blood pressure. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">9.
              <a href="../conditions/sam-e-1.htm">Depression</a>. Because carbohydrates
              are a natural &quot;downer,&quot; depressing the brain, it is not
              uncommon to see many depressed persons who also have Insulin Resistance.

            people who have lived over 100 years, don't have much in common. Many
            are smokers, for example. They come from all over the world without
            a favoring any geographic location in particular. </font></td>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">However,
        there are 3 consistent blood metabolic indicators of all centenarians
        which are relatively consistent: low sugar, low triglycerides, and low
        insulin. All 3 are relatively low for age. Among these 3 variables, insulin
        is the common denominator. The level of insulin sensitivity of the cell
        is one of the most important markers of lifespan. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Controlling
        your insulin levels is one of the most powerful anti-aging strategies
        you can possibly implement. <a href="sugar.htm">Sugar</a> and grains cause
        your body to produce insulin and high insulin levels are the single largest
        physical cause of accelerated aging. If you want to slow down aging and
        be healthy then you need to change your grains for <a href="../juicing-for-health.htm">greens</a>.
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Insulin
        resistance is the basis of all of the chronic diseases of aging, <a href="../conditions/heart-disease.htm">cardiovascular
        disease</a>, osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes, <a href="../conditions/detoxification-to-fight-cancer.htm">cancer</a>,
        all the so-called chronic diseases of aging.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Fortunately
        insulin is the variable most easily influenced by a <a href="../detoxification-diet.htm">healthy
        diet</a> and <a href="../mini-trampoline-exercise.htm">exercise</a>. Traditional
        doctors will prescribe drugs to lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetics
        and give verbal acknowledgment to exercise. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">A low grain,
        no sugar diet is one of the most effective ways to lower one's insulin
        levels. This is especially effective when combined with an aerobic exercise
        program which increases the heart rate to about 75% of its maximum and
        maintains it there for 45 minutes, 5 times a week. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">In addition
        to the steps we discussed related to diet and exercise, you may want to
        consider chromium supplementation. Chromium helps insulin to work efficiently.
        Many well-controlled clinical studies through the years show blood glucose
        improvements in the patients tested. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Important
        studies include one from the Human Nutrition Research Center of the United
        States Department of Agriculture conducted in 1996. Researchers in the
        study randomized 180 adult-onset diabetics into 3 groups of 60 each: one
        group received placebo twice a day, the second received 100 mcg twice
        a say of chromium as chromium picolinate and the third received 500 mcg
        of chromium as chromium picolinate twice per day. Their blood work was
        examined at baseline, at 2 months and at 4 months. The patients were told
        to remain on their anti-diabetic medications and to continue with their
        diets and activity levels as before. The results were impressive: blood
        glucose, insulin levels, and cholesterol all decreased, with the higher
        dose generally (but not always) more effective than the 200 mcg.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">I spend
        a lot of time researching the internet for the best prices for high quality
        supplements, and in my opinion the lowest price for high quality chromium
        supplements, whether picolinate or GTF, is <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=2sO3HF3YmRA&offerid=137425.26867&type=2&subid=0" target="_blank">here</a><img alt="icon" width="1" height="1" src="http://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=2sO3HF3YmRA&bids=20052.92496885&type=10&subid=">.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Your goals
        should be: Reduce insulin levels as much as possible, through diet and
        exercise, and control your weight. 90% of those with insulin resistance
        are obese.</font></p>
