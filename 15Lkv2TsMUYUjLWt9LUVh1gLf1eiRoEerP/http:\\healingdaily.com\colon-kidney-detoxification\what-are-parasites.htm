            A parasite is an organism which lives off the host, the host being

            recent medical studies, it has been estimated that 85% of the North
            American adult population has at least one form of parasite living
            inside their bodies. Some authorities feel this figure may be as high
            as 95%. </font></td>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The immediate
        question that comes to people's minds when they become informed of this
        situation is: &quot;How can a parasite possibly live in my body and I
        don't even know it is there?&quot; The answer to this is simple:. the
        nature of a parasite is to not make itself known. A smart parasite lives
        without being detected because if it is detected, of course, something
        is going to be done to eradicate it. Parasites are &quot;clever&quot;
        in their ability to survive and reproduce, which is of course, the purpose
        of any organism on this planet. It sounds pretty simple, doesn't it? And
        in some ways it is, but it can make life for humans very complicated.

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">In the
        book, &quot;Animals Parasitic in Man&quot; by Geoffrey Lapage, he states:
        &quot;There is no part of the human body, nor indeed, any part of the
        bodies of the hosts of parasitic animals in general, which is not visited
        by some kind of parasitic animal at some time or another, during their
        life histories&quot; This means parasites can occur anywhere in your body.
        No organ is immune from their infestation. </font></p>

        - hard to detect and hard to get rid of!</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">If you
        were to get tested by a doctor for parasites, chances are the results
        would come back negative. Does this mean with certainty that you do not
        have parasites? Unfortunately medical testing procedures only catch about
        20% of the actual cases of parasites. There exist over l,000 species of
        parasites which can live in your body, however tests are available for
        approximately 40 to 50 types. This means physicians are only testing for
        about 5% of the parasites and missing 80% of those which are present.
        This brings the ability to clinically find parasites down to l %. </font></p>

      <p><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The book,
        &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0721676340/healingdailyc-20" target="_blank">Medical
        Parasitology</a>&quot; by Markell and Voge, points out that therapy to
        remove entire tapeworms from the small intestine is only successful if
        the whole worm is expelled. If the head remains, the entire worm will
        grow back. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">How, then,
        do you determine whether or not you have parasites? In order to understand
        how to make this determination, you have to understand what a parasite
        does. A parasite eats, lays eggs and secretes. Sounds pretty simple, doesn't
        it? First let's look at the &quot;eats&quot; part. Depending on the kind,
        parasites will eat different things. Some parasites love <a href="../detoxification-diet/sugar.htm">sugar</a>,
        for instance. If you are a person who craves sugar, you may have a sugar
        loving parasite. These parasites live off the food that goes into your
        body. They exist mainly in the digestive tract, but can also be found
        in the liver, as well as throughout the body. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Other parasites
        actually get their nutrition directly from the cells of the body. They
        can literally attach themselves anywhere and suck nutrients out of the
        cells. These parasites are significantly more dangerous because they can
        travel to areas in the body where they can do a lot more damage than a
        parasite living exclusively in the digestive tract. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">As if it
        wasn't bad enough to have an uninvited guest living in your body, the
        parasites eat your nutrients before you do! They get the best nutrients,
        we get the scraps and leftovers. They grow healthy and fat, yet your organs
        and skin starve for nutrition. What's more, parasites can remain in your
        body for 10, 20 or even 30 years. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">To illustrate
        the longevity of parasites in the human body, consider this example: in
        l979, a British study reported on 600 former prisoners from World War
        2. These men had been stationed in the Far East. Thirty years after the
        war, 15% were still infected with a parasite called Stronglyloides which
        they had contracted during the war. This means you could have eaten meat
        10 years ago that was contaminated and still be hosting the tapeworms
        or other types of parasites which were in that meat. </font></p>
      <p></p>
      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Parasites
        reproduce quickly! </font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Let's now
        examine the way parasites reproduce. First of all, we need to understand
        that there are two major categories of parasites: large parasites, which
        are primarily worms, and small parasites which are mainly microscopic
        in size, including what are called protozoa and amoebae. Despite their
        being almost invisible, small parasites can be dangerous. Microscopic
        parasites can get into your joints and eat the calcium linings of your
        bones. This can lead to arthritic tendencies. They can also eat the protein
        coating on your nerves (the myelin sheath) and this can cause a disruption
        in the nerve signal from the brain. One type of tiny parasite which infects
        the <a href="../colon-kidney-detoxification.htm">colon</a> is called &quot;Entamoeba
        Histolytica&quot;. This type of infection can also be found in the liver,
        the lungs, and the brain. The disease is called amebiasis, and is often
        transmitted via contaminated food or <a href="../detoxification-diet/water-filtration-systems.htm">water</a>.
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Large parasites,
        which are the worm type, are usually large enough to be seen with the
        naked eye. Some can be up to 10 or even 15 inches long and in most cases
        cannot travel to other parts of the body, other than the digestive tract.
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The smaller
        parasites, the protozoas and amoebas, can function almost like a bacteria
        by traveling through the bloodstream to virtually any part of the body.
        They reproduce without laying eggs and behave more like an infection in
        the body than do the larger parasites. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The larger
        parasites are worms which reproduce by laying eggs. Eggs are deposited
        into the intestinal tract, where they stick to the walls of the intestines.
        When the eggs hatch, the young feed on the food that we eat and eventually
        grow into adults. The adults then repeat this process. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Some of
        the larger parasites:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Tapeworms:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The fish
        tapeworm is the largest of the human tapeworms, reaching the length of
        33 feet or more. There can be 3,000 to 4,000 segments in one worm. It
        can produce more than 1,000,000 eggs a day. This type of infestation can
        cause anemia because of interference with vitamin B12. Tapeworms can also
        cause <a href="../detoxification-diet/water-filtration-systems.htm">water</a>
        retention. Besides tapeworms from beef, pork and fish, there is also a
        type of dog tapeworm you can get when dogs lick your face or hands.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Pinworms:
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Pinworms
        are very infectious and can cause a lot of itchiness in the anal area.
        The worms deposit their eggs mostly at night, contaminating pajamas and
        bed linen. The eggs are readily transported through the air, and it is
        not uncommon to find them in every room of the house. Complications are
        much more common in women than in men. Pinworms can also sometimes be
        found in the vulva, uterus and fallopian tubes because the worm loses
        its way while trying to return to the anus after depositing its eggs.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Roundworms:
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Another
        type of roundworm that can be present in humans is whipworms. These insidious
        creatures actually inject a digestive fluid which converts the <a href="../colon-kidney-detoxification.htm">colon</a>
        tissue into liquid which the worms suck up. Dr. Norman Stoll, a former
        worm expert at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, estimated,
        in the 1940s, that the roundworm infects about 644 million people in the
        world. Nutritional deficiencies are seen in heavy roundworm infections.
        That figure must now be much higher 60 years later.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Hookworms:
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Hookworms
        bite and suck on the intestinal wall, which can cause bleeding and necrosis
        (death of the tissue). In severe infections, iron deficiency becomes a
        problem because of all the iron that is lost to the hookworm. Hemoglobin
        levels as low as 15% of normal have been seen in patients with severe,
        long-standing hookworm disease. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The smaller
        parasites reproduce without the process of laying eggs. They reproduce
        by duplicating themselves in a manner similar to bacteria or viral reproduction.

      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Parasites
        Secrete Toxins </font> </h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The 3rd
        thing which parasites do is secrete. All organisms secrete something,
        whether it be lubricants, waste materials, protective liquids for warding
        off viruses, bacteria and other harmful organisms, or secretions to help
        attract food. No matter what the secretion is-- the secretion can be a
        toxin to the host organism. Simply put, the secretions from parasites
        into our bodies are poisons and toxins which our bodies are forced to
        deal with by increasing the process of detoxification. As anyone who has
        ever maintained an aquarium knows, ammonia is extremely toxic, yet it
        is one of the gases excreted by parasites living within human and animal
        hosts. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">On the
        other end, a chronic parasitic infection secreting low levels of toxins
        can create an extremely strained <a href="../conditions/colostrum.htm">immune
        system</a> which may allow varied health problems to develop. When the
        immune system is strained over a long period of time, it of course, becomes
        weak. When the <a href="../conditions/colostrum.htm">immune system</a>
        is weak, our bodies become susceptible to infections of all kinds. This
        can be an extremely dangerous situation in this day and age because we
        are exposed to more viruses than ever before. Also, they are changing
        and adapting at a very fast rate as are the bacteria, many of which are
        now resistant to antibiotics and other artificial measures which used
        to combat them. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> People
        with a weakened <a href="../conditions/colostrum.htm">immune system</a>
        tend to feel tired all the time. Some people refer to this as &quot;Chronic
        Fatigue Syndrome&quot;. If this sounds like you or someone you know, you
        may want to seriously consider the possibility of a depleted immune system
        caused by a chronic parasitic infection. </font></p>
      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Parasites
        create toxic overload </font> </h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">If parasites
        secrete toxins into our bodies which our bodies need to neutralize, and
        we happen to be one of those people who drinks alcohol, smokes cigarettes,
        eats junk food and breathes polluted air, the extra stress and strain
        on the body's cleansing system can be enough to push the body into what
        we call toxic overload. Those last few lifestyle choices we just mentionned
        are under your control, however. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"><a href="/exercise/transcendental-meditation-1.htm">Transcendental
        meditation</a> has helped me make marked improvements in not only my health
        and behavior but all aspects of my life. I highly recommend you look <a href="/exercise/transcendental-meditation-1.htm">into
        it </a>.</font><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="1">
        </font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Toxic overload
        occurs when the 4 cleansing systems of the body have been pushed too far
        by an overload of toxins in the body. Parasite toxins in the body are
        one more thing a toxic body does not need.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> There
        are 4 cleansing systems in the body: the lungs, kidneys, skin and bowel.
        With toxic bowel syndrome, the excess of toxins absorbed from a clogged
        up bowel goes to the liver. The liver is then over-burdened, eventually
        unable to cope with this toxic load and the toxins start to spill into
        the bloodstream.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Once this
        happens, the kidneys, lungs and skin have to take over the job of cleansing
        and they too become challenged in their ability to remain healthy. So
        you see, parasites can be one of the most damaging health factors threatening
        the world today. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Now let's
        examine what we can do to <a href="parasites-getting-rid.htm">rid ourselves
        of parasites</a>.</font></p>
