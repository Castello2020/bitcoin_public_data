      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The core
        of their concerns rests with the chemical makeup of soy: in addition to
        all the nutrients and protein, soy contains a natural chemical that mimics
        estrogen, the female hormone. Some studies in animals show that this chemical
        can alter sexual development. And in fact, 2 glasses of soy milk/day,
        over the course of one month, contain enough of the chemical to change
        the timing of a woman&#146;s menstrual cycle.</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Isoflavones
        in soybeans</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Soybeans
        contain an impressive array of phytochemicals (biologically active components
        derived from plants), the most interesting of which are known as isoflavones.
        Isoflavones are the compounds which are being studied in relation to the
        relief of certain menopausal symptoms, cancer prevention, slowing or reversing
        osteoporosis and reducing the risk of <a href="../conditions/heart-disease.htm">heart
        disease</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Soy critics
        point to the fact that soybeans, as provided by nature, are not suitable
        for human consumption. Only after fermentation for some time, or extensive
        processing, including chemical extractions and high temperatures, are
        the beans, or the soy protein isolate, suitable for digestion when eaten.
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Soybeans
        also reportedly contain an anti-nutrient called &quot;phytic acid&quot;,
        which all beans do. However, soybeans have higher levels of phytic acid
        than any other legume. Phytic acid may block the absorption of certain
        minerals, including magnesium, calcium, iron and zinc. Epidemiological
        studies have shown that people in 3rd World Countries who have high consumption
        of grains and soy also commonly have deficiencies in these minerals. It
        must also be noted that this may be of particular concern with regard
        to babies who are using soy-based infant formulas.</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">What is
        the truth when it comes to soy?</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">So how
        does one get to the truth when it comes to soy? Usually, the first question
        I ask is� "Where is the money? Who has something to be gained from one
        side or the other?" With the soy issue, there does not seem to be an easy
        answer here either� and that's because there appear to be strong financial
        incentives on both sides of the argument.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Who has
        something to gain from the consumption of soy? Perhaps companies like
        Monsanto which produce the <a href="genetically-engineered-foods.htm">genetically
        modified</a> soybean seeds. Perhaps companies like Cargill Foods or SoyLife
        which produce countless soy-based foods. Or soybean councils in several
        states which represent farmers who grow this new, emerging bumper crop.
        And, of course, all of the companies which are constructing factories
        all over the world to do the processing which is necessary to make soybeans
        edible.</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Soy -
        more negatives than positives</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">I feel
        the positive aspects of the soybean are overshadowed by their potential
        for harm. Soybeans in fact contain a large number of dangerous substances.
        We already mentionned &quot;phytic acid&quot;, also called &quot;phytates&quot;.
        This organic acid is present in the bran or hulls of all seeds and legumes,
        but none have the high level of phytates which soybeans do. Phytic acid
        blocks the body's uptake of essential minerals like magnesium, calcium,
        iron and especially zinc. Adding to the high phytate problem, soybeans
        are highly resistant to phytate-reducing techniques, such as long, slow
        cooking. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Soybeans
        also contain potent enzyme-inhibitors. These inhibitors block uptake of
        trypsin and other <a href="enzymes.htm">enzymes</a> which the body needs
        for protein digestion. Normal cooking does not de-activate these harmful
        antinutrients, which can cause serious gastric distress, reduced protein
        digestion and can lead to chronic deficiencies in amino acid uptake. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">In addition,
        soybeans also contain hemagglutinin, a clot-promoting substance which
        causes red blood cells to clump together. These clustered blood cells
        cannot properly absorb oxygen for distribution to the body's tissues,
        and are unable to help in maintaining good cardiac health. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Hemagglutinin
        and trypsin inhibitors are both &quot;growth depressant&quot; substances.
        Although the act of fermenting soybeans does de-activate both hemagglutinin
        and trypsin inhibitors, cooking and precipitation do not. Although these
        enzyme inhibitors are found in reduced levels within precipitated soy
        products like tofu, they are not completely eliminated. For this reason,
        if you are going to consume soy, I would recommend limiting your soy use
        to fermented products only, like tempeh or miso. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Only after
        a long period of fermentation (as ocurs in the creation of miso or tempeh)
        are the antinutrient and phytate levels of soybeans reduced, making their
        nourishment available to the human digestive system. The high level of
        harmful substances remaining in precipitated soy products leaves their
        nutritional value questionable at best, and potentially harmful. </font></p>

        tofu is of vegetable origin does not necessarily make it healthy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Health-conscious
        Americans believe in the benefits of tofu, infant formula and other food
        products made from soybeans and soy extract. But their assumption is now
        being called into question by Jill Schneider, associate professor of biological
        sciences at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">In a study
        of hamsters completed under Schneider's direction, it was recently found
        that a component of soy beans - isoflavones - significantly accelerated
        the onset of puberty in the rodents. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">These findings,
        which are similar to the results reported by labs which have experimented
        with rats, might be relevant to humans, Schneider says. She points out
        that many babies who are allergic to cow's milk are fed soy-based formulas
        which contain isoflavones. Isoflavones, she says, can act like estrogen,
        a natural hormone important in the development of both male and female
        humans. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">It is child
        abuse to feed a baby soy formula. </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">A

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">SPI is
        not something you can make in your own kitchen. Production takes place
        in industrial factories where soybeans are first mixed with an alkaline
        solution to remove fiber, then precipitated and separated using an acid
        wash and, finally, neutralized in an alkaline solution.</font></p>
      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Acid washing
      in aluminum tanks leaches high levels of aluminum into the final product.
      As a result, soy-based formula also has over 1000% more aluminum than conventional
      milk based formulas. Breast milk is best, but if one, for whatever reason,
      cannot breast feed, then Carnation Good Start until six months and Carnation
      FollowUp after that seem to be the best commercial formula currently available.
      The milk protein is hydrolyzed 80% which tends to significantly decrease
      its allergenicity.</font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Finally,
        the resulting curds are spray-dried at high temperatures to produce a
        high-protein powder. A final hardship to the original soybean is high-temperature,
        high-pressure extrusion processing of soy protein isolate to produce textured
        vegetable protein.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Nitrites,
        which are potent carcinogens, are formed during spray-drying, and a toxin
        called &quot;lysinoalanine&quot; is formed during alkaline processing.(1)
        Numerous artificial flavorings, particularly MSG, are added to soy protein
        isolate and textured vegetable protein products to mask their strong "beany"
        taste and to impart the flavor of meat.(2)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Yet soy
        protein isolate and textured vegetable protein are used extensively in
        school lunch programs, commercial baked goods, fast food products and
        diet beverages. They are heavily promoted in 3rd world countries and form
        the basis of many food giveaway programs. </font></p>
      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Marketing
        and soy</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> All soybean
        producers pay a mandatory assessment of 0.5% to 1% of the net market price
        of soybeans. The total - something like US $80 million annually(3) - supports
        United Soybean's program to &quot;strengthen the position of soybeans
        in the marketplace and maintain and expand domestic and foreign markets
        for uses for soybeans and soybean products&quot;. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">State soybean
        councils from Maryland, Nebraska, Delaware, Arkansas, Virginia, North
        Dakota and Michigan provide another $2.5 million for &quot;research&quot;.(4)
        Private companies like Archer Daniels Midland also contribute their share.
        ADM spent $4.7 million for advertising on the TV shor &quot;Meet the Press&quot;
        and $4.3 million on &quot;Face the Nation&quot; during the course of a
        year.(5)</font></p>

        relations firms</a> help convert research projects into advertising copy
        and newspaper articles, and law firms lobby for favorable government regulations.
        IMF money funds soy-processing plants in foreign countries, and free-trade
        policies keep soybean abundance flowing to overseas destinations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Soy milk
        has posted the biggest gains, soaring from $2 million in 1980 to $300
        million in the US in 2001.(6) Recent advances in processing have transformed
        the bitter, gray, beany-tasting Asian beverage into a product that Western
        consumers will accept - one that tastes like a milkshake, but without
        the guilt.</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">What about
        soy offering protection against cancer?</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Some sources
        claim that &quot;soy has demonstrated powerful anticancer benefits...the
        Japanese, who eat 30 times as much soy as North Americans, have a lower
        incidence of cancers of the breast, uterus and prostate.&quot;(7) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Indeed
        they do. But the Japanese, and Asians in general, have much higher rates
        of other types of <a href="../conditions/detoxification-to-fight-cancer.htm">cancer</a>,
        particularly cancer of the esophagus, stomach, liver and pancreas.(8)
        Asians throughout the world also have high rates of thyroid cancer.(9)
        The logic which links low rates of reproductive cancers to soy consumption
        requires attribution of high rates of thyroid and digestive cancers to
        the same foods, particularly as soy causes these types of cancers in laboratory
        rats.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">In 1991,
        Japanese researchers reported that consumption of as little as 30 grams
        or 2 tablespoons of soybeans/day for only 1 month resulted in a significant
        increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone.(10) Diffuse goiter and hypothyroidism
        appeared in some of the subjects and many complained of constipation,
        lethargy and fatigue, even though their intake of iodine was adequate.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">25 grams
        of soy protein isolate, the minimum amount claimed to have cholesterol-lowering
        effects, contains from 50 to 70 mg of isoflavones. It took only 45 mg
        of isoflavones in pre-menopausal women to exert significant biological
        effects, including a reduction in hormones needed for adequate thyroid
        function. These effects lingered for 3 months after soy consumption was
        discontinued.(11) </font></p>
      <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">In 1992,
        the Swiss health service estimated that 100 grams of soy protein provided
        the estrogenic equivalent of the Pill.(12)</font></p>

            it is the isoflavones in infant formula which give the most cause
            for concern. In 1998, investigators reported that the daily exposure
            of infants to isoflavones in soy infant formula is 6 to 11 times higher
            on a body-weight basis than the dose that has hormonal effects in
            adults consuming soy foods. Circulating concentrations of isoflavones
            in infants who were fed soy-based formula were 13,000 to 22,000 times
            higher than plasma estradiol concentrations in infants on cow's milk
            formula.(13)</font></td>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Approximately
        25% of bottle-fed children in the US receive soy-based formula - a much
        higher percentage than in other parts of the Western world. It is estimated
        that an infant exclusively fed soy formula receives the estrogen equivalent
        (based on body weight) of at least 5 birth control pills per day.(14)
        By contrast, almost no phytoestrogens have been detected in dairy-based
        infant formula or in human milk, even when the mother consumes soy products.
