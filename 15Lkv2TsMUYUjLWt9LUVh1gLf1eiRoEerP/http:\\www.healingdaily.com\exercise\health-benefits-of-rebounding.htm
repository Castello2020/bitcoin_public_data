        The rebounding device is a mini-trampoline with a flexible jumping surface
        measuring 28 to 36 inches in diameter and set six to nine inches off the
        ground. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The jumping
        mat is attached to the frame with a series of coil springs, providing
        a good rebound while remaining firm on the downward bounce. Unlike a regular
        trampoline, the rebounding device is not meant for bouncing high or performing
        gymnastic tricks.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"><a href="33-benefits-of-rebounding-for-health.htm">Rebounding
        is a unique exercise</a> in that you achieve a weightless state at the
        top of each jump then land with twice the force of gravity on each bounce.
        This twice-gravity bounce affects every muscle and cell of the body. Researchers
        at the University of Kentucky, in conjunction with NASA, concluded that
        &quot;the magnitude of the biomechanical stimuli is greater with jumping
        on a trampoline than with running.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">For example,
        a 150-pound person spending one hour on a rebounder will burn about 410
        calories; the same person jogging for one hour (at the pace of five miles
        per hour) will burn only 355 calories.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">They further
        reported, based on their testing of physiological responses in eight men,
        age 19 to 26: &quot;These responses measured by whole-body vibration [on
        the trampoline] resemble those during mild exercise and suggest that perhaps
        body vibration could be used in place of exercise.&quot;</font></p>

        to the Healthy Cell News, other rebounding benefits include decreasing
        headaches (both frequency and strength), reducing back and
      <a href="../conditions/glucosamine.htm">joint pains</a>,
        alleviating arthritic symptoms, such as pain and inflammation, and boosting
        energy levels. Because the exercise provided by rebounding is sufficiently
        gentle, both the elderly and the pregnant can safely participate; in addition,
        it is suitable for those who are physically handicapped and those recovering
        from an accident or injury or who are otherwise hampered by a physical
        problem.</font></p>

        Helps Move the Lymph</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">One of
        rebounding's special benefits is its ability to <a href="effects-of-rebounding-on-the-lymphatic-system.htm">improve
        flow in the lymphatic system</a>. The lymphatic system is the metabolic
        garbage can of the body. It rids the body of toxins, fatigue substances,
        dead cells, cancer cells, nitrogenous wastes, trapped protein, fatty globules,
        pathogenic bacteria, infectious viruses, foreign substances, heavy metals,
        and other assorted junk the cells cast off.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Stagnant
        or inadequate lymph flow is associated with the onset of many symptoms
        and illnesses, including bursitis in the shoulders, bunions,
      <a href="../conditions/glucosamine.htm">joint stiffness</a>
        or soft tissue spasms, dry flaking skin, bad breath, body odors, lethargy,
        depression, and cancer. Unlike the circulatory system with the heart as
        its pump, the lymph system lacks a pump to move the fluid. It is vital
        that the lymph fluids continue to flow in order to eliminate waste from
        the body. The flow is dependent on muscle contractions and body movements,
        massage and other forms of compression, and gravity. One of the best ways
        to stimulate this flow is by exercising.</font></p>

        Stimulates The Lymph</font></h1>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Rebounding
        specifically stimulates the flow of lymph fluid. The change in gravitational
        forces experienced during rebounding allows for greater blood flow, which
        in turn increases the amount of waste products flushed from cells.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">&quot;The
        lymphatic [flow] becomes very active during exercise but sluggish under
        resting conditions,&quot; states Arthur C. Guyton, M.D., chairman of the
        department of Physiology and Biophysics at the University of Mississippi
        School of Medicine and author of Basic Human Physiology. &quot;During
        exercise, the rate of lymph flow can increase to as high as 14 times normal
        because of the increased activity.&quot; This happens because the lymph
        ducts expand during rebounding. The increased lymph flow flushes more
        toxins through the lymphatic system. </font></p>
      <h1><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Rebounding

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">One of
        the primary causes of the physical deterioration associated with aging
        is the declining performance of the heart and circulatory system. The
        pumping force of the heart decreases by 8% per decade in adulthood; lung
        capacity decreases, muscles lose strength, reaction time slows, and bones
        lose their mineral content. Exercise can help halt or at least slow this
        aging process. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">&quot;So
        many people 'rust' out before they wear out because they fail to realize

        only partially by the lessening of heart function. Rebounding stimulates

        Animal studies have shown that exercise can increase enzyme activity in

        working your heart harder during exercise, you improve its overall function

            exercises such as rebounding increase red blood cell count, allowing
            faster oxygen transport through the body, and can help lower elevated
            blood pressure. Aerobic exercise helps dissolve blood clots and increases
            the amount of high-density lipoproteins (HDL, the so-called &quot;good&quot;
            cholesterol and a major factor in the prevention of atherosclerosis)
            in the blood.</font></td>

        of the lungs also increases, enabling them to process more air and replenish
        oxygen in the cells of the body's tissues and organs more quickly. Metabolism
        (conversion of food into energy) is enhanced and you tend to absorb nutrients
        from your food more efficiently. Any tendency towards constipation, kidney
        stones, or diabetes is reduced by this form of exercise.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Regular
        exercise not only improves your health, it may extend your life. Two recent
        studies show a strong link between exercise and a decline in mortality
        rates. They show that engaging in physical activity, no matter what your
        age or how often you exercise, lowers your risk of early death.</font></p>
      <h1><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Rebounding
        Is For People Of All Ages</font></h1>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Overall,
        after adjusting for the mortality-increasing effects of chronic illnesses,
        cigarette smoking, and other factors, the authors reported that, nonetheless,
        there exists &quot;a strong inverse association between risk of all-cause
        mortality and level of physical fitness in both men and women.&quot; In
        other words, higher levels of fitness translate into a longer life. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Men who
        were physically active were at a lower risk of death from all causes than
        were sedentary ones, but this relationship was not as pronounced for women.
        Risk of death specifically from cancer dropped sharply as fitness levels
        increased for men; with women, while the same trend was present, the differences
        were less pronounced. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Older women
        can benefit significantly from regular exercise. In one of the largest
        studies of its kind involving women, the University of Minnesota School
        of Public Health looked at the physical activity levels of 40,417 postmenopausal
        women in Iowa. The women ranged in age from 55 to 69 and were followed
        for seven years. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The researchers
        found that women who exercised frequently (at least four times per week)
        and intensely could reduce their risk of premature death by as much as
        30%. Even those women who exercised relatively infrequently-once per week-still
        showed decreased mortality from all causes, the study reported. Exercising
        more frequently and with more intensity led to greater reductions in mortality,
        the researchers concluded. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">One of
        the best value for rebounders on the market today can be found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KIUIRC?ie=UTF8&tag=healingdailyc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000KIUIRC" target="_blank" >
        here</a>. This is the one I use. Unlike some other lower quality rebounders
        which have a 175-pound limit, this rebounder can withstand up to 250 pounds
        and is of excellent quality. It comes with a stabilizing bar which is
        really useful when you are rebounding while watching TV, for example.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Lastly,
        an even more affordable rebounder - with a 250 pound user weight limit
        - can be found <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=2sO3HF3YmRA&offerid=64951.881612&type=2&subid=0" target="_blank" >
        here</a> for less than $30. Please note however that this particular rebounder
        does not include a stabilizing bar.</font><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="1"></font></i></p>
