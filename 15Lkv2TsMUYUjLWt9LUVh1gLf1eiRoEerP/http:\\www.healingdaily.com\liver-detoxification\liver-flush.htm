              to the common bile duct and acts as a storage reservoir. Eating

            many persons, including children, the biliary tubing is choked with
            gallstones. Some develop <a href="../conditions/allergies.htm">allergies</a>
            or hives but some have no symptoms. When the gallbladder is scanned
            or <a href="../conditions/mammograms.htm">X-rayed</a> nothing is seen.
            Typically, they are not in the gallbladder. Not only that, most are
            too small and not calcified, a prerequisite for visibility on an X-ray.
            There are over half a dozen varieties of gallstones, most of which
            have cholesterol crystals in them. They can be black, red, white,
            green or tan colored. The green ones get their color from being coated
            with bile. Notice in the picture (pg. 545) how many have imbedded
            unidentified objects. Are they fluke remains? Notice how man are shaped
            like corks with longitudinal grooves below the tops. We can visualize
            the blocked bile ducts from such shapes. Other stones are composites-
            made of many smaller ones- showing that they regrouped in the bile

        the <a href="../colon-kidney-detoxification/kidney-cleanse.htm">kidney
        cleanse</a> before cleansing the liver is also recommended. You want your
        kidneys, bladder and urinary tract in top working condition so they can

        the intestine as the bile is being excreted. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Drink one
        serving (3/4 cup) of the ice cold Epsom salts. If you did not prepare
        this ahead of time, do it right now. You may also add 1/8 tsp. vitamin
        C powdered to improve the taste. You may also drink a few mouthfuls of
        water afterwards or rinse your mouth. Get the
      <a href="../detoxification-diet/olive-oil.htm">olive oil</a> and grapefruit out
        to warm up.</font></p>

        by drinking another 3/4 cup of Epsom salts. You haven't eaten since two
        o'clock, but you won't feel hungry. Get your bedtime chores done. The
        timing is critical for success; don't be more than 10 minutes early or
        late.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">9:45 PM.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Pour 1/2
        cup (measured) <a href="../detoxification-diet/olive-oil.htm">olive oil</a> into the pint jar. Squeeze the grapefruit by
        hand into the measuring cup. Remove pulp with fork. You should have at
        least 1/2 cup, more (up to 3/4 cup) is best. You may top it up with lemonade.
        Add this to the olive oil. Close the jar tightly with the lid and shake
        hard until watery (only fresh grapefruit does this).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Now visit

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Notes from
        the webmaster: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Although
        I generally recommend against drinking <a href="../detoxification-diet/soda-pop.htm">soda</a>,
        I make an exception when doing the liver flush. Adding an amount of Classic
        Coke equal to the amount of
      <a href="../detoxification-diet/olive-oil.htm">olive oil</a> to the recipe makes swallowing the
        mixture much easier.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Lie down
        immediately. You might fail to get stones out if you don't. The sooner
        you lie down the more stones you will get out. Be ready for bed ahead
        of time. Don't clean up the kitchen. As soon as the drink is down walk
        to your bed and lie down flat on your back with your head up high on the
        pillow. Try to think about what is happening in the liver. Try to keep
        perfectly still for at least 20 minutes. You may feel a train of stones
        traveling along the bile ducts like marbles. There is no pain because
        the bile duct valves are open (thank you Epsom salts!). Go to <a href="../exercise/sleep.htm">sleep</a>.
        You may fail to get stones out if you don't.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Next morning.
        Upon awakening take your third dose of Epsom salts. If you have indigestion
        or nausea wait unit it is gone before drinking the Epsom salts. You may
        go back to bed. Don't take this potion before 6:00 AM.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">2 hours
        later. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Take your
        fourth (the last) dose of Epsom salts. Drink 3/4 cups of the mixture.
        You may go back to bed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">After 2
        more hours you may eat. Start with fresh fruit juice. Half an hour later
        eat fruit. One hour later you may eat regular food but keep it light.
        By supper you should feel recovered.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">How well
        did you do?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Expect
        diarrhea in the morning. Use a flashlight to look for gallstones in the
        toilet with the bowel movement. Look for the green kind since this is
        proof that they are genuine gallstones, not food residue. Only bile from
        the liver is pea green. The bowel movement sinks but gallstones float
        because of the cholesterol inside. Count them all roughly, whether tan
        or green. You will need to total 2,000 stones before the liver is clean
        enough to rid you of allergies or bursitis or upper back pains permanently.
        The first cleanse may rid you of them for a few days, but as the stones
        from the rear travel forward, they give you the same symptoms again. You
        may repeat cleanses at two week intervals. Never cleanse when you are
        ill. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Sometimes,
        the bile ducts are full of cholesterol crystals that did not form into
        round stones. They appear as a &quot;chaff&quot; floating on top of the
        toilet bowl water. It may be tan colored, harboring millions of tiny white
        crystals. cleansing this chaff is just as important as purging the stones.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">How safe
        is the liver cleanse? It is very safe. My opinion is based on over 500
        cases, including many persons in their seventies and eighties. None went
        to the hospital; none even reported pain. However it can make you feel
        quite ill for one or two days afterwards, although in every one of these
        cases the maintenance parasite program had been neglected. This is why
        the instructions direct you to complete the parasite and kidney rinse
        program first.</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">This procedure
        contradicts many modern medical viewpoints. Gallstones are thought to
        be formed in the gallbladder, not the liver. They are though to be few,
        not thousands. They are not linked to pains other than gallbladder attacks.
        It is easy to understand why this thought: by the time you have acute
        pain attacks, some stones are in the gallbladder, are big enough and sufficiently
        calcified to see on <a href="../conditions/mammograms.htm">X-ray</a>, and have caused inflammation there. When the
        gallbladder is removed the acute attacks are gone, but the bursitis and
        other pains and digestive problems remain.</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The truth
        is self-evident. People who have had their gallbladder removed surgically
        still get plenty of green, bile coated stones, and anyone who cares to
        dissect their stones can see that the concentric circles and crystals
        of cholesterol match textbook pictures of &quot;gallstones&quot; exactly.&quot;</font></p>
