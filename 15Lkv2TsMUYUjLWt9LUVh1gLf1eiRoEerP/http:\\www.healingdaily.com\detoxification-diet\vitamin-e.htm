        damage to DNA caused by <a href="../conditions/free-radicals.htm">free

        the damaging effects of free radicals, which may contribute to the development
        of chronic diseases such as cancer. Vitamin E also may block the formation
        of nitrosamines, which are carcinogens formed in the stomach from nitrites
        consumed in the diet. Vitamin E may also protect against the development
        of cancers by enhancing <a href="../conditions/colostrum.htm">immune function</a>
        (6). However, human trials and surveys which tried to associate vitamin

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">However
        other studies which have reviewed the effects of standard vitamin E products
        (alpha-tocopherol acetate) taken by themselves have failed to decisively
        show a protective benefit for <a href="../conditions/detoxification-to-fight-cancer.htm">cancer</a>.(7,9)
        It is possible that other forms of vitamin E found in food (such as gamma
        tocopherol and tocotrienols) may be responsible for providing the protective
        effect against breast cancer shown in some surveys which evaluated total
        vitamin E intake. This is why I recommend that, when selecting a vitamin
        E supplement, you choose one which contains other tocopherols and tocotrienols,
        not just alpha-tocopherol.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">In 2002,
        a researcher at Wake Forest University School of Medicine compiled and
        analyzed the large volume of published data about vitamin E and
      <a href="../conditions/mammograms.htm">breast
        cancer</a> and her comprehensive work was published in the Journal of Nutritional
        Biochemistry.(4)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Taken together,
        the results of the studies presented indicate that certain vitamin E compounds
        found in food confer a significant protective effect, but that commercial
        alpha-tocopherol acetate supplements fail to reduce the incidence of breast
        cancer for most women. The data indicates that some other vitamin E compounds
        in food may account for the dramatic reductions in breast cancer incidence
        when dietary intake levels of vitamin E are measured.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Most studies
        have indicated that the form of vitamin E used in most commercial preparations
        (alpha-tocopherol acetate) has not been shown to protect against
      <a href="../conditions/mammograms.htm">breast cancer</a>.

        cancer cells by as much as 50% in culture.(10,12)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The objective
        of any <a href="../conditions/detoxification-to-fight-cancer.htm">cancer
        therapy</a> is to induce the cancer cells to differentiate in a way which
        promotes programmed cell death (apoptosis). Several studies indicate that
        tocotrienols induce breast cancer cell apoptosis.[13,14]</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">It therefore
        appears that the individual tocopherols and tocotrienols have different
        biological activities as they relate to their effects on health, and it
        is my recommendation that, when choosing a vitamin E product, you select
        one which also contains other tocopherols and tocotrienols, not just alpha-tocopherol.

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">It is especially
        important to take the tocotrienols along with some form of oil or fat-containing
        food. When tocotrienols are taken on an empty stomach, absorption is reduced
        by an average of 50%.</font></p>

        taking tocopherol and/or tocotrienol vitamin E supplements, I would recommend

        are growths on the lens of the eye which cloud the vision. They increase
        the risk of blindness and disability in aging adults. Antioxidants are
        being studied to determine whether they can help delay or prevent cataract
        growth. Observational studies have found that lens clarity, which is used
        to diagnose cataracts, is better in regular users of vitamin E supplements

        do not manufacture vitamin E. We have to get our vitamin E either from

        Allowance (RDA) to get its full benefits. Because vitamin E is fat-soluble,
        it is generally found in fat-rich foods. Can we get enough vitamin E from
        our food without ingesting thousands of fat calories? Which foods should

        other hand, you wish to take vitamin E supplements, then the question
        becomes: how do I pick the right vitamin E product?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">8 different
        compounds, 4 tocopherols and 4 tocotrienols make up the vitamin E family.
        Our food contains all eight compounds. Not so for most vitamin E supplements.
        Most contain only alpha-tocopherol. The best vitamin E products contain
        all 8 members of the vitamin E family - tocopherols plus tocotrienols
        - in their NATURAL form. </font></p>
      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Why is
        the natural form of vitamin E better than the synthetic form?</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">In one
        word, the difference is: availability. Natural vitamin E has roughly twice
        the availability of synthetic vitamin E. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Most vitamins
        are produced as synthetic. Most of the vitamins used to make nutritional
        supplements (tablets, capsules, etc.) are synthetic. Same thing for the
        vitamins used to fortify our cereals, milk, and other foods. Is there
        a problem with that? For most vitamins NO. The synthetic molecules behave
        and look exactly the same as the ones found in our food.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Not so
        for alpha-tocopherol. There is a difference in the molecule, in its potency
        and in the way it behaves in the body.<br>
        </font><br>
        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Here is
        the difference: The d-alpha-tocopherol in our food, the natural form,
        is a single entity, in other words all the molecules are identical. By
        contrast, the synthetic dl-alpha-tocopherol is a mixture of 8 different
        molecular entities, known in the chemical jargon as &quot;stereoisomers&quot;.
        Of these 8, only 1 is identical to the natural form. The other 7 do not
        exist in nature.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Synthetic
        dl-alpha-tocopherol is not harmful. But its value to your body is only
        1/2 of the natural. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Read the
        label - it's the only way to tell if you are getting natural or synthetic.
        Natural will say &quot;d-alpha-tocopherol&quot;, synthetic will say &quot;dl-alpha-tocopherol&quot;.</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">What is
        the health risk of too much vitamin E?</font> </h3>
      <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The health
        risk of too much vitamin E is low (18). </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">A
        recent review of the safety of vitamin E in the elderly concluded that
        taking vitamin E supplements for up to 4 months at doses of 530 mg or
        800 IU (35 times the current RDA) had no negative side-effect on general
        health, body weight, levels of body proteins, lipid levels, liver or kidney
        function, thyroid hormones, amount or kinds of blood cells, and bleeding
        time (19). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">It should
        however be noted that ingestion of total vitamin E products in excess
        of 1200 IU daily may interfere with absorption and metabolism of vitamins
        A and K. But one can get benefits with much lower levels of vitamin E.
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The Institute
        of Medicine has set an upper tolerable intake level for vitamin E at 1,000
        mg (1,500 IU)/day for any form of supplementary alpha-tocopherol because
        the nutrient can act as an anti-coagulant and increase the risk of bleeding
        problems. Upper tolerable intake levels &quot;represent the maximum intake
        of a nutrient that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects
        in almost all individuals in the general population&quot; (5). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">One important
        caveat is for people who are on &quot;blood thinners&quot;. Individuals
        on anti-coagulant therapy or individuals who are vitamin K deficient should
        not take alpha-tocopherol supplements without close medical supervision
        because of the increased risk of hemorrhage. </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">I spend
        a lot of time researching the internet for the best prices on supplements,
        and in my opinion the best prices for high-quality vitamin E can be found

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Vitamin
        E requires the presence of fats and bile in the gut to be absorbed. The
        degree to which vitamin E is absorbed by the body is dependent on the
        total absorption of dietary fat. </font></p>
