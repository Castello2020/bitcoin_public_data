      <p><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">When he
        wasn't filling root canals himself, Dr. Meinig was teaching the technique
        to dentists across the United States at weekend clinics and seminars.
        A few years ago, after having recently retired, Dr. Meinig decided to
        read all 1100+ pages of the detailed research of Dr. Weston Price, (D.D.S),
        a pioneer in the field of root canal therapy.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dr. Weston
        Price's careful, impeccable research took place over a 25 year period
        during the early 1900's. Dr. Price published his work in 2 volumes in
        1923. In 1915, the National Dental Association (which changed its name
        a few years later to &quot;<a href="../oral-chelation/mercury.htm">The
        American Dental Association</a>&quot;) was so impressed with Dr. Price's
        work that they appointed him their first Research Director.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dr. Meinig
        was shocked and startled by Dr. Price's published research. In Dr. Weston
        Price's research was valid documentation of systemic illnesses resulting
        from latent infections lingering in filled roots. </font></p>
      <h3><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So exactly
        what is the problem with root canal therapy?</font></h3>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dr. Meinig
        's book, which is based on the 25 years of research done by Dr. Weston
        Price, discusses how root canals can cause BACTERIA to become entrenched
        inside the structure of teeth and end up causing the largest number of
        diseases ever traced to a single source. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">According
        to Dr. Meinig, a high percentage of <a href="../conditions.htm">chronic
        degenerative diseases</a> can originate from root canals. The most frequent
        were circulatory and <a href="../conditions/heart-disease.htm">heart diseases</a>.
        The next most common diseases were those of the <a href="../conditions/glucosamine.htm">joints
        and arthritis</a>. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Again according
        to Dr. Meinig, there was an unfortunate turn of events whereby very valuable
        information was buried and covered up some 70 years ago by a small group
        of autocratic doctors who just didn't believe - or couldn't grasp - the
        &quot;focal infection theory&quot;. </font></p>

        the &quot;focal infection&quot; theory? </font><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The
        &quot;focal infection&quot; theory states that germs from a central focal

        gum tissues</a> or perhaps tonsils, metastasize to the heart, the eyes,
        the kidneys, lungs or other organs/tissues, establishing the same infection

            thinking in the early 1920's, this theory has been demonstrated and
            proven many times over. However, today, both patients and doctors
            have been <a href="../beliefs.htm">&quot;brain washed&quot; into believing</a>
            that infections are less serious because we now have antibiotics.
            That is not the case. In the case of root-filled teeth, the no-longer-living
            tooth lacks a blood supply flowing to its interior. So circulating
            antibiotics can not impact the bacteria living there because they
            can not get at them.</font> </td>

      <p><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In his
        research, Dr. Price did hundreds of experiments, </font><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">which
        Dr. Meinig discusses in his book &quot;<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0945196199/healingdailyc-20" target="_blank">Root
        Canal Cover-Up</A>&quot;. In one of those experiments, for example, Dr.
        Price removed an infected tooth from a woman who suffered from severe
        arthritis. As soon as he finished with the patient, he implanted the tooth
        beneath the skin of a healthy rabbit. Within 48 hours the rabbit was crippled
        with arthritis. </font></p>
      <p> <font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dr. Meinig
        claims that all root-filled teeth harbor some bacteria and/or other infective
        agents. No matter what technique or material is used, the root-filling
        shrinks microscopically. Another point is key: the bulk of the solid-appearing
        teeth, called the &quot;dentin&quot;, is not solid and actually consists
        of miles of tiny &quot;tubules&quot;. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In a healthy
        tooth, those &quot;tubules&quot; transport a fluid which carries nourishment
        to the inside of the tooth. To give you an idea, it is said that if the
        tubules of a front tooth were stretched out, they would be 3 miles long...
        A root-filled tooth no longer has any fluid circulating through it, but
        the maze of tubules remains. The anaerobic bacteria that live there seem
        remarkably safe from antibiotics.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Microscopic
        organisms hiding in this maze of &quot;tubules&quot; simply migrate into
        the interior of the tooth and set up housekeeping. A filled root seems
        to be a favorite place to start a new colony.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Another
        thing we need to understand is that large, relatively harmless bacteria
        common in the mouth, change and adapt to the new conditions. They shrink
        in size to fit the cramped quarters and even learn how to survive on very
        little food. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Those organisms
        that need oxygen mutate and become able to survive without the presence
        of oxygen. Though this process of adaptation, these formerly friendly/normal
        organisms become pathogenic - capable of producing disease - and more
        virulent and they produce much more potent toxins. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Today's
        bacteriologists are confirming the discoveries of Dr. Price's team of
        bacteriologists. They isolated in root canals the same strains of &quot;streptococcus&quot;,
        &quot;staphylococcus&quot; and &quot;spirochetes&quot;. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Not everyone
        who has ever had a root canal filled is made sick by it. It is believed
        now that every root canal filling does leak and bacteria do invade its
        structure. However the variable factor is the <a href="../conditions/colostrum.htm">vitality
        of the person's immune system</a>. Some people in good health are able
        to control the organisms which escape from their teeth into other areas
        of their body. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is believed
        that this happens because their <a href="../conditions/colostrum.htm">immune
        system's white blood cells</a> and other immune system fighters aren not
        constantly compromised by other <a href="../conditions.htm">diseases</a>.
        In other words, their immune system is capable of preventing those new
        colonies from taking hold in other tissues throughout the body. But over
        time, most people with root canals do seem to develop some kinds of systemic
        symptoms which they did not have before</font>. </p>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The &quot;focal
        infection&quot; theory says that the bacteria can migrate out into surrounding
        tissues where they can travel to other locations in the body via the bloodstream.
        The new location can be any organ or tissue, and the new colony will be
        a new source of infection in a body plagued by chronic or recurrent infections.
        </font></p>
      <h3><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Root canal
        or extraction?</font></h3>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Just extracting
        the tooth is not enough when removal proves necessary. In his research,
        Dr. Price found bacteria in the tissues and bone just adjacent to the
        tooth's root. So what is now recommended is slow-speed drilling with a
        burr, to remove 1 millimeter of the entire bony socket.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">If the
        tooth is dead and it is impossible to revive it, then it would be best
        to have a root canal with a material called &quot;Biocalex&quot;. &quot;Biocalex&quot;
        eliminates many of the organisms and is far less likely to cause complications
        in the short run. If this fails and one is seriously debilitated, it maybe
        necessary to extract the tooth. Check with a biological dentist for this.
        Many biological dentists have alternative methods, such as infra-red lasers,
        which can save the tooth in about 1/4 of the cases.</font></p>
