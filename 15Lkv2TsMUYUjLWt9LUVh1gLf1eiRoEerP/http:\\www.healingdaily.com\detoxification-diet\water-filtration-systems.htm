            1973, British Columbia was considering mandatory fluoridation. They
            gave the job of researching and reporting the topic to Richard Foulkes,
            MD. Foulkes then wrote a 1900 page report and he recommended that
            legislation be passed to make fluoride mandatory in Canada. Based
            on that work, Canada began to fluoridate.</font></td>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Then something
        happened. Little by little, Foulkes found out that the statistics that
        his researchers had based their findings on were largely falsified. It
        took Foulkes several years to uncover the truth, but by 1992, he shocked
        the country by backing down from his original recommendation:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">&quot;I
        now hold a different view. &#133;the fluoridation of community water supplies
        can no longer be held to be either safe or effective in the reduction
        of dental caries&#133;.Therefore, the practice should be abandoned.&quot;-
        Foulkes, 1992</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Foulkes
        is not some tree-hugger from Santa Cruz. He is one of Canada's top scientific
        researchers. Many cities in Canada listened and stopped fluoridating.
        Want to read a first-hand story about lies and greed and disregard for
        human health and crooked deals between government and industry? Read Dr.
        Foulkes stuff.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Another
        pro-fluoride Canadian scientist, Dr. Hardy Limeback, changed his tune
        when he learned that 30-60% of Canadian children now have visible signs
        of overexposure to fluoride, something called &quot;dental fluorosis&quot;.
        In a Toronto Star interview with Michael Downey, Limeback said:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">&quot;Children
        under three should never use fluoridated toothpaste. Or drink fluoridated
        water.&quot; (My favorite source for quality toothpaste products which
        don't contain fluoride can be found <a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-1236392-10273898?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kalyx.com%2Fstore%2Fproddetail.cfm%3FItemID%3D7074.0%26CategoryID%3D11000.0%26SubCatID%3D830.0" target="_blank" >here</a><img src="http://www.qksrv.net/image-1236392-10273898" height="1" width="1" border="0">)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Such research
        also prompted the Canadian Dental Association in 1992 to keep fluoride
        supplements from children of three and under. But attacking fluoride supplement
        pills is just a smokescreen to protect fluoridation of drinking water.
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Most research
        has found all the above ill effects at concentrations even less than the
        standard 1 PPM which exists in most city water. It's not the supplements
        that are killing us; it's the fluoridated water.</font></p>

        is as safe and effective as the <a href="../oral-chelation/mercury.htm">American Dental Association</a> says it is,

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Chlorine
        allowed population centers to spring up and thrive without any epidemic
        outbreaks.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The problem
        with chlorine is that it is a known poison and the safety of drinking
        this poison over the longterm (i.e. your lifetime) is highly uncertain.
        Also, chlorine reacts with water-borne decaying organic matter like leaves,
        bark, sediment, etc. to create a family of chemicals called trihalomethanes
        and other highly toxic substances. Trihalomethanes, or THM's, include
        chemicals such as chloroform, bromoform and dichlorobromethane, all of
        which are extremely carcinogenic even in minute amounts.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Chloramine:<br>
      Chloramine is another substance used now in many larger municipalities (i.e.
      Los Angeles). In systems where the level of chlorine is at the highest acceptable
      level but need still more disinfection, the utility will then add a chlorine/ammonia
      compound. Chloramine is represented as totally safe but with the <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">
      disclaimer to not give chloramine-treated water to your animals or use it
      in your fish tanks (it kills fish)!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Bacteria:<br>
        If you are on a municipal system with chlorination or chloramine, theoretically
        you are protected against bacteria. However, if the level of chlorination
        isn't high enough from the municipal source to your tap, bacteria can
        re-infect the water anywhere along the distribution system. The piping
        system -- whether it's the mains or your house plumbing -- has bacterial
        growth in it happening all the time.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> If you
        are on a spring or a wall, with no chlorine, then you are very vulnerable
        to bacterial contamination. Even the most pure sources cannot prevent
        occasional contamination from animals either dying or defecating in the
        source, or from neighboring pollution (i.e. septic tanks) traveling from
        an adjoining watershed to contaminate the source. Also, the pipes are
        again a source of bacteria.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Many people
        do periodic testing on their well or spring source and rely on this method
        to assure themselves that they have good water. What they don't realize
        is that there are a few problems with testing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">First,
        the test is only good for the moment the sample was taken. Bacteria can
        have &quot;blooms,&quot; if the conditions are right, which potentially
        occur hours, days or weeks after the testing and therefore remain undetected.
        Other casual contamination can occur from animal or human sources, as
        mentioned above, which the test never detected because the sample was
        taken before the contamination occurred.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Second,
        testing can be very expensive to do, depending on what is being tested
        for. Most basic tests cover bacteria (i.e. E. coli), levels of sediment
        and decaying organic matter, and amount of total dissolved solids (mineral
        levels such as calcium, magnesium, iron, sulfur, etc.). With any extra
        testing the price goes up per test. Lead, asbestos and specific chemical
        contaminants are more difficult and therefore much more expensive to test
        for.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Lead:<br>
        Lead is a cumulative toxin that stays in the tissue permanently, especially
        in brain tissue. It also affects a person in relation to their body weight.
        Therefore, an exposed adult can fend off the toxic effects for some time
        but in children, brain and developmental damage occur quickly and permanently.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Asbestos:<br>
        Asbestos is another potential carcinogen that can come either from water
        with naturally occurring asbestos (such as in areas that have a lot of
        serpentine rock) or from asbestos-lined water pipes. Thousands of miles
        of these pipes were laid throughout the U.S. in the 1950's and have yet
        to be replaced.<br>
        Asbestos is so small that it is unfeasible to remove it at the water treatment
        plant. To build such a removal facility is prohibitively expensive and
        would clog up the plant within five years of being in operation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Chemical
        Pollution:<br>
        Chemicals are, for the most part, odorless, colorless and tasteless, therefore
        undetectable. Chlorine is the most predominant chemical in our water.
        Some of the most dangerous chemicals are present only in trace amounts
        (parts per billion) but highly toxic even at these minute levels. Sources
        are usually industrial or commercial, like leaking underground storage
        tanks for gasoline or industrial solvents such as TCE (trichloroethane).
        These leaking toxins end up in the groundwater or in the municipal supply
        through breaks or cracks in the main water pipes. The biggest family of
        these toxics are VOC's or volatile organic contaminants, including various
        plastics, gasolines and petroleum products.<br>
        Next is the herbicidal group such as dioxin (2-4D) and lindane, used as
        a defoliant in modern logging operation and found in many wild and rural
        areas.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Along with
        the herbicides comes the pesticidal group such as DDT, malathione and
        other toxics used in insect eradication and control.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Also, the
        THM's mentioned before are a big pollutant because of the amount of chlorination
        used nationwide. They are a separate class of chemical from chlorine itself.</font></p>

            even death in people with compromised <a href="../conditions/colostrum.htm">immune

        is seven to fourteen microns in size and cryptosporidium is from three
        to 5 microns in size. When the environment becomes inhospitable (like
        the presence of chlorine or the absence of water), both <a href="../colon-kidney-detoxification/parasites.htm">parasites</a>
        can go into the cystic form (like a hard, round impermeable microscopic
        egg). The cyst form is chlorine resistant and very hard to kill.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Municipal
        utilities are unable to completely remove these cysts. Cysts have been
        found in most major municipal water systems in the U.S. Milwaukee, Wisconsin
        had a huge outbreak of cryptosporidia in 1993 that killed over 100 people.
        San Francisco, California has repeatedly tested positive for giardia in
        its chlorinated water that traveled hundreds of miles from the Sierras.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The human
        body is over 70% water. To think that contaminants in our drinking water
        have little or no bearing on our short term and long term health picture
        is to ignore reality. Federal, state and local authorities will strive
        to do their best to insure that we get the best water possible but they
        can't undo all of the damage to our water sources over decades of ignorance
        and abuse.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">It's up
        to us to take personal responsibility to safeguard the water we use to
        drink and prepare our food. That responsibility starts at each household's
        kitchen tap. Removing all contaminants at the kitchen or bathroom taps
        just before consuming the water is the most logical, efficient and economical
        solution to drinking water purification. In this manner, only the drinking
        water is filtered (rather than all the household water). Also, there is
        no possibility for re-contamination (i.e. in a holding tank) after purifying
        the water.</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Using
        filtration systems to rid our tap water from harmful contaminants.</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Bottled
        water in some cases can be of high quality, but its cost makes it a less-than-ideal
        solution. There is also a potential problem with the cloudy plastic (PVC)
        containers from your grocery store as they transfer far too many chemicals
        into the water. Therefore let's look at filters for a better solution.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">&quot;Buy
        a filter or be a filter.&quot; That's one company's slogan.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Today there
        is enough grassroots consciousness about the dangers of tap water that
        cheap carbon filters are now available in any hardware store which attach
        easily to the kitchen faucet. It is likely that such filters get rid of
        most of the chlorine - for a while. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">But to
        really get the resistant biologicals, the fluoride, heavy metals, and
        other contaminants, the customer may consider one of the high-end drinking
        water filters. These cost between $200 and $400 and come in models for
        both over and under the sink.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Names like
        Alpine, MultiPure, and Spectrapure are among the dozens of brand names
        that have come along during the past 20 years. Multipure seems to be out
        front at this time. Everyone claims to be the best, of course, but we
        can find some important similarities in their advertising. When you begin
        to compare the better water filters, you notice common concerns:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Chlorine,
        THMs, chloriform, chloramines, cryptosporidium and giardia lamblia, cysts,
        fluoride, minerals, <a href="pesticides.htm">pesticides</a> and toxic
        chemicals, heavy metals, MTBEs, nitrates. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Killing
        microbials is not a big deal since most of that's been done by chlorine.
        Most contaminants are removed by the better filters. The problem when
        choosing a filter seems to come down to four main concerns: fluoride,
        minerals, THMs, and nitrates. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">It is difficult
        to find one filter that does everything: many reverse osmosis filters
        take out fluoride, but also the healthy minerals. Many of the high-end
        carbon filters will not remove fluoride or nitrates, but leave the healthy
        minerals. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Fluoride
        is obviously an important one. Find out if the filter you are about to
        buy removes fluoride, and what percentage. After what we've learned about
        fluoride, we should expect a filter to remove it, wouldn't you say? Problem
        is: the demand. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Due to
        fluoride advocate propaganda, most Americans don't even realize fluoride
        is bad for them, and therefore don't think about it when considering a
        water filter.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">NSF is
        a third-party non-profit testing agency that has been rating water filters
        for the past 50 years. Always ask - is it NSF-certified? For what? Don't
        be fooled if they say 'NSF-tested.' There's a b</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">ig
        difference between &quot;tested&quot; and &quot;certified&quot;.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Minerals
        is an area of some controversy. You've got the hard water/soft water debate.
        Hard water has more minerals in it, which obviously is better for the
        bones and teeth, and probably for the heart as well. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Most naturopaths
        and holistic nutritionists don't like distilled water because they say
        it leaches minerals from the bones and teeth. In general, that seems logical,
        although some expert say it doesn't make any difference unless the person
        is extremely malnourished. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The truth
        is, no formal studies comparing distilled with mineral water have been
        done, so it's all pretty theoretical. But thinking about the Hunzas and
        their 120-year lifespan that was attributed to the glacial mineral waters
        they drank, one can see the value of minerals in drinking water. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">A high-end
        water filter should take this discussion into consideration and give reasons
        about the importance or unimportance of filtering out certain minerals.
        The water filter I personally prefer myself, is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CJG0KC/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001CJG0KC&linkCode=as2&tag=healingdailyc-20" target="_blank">Berkey
