        NOT the milk which transfers immunity, but only a special form of mother's
        milk, called the 'colostrum'. Furthermore, it is NOT true that the antibodies
        in the mother's milk actually do any good at all for the baby's immune
        system. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> It's a
        long and exciting story, but eventually the scientists discovered that
        ONLY the first few days of a mother's milk have the capability of transferring
        the immune system to the baby. That milk has its own special name: it's
        called 'colostrum'.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">This 'transfer
        factor' was only found in the colostrum, not in the 'regular' mother's
        milk. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> But, when
        researchers examined colostrum, they found, once again, that even though
        it contained lots of antibodies, it was not possible that the baby could
        absorb antibodies through its mouth and stomach. Yet, the antibodies were
        in the baby's body.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Researchers
        were back to trying to solve the puzzle of how the mother's colostrum
        could transfer this great immunity to her baby without actually transferring
        the antibodies themselves.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Since
        colostrum is only produced by the mother in the first few days of breast-feeding,

      <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">There
        are dozens of studies (2,3) which show that human colostrum transferred
        improved immunity not only to babies, but also to adults. You can find
        hundreds of studies on colostrum on <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/" target="_blank">Medline</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Then,
        more research was needed to show that cow colostrum (then pig colostrum
        and colostrum from other mammals too) would also transfer improved immunity,
        not only to human babies but to humans of any age.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">This was
        an exciting discovery. As you can imagine, the cow is subject to many
        of the same invading germs as a human, so when a human drinks colostrum
        from a cow, they can often get a nice boost to their immune system. Then
        the researchers made the very exciting discovery that when older people
        drink colostrum, they have a wonderful return of their immune 'recognition
        factor'.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">A cow's
        milk, right after having given birth, is called colostrum. The colostrum
        passes on the cow's immune system to the baby cow. But the truly amazing
        fact was discovered that the cow's colostrum would ALSO pass on immunity
        to a new-born human. The immunity is not dependent on the species of animal.</font>

        scientists started removing things from the colostrum, just as they had
        removed things from the regular mother's milk, to see what was actually
        transferring the immunity.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> First
        they removed the easy stuff - the <a href="../detoxification-diet/sugar.htm">sugar</a>
        and the fat. The immunity was still transferred. When you have removed
        both the sugar and the fat from milk you have something called 'whey'.
        But there are still many large particles within whey, and they can be
        removed. You have for instance all the many different types of living
        cells in the colostrum. These include the immune system cells of the cow
        (or human). It is possible to remove all these living cells. When you
        do THAT, the immunity still gets transferred. Now, there are no more living
        cells in this colostrum but there are all sorts of large molecules and
        even they can be removed with various machines and techniques. With those
        removed, the immunity was still transferred. Incredible. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">After they
        had filtered out all living cells, and they even filtered out the larger
        individual molecules, researchers found THE 'factor' which transfers immunity.
        It is a very small molecule. You could call it an 'information messenger'.
        It carries information with it, from the mother to the new-born baby (or
        from cow colostrum, properly processed into an adult human). These 'messengers'
        probably are equivalent to several hundreds pages of books.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Remember
        that older people may well have plenty of different types of antibodies
        cells, but their bodies are slow at recognizing what particular bug is
        currently invading their bodies.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> It turns
        out that when an elderly person drinks colostrum, even though the cow
        has not been specifically treated, the person's immune system is greatly
        improved, and it is the recognition factor which is improved.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">So, those
        who wanted to capture the benefits of the transfer factor from colostrum
        determined to freeze dry the colostrum and put it into capsules. Most
        companies who do this remove the milk sugars and the milk fats first,
        leaving what is often called 'whey'. The whey contains the transfer factor
        from that colostrum, but even that material would cause a person to get
        deathly ill if it were injected because the whey still contains many living
        organisms from the cow, and the human body can not use living bovine organisms.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">But if
        whey (or colostrum) is drunk, there is no rejection by the body. The larger
        cells (whether dead or living) are used by the body as food, but those
        tiny transfer factor molecules CAN pass through from the stomach into
        the body, carrying the immune system recognition molecules.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Some experiments
        were done with freezing colostrum. The freezing kills all the living organisms,
        but it does not damage the tiny molecule which is the transfer factor.
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">So, whether
        you drink fresh raw colostrum or take a dried form, the transfer factors
        are available. They are not harmed by simple processing. This is the form
        of most 'colostrum' being sold in the marketplace today. I spend a lot
        of time researching the lowest prices on the internet for supplements,
        and in my opinion, the best price for high quality colostrum can be found

      <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Remember
        that the entire philosophy of our currently drug-oriented medical paradigm
        is to give you some substance (drug) which is basically a poison, a toxin
        carefully designed to be toxic only to the bad bugs. But <br>
        wouldn't it be much better to let the IMMUNE SYSTEM do its job and help
        it along, not with drugs, but with well-researched nutrients which enhance
        the immune system, not attack the bad bugs.</font></p>
      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">In this way
      we can carefully say, but with complete accuracy, that colostrum and transfer
      factor do NOT prevent or cure any disease. Colostrum simply strengthens
      the immune system so that the immune system can prevent or cure disease.
      </font>
      <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">If you
        hear someone claiming that colostrum can cure <a href="detoxification-to-fight-cancer.htm">cancer</a>,
        that is a false and dangerous statement. It is a statement made by an
        ignorant person.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> If some
        substance is claimed to cure or prevent a disease, that is the definition
        of a 'drug' by the Food and Drug Administration, and all drugs must be
        approved the Food and Drug Administration. So, colostrum does NOT prevent
        or cure any disease, it strengthens the immune system.</font></p>
