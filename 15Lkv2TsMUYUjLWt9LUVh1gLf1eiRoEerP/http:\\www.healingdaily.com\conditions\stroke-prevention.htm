        occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked, either by blood clots
        or narrowed blood vessels, or when there is bleeding in the brain. Deprived
        of nutrients, brain nerve cells begin to die within a few minutes. As
        a result, a stroke can cause sensory and vision loss, problems with talking
        and walking, or difficulty in thinking clearly. In many cases, the effects
        of stroke are irreversible.</font></p>

            and are responsible for up to 80% of strokes. As people age, arteries

        When the arteries become plugged, the blood is no longer able to reach
        the brain and stroke results. </font> </p>

        to the brain. This slows blood-flow and can cause clots to form on the
        plaque that narrows or blocks the flow of nutrients and oxygen to the
        brain. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> An embolic
        stroke is caused by a blood clot formed in another part of the body which
        breaks loose, travels through the bloodstream, and then blocks an artery
        carrying nutrients and oxygen to the brain. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> A hemorrhagic
        stroke takes place when an artery supplying blood bleeds into the brain.
        The ruptured blood vessel prevents needed oxygen and nutrients from reaching
        brain cells. One type of hemorrhagic stroke is caused when an artery which
        has weakened over time, bulges (called an aneurysm) and suddenly bursts.</font></p>

            In one study (3), UK researchers reviewed 287 trials of treating high-risk
            individuals with anti-platelets such as aspirin. The 135,000 patients
            involved either had cardiovascular disease or conditions which predisposed

      </table>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The investigators,
        all part of a team known as the Anti-thrombotic Trialists' Collaboration
        (ATC), looked at whether or not the anti-platelets cut patients' risk
        of heart attack, stroke and death from a cardiovascular cause.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">They found
        that, overall, any anti-platelet therapy led to a 1/3 drop in heart attack
        risk, while the risk of non-fatal stroke fell by 25% and cardiovascular
        death risk declined by 16%.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Aspirin
        was the most widely studied anti-platelet. Based on this review, the evidence
        &quot;supports daily doses of aspirin in the range of 75-150 mg for the
        long-term prevention of serious vascular events in high risk patients.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">However
        the risks and benefits of aspirin therapy vary for each person. While
        the benefits may be significant for people who are at higher risk, healthy
        individuals should weigh the pros and cons of aspirin therapy carefully,
        in my opinion. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">First,
        if you're going to start an aspirin regimen, I would recommend you take
        the <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=2sO3HF3YmRA&offerid=43440.90918013&type=10&subid=" target="_blank">baby

        - 81 mgs - not the adult aspirin. Whatever benefits aspirin offers can
        be derived from the 81 mgs dosage. Even then, unless you are in the high-risk
        category, I would advise you not to take aspirin more often than every
        other day. The problem with aspirin is the risk of bleeding, gastrointestinal
        hemorrhage and a possible increased risk of renal failure.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Taking
        aspirin isn�t advised during a stroke, because not all strokes are caused
        by blood clots. Most strokes are caused by clots, but some are caused
        by ruptured blood vessels. Taking aspirin could actually make these bleeding
        strokes more severe.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">If you&#146;re
        taking aspirin and you must undergo even a simple surgical procedure or
        dental extraction, you must tell the surgeon or dentist your aspirin dosage.</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Vitamin
        E to reduce the risk of stroke?</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Vitamin
        E may have a protective effect against ischemic strokes, researchers reported
        on April 20 2000 at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology
        in Toronto, Canada. Their study showed that vitamin E supplements can
        reduce stroke risk by 53%. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Also, researchers
        from Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center (CPMC) of New York Presbyterian
        Hospital found a person's risk of stroke is reduced by 50% if he or she
        takes a vitamin E supplement each day. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">So there
        appears to be some protective effect offered by vitamin E, although it
        must be said that not all the evidence is conclusive in this regard. In
        my opinion the best price for high quality vitamin E on the internet can
        be found <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=2sO3HF3YmRA&offerid=20052.90608340&type=10&subid=" target="_blank">here</a><img alt="icon" width="1" height="1" src="http://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=2sO3HF3YmRA&bids=20052.90608340&type=10&subid=">.</font></p>
