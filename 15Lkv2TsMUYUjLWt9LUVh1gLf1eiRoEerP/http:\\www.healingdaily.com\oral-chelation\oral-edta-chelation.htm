        toxic metals from the blood. Studies have shown that as people age they
        continuously accumulate toxic metals: lead, <a href="mercury.htm">mercury</a>, aluminum, iron, cadmium,
        and arsenic, among others. The accrual of these toxins invites an increased
        risk for various diseases, especially <a href="../conditions/heart-disease.htm">heart
        disease</a>. The less of these metals we have in our bodies, the more
        likely we are to be physiologically healthy or simply feel good, and the
        lower our risk for <a href="../conditions/heart-disease.htm">heart disease</a>.
        Because EDTA is so effective at removing unwanted metals and other minerals
        from the blood, it has been the standard, FDA-approved treatment for lead,
        <a href="mercury.htm">mercury</a>, aluminum, and cadmium poisoning for more than 50 years. EDTA

        varicose veins, and more by inhibiting blood clotting. Because EDTA inhibits
        blood clotting so well, by tying up calcium, it is routinely added to
        blood samples that are drawn for testing purposes. Blood can't clot if
        the calcium is tied up. Inhibition of blood clotting can help prevent
        stroke, heart attack, phlebitis (painful inflammation of a vein), pulmonary
        embolism (potentially fatal clot to the lung), or varicose veins. Generally,
        these conditions are associated with aging. </font></p>

        EDTA lowers blood calcium, it also stimulates the parathyroid gland to
        produce a hormone called parathormone. This hormone is responsible for
        removing calcium from places such as the inside of arteries and depositing
        it in the right places, such as bone. So, IV chelation makes you physiologically
        younger because it moves calcium from your arteries and makes your bones
        stronger. </font></p>

        of treatments necessary (generally about 20 to 50 sessions) depends on
        the individual's condition. Typical candidates for IV chelation are people
        who have been diagnosed with serious atherosclerosis, heavy metal poisoning,
        or symptoms of vascular occlusion or significant calcification of tissues.
        A series of needed sessions of IV EDTA will cost about $2,000 to $4,000.

        add up and can definitely achieve similar benefits compared with IV chelation.
        Over the course of 5 or 6 weeks, regular use of oral EDTA can be as beneficial
        as a single IV EDTA session.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Oral EDTA
        is appropriate for people whose condition is less serious and does not
        demand prompt attention. It is especially desirable for preventing or
        delaying the onset of the many complications of the diseases related to
        atherosclerotic plaque buildup, including <a href="../conditions/heart-disease.htm">heart
        disease</a>, heart attack, <a href="../conditions/stroke-prevention.htm">stroke</a>,

        anyone opt for invasive, less lasting options, such as angioplasty or
        coronary bypass surgery, when a safe and effective alternative for restoring normal or near-normal
        circulatory functioning of the vasculature exists? It seems that EDTA
        should be the first line of treatment, with the invasive surgical procedures
        as the last-resort alternative, not the other way around. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Few, if
        any, would opt for surgical treatment if they were aware and informed
        about the value of EDTA chelation. However, there are organizations and
        institutions that see political gain in cloaking the truth about EDTA's
        benefits and punishing advocates of its use.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Except
        for abortion, it is unlikely that any other issue in modern medicine has
        been more highly politicized than that of EDTA chelation therapy. It is
        clear that most of the opposition to EDTA is due to the threat that this
        therapy represents, not to patients' health, but to the bank balances
        of orthodox physicians (those who specialize in coronary bypass surgery,
        for example), hospitals, and <a href="../conditions/pharmaceutical-companies.htm">pharmaceutical
        companies</a>. Conventional treatment of cardiovascular diseases is big
        business in the United States, bringing in tens of billions of dollars
        each year. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">You can
        find out more about how public relations firms shape and manipulate the
        public's beliefs on the &quot;<a href="../beliefs.htm">Why you believe
        what you believe</a>&quot; page.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Each coronary
        bypass surgery might cost $50,000 or even up to $100,000; each angioplasty
        costs about $15,000; drugs for reducing cholesterol, lowering high blood
        pressure, and normalizing heart rhythm bring the <a href="../conditions/pharmaceutical-companies.htm">pharmaceutical
        industry</a> hundreds of millions of dollars each year. And these are
        only a few examples. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> By contrast,
        the cost of chelation therapy, cited above, is minimal. The degree to
        which this therapy reduces the need for conventional therapies, and therefore
        the incomes of those previously mentioned, is the degree to which they
        feel threatened by it. Powerful medical societies and government agencies,
        for example, lobby to keep the knowledge about EDTA's benefits under wraps.
        They have harassed, vilified, and smeared physicians who have used EDTA
        chelation to help their patients and, in some cases, have even driven
        them from their profession. The reason everyone doesn't know about EDTA
        chelation therapy is politics (= money). <br>

            progress rapidly, unless healthy interventions are made: diet change,
            appropriate exercise, and effective supplementation. </font></td>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> EDTA chelation
        therapy can successfully remove plaque from arteries, veins, and capillaries
        and restore blood flow to normal or near-normal functioning - often even
        in severe cases. Removing the plaque allows the blood, laden with oxygen
        and nutrients, to fuel hungry body cells and tissues for optimal functioning.
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> For those
        who have not yet reached the symptomatic stage, preventing the onset of
        atherosclerotic diseases is a desirable goal. Oral EDTA chelation can
        be used as a preventive measure, because it can retard the plaque buildup
        that progresses with aging, and it may even reverse plaque buildup in
        many cases. Think of it as an insurance policy. EDTA may very well be
        able to slow, or even reverse, to some extent, the aging of the cardiovascular
        system. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> For those
        whose atherosclerosis is severe enough that they are experiencing symptoms,
        EDTA chelation may not only keep them from falling under the horrific
        coronary bypass surgery knife, but offer them instead the experience of renewed energy, clearer
        thinking, improved sexuality, warming of feet and hands, ability to walk
        or hike pain-free, stronger bones, diminished or eradicated chest pain,
        improved cholesterol, reduced blood pressure, or improved vision, among
        many other benefits. Restoring blood flow can be like being born again!
        It can be like a new life for you to enjoy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> The EDTA
        product I recommend can be found <a href="id=2sO3HF3YmRA&offerid=137425.24050&type=2&subid=0" target="_blank">here
        </a>. Because EDTA removes heavy metals from the body, it is important
        to supplement your diet with a good multi-mineral supplement while taking
        EDTA, to avoid any mineral deficiency, especially in zinc. I recommend
        you supplement your diet with a multi-vitamin/mineral supplement, as well
        as a calcium-magnesium-zinc supplement. You can find a list of high quality
        multimineral supplements at the lowest price on the internet <a href="id=2sO3HF3YmRA&offerid=137425.33042&type=2&subid=0" target="_blank">here
