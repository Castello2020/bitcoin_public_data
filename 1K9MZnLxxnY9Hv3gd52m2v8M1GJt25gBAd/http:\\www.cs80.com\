  Far back in the mists of ancient time, before microcomputers and their
offspring of digital signal processors became the basis for modern
synthesizer voicing, there existed a rich, sonic world comprised purely of
analog waveform generators, filters, transient generators and amplifiers.
This was the golden age of electronic music that began inconspicuously in
the 1920s with the Theremin and evolved gradually into the transistor
circuits that defined the first Moog modular synthesizer.  After Wendy
Carlos and Robert Moog showed the world what could be done with the quirky
but operational hardware in the hands of a skilled musician with the 1966
release of Switched-On Bach, electronic music seemed to be the "in" thing
of the fading 60s and most of the 70s.  Not electronic as in the jangling
techno beat and sampled-to-Pluto-and-back of the trance/dance/rave scene
as is today, but a purer electronic, when the goal was to explore all of
the sonic landscape with the synthesizer, from classical to
atmospheric.<p>

  In the early 1970s, the concept of the rock concert was rapidly growing
from the club-and-theatre circuit of the 1960s into the stadium and arena
venue. With these musicians came the desire to bring the electronic sound
on stage with them, a thing previously impossible due to the difficulty in
transforming the studio synthesizer into a real-time performance
instrument.  Moog Music unveiled their Minimoog in 1971, and the rush was
on.  Fat leads and powerful basses made it to the stage, but still lacking
in the minds of many performers was the polyphonic synthesizer that would
complete the gap.<p>

  Moog, Korg, Yamaha (just to name a few) were well aware of the desire to
get polyphony on stage.  Moog had their Polymoog project underway, and
Korg had the Delta/Sigma coming out, but Yamaha drew on their Electone
organ engineering team to come up with <i>the</i> musician's polyphonic
synthesizer.  Taking 3 years to develop, Yamaha took the layout of the
EX-42 triple-manual+pedalboard organ and fashioned a
synthesizer--<b>THE</b> synthesizer of which arguably no equal has yet
been seen in terms of performance potential: <a 
href="http://www.sospubs.co.uk/sos/feb00/articles/yamahagx1.htm">The 
Yamaha GX1</a>.<p>

  Of course, the GX1 weighed half a tonne and listed at $60,000 (in 1976
dollars!), but the elite musicians of the day such as Keith Emerson and
Stevie Wonder managed to bring them along on tour.  Even so, the GX1 was
known to be a R&D prototype of which about 70 machines were built, most
never leaving Japan.  The GX1 had discrete (individual transistors)
circuits, which accounted for much of its bulk.  Yamaha developed those
circuits in discrete form and placed them in epoxy-filled 'potting 
boxes' to create pre-calibrated submodules.  These modules are also 
found in the SY-1 and SY-2 solo synthesizers, as well as the CSY-1 
and CSY-2 organs.<p>

  <b>Update:</b> In January 2004, the author managed to reverse-engineer
several of these submodules and made an interesting discovery: they are
<i>not</i> discrete versions of the IG-series chips Yamaha used in the CS
series. They are different circuit topologies entirely.  Plans are
underway to open a new page on this site detailing what is actually in the
submodules.  Nevertheless, higher level concepts such as the dual voicing
and realtime performance controls were tested on the GX1 before Yamaha
advanced to the next phase of their performing keyboard plan: the
CS-series.<p>

  The CS-series started with the CS-50 in 1976, a four-voice polyphonic
keyboard that was the first to feature the integrated-circuit versions of
their previously discrete oscillators, filters, amplifiers and envelope
generators.  Yamaha also introduced the pressure-sensitive keyboard, which
had been previously been a custom-only feature on very few keyboards.
Yamaha tested their new chipset with the CS-50 for a year while designing
their real goals: the CS-60 and CS-80.  The CS-60 is an eight-voice
machine that uses the same circuitry as the CS-50 and adds the unique
Yamaha pitch ribbon.  The ribbon itself was nothing new, but the method
Yamaha employed that allowed the "zero-point" to be wherever the ribbon
was touched intially was an instant hit.<p>

  The CS-80, flagship of their new CS-series synthesizer line, represents
Yamaha's attempt to cram as much of the GX1 into a single-manual keyboard
as possible.  More portable though still weighing in at 100kg, the CS-80
had dual eight-voice polyphony and a new feature never before attempted:
polyphonic initial and aftertouch. The number of modulation controls
assigned to working with the keyboard makes the CS-80 the best musician's
keyboard ever created.  Yamaha's own DX1 that arrived 7 years later
as the flagship of the DX synthesizer line is the only keyboard that is
equal in capability derived from the keyboard, and the DX1 owes this to
the CS-80.<p>

  One man purchased a CS-80 in 1976 and that event changed his music
from that moment on.  The man's name is Vangelis, a Greek composer who
rose to fame with his academy award-winning score to Chariots of Fire in
1981--composed mostly using the CS-80 and a piano.  Vangelis was already
working on at that time what is still considered to be one of the best
film scores ever recorded, the soundtrack to director Ridley Scott's
"Blade Runner", a film that in itself changed the way science-fiction
films were made. The haunting, articulated notes that seem to permeate the
smog of the film's future vision of Los Angeles, the rising swell of lush
chords as a spinner takes off, the sultry lead and dark strings of the
Blade Runner's Blues--<i>this</i> is the power of the CS-80, and why every
CS-80 that yet exists in the 21st century deserves to live on.<p>

the cover of the CS-80, here is my article on aging chips and capacitors,
