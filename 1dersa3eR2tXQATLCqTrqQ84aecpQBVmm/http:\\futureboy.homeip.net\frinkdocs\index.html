  <P>
   Frink is a practical calculating tool and programming language designed to
   make physical calculations simple, to help ensure that answers come out
   right, and to make a tool that's really useful in the real world.  It
   tracks units of measure (feet, meters, kilograms, watts, etc.) through all
   calculations, allowing you to mix units of measure transparently, and helps
   you easily verify that your answers make sense.  It also contains a large
   <A HREF="/frinkdata/units.txt">data file</A> of physical quantities,
   freeing you from having to look them up, and freeing you to make
   effortless calculations without getting bogged down in the mechanics.
  </P>

  <P>
   Perhaps you'll get the best idea of what Frink can do if you skip down to
   the <A HREF="#SampleCalculations">Sample Calculations</A> further on this
   document.  Come back up to the top when you're done.
  </P>

  <P>
   Frink was named after one of my personal heroes, and great scientists of
   our time, the brilliant Professor John Frink.  Professor Frink noted,
   decades ago:

   <LI><A HREF="#HowFrinkIsDifferent">Tracks units of measure</A> (feet,
    meters, tons, dollars, watts, etc.) through all calculations and allows
    you to add, subtract, multiply, and divide them effortlessly, and makes
    sure the answer comes out correct, even if you mix units like gallons and
    liters.

   <LI><A HREF="#NumericTypes">Arbitrary-precision math</A>, including huge
    integers and floating-point numbers, rational numbers (that is, fractions
    like 1/3 are kept without loss of precision,) complex numbers, and

  <H2>Using Frink</H2>
  <H3><A NAME="TryAsYouRead">Try as you read</A></H3>
  <P>
   If you want to try the calculations as you're reading,
   <A HREF="/fsp/frink.fsp" TARGET="_blank">click here to open the web-based
    interface in a new window.</A>  The web-based interface gives hints for
   new users, which may make it the easiest way to learn how to use Frink.
  </P>
  
  <P>
   If you have a frames-enabled browser, and you don't see a Frink sidebar to
   the left, you can also <A HREF="frinkframe.html">click here to try Frink in
    a sidebar</A> as you read this.  (The sidebar mode doesn't give as many
   hints, though.)
  </P>

  <H3><A NAME="JavaWebStart">Download using Java Web Start</A></H3>

  <P>
   This method of installation requires Java Web Start, which is installed
   with recent versions of Java.  Using Java Web Start <DEL>is</DEL> used to
   be a great way to run Frink if you don't need to run programs from the
   command-line.  (But you <EM>can</EM> still write and run programs from the
   GUI using Java Web Start!)  If you do want to run programs from the
   command-line, see the <A HREF="#DownloadingFrink">Downloading Frink</A>
   section below.  Java Web Start will allow you to automatically get the
   latest version of Frink and will update Frink automatically when new
   versions are available.
  </P>

  <H4>Installation Steps</H4>
  <OL>
   <LI>If you <EM>don't</EM> have a recent version of Java, you can <A
     TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://java.com/">get it from Sun.</A>
    (Link opens in new window.)
     
   <LI>(<I>Optional</I>) If you've never installed anything with Java Web
   Start, please read and understand the <A TARGET="_blank"
   HREF="faq.html#AboutSecurityWarnings">FAQ entry about the security warnings
   you'll see</A> (link opens in new window) and your alternate download
    options.

   <LI><B>Warning:</B> If you're using Java version 7u51 or later, they
    silently and incompatibly decided to change default security settings so
    you'll need to open the Java Control Panel to allow Frink to run.
    Otherwise you will see a dialog that says something like "Application
    blocked by security settings" or "Your security settings have blocked a
    self-signed application from running."  (This silent change was made after
    12+ years of the aforementioned method working fine.)
    <P>
     The best way to allow Frink to run is to follow the instructions <A
     HREF="https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/upcoming_exception_site_list_in"
     TARGET="_blank">listed here</A> and add <CODE>http://futureboy.us</CODE>
     to the exceptions list in step 7.
     
     <P><B>Note:</B> As always, Java's instructions and installer are
     terrible, and the Java Control panel on Windows may actually be under
     your Start menu as <CODE>Java</CODE> | <CODE>Configure Java</CODE>, or
     under your Windows Control Panel, or if you start your Control Panel and
     don't see it, Java's control panel will be hidden under "32-bit Control
     Panel."  And sometimes you'll have multiple versions of Java installed
     and the one that gets started isn't the latest version. I had
     <EM>lots</EM> of problems until I manually uninstalled <EM>all</EM> the
     versions of Java on the Windows machine, reinstalled the latest version,
     and uninstalled Frink and reinstalled it.  Sorry about that.  Windows and
     Java integration is terrible.

   <LI>Click one of the options below to install Frink with either interface
    (see the screenshots below):
    <UL>
     <LI><A HREF="/frinkjar/frink.jnlp">Swing Interface</A>
      Prettier.  Requires Java 1.5.0 or later.

     <LI>New, experimental <A HREF="/frinkjar/frinkwithlibs.jnlp">Swing
       Interface with standard libraries</A>.  This is a version of Frink that
      contains a variety of <A HREF="/fsp/frinklibs.fsp">standard
       libraries</A> and useful programs.  It's a larger download, but the
      standard libraries change somewhat infrequently and will only get
      downloaded when changes are made.
      
     <LI><A HREF="/frinkjar/frinkawt.jnlp">AWT Interface</A> -
      Not as pretty as the Swing mode, but will run on older JVMs.
    </UL>
    <P>
     You can install both, actually, with no problems.
    </P>
  </OL>

  <P>
   If you've read those <A TARGET="_blank"
   HREF="faq.html#AboutSecurityWarnings">security notes</A>, and understood
   what the security messages are telling you, and the warnings are still too
   scary, (and you don't want to send me the $400 per year it would cost me to
   remove at least one of them,) and you'd rather download a limited version
   of Frink that runs in the most restrictive security sandbox (breaking some
   features), then <A HREF="/frinkjar/frinklimited.jnlp">click here to install
   a limited version of Frink.</A> Again, please read those <A TARGET="_blank"
   HREF="faq.html#AboutSecurityWarnings">security notes</A> to see what
   features will be unavailable if you choose this option.  You can always get
   the full version of Frink later if you need those features.
  </P>

  <P>
   If someone wants to send me the $400 necessary to get a VeriSign "Code
   Signing Cerificate", I'll sign it just for you.  It won't work any
   differently.)
  </P>

  <P>
   If you have an old version of Java Web Start, Frink will probably show up
   in the "Downloaded Applications" section of the Java Web Start panel which
   isn't immediately visible.  Use the <CODE>View</CODE> menu option to select
   the Downloaded Applications tab.  It will also let you create a Frink
   shortcut on your desktop or in your start menu.  The defaults in Java Web
   Start before version 1.4.2 are set oddly so that the <EM>second</EM> time
   you run Frink, it will ask you if you want to make a shortcut.
  </P>

  <P>
   If you're using Linux, and Sun's Java release, only Java version 1.5 beta
   and later will install shortcuts onto your desktop and start menu.  Highly
   recommended.
  </P>
  
  <H2><A NAME="UserInterfaceOptions">User Interface Options</A></H2>
  
  <H3><A NAME="SwingUserInterface">Swing User Interface</A></H3>
  
  <P>
   The Swing version allows mixed fonts and colors.  Due to some performance
   bugs in Sun's Swing implementation (like large paragraphs taking several
   minutes to paint every time you resize or scroll,) it can be problematic.
   As of 2008-08-25, the capabilities of the Swing and AWT interfaces are
   about the same.

  <P>
   The AWT user interface has several modes.  The two-line conversion mode and

  <P>
   If your web browser supports Java 1.3.1 or later, try the <A
   HREF="FrinkApplet.html">Java Applet-based interface</A>.  It looks and
   works just like the GUI above, but it requires you to be connected to the
   internet and must download for each session.

   Your browser must support Java 1.3.1 or later, or you will need to get <A
    TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://java.com/">download a newer version of Java
    from Sun.</A>  It is extremely highly recommended that you have Java 1.5.0
   update 2 or later.  This has been tested with Internet Explorer, Netscape
   4.x, Netscape 6+, Mozilla (Windows and Linux), and Opera.
  </P>

  <P>
   If you don't have a recent version of Java, you can <A TARGET="_blank"

  </P>
  
  <P>
   (The certificate is just signed by me, so you'll get a warning.
   Network access is necessary to use the network portions of Frink... like
   currency calculations, translations, etc.  If you deny network access, the
   non-network parts of Frink will work just fine.  If someone wants to send
   me the $400 necessary to get a VeriSign "Code Signing Cerificate", I'll
   sign it just for you.  It won't work any differently.)
  </P>
  
  <H3><A NAME="MinimalistWebInterface">Minimalist Web Interface</A></H3>
  <P>
   If the applet doesn't work for you, try the
   <A HREF="/fsp/frink.fsp">minimalist web interface.</A>
   The minimalist interface is intentionally very spare but it
   should allow you to use the latest version of the Frink engine.  It is now
   powered by <A HREF="fspdocs.html">Frink Server Pages</A>.
  </P>

  <P>
   In this web interface, you can enter any Frink expression in the "From:"
   box.  If you also enter a value in the "To:" box, it is treated as the
   right-hand side of a conversion expression (that is, to the right of the
   conversion operator <CODE>-&gt;</CODE> )
  </P>

  <P>
   Thus, to convert 10 meters to feet, you can enter
   <CODE CLASS="input">10&nbsp;meters</CODE> in the "From" box and
   <CODE CLASS="input">feet</CODE> in the "To" box, or, equivalently, type
   <CODE CLASS="input">10&nbsp;meters&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;feet</CODE> in the
   "From" box and leave the "To" box empty.  It does exactly the same thing.
  </P>

   If you're just using Frink for interactive calculations, or are happy using

   the command-line, see the 
   <A HREF="#JavaWebStart">Java Web Start</A> section above.

   (If you're looking for an installer for handheld devices, like Android, see
   the <A HREF="#SmallDevices">Small Devices</A> section below.)
  </P>

  <P>
   If you want to write full Frink programs <EM>and</EM> run them from
   the commmand-line, you will need to get your own copy of Frink, and
   have a Java 1.1 or later runtime environment on your machine,
   1.4.2+ is recommended as it's less buggy.  The date calculations in
   anything before Java 1.3 are rather bad,) you may download the

  <P>
   On many platforms, you can start Frink in the AWT GUI mode by simply
   double-clicking the <CODE>frink.jar</CODE> file.
  </P>

  <P>If you want to run Frink in command-line mode, here are a couple of
   sample scripts you can use to start Frink.  <EM>You will need to edit them
    to match the paths on your system!</EM>

  <P>
   In the samples below, you may need to replace <CODE>java</CODE> or
   <CODE>javaw</CODE> with the full path to your Java Virtual Machine,
   whatever that may be.  Note that <CODE>javaw</CODE> is a Windows-only
   command that simply starts Java without opening a console window.  You'll
   probably replace this with <CODE>java</CODE> on other platforms.
  </P>

  <P>
   The most general way to start Frink is to launch the
   <CODE>frink.gui.FrinkStarter</CODE> class.  (The above starter scripts use
   this class.) This allows many command-line options to configure how Frink
   starts:

   For those who want a standalone, all-in-one Frink download, there is an
   <EM>experimental, unsupported</EM> version of Frink compiled for Windows
   only using an experimental, unreleased version of the GNU compiler for Java
   (GCJ).  This only works in command-line mode, but requires no other
   downloads and may start up more quickly.  It is appropriate for quick
   calculations and command-line scripts.  Not all functions may work.  Let me
   know about parts that do or don't work for you.  It is compressed with UPX
   to reduce the file size (possibly at the cost of some startup time.)  This
   version starts up more quickly than the Sun JVM, but runs programs about
   5-6 times slower.

   You should have Java 1.5.0 update 2 or later to run this.  It'll work with
   other versions of Java, but they have known bugs.  If you don't have it, <A
   TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://java.com/">download a newer version of Java
   from Sun.</A> After installation of Java 1.5, you should immediately also
   go into your Java Control Panel/Java Preferences and make sure that Java is
   actually configured to <EM>use</EM> JDK 1.5.0 (also called J2SE 5.0) when
   launching applets and JNLP (Java Web Start) files!  <EM>It does not appear

  </P>
    
  <P>
   Note that when Frink first starts up as a widget, it might appear to hang.
   This is because Sun's Java installation pops up a dialog box <EM>behind
   other windows</EM> that asks you if you want to trust the Frink applet.
   You may have to hunt for this window.  You can choose to "always trust" the
   application so you don't have this problem repeatedly.  This was supposedly
   fixed in Java 1.5, but it still seems flaky, because Java 1.5 seems not to
   be used by default.  Note the above paragraph which shows how to make sure
   your installation is actually <EM>using</EM> Java 1.5 or later.

  <P>
   It should be noted that using the <A HREF="#JavaWebStart">Java Web

   There are several things you can do to make your Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
   run Frink more quickly:
  </P>

  <UL>
   <LI>
    Java 8 contains my algorithmic improvements to make large integers work
    <EM>much</EM> more quickly for multiplication, base conversion, etc.  (It
    only took the Java people 11+ years to import my patches.)
    
   <LI>For long-running programs, if you're using Sun's Java Virtual Machine
    (JVM), use the <CODE>-server</CODE> command-line switch to the
    <CODE>java</CODE> executable.  This starts the Server VM which optimizes
    more aggressively and often improves performance of long-running programs
    by a factor of 2, but at the expense of increased start-up time.  Note that
    the server VM may not be available if you just downloaded the Java Runtime
    Environment (JRE), and not the full Java Software Development Kit (SDK).

   <LI>If you're <EM>not</EM> starting long-running programs, and want the
    fastest start-up time, <EM>don't</EM> use the Server VM.
    
   <LI>Like all Java programs, Frink can often run much faster if you allow
    the JVM to use more memory at startup, leading to less-frequent garbage
    collection.  In Sun's implementation, this is achieved by passing the
    options <CODE>-Xmx<I>&lt;size&gt;</I></CODE> (for maximum Java heap size)
    and <CODE>-Xms<I>&lt;size&gt;</I></CODE> (for initial Java heap size) to
    the <CODE>java</CODE> executable.  The <I>size</I> arguments are something
    like <CODE>256M</CODE> for 256 megabytes.  Note that this is at the expense
    of other processes running on your system, and should be used sparingly
    because allocating too much memory may cause your system to swap
    excessively or run out of memory if set too high.
    
   <LI>(<I>Probably obsolete</I>) If you're doing mostly large integer work
   (factoring, primality testing, other number theory,) where most of the
   runtime is spent in mathematical operations on very large integers, the <A
   HREF="http://www.kaffe.org/">Kaffe</A> Virtual Machine compiled with the
   incredibly fast <A HREF="https://gmplib.org/">GMP</A> numerical libraries
   works literally thousands of times faster than Sun's VM and its horribly
   na&iuml;ve algorithms.
    
    <P><B>Warning:</B> Make sure that GMP is compiled with the
     configure option <CODE>--enable-alloca=malloc-reentrant</CODE> or you'll
     blow out the stack and crash with very large integers.

    <P><B>Warning:</B> As of the 2004-07-18 release of Kaffe, you must now
     explicitly pass the <CODE>-Xnative-big-math</CODE> argument when running

   If you use a HTTP or FTP proxy server, you need to add some options to your
   command lines (say, right after the word <CODE>java</CODE>) to use the
   proxy if you want certain functions to work.  HTTP and FTP are used for the
   following:

  <H2><A NAME="HowFrinkIsDifferent">How Frink is Different</A></H2>
  <P>
   Frink is, first and foremost, designed to make it easy to figure out
   things.  If there's a unifying principle in Frink, it could be considered
   to be the <EM>normalization of information</EM>.  I'm trying to
   simplify and unify the representation of data so that you can perform all
   sorts of interesting operations on them.  Whatever that means.
  </P>

  <P>
   Frink is optimized for doing quick, off-the-cuff calculations with a
   minimum of typing, primarily so it can be used with handheld devices which
   can make text entry difficult (especially symbols).  This doesn't mean that
   Frink is unsuitable for doing large, very high accuracy calculations.  It
   does those well, too, and the complicated calculations look just like the
   simple ones.
  </P>

  <P>
   To give an example, Frink represents <EM>all</EM> numerical quantities as
   not simply a number, but a number and the units of measurement that
   quantity represents.  So you can enter things such as "3 feet" or "40
   acres" or "4 tons", and add, subtract, multiply, etc. these things
   together.  Frink will track the resulting quantities through all
   calculations, eliminating a large category of errors.  You can add feet,
   meters, or rods all in the same calculation and the details are handled
   transparently and correctly.
  </P>

  <P>
   It also knows the ways that these units are interrelated-- a length times a
   length is an area; length<SUP>3</SUP> is a volume (if you believe in the
   hypothetical Z axis); mass times distance times acceleration is energy.  If
   you know something in one system of measurement you can convert it to any
   other system of measurement.
  </P>

  <P>
   All units are standardized and normalized into combinations a small number
   of several "Fundamental Dimensions" that cannot be reduced any further.
   These are completely arbitrary and configurable but are currently:
  </P>
   
  <TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=3 SUMMARY="Fundamental Units">

  </TABLE>

  <P>
   Look at the <A HREF="/frinkdata/units.txt">data file</A> for these
   definitions (and my editorializing on the boneheadedness of many these
   choices.)  The data file recursively defines all measurements in terms of
   the fundamental units.
  </P>

  <P>
   An exponent can be attached to each dimension.  For example, an area is
   length * length which might be represented as <CODE>meters^2</CODE>.  Of
   course, a negative exponent indicates <EM>division</EM> by that quantity,
   so meters/second will be displayed as <CODE>m s^-1</CODE>, or acceleration
   (which can be represented as meters per second per second) is represented
   as <CODE>m s^-2</CODE>.
  </P>

  <H2><A NAME="NumericTypes">Numeric Types</A></H2>
  <P>
   Numeric values in Frink are represented in one of three ways:
  </P>

  <DL>
   <DT>Integer</DT> <DD>An arbitrarily large number with no decimal part.
   Represented as a number with no decimal point, (<I>e.g.</I>
   <CODE>1000000000</CODE>) or the special "exact exponent" form
   <CODE>1ee9</CODE>.  An integer can also contain underscores for better
   readability, <I>e.g.</I> <CODE>1_000_000_000</CODE></DD>
   
   <DT>Rational</DT>
   <DD>An arbitrarily large number which can be written as
    integer/integer ( such as <CODE>1/3</CODE> or <CODE>22/7</CODE> ).
    Rational numbers are first reduced to smallest terms; that is,
    <CODE>2/10</CODE> is stored as <CODE>1/5</CODE> and <CODE>5/5</CODE> is
    stored as the integer <CODE>1</CODE></DD>
   
   <DT>Floating Point</DT>
   <DD>An arbitrary-precision floating-point number.
    Currently, the number of decimal places calculated or displayed is limited
    to 20 for efficiency reasons.  Any number containing a decimal point is a
    floating-point number, such as <CODE>1.</CODE> or <CODE>1.01132</CODE>, as
    well as any approximate exponential such as <CODE>2e10</CODE> or
    <CODE>6.02e23</CODE>.</DD>

   <DT>Complex Numbers</DT>
   <DD>Complex numbers are any number with an imaginary part.  The imaginary
    unit is specified by the symbol <CODE>i</CODE>.  For example, <CODE>40 +
     3 i</CODE>.  The real and imaginary parts of a complex number can be any
    of the numerical types listed above.</DD>

   <DT>Intervals</DT>
   <DD>An interval represents a range of values, such as [2, 3] where,
    depending on your interpretation, the actual number is unknown, but
    contained within this range, or the number simultaneously takes on all
    values within the range.  See the <A HREF="#IntervalArithmetic">Interval
     Arithmetic</A> section of the documentation for more information.</DD>

   In this case, because the ratio between feet and meters is an

  </P>

  <P>
   Both sides of a conversion can be arbitrarily complex.
  </P>

  <H2><A NAME="Variables">Variables</A></H2>
  <P>
   By default, all variables in Frink can contain any type.  Variable names
   begin with any (Unicode) letter followed by 0 or more letters, digits, or
   the underscore (<CODE>_</CODE>) character.
  </P>

  <P>
   You do not need to declare variables before using them.  The variable will
   be defined in the smallest containing scope.
  </P>

  <P>
   To assign a value to a variable, use the <CODE>=</CODE> operator:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">a = 10 feet</CODE>  (assigns a single value)<BR>
   <CODE CLASS="input">b = [30 yards, 3 inches]</CODE>  (assigns an array)
  </P>

  <H3><A NAME="DeclaringVariables">Declaring Variables</A></H3>
  <P>
   Variables <EM>may</EM> be declared before they are used using the
   <CODE>var</CODE> keyword.  For example, to
   declare a variable called <CODE>t</CODE>:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">var t</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   This defines the variable t in the smallest containing scope and sets its
   initial value to the special value <CODE>undef</CODE>.  You may also
   specify an initial value:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">var t = 10 seconds</CODE>
  </P>

  <H3><A NAME="ConstraintsOnVariables">Constraints on Variables</A></H3>
  <P>
   When a variable is declared, you can constrain the type of values that it
   can contain.  The constraints are checked at runtime.  If you try to set a
   value that does not meet the constraints, a runtime error occurs.  For
   example, to make sure that the variable <CODE>t</CODE> only contains values
   with dimensions of time, you can declare it using the <CODE>is</CODE>
   keyword which defines constraints.
  </P>
    
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">var t is time = 10 seconds</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   In this case, the initial value is necessary to ensure that <CODE>t</CODE>
   contains a value with dimensions of time <EM>at all times</EM>.  (The
   special value <CODE>undef</CODE> is applied if no initial value is
   supplied.)  If a valid initial value is not supplied, this will produce an
   error at runtime.
  </P>

  <P>
   Multiple constraints can be specified by placing them in square brackets.
   <EM>All</EM> constraints must be met.  (If you want to do an "OR" of
   constraints, see the <A HREF="#ConstraintFunctions">Constraint
    Functions</A> section below.)

   <CODE CLASS="input">var t is [time, positive] = 10 seconds</CODE>
  </P>
  
  <H4><A NAME="ConstrainingByDimensions">Constraining by Dimensions</A></H4>
  <P>
   Built-in constraint types include all of the dimension types defined in
   your program.  For example, you can list all of the defined dimension types
   (<I>e.g.</I> <CODE>length, mass, power, energy</CODE>) with the
   <CODE>dimensions[]</CODE> function.  All of these defined types can be used
   as constraints.
  </P>

  <H4><A NAME="ConstrainingToBuiltInTypes">Constraining to Built-In Types</A></H4>
  <P>
   The following built-in constraints can be used to verify that the value is
   of one of the built-in types.  For example,
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">var name is string = "Frink"</CODE>

  </TABLE>

  <H4><A NAME="ConstrainingByObjectType">Constraining by Object Type</A></H4>

   A class name can also be a constraint name.  If, for example, you've

  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">a is Sphere = new Sphere[]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   This constraint check also works with interface names.  If the name of the
   constraint is the name of an interface, this check will ensure that any
   object assigned to the variable implements that interface.  See the <A
    HREF="/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=interfacetest.frink">interfacetest.frink</A> file for an example.
  </P>
  
  <H4><A NAME="ConstraintFunctions">Constraint Functions</A></H4>
  <P>
   You may define your own functions that will be used as constraints.  The
   function must take one argument and return a <CODE>true</CODE> value if the
   constraint is met.  Returning <CODE>false</CODE> or another value will
   cause the constraint to fail.  The following defines a function called
   <CODE>positive</CODE> that returns <CODE>true</CODE> if a value is a
   positive dimensionless value.

    isVariableDefined["a"]
   </CODE>
  </P>
  
  <H3><A NAME="GlobalVariables">Global Variables</A></H3>
  <P>
   Ha ha...just kidding.  There are no global variables in Frink.  However, if
   you need to access some sort of "global" values from anywhere in your
   program, without passing them explicitly to each function, you can simulate
   it with class-level variables in a class that you define.  These are
   defined using the <CODE>class var</CODE> keywords, and are similar to
   <CODE>static</CODE> class-level variables in languages like C++ and Java.
  </P>

  <P>
   If you want to use a "global" variable in only a few functions, you can
   encapsulate those functions into a <CODE>class</CODE>.
  </P>
  
  <P>
   For samples of class-level variables and how to access them, see <A
    HREF="/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=classtest.frink">classtest.frink</A>.
  </P>
  
  <H3><A NAME="UnicodeInFrink">Unicode in Frink</A></H3>
  <P>
   For internationalization, Frink allows <A
   HREF="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode</A> characters anywhere.  For
   maximum portability, and maximum editability with non-Unicode-aware
   editors, you can use Unicode escapes to embed these characters in program
   files.

  <P>
   Variable names can contain Unicode characters, indicated by
   <CODE>\u</CODE> followed by exactly 4 hexadecimal digits [0-9a-fA-F]
   indicating the Unicode code-point, for example: <CODE>\u210e</CODE> .  In
   addition, a Unicode character can be specified with anywhere from one to
   six hexadecimal digits by placing the digits in brackets, for example:
   <CODE>\u{FF}</CODE> or <CODE>\u{1f638}</CODE> (this is the Unicode
   character "GRINNING CAT FACE WITH SMILING EYES".  So, yes, you can have
   kitty faces as variable names!)  This allows Unicode characters to be
   placed into any ASCII text file, and edited by programs that don't
   understand Unicode.  It also allows <EM>any</EM> Unicode character to be
   used in an identifier.
  </P>

  <P>
   If you <EM>do</EM> have a nifty editor that handles Unicode, or other
   character encodings, you can write your Frink program in full Unicode, and
   load it using the <A HREF="#CommandLineOptions"><CODE>--encoding
    <I>str</I></CODE></A> command-line switch.  Keep in mind that in this
   case, identifiers can only consist of Unicode letters, digits, and the
   underscore.  You still have to use the <CODE>\u00a5</CODE> Unicode escape
   trick if your identifier contains other classes of characters.
  </P>

  <P>
   For example, Unicode defines the character <CODE>\u201e</CODE> for Planck's
   constant.  In the data file, we define Planck's constant as the normal
   character <CODE>h</CODE> (which is easier to type) and also as the Unicode
   character.  These definitions look like:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    h := 6.62606876e-34 J s</CODE> <CODE CLASS="comment">// Planck's constant</CODE><BR>
    <CODE CLASS="input">\u210e := h</CODE> <CODE CLASS="comment">// Unicode character for Planck's constant
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   <EM>Note:</EM> The <CODE>:=</CODE> notation simply defines a
   <EM>global</EM> unit, that is available from all functions.
  </P>

  <H2><A NAME="SettingDisplayUnits">Setting Display Units</A></H2>
  <P>
   By default, units are displayed with their dimensions given as multiples of
   the
   <A HREF="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/units.html">International System
    of Units (SI)</A> base units.  These are often not very intuitive.  For
   example, volts are displayed as:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">1 volt</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">1 m^2 s^-3 kg A^-1 (electric_potential)</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Of course, you could convert to volts explicitly using the
   <CODE>-&gt;</CODE> operator, but if you have to do that repeatedly, it's a
   hassle.  Instead, you can define the default output format for a unit type
   by using the <CODE>:-&gt;</CODE> operator:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">electric_potential :-&gt; "volts"</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="input">10 volt</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">10 volts</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   The left-hand side is the dimension list identifier like
   <CODE>electric_potential</CODE> or <CODE>time</CODE> or <CODE>power</CODE>
   (you can see what this is named for any given unit by entering an
   expression of that type--see the first "volt" sample above.)
  </P>

  <P>
   The right-hand side is any expression that can go on the right-hand-side of
   a conversion operator <CODE>-&gt;</CODE> , including multiple conversions:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">time :-&gt; [0, "days", "hours", "minutes", "seconds"]</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="input">siderealyear</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes, 9.5400288 seconds</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="input">siderealday</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.0899984 seconds</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   The right-hand-side can even be a function that takes a single argument:
  </P>
  
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">HMS[x] := x -&gt; [0, "hours", "minutes", "seconds"]</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="input">time :-&gt; HMS</CODE><BR>
  </P>

  <P>
   If you want, you can define a function that displays distances in
   millimeters if it's small, kilometers if it's bigger, and light-years if
   it's huge.
  </P>

  <H2><A NAME="SettingPrecision">Setting Precision</A></H2>
  <P>
   Floating-point calculations are performed to a limited number of digits.
   You can change the number of digits of working precision by the
   <CODE>setPrecision[<I>digits</I>]</CODE> function:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    setPrecision[50]<BR>
    1 / 3.0<BR>
   </CODE>
   <CODE CLASS="output">0.33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Note that this will only affect calculations performed <EM>after</EM> this
   flag is set, of course.  Currently, not all operations (notably
   trigonometric functions) can be performed to arbitrary precision.
  </P>

  <P>
   You can also see the current working precision by calling the
   <CODE>getPrecision[]</CODE> function:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">

   </CODE>
   <CODE CLASS="output">50</CODE>
  </P>
  
  <H2><A NAME="SettingNumberFormats">Setting Number Formats</A></H2>
  <P>
   By default, floating-point numbers are displayed in scientific notation
   with one digit before the decimal point.  This can be changed to
   "engineering" format where 1 to 3 digits are placed before the decimal
   point and the exponent is a multiple of 3.  This allows you to more easily
   see it as "milli-", "micro-", "million", etc.  The call to enable this is:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
    <CODE CLASS="input">setEngineering[true]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Example without engineering mode:
  </P>

    <CODE CLASS="input">d = 140.5 million meters</CODE><BR>
    <CODE CLASS="output">1.405000000e+8 m (length)</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Now notice the change if you set "engineering mode" to true.  The result
   comes out so you can more easily read it as "140.5 million meters":

  <P CLASS="code">
    <CODE CLASS="input">setEngineering[true]</CODE><BR>
    <CODE CLASS="input">d</CODE><BR>
    <CODE CLASS="output">140.5000000e+6 m (length)</CODE>

  <P>
   You can tell Frink to always <EM>display</EM> rational numbers as

   If you repeat a calculation, you may want to define it as a function.
   Functions in Frink are denoted by the function name followed by arguments
   in square brackets, separated by commas.  A function can be defined like
   the following:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">circlearea[radius] := pi radius^2</CODE><BR>
  </P>

  <P>
   Then, to call the function, say, to find the area of my telescope mirror,
   which has a radius of 2 inches:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">circlearea[2 inches]</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">0.008107319665559965 m^2 (area)</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   But that comes out in standard units... let's try again, converting to
   square inches.
  </P>
  
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">circlearea[2 inches] -&gt; in^2</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">12.566370</CODE>
  </P>

  <H3><A NAME="MultiLineFunctions">Multi-line Functions</A></H3>
  <P>
   Multi-line functions can be built; just put the body in curly braces.  It
   may be more legible to use the <CODE>return</CODE> statement in your
   function.  For example, the factorial function could be written as:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
   factorial[x] :=<BR>
   {<BR>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if x&gt;1<BR>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return x * factorial[x-1]<BR>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else<BR>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 1<BR>
    }
    </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   If a function does not explicitly return a value, the value returned is the
   value of the last expression evaluated.  A <CODE>return</CODE> statement
   with no value on the right-hand-side returns a special void type.
  </P>

  <H3><A NAME="DefaultValues">Default Values</A></H3>
  <P>
   Function declarations can have default values.  Default values are
   specified by putting "<CODE>= <I>value</I></CODE>" after a parameter name
   in the function declaration.  For example, if your Willard pocket organizer
   goes out, you can use Frink to calculate the tip on your dinner check, and,
   to make it easy, you can default the tip rate to 15 percent of the bill.
   The function declaration with default parameters is:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">tip[amount, rate=15 percent] := amount * rate</CODE><BR>
  </P>

  <P>
   Now, when you get to the restaurant, you can easily calculate the tip using
   the default rate:
  </P>
  
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">tip[80.75 dollars]</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">12.1125 dollar (currency)</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Or, if service is outstanding and you want to tip at 20%, you can specify
   the second argument instead of leaving it at the default:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">tip[80.75 dollars, 20 percent]</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">16.15 dollar (currency)</CODE>
  </P>

  <H3><A NAME="MultipleReturnValues">Multiple Return Values</A></H3>
  <P>
   The previous tip example probably has you thinking, "Well, it would be nice
   if it calculated the total too!"  I'm bad at math, also... that's why I'm
   developing Frink.
  </P>

  <P>
   In Frink, values surrounded by square brackets and separated by commas form
   a list of values.  These lists can be returned from a function, assigned to
   a variable, or whatever.  A better version of the above function would
   be defined to return a list containing the tip <EM>and</EM> the total as a
   list:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">tipandtotal[amount, rate=15 percent] := [amount * rate,
   amount * (1+rate)]</CODE><BR>
  </P>

  <P>
   Note the square brackets on the right-hand-side of the definition.  Then, to
   calculate the tip, it's as easy as before:
  </P>
  
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">tipandtotal[80.75 dollars]</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">[12.1125 dollar (currency), 92.8625 dollar (currency)]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   I'll let you do the rounding in your head, or you can use the
   <A HREF="#RoundingFunctions">rounding functions</A> below.
  </P>

  <H3><A NAME="RecursiveFunctions">Recursive Functions</A></H3>
  <P>
   Yes indeedy-o, functions can be recursive.  The classic example is the
   factorial:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">factorial[x] := x&gt;1  ?  x factorial[x-1]  :  1</CODE><BR>
  </P>

  <P>
   This uses the conditional expression <CODE>condition ? trueClause :
    falseClause</CODE>.  The condition is first evaluated (it should evaluate
   to a boolean value,) and if it's true, the true clause is evaluated and
   returned, the false clause otherwise.  Let's try a big number, just big
   enough that it would overflow my old solar calculator:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">factorial[70]</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">119785716699698917960727837216890987364589381425464258
    57555362864628009582789845319680000000000000000</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   You can still blow out the stack if you go too deep, or forget to put in a
   condition such that the function terminates.  Don't come crying to me.
  </P>
  
  <H3><A NAME="ConstrainingFunctionArguments">Constraining Function Arguments</A></H3>
  <P>
   Like other variables, formal arguments to functions can have constraints.
   The syntax for constraining is just the same as setting <A
    HREF="#ConstraintsOnVariables">Constraints on variables.</A>  For example,
   if you want to make sure that a function that calculates the volume of a
   sphere is passed a radius, the declaration looks like:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">sphereVolume[radius is length] := 4/3 pi radius^3</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   The constraint(s) are checked at runtime, and if all constraints are not
   met, the function call produces an error.
  </P>

  <P>
   At some point in the future, I'd like to have this choose an appropriate
   function based on the constraints, if more than one is possible.  My
   underlying function dispatching is designed to allow this, but functions
   with constraints may be slower to resolve.
  </P>

  <H2><A NAME="IfThenElse">If/Then/Else</A></H2>
  <P>
   You can control program flow with the if/then/else construct.  If the
   condition is true, it will execute the first clause, otherwise, if there is
   an (optional) <CODE>else</CODE> clause, it will execute the
   <CODE>else</CODE> clause.
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    if a&lt;10<BR>
    {<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println["Less than ten"]<BR>
    } else<BR>
    {<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println["Greater than ten."]<BR>
    }
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   <B>Note:</B> Note that putting the brackets and statements on separate
   lines is currently important.  Also, please note that the <CODE>else</CODE>
   keyword goes on the same line as the closing bracket of the
   <CODE>then</CODE> clause.
  </P>

  <P>
   If either the <CODE>then</CODE> or <CODE>else</CODE> clause is a single
   line, the curly braces for that clause can be eliminated.  The following is
   the same as the code above:
  </P>
   
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    if a&lt;10<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println["Less than ten"]<BR>
    else<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println["Greater than ten."]<BR>
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   The condition must be able to be turned into a boolean value.  When testing
   for equality, be sure to use the double equals sign, (a single equals
   indicates assignment) <I>e.g.</I>:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    if a==b<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println["Equal."]
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   If, for some reason, you need to jam everything into one line, you need to
   add the <CODE>then</CODE> keyword:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    if a==b then println["Equal."] else println["Not equal."]
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <H2><A NAME="Truth">Truth</A></H2>
  <P>
   The condition in an if/then/else statement or a loop needs to be a boolean
   (true/false) value.  This can either be represented by the special values
   <CODE>true</CODE> and <CODE>false</CODE>, or the following types can be
   used in places where a boolean value is required:
  </P>

  <TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=3 SUMMARY="Boolean-Equivalent Expressions">
    <TR><TH>True<TH>False
    <TR><TD CLASS="lit">true<TD CLASS="lit">false
    <TR><TD>Any non-empty string<TD>The empty string <CODE>""</CODE>
    <TR><TD>Any list (even a zero-element list)<TD CLASS="lit">
    <TR><TD><TD>The special undefined value <CODE>undef</CODE>
  </TABLE>

  <P>
   Any other value will cause a runtime error.  See the <A
    HREF="#BooleanOperators">Boolean Operators</A> section below for operators
   that return boolean values.
  </P>

  <H2><A NAME="Loops">Loops</A></H2>

  <H3><A NAME="WhileLoop">While Loop</A></H3>
  <P>
   The <CODE>while</CODE> loop is a loop with a condition and a body.  The
   body is executed repeatedly while the condition is true.
  </P>
  
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    i=0<BR>
    while i&lt;1000000<BR>
    {<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i = i+1<BR>
    }<BR>
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   If the body is a single line, the braces can be omitted:
  </P>
  
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    i=0<BR>
    while i&lt;1000000<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i = i+1<BR>
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   You can use the <CODE>next</CODE> statement to prematurely jump to the next
   iteration of a <CODE>while</CODE> loop.  You can use a labeled
   <CODE>next</CODE> statement to jump to the next iteration of a higher
   loop.  See the <A HREF="#ForLoop">for loop</A> section for an
   example.
  </P>
  
  <P>
   You can use the <CODE>break</CODE> statement to exit the smallest
   containing loop.  You can also use labeled break statements to break out to
   a higher loop:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<BR>
    }
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   The label must precede the loop <EM>on a separate line</EM> and be followed
   by a colon.
  </P>

  <H3><A NAME="DoWhileLoop">Do...While Loop</A></H3>
  <P>
   The <CODE>do...while</CODE> loop is much like the <CODE>while</CODE> loop,
   the only difference being that with the <CODE>do</CODE> loop, the body of
   the loop is always executed at least once, and then the condition is
   checked.  The body of the loop then repeats as long as the condition is
   true.
  </P>
  
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    i=0<BR>

    {<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i = i+1<BR>
    } while i&lt;1000
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   If the body is a single line, the braces can be omitted, but each part of
   the loop has to be on a different line:
  </P>
  
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    i=0<BR>

   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   You can use the <CODE>next</CODE> statement to prematurely jump to the next
   iteration of a <CODE>do</CODE> loop.  You can use a labeled
   <CODE>next</CODE> statement to jump to the next iteration of a higher
   loop.  See the <A HREF="#ForLoop">for loop</A> section for an
   example.
  </P>

  <P>
   You can use the <CODE>break</CODE> statement to exit the smallest
   containing loop.  You can also use labeled break statements to break out to
   a higher loop.  See the <A HREF="#WhileLoop">while loop</A> section of the
   documentation for an example.
  </P>

  <H3><A NAME="ForLoop">For Loop</A></H3>
  <P>
   The above <CODE>while</CODE> loop can also be written as:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    for i = 1 to 1000000<BR>
    {<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>body</I><BR>
    }
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   If the body is a single line, the curly braces can be omitted.  The above
   sample can be written as:
  </P>
  
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    for i = 1 to 1000000<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>body</I>
   </CODE>
  </P>


  <P>
   The range and step size can be specified using the <CODE>step</CODE>
   keyword:
  </P>
  
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">for i = 1 to 1000 step 3</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   The step is <EM>required</EM> to be specified for any range in which the
   limits are not dimensionless integers.  For example:
  </P>
  
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">for i = 0 miles to 1 mile step 1 foot</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   This also works with a date range, but the step <EM>must</EM> be specified
   and it must have dimensions of time:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">for time = #2001-01-01# to #2002-01-01# step 1 day</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   The boundaries of a loop may also be boolean values:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">for x = false to true</CODE>
  </P>
  
  <P>
   Other orderings are allowed such as <CODE>true to false</CODE> or
   <CODE>true to true</CODE> (the latter only goes through the loop once.)
  </P>
  
  <P>
   The <CODE>for</CODE> loop is also used to iterate over the contents of
   an enumerating expression or array.  (You can think of it as a "for each"
   loop, which is really what it is.)  You can also use the <CODE>for</CODE>
   loop to iterate over the contents of Java objects.  See the <A
    HREF="#IteratingOverJavaCollections">Iterating over Java Collections</A>
   section of the documentation for more.
  </P>

  <P>
   If the enumerating expression produces a list, and you want to break apart
   that list into named variables in the <CODE>for</CODE> loop, write it as:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    for [<I>var1</I>, <I>var2, ...</I>] = <I>enumerating_expression</I><BR>
    {<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>body</I><BR>
    }
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Again, if the body is a single line, the curly braces may be
   omitted:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    for [var1, var2] = <I>enum</I><BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>body</I>

  </P>

  <P>
   See the <A HREF="#InputAndOutput">Input and Output</A> section below for a
   sample of its use.
  </P>

  <P>
   You can use the <CODE>next</CODE> statement to prematurely jump to the next
   iteration of a <CODE>for</CODE> loop.  You can use a labeled
   <CODE>next</CODE> statement to jump to the next iteration of a higher loop:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">

   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   The label must precede the loop <EM>on a separate line</EM> and be followed
   by a colon.
  </P>
  
  <P>
   You can use the <CODE>break</CODE> statement to exit the smallest
   containing loop.  You can also use labeled break statements to break out to

   documentation for an example.
  </P>
  
  <P>
   (<I>Note to programmers:</I> The special keyword <CODE>to</CODE> creates an
   enumerating expression that successively takes on all values from the
   beginning to the end, inclusive, with the default step being 1.  (The step
   size can be changed as shown below.)  You can use this <CODE>to</CODE>
   notation anywhere to create an enumerating expression that takes on
   successive values.  You can even make it into an array using the
   <CODE>array</CODE> function:)
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    a = array[1 to 10]<BR></CODE>
    <CODE CLASS="output">[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   You can create an more flexible enumerating expression that does the same
   as the above by using the format: <CODE>new range[1, 10]</CODE> or
   <CODE>new range[1, 10, 2]</CODE> formats.  Use this if you're going to
   assign to variables or use the range symbolically.
  </P>

  <H3><A NAME="MultiforLoop">Multifor Loop</A></H3>
  <P>
   For programs that require nested <CODE>for</CODE> loops for which it's not
   known in advance how many nested loops will be needed, the
   <CODE>multifor</CODE> construct allows multiple loops to be created simply:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    multifor [a, b, c] = [1 to 2, 1 to 3, 1 to 5]<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println["$a $b $c"]
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   An similar (and technically better in almost all ways) way of writing
   the loop above would be to create new <CODE>range</CODE> objects:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    bounds = [new range[1,2], new range[1,3], new range[1,5]]<BR>
    multifor [a, b, c] = <I>bounds</I><BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>println["$a $b $c"]</I>
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   A typical idiom for creating a multi-loop is to use the
   <CODE>makeArray</CODE> function to create array bounds.  For example, the
   following creates in effect 8 nested loops, each running from 1 to 2.  The
   results are assigned as an array to the variable <CODE>d</CODE>.
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    upper = 2<BR>
    bounds = makeArray[[8], new range[1,upper]]<BR>
    multifor d = bounds<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[d]
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   As of the 2012-09-04 release, the bounds of one loop can now depend on the
   bounds of the loops to its left, for example:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    multifor [f,g] = [new range[1,3], new range[f+1,3]]<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println["$f $g"]
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   You can use the <CODE>next</CODE> statement to prematurely jump to the next
   iteration of a <CODE>multifor</CODE> loop.  You can use a labeled
   <CODE>next</CODE> statement to jump to the next iteration of a higher
   loop.  See the <A HREF="#ForLoop">for loop</A> section for an
   example.
  </P>

  <P>
   There's a version of the <CODE>next</CODE> statement that jumps to a
   specified level of a <CODE>multifor</CODE> loop.  The leftmost/highest
   level is level 0, and the next levels increment to the right.  The loop
   must be labeled and the index to jump to follows the label in the
   <CODE>next</CODE> statement.  For example <CODE>next LOOP i</CODE> 
  </P>

  <P>
   The program <A
    HREF="/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=multinexttest.frink">multinexttest.frink</A>
   demonstrates the use of this construct.
  </P>
  
  <H2><A NAME="SelfEvaluation">Self-Evaluation</A></H2>
  <P>
   Frink can evaluate a string as a Frink expression.  If that means something
   to you, good.  It's cool.  You can make programs that write and run their
   own programs.  Frink became self-aware on December 7, 2001 at 9:26 PM MST.
   This is 1561.926 days after Skynet became self-aware.  History will be the
   judge if <EM>this</EM> December 7th is another date that will live in
   infamy.
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">eval["2 + 2"]</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">4</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   This behavior can also be used to convert a string into a number.  It
   allows users to enter information as any Frink expression such as <CODE>"6
    billion tons"</CODE> or <CODE>2+2</CODE> and have it handled correctly.
   See the <A HREF="#Input">Input</A> section below for examples of its use.
  </P>

  <P>
   <CODE>eval[]</CODE> can also be used to perform another layer of evaluation
   on a value that is not a string.
  </P>

  <P>
   If <CODE>eval[]</CODE> is passed an array, all elements of the array will
   be individually evaluated and the result will be returned in an array.
  </P>

  <P>
   There is also a two-argument version, <CODE>eval[<I>expression</I>,
   <I>rethrows</I>]</CODE> where the <CODE>rethrows</CODE> argument is a
   boolean flag indicating if we want evaluation errors to be thrown or just
   suppressed and <CODE>undef</CODE> returned.  If it is true, errors will be
   rethrown as Java exceptions, otherwise an error returns <CODE>undef</CODE>.
  </P>

  <P>
   There is also a three-argument version, <CODE>eval[<I>expression</I>,
   <I>rethrows</I>, <I>hidesLocals</I>]</CODE> where the
   <CODE>hidesLocal</CODE> argument is a boolean flag indicating if we want

   The <CODE>eval[]</CODE> function restricts some insecure operations from
   being performed (<I>e.g.</I> you can't read files from the local

   Arbitrarily-dimensional, non-rectangular, heterogeneous arrays are
   possible.  (If you're playing "buzzword bingo," you just won.)  Array
   indices are zero-based.  Arrays are indicated by square brackets.

   You can break arrays into multiple lines by inserting newlines after the

  </P>

  <P>
   To get elements out, use the lovely @ operator (yes, I'm running out of
   bracket types... square brackets would be indistinguishable from function
   calls):

   With the advent of array manipulation, I've proven to myself that Frink is

  <P>
   An <CODE>OrderedList</CODE> is an array that is always kept in order.  Of

   almost all methods and functions that operate on <CODE>array</CODE> will
   work with <CODE>OrderedList</CODE>, unless those methods would violate the
   ordering (e.g. <CODE>pushFirst</CODE>).
  </P>

  <P>
   By default, the ordering is the default ordering produced by the
   <CODE>&lt;=&gt;</CODE> comparison operator.  If another user-defined
   ordering is desired, it can be specified by one of the constructors
   explained in the next section.
  </P>

  <H3><A NAME="InitializingOrderedList">Initializing OrderedList</A></H3>

  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    a = new OrderedList

  </P>

  <P>
   If you want to specify a user-defined ordering, you can pass a (possibly <A
   HREF="#AnonymousFunctions">anonymous</A>) function as the first argument to
   the constructor.  This function must take two arguments (we'll call them)
   <CODE>[a,b]</CODE>, and return -1 if <CODE>a&lt;b</CODE>, 0 if
   <CODE>a==b</CODE>, and 1 if <CODE>a&gt;b</CODE>.  (These are the values
   returned by the <CODE>&lt;=&gt;</CODE> operator, so you may be able to use
   it in your comparison function.)
  </P>

  <P>
   For example, if you want to use an ordering that simply sorts shorter
   strings before longer strings, (say that six times speedily,) you can do the
   following:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">

  <P>
   An OrderedList can also take a piece of arbitrary data that is passed to
   the comparison function.  This data is passed as the second argument to the

  <H2><A NAME="Input">Input</A></H2>
  <P>
   You can request input from the user with the
   <CODE>input[<I>prompt</I>]</CODE> or
   <CODE>input[<I>prompt</I>,&nbsp;<I>defaultValue</I>]</CODE> function.
   The result always comes back as a string, but you can parse it into a unit,
   a date, or whatever, using the <CODE>eval[str]</CODE> function:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">radius = input["Enter the radius of a sphere: "]</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="input">volume = 4/3 pi eval[radius]^3</CODE><BR>
  </P>

  <P>
   This allows your users to enter things like "3 inches" or "1 mile" or any
   units that Frink knows about (like "earthradius",) and everything will Just
   Work.  (That "Self-Evaluation" section above seemed irrelevant at the time,
   but it turns out it's quite useful.)
  </P>

  <P>
   If the user cancels the input dialog, or, for text input, if end-of-file is
   reached, this returns the special value <CODE>undef</CODE>.
  </P>

  <P>
   In command-line mode, these <CODE>input</CODE> functions also allow you to
   read from standard input (stdin).  (User input is actually taken from stdin
   in command-line mode, as you may expect.)  Lines can be read one at a time,
   <EM>and have trailing carriage returns/linefeeds removed.</EM>  On
   end-of-file (EOF), the input function returns the special value
   <CODE>undef</CODE>.  A short-program to read from standard in and echo its
   output may look like:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">while (line = input[""]) != undef<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[line]
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   If, for some reason, you're in a GUI mode and you still want to read from
   standard input, you can call <CODE>readStdin[]</CODE> to read one line
   from standard input.  This is just like calling <CODE>input[""]</CODE> from
   command-line mode, which is what you really want to be calling if you're
   trying to make programs that work both interactively and non-interactively,
   and in GUI mode and non-GUI mode.  But if you're sure you only ever want to
   read from standard input, and don't want to trigger a GUI input window, use
   <CODE>readStdin[]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">while (line = readStdin[]) != undef<BR>

  <H3><A NAME="MultiInput">Multi-Input</A></H3>
  <P>
   If you want to request multiple input items from the user, you can use the
   "multi-input" version of the input function, where the second argument is an
   array of items you're going to prompt for:
  <P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">[first, last] = input["What is your name", ["First Name", "Last Name"]]</CODE><BR>
  </P>

  <P>
   This will produce a graphical user interface which prompts the user for
   their input.  This works on AWT, Swing, Android, and in text mode if you're
   running in a pure text environment.
  </P>
  
  <P>
   The results will be returned as an array of strings, in the same order as
   they were specified.  As in the <A HREF="#Input">Input</A> section above,
   you can use the <CODE>eval[<I>str</I>]</CODE> function to parse them into
   numeric or other values.
  </P>

  <P>
   If the user cancels the input dialog, or, for text input, if end-of-file is
   reached, this returns the special value <CODE>undef</CODE> instead of an
   array.  When in text mode, if end-of-file is reached before filling the
   second or later item, then partial results will be returned (with the
   special value <CODE>undef</CODE> being returned for each incomplete value.)
  </P>

  <P>
   If any of the items in the array is a two-element array, the second
   argument will be used as the default value:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">[first, last] = input["What is your name",[["First
    Name", "Jeff"], ["Last Name", "Albertson"]]]</CODE>

   The following program demonstrates an idiom for creating a simple
   interactive GUI that finds roots of numbers until you cancel.  The
   <CODE>while</CODE> loop exits when the user cancels calculations.  Previous
   results are displayed to the user at the top of the input dialog, and the
   user's previous input is maintained (verbatim) in the input fields.
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    n = "10000"<BR>

    }<BR>
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   This code works whether the user is running with a Swing or AWT or Android
   GUI, or in text mode.  The user cancels input by closing the input dialog
   (in Swing or AWT), hitting the "back" button on Android, or with
   end-of-file (EOF) in text mode (EOF can be simulated by Control-D on
   Unixlike systems, Control-Z on Windows.)
  </P>

  <P>
   Note that the idiomatic use of the "eval" function to turn the string
   inputs into Frink expressions.  This means that the user can enter any
   expression that Frink understands, such as "<CODE>2+2</CODE>", "<CODE>1
    trillion</CODE>", "<CODE>sin[30 degrees]</CODE>" or "<CODE>32
    m^2</CODE>".  It's like a generalized calculator inside of a specialized

   A dictionary is an associative data structure that lets you map arbitrary

   The most common trigonometric functions are built in.  They, as everything
   else in Frink, are best used when you explicitly specify the units.  For
   the following functions, input should be an angle, and output will come out
   dimensionless.  (If no unit is specified for input, it should act like
   radians, because radians <EM>are</EM> dimensionless units and really

   For inverse operations, the input must be dimensionless, and the output
   will come out in angular units.  (Radians, by default.)  This is easily
   converted to whatever angular units you want, as above.  You don't see that
   the output is in radians because radians are essentially dimensionless

    <TR><TD CLASS="lit">bitLength[<I>x</I>]<TD>Returns the number of bits in
      the minimal two's-complement representation of an integer,
      <EM>excluding</EM> a sign bit.
      
    <TR><TD CLASS="lit">getBit[<I>num</I>,&nbsp;<I>bit</I>]<TD>Returns an
      integer, either 0 or 1, indicating the value of the specified bit in an
      integer.  Bit 0 is the least-significant bit.  The number is treated as
      a two's-complement representation with infinite length.  That is, the
      high bits on a negative number will always be 1, and the high bits on a
      positive number or zero will always be 0.

    <TR><TD CLASS="lit">getLowestSetBit[<I>num</I>]<TD>Returns the index of
      the rightmost (lowest-order) one bit in an integer (the number of
      zero bits to the right of the rightmost one bit). Returns -1 if the
      integer contains no one bits.

    <TR><TD CLASS="lit">shiftLeft[<I>num</I>, <I>bits</I>]<TD>Shifts the bits
      of an integer left by the specified number of bits.  New bits will
      contain zero.  This is equivalent to multiplying by 2<SUP>bits</SUP> but
      is usually more efficient.

    <TR><TD CLASS="lit">shiftRight[<I>num</I>, <I>bits</I>]<TD>Shifts the bits
      of an integer right by the specified number of bits, losing the bits
      pushed off the right side.  This is equivalent to performing a

      <CODE>NOT</CODE> of an integer, treated as a two's complement number with
      infinite sign bits.  This means that performing a <CODE>bitNot</CODE> on
      a positive number will return a negative number, and vice-versa.  This
      may be unexpected if you're unfamiliar with two's complement notation,
      but functions like <CODE>getBit[<I>num</I>,&nbsp;<I>bit</I>]</CODE> and
      <CODE>bitLength[<I>num</I>]</CODE> will do the right thing, and will
      handle all leading sign bits correctly without you needing to specify

      number representation if you're unfamiliar with this.

    <TR><TD CLASS="lit">isPrime[<I>x</I>]<TD>Returns false if the integer
      <CODE>x</CODE> is composite, true if the number is prime (or probably
      prime.)  This test uses trial division and then Rabin-Miller strong
      pseudoprime tests to determine primality.  The bases used in the
      Rabin-Miller test are known to always return correct answers for numbers
      smaller than 341,550,071,728,321, but for larger numbers this function
      may erroneously declare a composite number to be prime.  (If it returns
      false, the number is definitely composite.)
      
      <P>
       If the number is larger than this, the test is performed against all 78
       prime bases less than or equal to 400.  This gives a <EM>very</EM>
       small probability of about 1 in 10<SUP>47</SUP> that the function may
       return <CODE>true</CODE> for a composite number.  (And that's a
       worst-case; for randomly-chosen large numbers, the probability of error
       is actually far, far lower for most numbers, especially big ones.  The
       above assumes the ridiculously low estimate that the pseudoprime test
       fails 1/4 of the time.  The reality is orders of magnitude lower.  For
       better estimates,

        a cosmic ray hitting it.)

       <LI>You'll flip a coin 156 times in a row and it will land on "heads"

      <P>
       And these are ridiculously generous estimates.  The actual probability

      <P>
       As of the 2005-11-13 release, <CODE>isPrime[<I>x</I>]</CODE> was
       extended to automatically use a faster Lucas-Lehmer test if <I>x</I> is
       of the form 2<SUP>n</SUP>-1 (<I>i.e.</I> Mersenne numbers).  Note that
       the Lucas-Lehmer test is sufficient to <EM>prove</EM> primality for
       numbers of this form, regardless of their size.
      </P>

      <P>
       Also note that <CODE>isPrime[1]</CODE> will return <CODE>true</CODE>.
       This simplifies recursive factor-finding algorithms, but I know it may

    <TR><TD CLASS="lit">factor[<I>x</I>]<TD>Returns the prime factors of an

      sorted. If the optional argument <CODE>onlyToSqrt</CODE>=true, then only
      the factors less than or equal to the square root of the number will be
      produced.  It currently returns an array, but that may change to an
      enumerating expression someday to be more memory-efficient for numbers
      with huge amounts of factors.
      
    <TR><TD CLASS="lit">JacobiSymbol[<I>a,n</I>]<TD>Returns the Jacobi symbol
      (often written as (a/n) ) of the integers <CODE>a</CODE> and
      <CODE>n</CODE>.  <CODE>n</CODE> must be a positive, odd integer.  This
      function is used in factorization and primality testing.  The Jacobi
      symbol is a generalization of the Legendre symbol, so it can be used to
      calculate the Legendre symbol of two numbers.  (The Legendre symbol is
      only defined if <CODE>n</CODE> is prime.)
      <P>
       <B>Warning:</B> In releases of Frink prior to the 2005-03-11 release,

    <TR><TD CLASS="lit">isStrongPseudoprime[<I>num</I>, <I>base</I>]<TD>
      Returns true if <CODE>num</CODE> is a strong pseudoprime to base
      <CODE>base</CODE>.  If this returns false, the number is definitely
      composite.  If it returns true, the number <EM>may</EM> be prime.  This
      does <EM>not</EM> prove that a number is actually prime, as
      numbers can fail this test for up to 1/4 of bases.  This can be used as a
      component of a prime sieving algorithm.

    <TR><TD CLASS="lit"><CODE>nextPrime[<I>n</I>]</CODE><TD>Returns the next
      prime number <EM>greater than</EM> <CODE>n</CODE>.  The value of

      factoring method to completely avoid testing composite numbers with
      small factors.

    <TR><TD CLASS="lit"><CODE>partitionCount[<I>n</I>]</CODE><TD>Returns the
      number of ways that the integer n can be partitioned.  This uses Euler's
      pentagonal number algorithm to find the partition count somewhat

        will be efficient.

    <TR><TD CLASS="lit"><CODE>binomial[<I>m,n</I>]</CODE><TD>Returns the
     binomial coefficient.  This is of the number of ways <CODE>m</CODE>
     things can be chosen <CODE>n</CODE> at a time, with order being
     unimportant.  This is sometimes called "m choose n" or "m C n".  This is
     equivalent to m!/(n!*(m-n)!) although calculating that way often leads to
     way-too-big numbers.  For example, binomial[10000, 9998] is equal to
     49995000, but if you calculated it naively, you'd have to calculate
     10000! which is a 35660-digit number, and divide it by another huge

   <LI>High Unicode characters (those with value higher than
    <CODE>\uFFFF</CODE>) can also be represented as a Unicode "surrogate
    pair."  For example, the Unicode character "MONKEY FACE" can also be
    represented as two 4-hex-digit characters: <CODE>"\ud83d\udc35"</CODE>.
    This is for compatibility with environments (such as Java) that represent
    a character as 16 bits.  (The <A
       HREF="#InputForm"><CODE>inputForm[<I>expr</I>]</CODE></A> function
    will produce this format for cross-platform and cross-Java-version
    compatibility.)

  </TABLE>

  <H3><A NAME="MultiLineStrings">Multi-Line Strings</A></H3>
  <P>
   Text surrounded by three sets of double-quotes is a multi-line string (like
   in Python.)  Newlines are allowed and retained in the string. Hopefully,
   this is less burdensome and error-prone than Perl's "here-document" syntax.
   For example:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    lyrics = """Oh, Danny Boy,<BR>
    The pipes, the pipes are calling<BR>
    From glen to glen and down the mountainside"""<BR>
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   This is also useful when you have strings that contain double quotes, as it
   eliminates the need for escaping those quotes:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">quote = """We will say "ni" to you again if you do not appease us."""</CODE>
  </P>
  
  <H3><A NAME="StringInterpolation">String Interpolation</A></H3>
  <P>
   If a double-quoted string or multi-line string contains a dollar sign
   (<CODE>$</CODE>) followed by a variable name (which must begin with a
   letter), the value of that variable is replaced in the string at evaluation
   time.  This is (probably) faster than string concatenation which could be
   used to get the same effect.  There are certain optimizations to make sure
   that this isn't significantly more inefficient if the string doesn't need
   replacement.  (The string is checked for dollar signs at compile time.)
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">first = "Inigo"<BR>
    last = "Montoya"<BR>
    "My name is $first $last."</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">My name is Inigo Montoya.</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   If you need to explicitly mark where the variable name begins and ends, you
   can put it in curly braces as below:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">last="Frink"<BR>
    "You can call me the ${last}meister."</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">You can call me the Frinkmeister.</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Since a variable name must begin with a letter, it's fine to put a quantity
   like <CODE>$2.00</CODE> into the string, and no substitution will be
   attempted, and there will be no runtime performance penalty.  To put a
   literal dollar sign into the string immediately preceding an letter
   character, use two dollar signs:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">"I want my $$USD 2.00.  Plus tip."</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">I want my $USD 2.00.  Plus tip.</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   For best performance, <EM>don't</EM> use double dollar signs like this
   unless they directly precede an letter character.
  </P>

  <P>
   You can always use this technique to coerce a numeric value, or a unit, or
   a date, etc., to a string representation by enclosing it in quotes:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">n = 2^13367-1<BR>
   stringRep = "$n"</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   After the above code, the variable <CODE>stringRep</CODE> contains the
   result of the calculation <EM>as a string</EM> which you can use to grab
   certain characters, truncate, etc. Note that the
   <CODE>toString[<I>expr</I>]</CODE> function does the same thing, and can
   often be used on the same line.

  <H3><A NAME="TranslatorProgram">Translator Program</A></H3>
  <P>
   Here's a small program that can be used to make a mini-translator for a
   specific language.  It allows you to enter phrases to be translated without
   entering the quotes and other bits.  It will continue to translate phrases
   until you click the "OK" button without entering a phrase, or until you
   cancel the dialog using your windowing system's methods.  (See <A

   (JavaScript Object Notation) is a terrible standard based on an even more
   terrible language, (JavaScript doesn't even have <EM>integers</EM>, if
   you can believe that,) you can still parse it easily in Frink.
  </P>

  <P>
   <CODE>parseJSON[<I>string</I>]</CODE> will parse a JSON document and return
   it as a Frink datatype, with the top level being either a <CODE>dict</CODE>
   or an <CODE>array</CODE>, depending on the types included in the document.
   (The top-level of a JSON document can either be an object or an array.)
   Objects are converted to a Frink <CODE>dict</CODE> with the keys stored as
   strings.  The <CODE>null</CODE> type is converted to <CODE>undef</CODE>.
  </P>

  <H3><A NAME="Bitcoin">Bitcoin</A></H3>  
  <P>
   As a demonstration of JSON parsing, the following example reads from a
   remote URL which returns a JSON document, making the current value of
   Bitcoin into a globally-accessible Frink unit according to the CoinDesk
   Bitcoin Index (Powered by <A HREF="http://www.coindesk.com/price/"
   TARGET="_blank">CoinDesk</A>).  See the <A
   HREF="http://www.coindesk.com/api/" TARGET="_blank">CoinDesk API</A> for
   information about the various data sources available.
  </P>

  <P>
   Note that the following program is essentially a one-line program that
   parses a JSON document and extracts its data with correct units of measure
   in the result.
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">

   Also, if this is useful to you, you can pay me in Bitcoin at the address: <CODE>1dersa3eR2tXQATLCqTrqQ84aecpQBVmm</CODE>

  <H2><A NAME="DateTimeHandling">Date/Time Handling</A></H2>
  <P>
   Frink has the ability to define specific points in time and add time
   intervals to them, to convert between timezones, or to subtract dates from
   each other.  Date literals are surrounded by pound signs (<CODE>#</CODE>)
   and can be entered in a wide variety of formats, but I prefer a format like:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input"># yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss #</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Note that I've chosen to have most-significant digits first, as is only
   logical (the world will realize this someday.) You can have whitespace
   preceding or following the # signs for readability.  All of the predefined
   formats are defined in
   <A HREF="/frinkdata/dateformats.txt"><CODE>/data/dateformats.txt</CODE></A>.
   Check that file first to see the formats that are already defined.  If the
   format you want is not there, see below for ways to define your own
   formats.
  </P>

  <P>
   You can also parse a string into a date using the
   <CODE>parseDate[<I>string</I>]</CODE> function.  This returns the string
   parsed into a date/time datatype, or returns <CODE>undef</CODE> if the
   string cannot be parsed as a date using any of the defined date formats.
  </P>

  <H3><A NAME="SpecifyingTimezones">Specifying Timezones</A></H3>
  <P>
   All date/time formats also allow a timezone specifier at the end.  This
   timezone specifier can be a 3-letter code like "UTC" or "MST", but you can
   also use the name of a country or U.S. state (if the country or state has a
   single time zone) or a selected city (of course, not all cities are
   available.)  This means that you don't have to know when daylight savings
   time starts and ends.  The names are chosen from the globally-used Olson
   timezone database, and Frink allows shortening of the Olson timezones, say,
   from "Europe/Paris" to simply "Paris".  The following are all valid inputs:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input"># 2002-01-03 10:00 AM New York #</CODE><BR>

  </P>

  <H4><A NAME="CustomTimezones">Custom Timezones</A></H4>
  <P>
   While the Olson timezone database is very complete, and has named rules for
   basically all official timezones in the world, sometimes your data source
   only tells you the offset from UTC or GMT, or may even have custom offsets
   in minutes.  If this is the case, the timezone offset from UTC can be
   specified in one of the following formats:
  </P>

  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="code">+0700
   <LI CLASS="code">-0700
   <LI CLASS="code">+07:00
   <LI CLASS="code">-07:00
   <LI CLASS="code">GMT+0700
   <LI CLASS="code">GMT-0700
   <LI CLASS="code">GMT+07:00
   <LI CLASS="code">GMT-07:00
  </UL>

  <P>
   So, for example, if your data source is in the ISO-8601 format that doesn't
   allow you to use named timezones (it only allows only numbered timezones or
   the letter <CODE>Z</CODE>) and looks like:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE>2014-06-02T02:24:10-06:00</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Then Frink will parse the trailing <CODE>-06:00</CODE> as a timezone
   specification.  (Again, see all the date formats that Frink parses by
   default in the <A
    HREF="/frinkdata/dateformats.txt"><CODE>/dateformats.txt</CODE></A> file.)
  </P>

  <P>
   The trailing <CODE>Z</CODE> (for "Zulu time", an alias for UTC,) in the
   following ISO-8601 format indicates that the time is in UTC.
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE>2014-06-02T02:24:10Z</CODE>
  </P>

  <H4><A NAME="TimezoneWarning">Timezone Warning</A></H4>
  <P>
   <B>Warning:</B> The Olson timezone database and the POSIX standard (and the
   Java Virtual Machine) define timezones called something like
   <CODE>Etc/GMT+7</CODE> (or, using Frink's shorter notation,
   <CODE>GMT+7</CODE>), but you must be <EM>most strongly warned</EM> that the
   sign convention of these zones is <EM>opposite</EM> of what any rational
   person would choose, and <EM>opposite</EM> of the other sign conventions in
   Frink!  In the Olson/POSIX/Java world, <CODE>GMT-7</CODE> is actually 7
   hours <EM>ahead/east</EM> of GMT.  Yes, in that weird world,
   <CODE>GMT-7</CODE> means GMT <EM>plus</EM> seven hours.  Augh.  (And you
   wonder why all of my documentation is full of diatribes against the
   stupidity of almost every major standard.)
  </P>

  <P>
   This is a horrible, insane convention and it <EM>will</EM> bite you or the
   people you try to communicate with (unless you both accidentally share the
   same random form of insanity and wrongness.)  They will think you are crazy
   if you follow this convention.  Yet it's the convention used by a large
   fraction of the world's software, so Frink keeps these timezones around
   (for now) in case you have to communicate with other software that uses the
   insane Olson/POSIX conventions.  But <EM>do not</EM> use these conventions
   otherwise.
  </P>

  <P>
   The 4-digit timezone formats listed in the <A
   HREF="#CustomTimezones">Custom Timezones</A> section above use correct and
   rational definitions of these sign conventions.  If you are using custom
   timezones, you are most strongly warned to use the 4-digit versions like
   <CODE>GMT+0200</CODE> or <CODE>GMT+12:00</CODE>.  These will be correct.
   <CODE>GMT+0200</CODE> will mean GMT <EM>plus</EM> 2 hours.  But don't
   confuse these 4-digit versions with the shorter 1- or 2-digit
   Olson/POSIX/Java versions like <CODE>GMT+2</CODE> or <CODE>GMT+12</CODE> or
   <CODE>Etc/GMT+2</CODE> which should be considered weird and wrong (unless
   you're communicating with a source that produces these timezone names
   according to the weird and wrong Olson/POSIX/Java rules.  For now, Frink
   will let you use those weird conventions, but it will scowl and furrow its
   brow at you and someday in the future it may not allow them at all.  I might
   completely disallow the shorter versions of these timezone names
   (<I>i.e.</I> reject <CODE>GMT+7</CODE> while still allowing the more
   foolhardy <CODE>Etc/GMT+7</CODE>)
  </P>

   By default, Frink displays and parses all dates using the timezone
   specified by your operating system, unless the date string being parsed
   contains an explicit timezone (see <A HREF="#SpecifyingTimezones">
   "Specifying Timezones"</A> section above,) or if the output format contains 
   an explicit timezone name (see <A HREF="#TimezoneConversions">"Timezone

   where <CODE><I>tzstring</I></CODE> is the name of a timezone that Frink
   recognizes.  If the timezone name is not recognized, an error will be
   displayed and the default timezone will be unchanged.  For example, if you

   Coordinated Time (unless an explicit timezone identifier is given,) you can

   Actually, since 2003-06-12, Frink uses full precision (usually rational

   If you don't desire this much precision, you can use the

   You can subtract one date from another, or add/subtract a time interval to

   <B>Note:</B> You may notice that adding units of months or years (or
   commonyear, etc.)  may not give you the results you expect--that is because
   months and years are <EM>not</EM> fixed-size units, and even having a unit
   called "month" or "year" is inherently ill-advised.  Perhaps later there
   will be "increment/decrement" of these individual fields on Date objects,
   but it's better to make sure that you understand these are <EM>also</EM>
   inherently troublesome and often meaningless operations.  (<I>e.g.</I> what
   does it mean to increment the month on a date representing Jan. 31?)  Use
   fixed-size units if you can.
  </P>

  <P>
   You can subtract one date from another, and receive an answer as a Unit

  <P CLASS="warning">
   <B>Note:</B>  The following notes apply to Frink release 2008-08-02 and
   later.  Previous releases may have handled the transistion between Julian
   and Gregorian dates and large BC years inconsistently.
  </P>

  <UL>
   <LI>Frink models the switch between the Julian and Gregorian calendars.
    This switch occurs between October 4, 1582 (Julian) which
    was followed immediately by October 15, 1582 (Gregorian).  However, you
    should be warned that many countries observed the switch from the Julian
    to the Gregorian calendar in later years. (As late as 1918 in Russia, or
    1923 for Greece.)  When reviewing historical dates, you need to verify and
    double-check your author's assumptions about dates and calendar systems.

   <LI>Dates prior to this switch date are parsed and displayed as their dates
    in the Julian calendar.

   <LI>Frink follows Julian leap year rules before the switch date (all years
    divisible by 4 are leap years) and Gregorian leap year rules after the
    switch (if a year is divisible by 100, it is only a leap year if it is
    also divisible by 400.  Otherwise, all other years divisible by 4 are leap
    years.)

   <LI>Parsing a date between the switch dates will result in undefined
    behavior.

   <LI>Julian date <CODE># AD 0001-01-01 #</CODE> (Julian) was preceded
    immediately by <CODE># BC 0001-12-31 #</CODE> (Julian).  There is no year
    0, and negative years are intentionally disallowed when parsing, as they
    are often treated inconsistently by authors and scholars.  Again, if you
    encounter a negative year in a publication, you need to examine your
    author's assumptions about years before AD 0001.
  </UL>

  <H2><A NAME="DefiningNewDateTimeFormats">Defining New Date/Time Formats</A></H2>
  <P>
   If you want to enter date/time values in a specific format, you can enter
   new date formats on the fly.  Date formats are enclosed between sets of 3
   pound signs: <CODE>###<I>pattern</I>###</CODE>.  After defining a new
   pattern, dates between pound signs should be recognized.  For readability,
   you may have leading or trailing space in your formats or dates.  For
   example:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">### yyyy-MM-dd ###</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="input">#2001-09-10#</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">Sep 10, 2001 12:00:00 AM</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   You can also define the default <EM>output</EM> format with 4 pound signs.
   Without a definition in the <A
   HREF="/frinkdata/dateformats.txt">dateformats.txt</A> file, you get the
   Java default (which should theoretically get it from your system's
   settings, or mine if you're using the web interface,) but for lots of info,
   try something like:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">#### G yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss.SSS a (E) zzzz ####</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Date format expressions can be assigned to variables and/or used on the
   right-hand side of a conversion operator ( <CODE>-&gt;</CODE> ).  To output
   a date in a specified format, use something like:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">fmt = ### HH:mm ###<BR>
    now[] -&gt; fmt</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">23:55</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   If you want to format a date with both a specific format and a timezone,
   make the right-hand-side of the conversion operator into a 2-argument
   bracketed list with the first argument indicating the date format and the
   second a <EM>string</EM> indicating the timezone name:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">fmt = ### yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm a (E) zzzz ###<BR>

   Internally, all dates are represented as the Julian Day (which is

   fractions of days since Julian Day 0, which began at noon UTC on January 1,
   4713 B.C. as reckoned on the Julian Calendar.  Yes, <EM>noon</EM> is the
   beginning of the day in the Julian Day system.)  So noon UTC on September
   10, 2001 is JD 2452163.0.
  </P>

  <P>
   Julian Day (JD) and Modified Julian Day (MJD) can also be parsed.  MJD is

  <P>
   <B>Note:</B> Do not confuse the Julian Day, (which is a single continuous

   International Atomic Time (TAI) is a system of time based on the "proper

   Modern leap seconds were first introduced on
   1972 January 1, where the value of TAI-UTC became exactly 10 seconds, and
   leap seconds have been introduced at irregular intervals since then.  Leap
   seconds may be added just before January 1 or July 1 of each year.
  </P>

  <P>
   It should be noted that from 1961 January 1 to 1972 January 1, instead of
   introducing discrete leap seconds, you had to do linear interpolation to
   convert between TAI and UTC.  <I>Be warned that Frink follows this
   interpolation process between these dates, and the value of UTC-TAI will
   not be an integer during this period!</I> Before 1961 Jan 1, this function
   returns 0 seconds.  For dates after the last known leap second is
   introduced, this function will return the value of TAI-UTC for the last
   leap second (<I>e.g.</I> 34 seconds after 2009 Jan 1.)
  </P>

  <P>
   For more information on the interpolation, see <A

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println["Matched email $email"]
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   (Since a matched pattern always returns an array of values, putting
   <CODE>[email]</CODE> in square brackets assigns the result, as a single
   string, to the variable named <CODE>email</CODE>.  Without the brackets, it
   would assign <EM>the whole array</EM> to the variable <CODE>email</CODE>.)
  </P>

  <P>
   The matching syntax is similar to Perl or Ruby, with the exception that the
   pattern is denoted by <CODE>%r/<I>pattern</I>/<I>options</I></CODE> as
   below:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
   line = "New Zealand"<BR>
   if line =~ %r/Alan/i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE CLASS="comment">// Case-insensitive
     match</CODE><BR>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println["Matched"]<BR>
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   In the form listed above, no variable interpolation is done in the string.
   If you need to build up a variable regular expression from a string, use
   the <CODE>regex[<I>string</I>]</CODE> or <CODE>regex[<I>string</I>,
    <I>options</I>]</CODE> functions.  The sample below is identical to the
   sample above:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    line = "New Zealand"<BR>
    re = regex["Alan", "i"]<BR>
    if line =~ re<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println["Matched"]<BR>
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Any part of the pattern surrounded by parentheses are saved off and
   returned as an <EM>array</EM> (even if only one item is returned.)  There
   aren't shortcut <CODE>$1</CODE>... variables like in Perl, and probably
   never will be, as it's too easy to break code without knowing it.
  </P>

  <P>
   The usual idiom is to get return values by breaking apart the array that is
   returned:
  </P>
  
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
   line = "My name is Inigo Montoya."<BR><BR>
   if [first, last] = line =~ %r/my name is (\w+) (\w+)/i<BR>
   {<BR>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println["First name is: $first"]<BR>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println["Last  name is: $last"]<BR>
   }
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   If you don't assign the results to an array in square brackets (even a
   single-element array,) all matching results are assigned as an array to a
   single variable:

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
   line = "My name is Inigo Montoya."<BR><BR>
   results = line =~ %r/my name is (\w+) (\w+)/i<BR>
   if results<BR>
   {<BR>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println["First name is: " + results@0]<BR>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println["Last  name is: " + results@1]<BR>
   }
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   If the <CODE>/g</CODE> modifier is used at the end of the pattern,
   (indicating return <EM>all</EM> times matched, not just the first,) this
   will return an enumerating expression of the items matched, and you should
   change the <CODE>if</CODE> statement to a <CODE>for</CODE> statement:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
   line = "My name is Inigo Montoya."<BR><BR>
   for [first, last] = line =~ %r/my name is (\w+) (\w+)/ig<BR>
   {<BR>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println["First name is: $first"]<BR>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println["Last  name is: $last"]<BR>

   Repeating regular expression matches (those with the <CODE>/g</CODE>

  <P>
   (The above URL contains the e-mail address twice.)  Note that pattern
   matches always return a <EM>list</EM> of values, (even if only one item is
   returned,) so to get only the first match, the variable <CODE>email</CODE>
   must be placed in square brackets.
  </P>

  <P>
   If used in a non-enumerating context (such as simple assignment,) the match
   will return a list-of-lists:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">

   A Perl-like search-and-replace operator also exists.  The syntax is:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">line =~
    %s/<I>pattern</I>/<I>replacement</I>/<I>opts</I></CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   If the expression on the left-hand-side of <CODE>=~</CODE> is assignable,

  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    line =~ %s/Frank/Frink/g
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   In the form listed above, no variable interpolation is done in the
   <I>from</I> string.  If you need to build up a variable replacement
   expression from a string, use the <CODE>subst[<I>fromStr</I>,
   <I>toStr</I>]</CODE> or <CODE>subst[<I>fromStr</I>, <I>toStr</I>,
    <I>options</I>]</CODE> 
   functions.  Note that these <EM>do not</EM> actually perform the
   substitution, but create an object that can be used later to perform the
   substitution.  The sample below is identical to the sample above:
  </P>
  
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    fromStr = "Frank"<BR>
    rep = subst[fromStr, "Frink", "g"]<BR>
    line =~ rep<BR>
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   You can even use the Perl 5 behavior of replacing parenthesized parts of an
   expression.  The first parenthesized pattern on the left-hand side can be
   denoted by <CODE>$1</CODE> in the replacement, the second by
   <CODE>$2</CODE> and so on.  For example, to change a file with names like
   "Frink, John" to "John Frink":
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    line =~ %s/(\w+), (\w+)/$2 $1/
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   You can't use <CODE>$1</CODE> and <CODE>$2</CODE> outside of the pattern
   match, like you can in Perl, though.  Another difference from Perl is that
   the return value of a search-and-replace is the replaced string, and not
   the number of times replaced.  This may change.
  </P>

  <H3><A NAME="SubstitutionWithExpressions">Substitution with Expressions</A></H3>
  <P>
   If the <CODE>/e</CODE> modifier exists on a search-and-replace operation,
   the right-hand-side of the substitution is treated as an expression.  The
   values saved on the left-hand side in parentheses are put into the
   variables <CODE>$1</CODE> , <CODE>$2</CODE> , etc.  (<EM>Note that these
   variables are only available in the right-hand side of the
   substitution!</EM>)

  <H3><A NAME="ReadingLines">Reading Lines</A></H3>
  <P>
   Frink has a useful file/URL input function called
   <CODE>lines[<I>URL</I>]</CODE> which reads lines one at a time from the
   specified URL or <CODE>java.io.InputStream</CODE>.  The URL can be an HTTP,
   file, or FTP URL.  It is best used with the <A
   HREF="#ForLoop"><CODE>for</CODE></A> loop.  For example, to fetch and
   display the contents of a web page:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
   for line = lines["http://futureboy.us/"]<BR>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[line] 
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   By default, the <CODE>lines[<I>URL</I>]</CODE> function returns an
   enumerating expression which returns each line as requested, and forgets
   about previous lines.  If you want to store each line in an array for later
   use, use the <CODE>array[]</CODE> function:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    a = array[ lines["file:data/units.txt"] ]<BR>
    println["The data file contains " + length[a] + " lines."]
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   If the first argument is the special string <CODE>"-"</CODE>, then the
   function will return an enumeration which reads lines from standard input
   (stdin) one at a time.  The following implements a simple "echo" program:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    for line = lines["-"]<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[line]
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Or, a simple program to read in and sort the lines from standard input, and
   print them back out:
  <P CLASS="code">
   
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    println[join["\n",sort[lines["-"]]]]
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   The argument to the function may also be a <CODE>java.io.InputStream</CODE>
   which simplifies reading from other input streams (for example,
   reading from a <CODE>URLConnection</CODE> or an external process, or a
   pipe.)

  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    bigstring = read["http://futureboy.us/"]

   Hint:  If you don't know what a file URL looks like on your system, try
   opening the file locally in your web browser.  It will show you what the
   file URL is.

  <P>
   If the url is the special value <CODE>"-"</CODE> these functions will read
   all the data passed to standard input (stdin) in one fell swoop.  For

   The <CODE CLASS="input">lines[<I>URL</I>] and read[<I>URL</I>]</CODE>
   functions will attempt to set the character encoding correctly based on the
   <CODE>Content-Type</CODE> HTTP header.  If you are not requesting an HTTP
   URL, or the encoding is not properly specified, or not set in the HTTP
   headers, these functions will use your system's default character encoding.
   If the default charset is not appropriate for a file or URL, you can
   explicitly specify the character encoding of the file using the
   two-argument versions of the above functions:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">lines[<I>URL</I>,&nbsp;<I>encoding</I>]<BR>
    read[<I>URL</I>,&nbsp;<I>encoding</I>]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   The encoding is a string representing any character encoding that your
   version of Java supports, <I>e.g.</I> <CODE>"UTF-8"</CODE>,
   <CODE>"US-ASCII"</CODE>, <CODE>"ISO-8859-1"</CODE>, <CODE>"UTF-16"</CODE>,
   <CODE>"UTF-16BE"</CODE>, <CODE>"UTF-16LE"</CODE>.  Your release of Java may
   support more charsets, but all implementations of Java are required to
   support the above.  Check the release notes for your Java implementation to
   see if other charsets are supported.
  </P>

  <P>
   In addition, see the sample program  
   <A HREF="/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=encodings.frink">encodings.frink</A> which
   demonstrates how to list all of the encodings available on your system (and
   their aliases.)
  </P>

  <H2><A NAME="WritingFiles">Writing Files</A></H2>
  <P>
   Text files can be written with the <CODE>Writer</CODE> class.  For example:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="CODE">
   <CODE>
    w = new Writer["filename.txt"]<BR>
    w.print[2]<BR>
    w.println[" monkeys."]<BR>
    w.close[]<BR>
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   The <CODE>Writer</CODE> class can write out any Unicode text properly in
   the encoding that you specify (or your system's default encoding, if you
   don't specify an encoding.)  You can also read in files in one encoding and
   translate them to another encoding.
  <P>

  <P>
   For example, the following simple program reads in a file in the UTF-8
   encoding and writes it out in the UTF-16 encoding (or you can use it to
   convert between any encodings that your Java Virtual Machine supports):
  </P>

  <P CLASS="CODE">
   <CODE>
    w = new Writer["outfile.txt", "UTF-16"]<BR>
    w.print[read["file:infile.txt", "UTF-8"]]<BR>
    w.close[]<BR>
   </CODE>
  </P>

   See <A
    HREF="#SpecifyingAlternateEncodings">Specifying Alternate Encodings</A>
   for information about supported encodings.

  <H3>Writer Constructors</H3>
  <P>
   Note that calling any of the constructors below immediately checks
   permissions and opens the file if allowed.  Your operating system may only
   allow one process to open a file for writing at a time.

  <H3><A NAME="URLManipulation">URL Manipulation</A></H3>
  <P>
   Frink provides a few functions which are useful for manipulating URLs and
   producing web-spiders:
  </P>

  <P>
   <CODE CLASS="input">url[base, relative]</CODE> returns a new string URL
   made up of the given base and relative parts of a URL.  This is useful in
   resolving relative URLs in an HTML document:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">url["http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/index.html",&nbsp;"whatsnew.html"]</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/whatsnew.html</CODE>
  </P>
  
  <P>
   <CODE CLASS="input">urlHost[url]</CODE> returns a string indicating the
   hostname of a specifed URL string (e.g. <CODE>"futureboy.us"</CODE>, or
   an empty string if no host is specified.)
  </P>

  <P>
   <CODE CLASS="input">urlPath[url]</CODE> returns a string indicating the
   entire path of a specifed URL string,
   (e.g. <CODE>"http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/whatsnew.html"</CODE> will 
   return <CODE>"/frinkdocs/whatsnew.html"</CODE>)
  </P>
  
  <P>
   <CODE CLASS="input">urlFile[url]</CODE> returns a string indicating the
   filename of a specifed URL string, that is the last path part of a URL
   (e.g. <CODE>"http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/whatsnew.html"</CODE> will
   return <CODE>"whatsnew.html"</CODE>)
  </P>
  
  <P>
   <CODE CLASS="input">URLEncode[<I>string, encoding</I>]</CODE> encodes a

   be the string <CODE>"UTF8"</CODE> for most applications.
  </P>
  
  <P>
   <CODE CLASS="input">urlProtocol[url]</CODE> returns a string indicating the
   protocol (e.g., <CODE>"http"</CODE> of a given URL string.)
  </P>

   The following program resolves all of the relative URLs in an HTML
   document and prints their values.

  <H2><A NAME="AnonymousFunctions">Anonymous Functions</A></H2>
  <P>
   In Frink, you can define blocks of executable code which can be assigned to
   variables, passed to and from functions, and executed as functions.  These
   work just like functions with no name.  In fact, that's exactly what they
   are.  The syntax is:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">{ |<I>arglist</I>| <I>body</I> }</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
    These can be multi-line functions, too:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
    <CODE CLASS="input">{ |<I>x, y</I>|<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[x+y]<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[x*y]<BR>
    }</CODE>
  </P>
  
  <P>
   The arguments in <CODE>arglist</CODE> are a (possibly empty)
   comma-separated list of variable names which are treated just like the
   formal parameters to a function.  The body is one or more statements or
   expressions to be executed.
  </P>

  <P>
   How is this useful?  Well, for example the <A
    HREF="#select"><CODE>select</CODE></A> function can take an anonymous
   function as an argument to help it select items from a list.  See its
   documentation for more information.
  </P>

  <P>
   An anonymous function can be called as a function.  The current syntax looks
   just like a function call:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    isEven = { |x|  x mod 2 == 0 }<BR>
    isEven[4]<BR>
   </CODE>
   <CODE CLASS="output">true</CODE>
  </P>

  <H2><A NAME="Sorting">Sorting</A></H2>
  <P>
   <CODE>sort[<I>list</I>]</CODE>will sort lists in which the elements have
   the same type.  When sorting units, the units should be conformal (that is,
   all should have the same dimensions.)  It is important to note that the
   list will be sorted in-place, that is, the original list will be modified!
   To get around this, the array should first be copied with the <A
    HREF="#ArrayMethods"><CODE><I>array</I>.shallowCopy[]</CODE> method.</A>
  </P>
  
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    a = [5,2,3,1,4]<BR>
    sort[a]<BR>
   </CODE>
   <CODE CLASS="output">
    [1,2,3,4,5]
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   The two-argument version <CODE>sort[<I>list</I>, <I>func</I>]</CODE> allows
   you to specify a user-defined comparison routine. The second argument is a
   anonymous function which contains a user-defined comparison routine.  The
   comparison routine must take 2 arguments (say <CODE>|a,b|</CODE>) and
   return -1 if a is less than b, 0 if a==b, and 1 if a is greater than b.
   The following samples are equivalent:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    a = [5,2,3,1,4]<BR>
    cmp = { |a,b|  a &lt;=&gt; b }<BR>
    sort[a, cmp]<BR>
   </CODE>
   <CODE CLASS="output">
    [1,2,3,4,5]
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   The default sort is much faster than if you define a user-defined
   comparison function (about 30 times faster in my tests!)  Now I see why
   Perl has so many anomalous and special-cased optimizations around
   user-defined sorting.
  </P>

  <P>
   If the <CODE>sort</CODE> function needs additional data to perform its
   work, you can use the three-argument <CODE>sort[<I>list</I>, <I>func</I>,
   <I>data</I>]</CODE> function which requires a three-argument comparison
   function to be passed to it, with the first two arguments being items to
   compare and the third argument being the arbitrary data.  For example, to
   sort a list by a specified column number:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    list = [[1, "c"], [2, "b"], [3, "a"]]<BR>
    <BR>
    <CODE CLASS="comment">
     // Create a comparision function that takes a column number.<BR>
    </CODE>
     cmpfunc = {|a, b, column| a@column <=> b@column}<BR>
    <BR>
    <CODE CLASS="comment">
     // Sort by column 1.  Note that the third argument is passed<BR>
     // as the third argument to the comparison function.</CODE><BR>
     sort[list, cmpfunc, 1]<BR>
   </CODE>
   <CODE CLASS="output">[[3, a], [2, b], [1, c]]</CODE>
  </P>
  
  <P>
   If you want the elements in reverse order, you can reverse the sorted list
   by calling the <CODE>reverse[<I>list</I>]</CODE> function on the sorted
   list.
  </P>

  <P>
   To sort all of the units with dimensions of time (or by extension, any
   dimension list) by their magnitude, you can use the following.  (Keep in
   mind that the <CODE>units</CODE> function returns the <EM>names</EM> of the
   units as strings.  The function <CODE>unit[<I>string</I>]</CODE> returns
   the unit with the specified name.:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    sort[units[time], { |a,b| unit[a] &lt;=&gt; unit[b] }]
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <H2><A NAME="ListComprehensions">List Comprehensions</A></H2>
  <P>
   The following functions operate on all the elements of an array:
  </P>

  <H3><A NAME="select">select</A></H3>
  <P>
   The <CODE>select[<I>list</I>,
   <I>proc</I>]</CODE> function allows you to select the items from a list for
   which <CODE>proc</CODE> returns <CODE>true</CODE>.  For example, to select
   the even items from a list:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    array = [0,1,2,3,4,5]<BR>
    select[ array, { |x|  x mod 2 == 0 } ]<BR>
   </CODE>
   <CODE CLASS="output">[0,2,4]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   This successively assigns each element of <CODE>array</CODE> to a new
   local variable <CODE>x</CODE>, and returns the list of values for which
   <CODE>x mod 2</CODE> equals zero.
  </P>

  <P>
   If the function takes more than one argument, and is passed an array of
   values, the elements of the array are passed individually as function
   arguments.
  </P>

  <P>
   The following sample selects pairs of numbers which are coprime, that is,
   do <EM>not</EM> contain common factors (this is tested by checking if the
   greatest common factor is 1.):
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    array = [[2,3], [5,10], [20, 3], [7, 25]]<BR>
    coprime = {|x,y| gcd[x,y] == 1}<BR>
    select[array, coprime]<BR>
   </CODE>
   <CODE CLASS="output">[[2, 3], [20, 3], [7, 25]]</CODE>
  </P>
  
  <P>
   <B>Note:</B> The second argument to <CODE>select[<I>list</I>,
   <I>regex</I>]</CODE> can also be a regular expression.  This expects the
   list to contain all strings and returns all of the strings that match the
   regular expression.
  </P>

  <P>
   If the <CODE>select</CODE> function needs additional data to perform its
   work, you can use the three-argument <CODE>select[<I>list</I>, <I>func</I>,
   <I>data</I>]</CODE>
   function which requires a two-argument function to be passed to it, with
   the first argument being the item and the second argument the arbitrary
   data.  For example, to select all the elements of a list that are greater
   a certain number (in the following case, 2):
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    array = [0,1,2,3,4,5]<BR>
    select[ array, { |x, data|  x > data }, 2]<BR>
   </CODE>
   <CODE CLASS="output">[3,4,5]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Similarly, the three-argument <CODE>select</CODE> function that passes in
   additional data will pass the data argument as the last argument to your
   selector function.
  </P>

  <P>
   The following example selects pairs whose product is larger than a specific
   number (in this case, 50).
  </P>
   
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    array = [[2,3], [5,10], [20, 3], [7, 25]]<BR>
    product = {|x,y,data| x*y > data}<BR>
    select[array, product, 50]<BR>
   </CODE>
   <CODE CLASS="output">[[20, 3], [7, 25]]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   <B>Behavior change:</B>  As of the 2014-05-09 release, the
   <CODE>select</CODE> and <CODE>remove</CODE> functions now try
   harder to keep their return values as arrays if passed an array, and an
   enumerating expression if passed an enumerating expression.  In addition,
    they now keep dictionaries as dictionaries, OrderedLists as OrderedLists,
    and sets as sets.  To obtain
    other types, <CODE>toArray[<I>expr</I>]</CODE>,
    <CODE>toDict[<I>expr</I>]</CODE>, and <CODE>toSet[<I>expr</I>]</CODE>
    functions.  If in doubt, use these functions directly to change the return
    types.)
   However,closing the results in a <A
   HREF="#ForLoop"><CODE>for</CODE> loop</A> will still work to enumerate
   through all contained objects, no matter what the return type is.)
  </P>
  
  <P>
   This makes these functions now work properly with infinite series, and work
   more responsively with long-running operations that return information
   periodically. (<I>e.g.</I> searches.)  This change may also allow
   significantly-reduced memory consumption, as you can process each element
   and then forget about it, rather than holding on to a large array of
   values.
  </P>

  <P>
   The inverse of <CODE>select</CODE> is <CODE>remove</CODE>.  Read below.
  </P>
  
  <H3><A NAME="remove">remove</A></H3>
  <P>
   The inverse of the <CODE>select</CODE> function is <CODE>remove</CODE>
   which works similarly to <CODE>select</CODE>, but <EM>removes</EM> all
   items from a list that match the condition.
  </P>
   
  <P>
   The <CODE>remove[<I>list</I>,
   <I>proc</I>]</CODE> function allows you to remove the items from a list for
   which <CODE>proc</CODE> returns <CODE>true</CODE>.  For example, to remove
   the even items from a list:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    array = [0,1,2,3,4,5]<BR>
    remove[ array, { |x|  x mod 2 == 0 } ]<BR>
   </CODE>
   <CODE CLASS="output">[1, 3, 5]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   This successively assigns each element of <CODE>array</CODE> to a new
   local variable <CODE>x</CODE>, and removes all values for which
   <CODE>x mod 2</CODE> equals zero.
  </P>

  <P>
   If the function takes more than one argument, and is passed an array of
   values, the elements of the array are passed individually as function
   arguments.
  </P>

  <P>
   The following sample removes pairs of numbers which are coprime, that is,
   do <EM>not</EM> contain common factors (this is tested by checking if the
   greatest common factor is 1.):
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    array = [[2,3], [5,10], [20, 3], [7, 25]]<BR>
    coprime = {|x,y| gcd[x,y] == 1}<BR>
    remove[array, coprime]<BR>
   </CODE>
   <CODE CLASS="output">[[5, 10]]</CODE>
  </P>
  
  <P>
   <B>Note:</B> The second argument to <CODE>remove[<I>list</I>,
   <I>regex</I>]</CODE> can also be a regular expression.  This expects the
   list to contain all strings and removes all of the strings that match the
   regular expression, returning the items that did <EM>not</EM> match.
  </P>

  <P>
   For example, if you wanted to remove all filenames that contained the
   substring <CODE>CVS</CODE> from a list, you might have to write a
   somewhat complicated, non-obvious regular expression that does not match
   that pattern using select: 
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">select[files,  %r/^(.(?!(CVS)))*$/]</CODE>
  <P>

  <P>
   Or, more simply, use <CODE>remove</CODE> and a simpler pattern that matches
   the strings we want to remove:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">remove[files,  %r/CVS/]</CODE>
  <P>
   
  <P>
   If the <CODE>remove</CODE> function needs additional data to perform its
   work, you can use the three-argument <CODE>remove[<I>list</I>, <I>func</I>,
   <I>data</I>]</CODE>
   function which requires a two-argument function to be passed to it, with
   the first argument being the item and the second argument the arbitrary
   data.  For example, to remove all the elements of a list that match a
   certain number (in the following case, 2):
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    array = [0,1,2,3,4,5]<BR>
    remove[ array, { |x, data|  x == data }, 2]<BR>
   </CODE>
   <CODE CLASS="output">[0,1,3,4,5]</CODE>
  </P>
  
  <P>
   Similarly, the three-argument <CODE>remove</CODE> function that passes in
   additional data will pass the data argument as the last argument to your
   selector function.
  </P>

  <P>
   The following example removes pairs whose product is larger than a specific
   number (in this case, 50).
  </P>
   
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    array = [[2,3], [5,10], [20, 3], [7, 25]]<BR>
    product = {|x,y,data| x*y > data}<BR>
    remove[array, product, 50]<BR>
   </CODE>
   <CODE CLASS="output">[[2, 3], [5, 10]]</CODE>
  </P>
  
  <H3><A NAME="map">map</A></H3>
  <P>
   The <CODE>map[<I>function</I>, <I>list</I>]</CODE> applies the specified
   function to all the members of a list, and returns a new list containing
   the results.
  <P>

  <P>
   The <CODE><I>function</I></CODE> parameter may be either a string
   containing the name of the function or a function, possibly an <A
    HREF="#AnonymousFunctions">anonymous function</A>.
  </P>

  <P>
   If your list of arguments all have the same number of items, you can pass
   in the function name as a string:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    array = [0,1,4,9]<BR>
    map["sqrt", array]<BR>
   </CODE>
   <CODE CLASS="output">[0,1,2,3]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   You may need to pass in a reference to the function itself as the first
   parameter.  You can do this by calling the <CODE>getFunction[<I>name</I>,
   <I>numArgs</I>]</CODE> function.  For example, to return the greatest
   common denominator of successive pairs of numbers, you might do the
   following:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    array = [[3,5], [2,10], [24, 36]]<BR>
    g = getFunction["gcd", 2]<BR>
    map[g, array]<BR>
   </CODE>
   <CODE CLASS="output">[1,2,12]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Or, defining and using an <A HREF="#AnonymousFunctions">anonymous
    function</A>:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    array = [1,2,3]<BR>
    double = {|a|  a*2 }<BR>
    map[double, array]<BR>
   </CODE>
   <CODE CLASS="output">[2,4,6]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Anonymous arrays with any number of arguments are allowed, as long as each
   element of your list is a list containing the right number of items.
  </P>

  <P>
   Currently, all elements of the list must have the same number of elements
   and will resolve to the same function call.
  </P>

  <P>
   If the number of items that will be passed to the function is greater than
   the number of formal arguments defined by the function, all of the extra
   arguments will be passed as an array to the last argument of the function.
   For example, if we define a function that only takes one argument, but pass
   it three items in each list, all three items will be passed as an array:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    concat = {|i| join["", i]}<BR>
    a = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]<BR>

   </CODE>
   <CODE CLASS="output">[123, 456, 789]</CODE>
  </P>

  <H3><A NAME="split">split</A></H3>
  <P>
   A string can be split into an array using the <CODE>split[<I>regex</I>,
   <I>str</I>]</CODE> function which splits the string into parts.  The first
   argument to the <CODE>split[<I>pat</I>,&nbsp;<I>str</I>]</CODE> function
   can be either a regular expression or a string containing the delimiter.
   Conversely, the elements of an array can be joined into a string with a
   fixed delimiter, using <CODE>join[<I>separator</I>, <I>array</I>]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Splitting a string into an array, splitting on whitespace (the pattern
   <CODE>\s+</CODE> matches 1 or more whitespace characters:)
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">

   <CODE CLASS="output">[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</CODE><BR>
  </P>

  <P>
   Or, to split a tab-delimited line into elements:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">array = split["\t", line]</CODE><BR>
   which is the same as<BR>
   <CODE CLASS="input">array = split[%r/\t/, line]</CODE><BR>
  </P>
  
  <H3><A NAME="join">join</A></H3>
  <P>
   The reverse of <CODE>split</CODE> is <CODE>join</CODE> which joins multiple
   array elements into one string, with elements separated by the specified

  <P>
   The function <CODE>zip[<I>a</I>, <I>b</I>]</CODE> "zips" together
   corresponding elements of lists <CODE>a</CODE> and <CODE>b</CODE> and
   returns each pair as a two-element array.  (This is what this function is
   usually called in functional programming, and has nothing to do with the
   zip compression format.)  For example:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">zip[1 to 3, 6 to 8]</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">[ [1,6], [2,7], [3,8] ]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   If one list is longer than the other, the shorter list will be
   padded with <CODE>undef</CODE> values.  If <EM>both</EM> arguments are
   enumerating expressions, the result will be an efficient enumerating
   expression.  Otherwise, the arguments will be converted to arrays and the
   result will be an array (which is potentially large.)  Also note that an
   array <EM>is</EM> an enumerating expression too!
  </P>

  <P>
   The results can be processed individually with the <CODE>for</CODE> loop:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    for a = zip[1 to million, 3 to million + 3]<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[a]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   If you wish to pad with values other than <CODE>undef</CODE>, there is a
   4-argument version of the function <CODE>zip[<I>a</I>, <I>b</I>,
    <I>defaultA</I>, <I>defaultB</I>]</CODE> that specifies what values to pad
   each list with.

    include the strings <CODE>"Input"</CODE>
    and <CODE>"Output"</CODE>.  <CODE>"Input"</CODE> is a formatter that
    provides Frink's input form that can be easily parsed by a call
    to <CODE>eval[<I>str</I>]</CODE>.  <CODE>"Output"</CODE> is the
    human-friendly formatter, which has been greatly improved for the
    introduction of multiple formatters.

  <H2><A NAME="Graphics">Graphics</A></H2>
  <P>
   Frink has a powerful system for drawing graphics in a simple way.  Here are
   some of the features:
  </P>

  <UL>
   <LI><B>Flexible coordinate system:</B> You can draw your graphics to any
    coordinates you wish, and Frink will, by default, automatically scale and
    center them in your display device, eliminating the tedium and error of
    manual coordinate conversions, adjustment for different window or printer
    sizes, etc.

   <LI><B>Dimensioned drawings:</B>  Graphics can be specified with explicit
    lengths (such as "3 cm",) so exactly-sized drawings can be printed.
    (Well, as accurately as your printer's driver allows them to be!)

   <LI><B>Infinitely scalable:</B> Frink's graphics are primarily designed to
    work with shapes, not individual pixels, so they can be re-scaled perfectly
    to display with full resolution on printers, in resizable graphics
    windows, in image files, or in rescalable vector formats.
    
   <LI><B>High-quality shapes:</B>  Polygons and polylines are drawn with
    properly-joined, angled corners.

   <LI><B>Anti-Aliasing:</B> Lines and shapes are anti-aliased, eliminating
    jagged edges.  (When running under Java 1.2 or later.  Frink's graphics
    will also run on Java 1.1, but without antialiased edges.)

   <LI><B>Transparency (alpha channel):</B> Allows transparent shapes and
    lines, and see-through shapes to be drawn on top of other shapes.
    Anti-aliased edges are drawn with proper transparency so they can be
    overlaid on any background color or image.  (Requires Java 1.2 or later for
    transparency.)

   <LI><B>High-quality text:</B>  Text can be written into any graphics
    object, with properly transparent anti-aliased edges.  Text may be scaled
    along with the image, or rendered at a constant size.

   <LI><B>Easy transformations:</B>  All graphics can be translated, scaled,
    and rotated, making it very easy to draw objects to the coordinate system
    that is easiest to use, and translating it into larger drawings.  When
    graphics are scaled and rotated, Frink is smart enough to keep what you've
    drawn centered and scaled to fit on the screen or printed page!

   <LI><B>Easy writing to files:</B> Graphics can be easily written to various
    file formats, including JPEG, PNG, HTML5 canvas, and Scalable Vector
    Graphics (SVG) formats.  PNG supports transparency (alpha channel) and
    allows antialiased, semi-transparent lines and shapes to be overlaid over
    other backgrounds or layers.  SVG format allows infinite rescaling and
    perfect rendering to high-resolution devices such as printers, and perfect
    import into other vector graphics programs.

   <LI><B>Easy display on different devices:</B> The same graphics object
    can be created and then displayed on screen, printed to a printer, or
    written to a file, using a single command.

  <P>
   That's it.  Frink takes care of the scaling and centering by default.  The
   coordinates that you choose can be whatever is most convenient and natural
   for you.  You can also create as many <CODE>graphics</CODE> objects as you
   want.  By default, when you call <CODE><I>graphics</I>.show[]</CODE>, each
   graphics object is displayed in its own resizable window. 
  </P>

  <H3><A NAME="Coordinates">Coordinates</A></H3>
  <P>
   Coordinates in Frink's graphics are very flexible.  There are a few things
   to note:
  </P>

  <UL>
   <LI>Coordinates are specified as (x, y) with <CODE>x</CODE> being the
    horizontal coordinate and <CODE>y</CODE> the vertical coordinate.

   <LI>Horizontal coordinates increase as you move right.

   <LI>Vertical coordinates increase as you move down.  (Note that this is the
    common convention for almost all computer graphics, but is different than
    the usual mathematical conventions.  There may be a way to flip this
    in the future.  Until then, just negate vertical coordinates to flip
    them.)

   <LI><B>Arbitrary-sized coordinates:</B>  Coordinates can be as big or small
    as you want.  Any real number that Frink can represent is fine.

   <LI><B>Automatic centering and scaling:</B> You don't need to worry about
    the size or location of your rendering window.  By default, all graphics
    are resized and centered to fit into your graphics device (whether it's a
    resizable window, a printed page, or a graphic file.)  This saves lots of
    time and effort when drawing most graphics.  Even if your graphics have
    been scaled, translated, and rotated, Frink will still ensure that what
    you've drawn is scaled and centered.

   <LI><B>Aspect ratio:</B> Aspect ratio is preserved by default.  That is, if
    a rectangle is 2 units wide and 1 unit high, it will retain that shape on
    resizing.  (There is currently no way to turn this off; if you want
    different scaling, just multiply one axis by the desired factor.)

   <LI><B>Accurately-scaled drawings</B>: Coordinates may have dimensions of
    length (e.g. "1 inch"), in which case they are treated specially.  In this
    case, the graphics are still translated to fit into your view window, but
    Frink will also attempt to render them at the specified size.  This is
    highly dependent on how your operating system reports its resolution.  It
    works very well for printers, but not as well for monitors (especially in
    Windows, which almost always reports its screen resolution as 96 dpi, no
    matter what it really is.)  This allows you to print exact-sized drawings

  <TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=3 SUMMARY="Graphics Shape and Color Methods">
    <TR><TH>Method<TH>Description
    <TR><TD CLASS="lit">color[<I>r, g, b</I>]<TD>Sets the current
      drawing color.  All following drawings will be made using this color.
      The color is specified with its red, green, and blue
      components which are floating-point values which must range from 0.0 to
      1.0, with 0.0 being completely dark for that component, and 1.0 being
      the brightest value for that component.  In a new graphics object, the
      default drawing color is black.  This also returns the color object so
      you can later re-use it in a <CODE>color[<I>c</I>]</CODE> method call.

    <TR><TD CLASS="lit">color[<I>r, g, b, alpha</I>]<TD>Also specifies a
      color, but with transparency.  The <CODE>alpha</CODE> component
      specifies the opacity of the color, and takes values from 0.0 to 1.0,
      with 1.0 being fully opaque and 0.0 being fully transparent.  (Note:
      transparency requires Java 1.2 or later.)  This also returns the color
      object so you can later re-use it in a <CODE>color[<I>c</I>]</CODE>
        method call.

    <TR><TD CLASS="lit">color[<I>colorObject</I>]<TD>Sets the current color to
      a color object that has been previously obtained from a call to
      <CODE>color[<I>r, g, b, alpha</I>]</CODE>, <CODE>color[<I>r, g,
      b</I>]</CODE>, or a call to the constructor <CODE>new color[<I>r, g, b,
      alpha</I>]</CODE> or <CODE>new color[<I>r, g, b</I>]</CODE>.
      
    <TR><TD CLASS="lit">backgroundColor[<I>r, g, b</I>]<TD>Sets the
      background color of the graphics window or image file.  The color
      components are specified as above.  There should be only one
      <CODE>backgroundColor</CODE> method call in a <CODE>graphics</CODE>
      object, and it should be the first method called when drawing.  If more
      than one call to <CODE>backgroundColor</CODE> is made, this will raise a
      warning.  (It will also replace any existing background color, but that
      behavior should not be relied on.)  By default, the background color is
      opaque white (or transparent when writing formats like SVG.)

    <TR><TD CLASS="lit">stroke[<I>width</I>]<TD>Sets the stroke width used to
      draw lines, polygon outlines, ellipses, and polylines.  If the width is a
      dimensionless number, (e.g. <CODE CLASS="input">10</CODE>) the stroke
      will be scaled along with the drawing.  If the stroke has units of
      length, (e.g. <CODE CLASS="input">2 mm</CODE>) the lines will be
      rendered at that constant width regardless of how the image is scaled.
      (Note that the stroke width can not be changed in Java 1.1.)

    <TR><TD CLASS="lit">alpha[<I>opacity</I>]<TD>Sets the transparency (often
      called "alpha channel") of all subsequent drawing operations.  The
      opacity is a dimensionless number from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully
      opaque.)  This primarily allows you to draw transparent images, as
      transparency can already be specified when setting colors.  If a color
      already has a transparency, that transparency value will be multiplied
      by this global transparency.  (Note that the transparency can not be
      changed in Java 1.1.) 
      
    <TR><TD CLASS="lit">line[<I>x1, y1, x2, y2</I>]<TD>Draws a straight line
      segment between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using the current color.
      
    <TR><TD CLASS="lit">fillRectSize[<I>x, y, width, height</I>]<P>drawRectSize[<I>x, y, width, height</I>]<TD>Draws
    a rectangle (filled or outlined, depending on the method called) with top
      left coordinate (x,y) and the specified width and height.  If the width
      or height are negative, this draws the rectangle to the left or to the

    <TR><TD
    CLASS="lit">fillEllipseSize[<I>x, y, width, height</I>]<P>drawEllipseSize[<I>x, y, width, height</I>]<TD>Draws

      coordinate (x,y) and the specified width and height.  If the width or

   A <CODE>graphics</CODE> object can be built up from multiple
   <CODE>graphics</CODE> objects that are added to it.  These graphics can be
   added at their original size, or placed at a certain location and size.
   This makes it easy to create complex graphics from many different graphics
   objects that were rendered at their "natural" sizes and then automatically
   resized to fit where you want them, <EM>no matter what coordinates they
    were originally drawn to!</EM>
  </P>

  <P>
   When adding one <CODE>graphics</CODE> obect into another, the new graphics
   object added will be transformed according to the current state of the <A
    HREF="#TransformingGraphics">Graphics Transformation</A> and global
   transparency (set by the <CODE>alpha[<I>opacity</I>]</CODE> method listed
   above in the <A HREF="#ShapesAndColors">Shapes and Colors</A> section.)
  </P>
  
  <P>
   Note that the object is fit according to its estimated bounding box;
   if the bounding box is estimated too large, then the graphic may not
   fill the entire region requested, and you may have to manually adjust
   the scaling.
   </P>
   
  <P>
   The following methods on a <CODE>graphics</CODE> object allow you to add
   other <CODE>graphics</CODE> objects to them.

      should be drawn. <CODE>insets</CODE> is a floating-point value between 0
      and 1, where 1 means to use 100% of the window with the graphic (no
      borders.)  An insets value of 0.95 causes 5% of the window's width

    The format of the file is guessed from the filename's extension.  If the

      supports it, the image will be rendered with a transparent background,
      allowing you to stack and create composite images with full
      anti-aliasing and background support.  The file formats supported by
      your version of Java may vary, but the following should be supported:
      
      <UL>
       <LI><B>JPEG</B>: Does not support transparency.  Requires Java 1.4 or
        later.
       <LI><B>PNG</B>: (Portable Network Graphics) Supports transparency and
        full anti-aliasing of transparent graphics.  Requires Java 1.4 or
        later.
       <LI><B>SVG</B>: (Scalable Vector Graphics) A vector format that is
        infinitely resizable.  Supports transparency.  By default, all
        backgrounds in SVG graphics are transparent.  Works in all versions
        of Java.  <EM>Warning:</EM>  Due to a deficiency in the SVG standard,
        drawings with dimensions of length (e.g. "1 inch") may not work
        properly for some shapes, notably polygons, polylines, and GeneralPath.
       <LI><A NAME="html5"><B>HTML</B></A>: (HTML5 canvas support required)
        While HTML5 will not be a finalized specification until at least 2014,
        major modern browsers for desktop and mobile devices (Firefox, Chrome,
        Opera, Safari, IE) support the HTML5 features that Frink requires.
        <UL>
         <LI>Transmission of vector graphics in vector formats, allowing
          efficient, antialiased rendering of vector graphics.

         <LI>Bitmapped images are transmitted within the HTML document as
          embedded <CODE>data</CODE> URIs encoded in base-64, allowing you to
          send the entire graphic as a single HTML file.  Bitmapped images are
          transmitted at the end of the file, and displayed as they are loaded,
          allowing progressive display of documents containing multiple
          bitmaps.

         <LI>All of Frink's graphics primitives are supported, including
          bitmaps, <CODE>GeneralPath</CODE>, partially-transparent graphics,
          rotations, translations, and scaling.

         <LI>HTML5 is rendered to relatively simple, user-modifiable code.

         <LI><I>What doesn't work in HTML5 (future wish list):</I>
          <UL>
           <LI>Drawings with dimensions (<I>e.g.</I> a rectangle with width
            <CODE>1 inch</CODE>) does not get rendered properly to HTML5.  I'm
            still doing research to see if we can get a reasonable resolution
            figure from the rendering environment.
            
           <LI>HTML5, for some ungodly reason, does not support the <A
           HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even-odd_rule">even-odd winding
           rule</A> for filling graphics, which becomes important when drawing
           an arbitrary <CODE>GeneralPath</CODE> and self-intersecting filled
           polygons.  HTML5 only supports the rather stupid and useless <A
           HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonzero-rule"
           TARGET="_blank">nonzero winding rule</A> which will make some
           objects with "hollow" centers not render the same in HTML5 as they
           do in all other sane environments (e.g. Swing, AWT, Android, SVG,
           PostScript, PDF).
            <P>
             This means that you may have to draw the inside and outside paths
             of an object with "holes" in different "directions" to make it
             work correctly.  See <A
             HREF="/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=GeneralPathTest.frink">GeneralPathTest.frink</A>
             for an example of a working and non-working hollow object.  The
             commented-out code demonstrates how the code had to be changed to
             accommodate this stupid deficiency in HTML5, which will hopefully
             be improved before the specification is finalized.

            <P>
             Frink goes to some lengths to kludge around this problem, such as
             by alternating the drawing direction of circles/ellipses each
             time one is drawn.  Sigh.  If you're drawing circles/ellipses
             inside each other, draw them in order from inside out or outside
             in and it should just work, but a truly generic solution is not
             possible without a sane winding rule.

           <LI>Animation is not yet possible in HTML5.  It's not clear if this
            will be easy without porting all of Frink to JavaScript.

           <LI>All bitmapped graphics are embedded in PNG format.  These may
           be larger than the corresponding JPEG graphics, but they are
           lossless and allow alpha channels, which JPEG does not allow.  It's
           possible that there may be a switch in the future to embed bitmaps
           in JPEG format and to control the quality, or the renderer may get
           "smarter" and determine if alpha channels are present, and switch
           rendering formats for efficiency.

           <LI>A single bitmapped image currently cannot be rendered several
           times in the same graphic without retransmitting it.

           <LI>When rendering just a portion of a bitmapped image to HTML5,
           the entire original bitmap file is transmitted in the HTML5
           document.

           <LI>If the browser doesn't support the HTML5 <CODE>canvas</CODE>
           element, Frink could theoretically render a small thumbnail image
           (or full-resolution image, but that would be wasteful) showing the
           user what they're missing.  If the browser doesn't support
           <CODE>canvas</CODE>, the user is warned about possibly needing to
           open the document in a newer browser.

       In the versions of these functions where <CODE>insets</CODE> is
       specified, the value of that argument indicates how wide a border
       should be left when drawing.  When specifying <CODE>1</CODE> (indicating
       100%) to the <CODE>insets</CODE> argument, the drawn image occupies
       100% of the width and height, with no border.  By default, only 95%
       (0.95) of the width or height is used, leaving a small 5% border around
       the drawn graphics.  Specifying the insets is important when rendering
       image files out at their original size.  See the <A

   Bitmap images can be loaded and drawn to a graphics object, displayed in
   their own window, resized, printed (including tiled across several pages,)
   drawn over, saved out to files, etc.  You can also load an image or create
   it in memory, and read or write the values of individual pixels, allowing
   image processing or analysis.

  <P>
   <EM>Note that Java 1.1 and earlier did not have a portable, public way to
     read and write individial pixels of images, so many of these methods
     require Java 1.2 or later.</EM>
  </P>

  <P>
   To load an image, call <CODE>new image[<I>URL</I>]</CODE>, passing it a
   URL.  The URL can be of any type your Java platform understands, including a
   <CODE>file:</CODE> URL indicating a file on your local system:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">

    img1 = new image["http://futureboy.us/images/futureboydomethumb4.gif"]<BR>
    img2 = new image["file:yourfile.gif"]

  </P>
  
  <P>
   An image can also be loaded from a Java object that contains an
   already-opened <CODE>java.io.InputStream</CODE>: <CODE>new
   image[<I>java.io.InputStream</I>]</CODE>.  This allows you to create images
   from open files, URLs, network sources, servlet containers, in-memory
   sources, etc., without writing their data to temporary files.

  <P>
    To create a new (blank) image, specify the width and height in pixels:

  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    img4 = new image[img3]

  <P>
   This will make a copy of all of the pixels in the image, so the copy can be

   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Where <CODE>width</CODE> and <CODE>height</CODE> are dimensionless
   integers.  This gives you a readable/writable bitmap which allows you to
   read and write the individual pixels of the graphic.  For example, to
   create a graphic and then render it to a bitmapped image in memory, you may
   do something like:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    g = new graphics<BR>
    g.line[0,0,1,1]<BR>
    img4 = new image[g, 300, 300]
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Note that there are already methods to write graphics to a bitmapped file
   format.  Using this constructor is only necessary if you want to read or
   write specific pixels of the rendered graphic <EM>directly in memory</EM>.

   One of the main design goals of Frink was to allow new sources of data to

   in the <A HREF="/frinkdata/units.txt">data file</A>.  The three data
   sources listed below retrieve data on demand from up-to-the minute data on
   the Internet (and thus require connection to the Internet.)

   The units "dollar" or "USD" indicate the value of a <EM>current</EM>
   U.S. dollar (which is arbitrarily chosen as the standard unit of currency.)
   Historical price data is available to allow comparisons between the
   historical "buying power" of U.S. currency.  This allows you to adjust
   historical prices for inflation.  These are represented by specially-named
   units containing both the currency and the year, separated by an
   underscore, for example:

   Data after 1913 is fetched live from the U.S. Department of Labor <A

   Consumer Price Index data, specifially by retrieving and parsing <A
    HREF="http://stats.bls.gov/cpi/cpifiles/cpiai.txt">this
    file</A>.  If that file is unavailable, the data will be fetched from a
   static file distributed with Frink, which is only as recent as your version
   of Frink.
  </P>

  <P>
   Data from 1700 to 1912 is based on some general economists' guesses and
   should be taken with a grain of salt.  U.S. data before 1700 is not
   available, and probably wouldn't be meaningful unless you could convert
   between the value of pelts, tinder, and tallow.

  <P>
   <B>Warning:</B> The BLS web and FTP servers seem to have frequent
   outages, and historical data will not be available if the servers are down,
   or if you are not connected to the Internet.  Frink contains an internal
   cache of the CPI data in this case.
  </P>

  <P>
   From 1913-present, you can even use monthly resolution by indicating the
   month after the year.  Months are 2 digits and padded with zeros:

   Historical price data is available to allow comparisons between

  <P>
   Frink has the magical ability to perform rigorous interval arithmetic
   throughout calculations.  So what is interval arithmetic?  Well, you can
   think of it as a "new kind of number" that represents a fuzzy range of
   values.  For example, you may know that a value lies between 1 and 2, but
   you're not quite sure where the value lies in that interval.  Depending on
   your philosophy, you can think of an interval as specifying a fuzzy error
   bound, or you can think of an interval as simultaneously taking on all
   values within its bounds.
  </P>

  <P>
   Frink can take this uncertain interval and propagate the uncertainty
   through its calculations, giving you the ability to see how the initial
   uncertainties in your values affect your final calculations.
  </P>

  <P>
   Currently, the way to indicate that something is an interval is to use the
   <CODE>new interval</CODE> syntax (although something more concise will
   likely be added later, and the output format may change.)
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    a = new interval[2,3]<BR>
    b = new interval[5,7]
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   The intervals can then be manipulated in mathematical expressions, either
   with ordinary scalar variables or other intervals:
  </P>
  
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">a * 3</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">[6, 9]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">a + b</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">[7, 10]</CODE><BR>
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">a * b</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">[10, 21]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Intervals may also have a "middle" or "main" value which indicates the
   best-known value.  Note that values should be specified in increasing
   order.
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    d = new interval[2, 2.5, 3]<BR>
    e = new interval[7, 8.2, 9.4]<BR>
    d * e<BR>
   </CODE>
   <CODE CLASS="output">[14, 20.5, 28.2]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Of course, all intervals used in a calculation must have "main" values or
   the main value will be dropped, creating an interval with only upper and
   lower bounds.
  </P>

  <P>
   Note:  The boundaries and "main" values for intervals must be real
   numbers.  (These numbers can also have dimensions like feet, meters, etc.)
   Although there is a theory of complex intervals, it's much harder and may
   not get implemented any time soon.  (If you want to speed the process, <A
    HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/3527401342" TARGET="_blank">the most expensive book in the world</A> is on <A
    HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/wishlist/1HBWTNB5L6H3J/ref=wl_em_to?add-fav=1" TARGET="_blank">my Amazon.com wishlist</A>, if you want to buy it for me.)
  </P>

  <P>
   Lest you think that intervals are simpler than they are, I find that people
   better understand them when they consider the following case:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    x = new interval[-2,2]
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Now, let's square x.  Note that the values at each endpoint are equal to 4.
   However, over the range [-2,2], the value of x<SUP>2</SUP> ranges from 4,
   down to 0 (at x=0), and back up to 4.  Frink does the right thing for the
   values over this whole range:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">x^2</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">[0, 4]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Yeah, that <EM>is</EM> cool.  Frink tracks appropriate boundaries for
   intervals throughout all of your calculations.
  </P>

  <P>
   Frink's interval arithmetic is also rigorous in its treatment of error
   bounds.  It painstakingly controls the rounding direction of arithmetic
   operations so that the boundaries are guaranteed to include the
   next-largest or next-smallest representable floating-point number that
   contains the interval.  (See notes below on <A
    HREF="#IntervalArithmeticStatus">implementation status</A>.)  This
   is subtle, but I have spent a lot of work ensuring that the boundaries came
   out trustable, and no bigger than need be. For example:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">m = new interval[3,6]<BR>
    1.0/m</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">[0.16666666666666666666, 0.33333333333333333334]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Note that the bottom bound is rounded down, and the top bound is rounded
   up.
  </P>
  
  <P>
   Currently, almost all functions have been made interval-aware.
   Implementing all functions <EM>to arbitrary precision</EM> will take quite
   a bit of effort.  Of course, that would be much slower, too.  Error bounds
   are unfortunately not "sharp" for all operations (meaning as tight as they
   could possibly be with limited precision.)  I've noted them as such in the
   <A HREF="#IntervalArithmeticStatus">Interval Arithmetic Status</A> section
   below.
  </P>

  <P>
   Not all operators such as <CODE>&lt; &gt; =</CODE> make unambiguous sense
   when applied to intervals, so Frink has introduced new operators to
   disambiguate these cases, and will implement other operators to work with
   intervals.  See the <A HREF="#IntervalComparisonOperators">Interval
    Comparison Operators</A> section below for more details.
  </P>

  <P>
   By default, degenerate intervals which have the same upper and lower bounds
   are "collapsed" into a single real number.  If you want to maintain them as
   intervals, call the function <CODE>collapseIntervals[false]</CODE> before
   constructing or performing mathematics on those intervals.
  </P>

  <P>
   As everyone uses Interval Arithmetic for the first time, they come upon two
   characteristic problems in the field:  the dependence problem and the
   overestimation problem.  These are common to all interval analysis, and not
   just to Frink, and are covered in extensive detail in the <A
    HREF="faq.html#IntervalArithmetic">Interval Arithmetic section of the
    Frink FAQ.</A>
  </P>

  <P>

   website. (Link opens in new window.)

  <H3><A NAME="IntervalArithmeticExample">Interval Arithmetic Example</A></H3>
  <P>
   Interval arithmetic is an incredibly powerful feature that allows programs
   that weren't necessarily written with intervals in mind to track error
   bounds throughout your calculations, and can be magically applied to
   programs that are already written.  For example, let's take some
   calculations to find the volume and density of a sphere:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    circumference = eval[input["Enter circumference of a sphere: "]]<BR>
    mass = eval[input["Enter the mass of the sphere: "]]<BR>
    diameter = circumference / pi<BR>
    radius = diameter / 2<BR>
    volume = 4/3 pi radius^3<BR>
    density = mass / volume<BR>
    println["The density is: " + (density -&gt; "g/cm^3")]
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Now, you can run the program and enter something like "9.1 inches" for the
   circumference and "5.1 ounces" for the mass and find out the density of your
   baseball.  No surprises there.  But when you read the rules of Major League
   Baseball, you'll find that section 1.09 states:
  </P>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P>
    "The ball shall be a sphere formed by yarn wound around a small core of
    cork, rubber or similar material, covered with two stripes of white
    horsehide or cowhide, tightly stitched together. It shall weigh not less
    than five nor more than 5 1/4 ounces avoirdupois and measure not less than
    nine nor more than 9 1/4 inches in circumference."
   </P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P>
   So, using your exact same program above, and a little interval input,
   Frink can calculate the effects of these allowed variations and show you
   the allowed range of densities of <EM>any</EM> legal baseball:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="output">Enter circumference of a sphere:</CODE>
   <CODE CLASS="input">new interval[9, 9+1/4] inches</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">Enter the mass of the sphere:</CODE>
   <CODE CLASS="input">new interval[5, 5+1/4] ounces</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">The density is: [0.64720283343427980773,
    0.73778085086685322066] g/cm^3</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   The output indicates the range of uncertainties.  Note that two different
   intervals were used to perform this calculation, and the effects of their
   uncertainties was automatically tracked throughout all calculations.  All
   this in a program that wasn't even written with intervals in mind.
   Unscrupulous teams may also not that the official definition allows for a
   <EM>large</EM> variation in allowable densities of baseballs, which could
   be manipulated to your advantage.
  </P>

  <P>
   Also note that I put the units of measure (e.g. inches, ounces) outside the
   brackets.  You could put them inside the brackets, but you'd just have to
   write them twice in this case.  Intervals can, of course, contain units of
   measure.
  </P>

  <P>
   By the way, I'm working on a more concise notation for specifying
   intervals.
  </P>

  <H3><A NAME="IntervalComparisonOperators">Interval Comparison
    Operators</A></H3>
  <P>
   The relational operators (e.g. <CODE>&lt; == &gt;</CODE>, etc) work with
   intervals, but there are many ambiguous cases.  These operators try to Do
   The Right Thing when applied to intervals.  If you compare intervals that
   do not overlap, they return the appropriate result.  If, however, the
   intervals <EM>do</EM> overlap, they terminate the program with an error
   similar to the following:

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P>
    Comparison expression: Using operator &gt; to compare intervals [1, 3]
    and [2, 4]<BR>
    This operator is only defined if there is no overlap between intervals.<BR>
    Please modify your program to use interval-aware comparison operators.
   </P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P>
   To handle the overlapping cases, Frink defines operators like "certainly
   less than" (<CODE>CLT</CODE>) and "possibly less than" (<CODE>PLT</CODE>).
   These operators can directly replace the normal relational operators.
   These new operators also work with normal real numbers, so you can still
   write programs that run using either intervals or real numbers as input.
  </P>

   and functions.  If a function does not appear on this list, it may still
   return values for interval arguments, but you shouldn't trust it because I
   haven't evaluated it for discontinuities or non-monotonicity yet.

   (e.g. <CODE>"java.util.Hashtable"</CODE>) or a primitive type name,
   (e.g. <CODE>"int"</CODE> or <CODE>"double"</CODE>).  Elements of Java
   arrays are addressed the same way as other <A HREF="#Arrays">arrays</A>.
  </P>

  <P>
   Multi-dimensional arrays of Java objects can be created by the same
   function, but with an array of integers specifying the size of each
   dimension.  For example, the following creates a two-dimensional array of
   <CODE>double</CODE> with dimensions 3 by 4:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    d = newJavaArray["double", [3,4]]<BR>
    d@0@0 = 3.14
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   The methods on a Java object can be listed using the
   <CODE>methods[<I>obj</I>]</CODE> function:
  </P>
  
  <P CLASS="code">

  <H3><A NAME="CallingStaticJavaMethods">Calling Static Java Methods</A></H3>
  <P>
   If you don't have an instance of the class, you can call static methods in
   Java classes using the <CODE>callJava[classname, methodname, argList]</CODE>
   function.  The following uses the <CODE>java.lang.Math</CODE> class to
   generate a random number.
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">n = callJava["java.lang.Math", "random", [] ]</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">0.38102192379837</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   If the method requires no arguments, as in the above example, the last
   argument can be eliminated:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">n = callJava["java.lang.Math", "random"]</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">0.314291983004521</CODE>
  </P>
  
  <P>
   Lame example, huh?  Especially when Frink can already generate random
   numbers.  The same syntax can be used to get a database driver, or
   something more interesting.
  </P>

  <H3><A NAME="AccessingStaticJavaFields">Accessing Static Java Fields</A></H3>
  <P>
   You can access static variables in a class without having an instance of
   the class by calling the <CODE>staticJava[classname, fieldname]</CODE>
   function.
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">green = staticJava["java.awt.Color", "GREEN"]</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">JavaObject:java.awt.Color</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   You can then call methods on that object:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">green.getRed[]</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">0</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   As of the 2014-04-21 release, Frink turns values returned from
   <CODE>staticJava</CODE> into their corresponding Frink types.  If you need
   the original, raw Java object (say, for code that checks object identity,)
   then you can call the three-argument version of the function, passing
   <CODE>false</CODE> as the third argument (this indicates that the value
   should <EM>not</EM> be mapped to a Frink type):
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">staticJava["javax.swing.SwingConstants", "LEFT"]</CODE><BR>

  </P>
  
  <H3><A NAME="CallingFunctionsAndMethodsByName">Calling Functions and Methods by Name</A></H3>
  <P>
   Sometimes you may have to call functions or methods by name.  For example,
   calling a method called <CODE><I>object</I>.next[]</CODE> on a Java object
   is impossible in Frink because <CODE>next</CODE> is a reserved word and
   produces a syntax error!  To get around this, use the
   <CODE>callByName[<I>object</I>, <I>methodName</I>, <I>argList</I>]</CODE>
   function.
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">callByName[iterator, "next", [] ]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   If the first argument (normally an object) is <CODE>undef</CODE>, then the
   function with the specified name will be called.
  </P>

  <P>
   If the argument list is empty, as above, you can eliminate it entirely:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">callByName[iterator, "next"]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   If the argument list is a single element, you don't have to pass it as a
   list: 
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">callByName[undef, "println", "yo"]</CODE>
  </P>
  
  <P>
   Similarly, you can get a reference to a function by calling
   <CODE>getFunction[<I>name</I>, <I>numArgs</I>]</CODE> which returns a
   reference to the function with the specified name (specified as a string)
   and number of arguments.  This can then be assigned to variables, or called
   as noted in the <A HREF="#AnonymousFunctions">Anonymous Functions</A>
   section of the documentation.
  </P>
  
  <H3><A NAME="IteratingOverJavaCollections">Iterating Over Java Collections</A></H3>
  <P>
   The <CODE>for</CODE> loop can be used to iterate over the contents of most
   Java collections, including <CODE>array</CODE>, <CODE>Vector</CODE>,
   <CODE>Enumeration</CODE>, <CODE>Iterator</CODE>, <CODE>Collection</CODE>,
   <CODE>Map</CODE>, (which includes <CODE>Hashtable</CODE>,
   <CODE>HashMap</CODE>, <CODE>Properties</CODE> etc.), <CODE>Iterable</CODE>
   (which includes almost <EM>all</EM> <CODE>Collection</CODE> types in Java,
   and anything that can be used in Java's <CODE>foreach</CODE> statement)
   <I>etc.</I>
  </P>

  <P>
   For most Java collections, you can iterate through the contents using a
   <CODE>for</CODE> loop (which is really just a "for each" loop.)
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    for a = <I>javaObject</I><BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[a]<BR>
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   If the Java class implements the <CODE>java.util.Map</CODE> interface (this
   includes classes like <CODE>HashMap</CODE>, <CODE>Hashtable</CODE>,
   <CODE>Properties</CODE>, etc), it can be treated like a Frink <A
   HREF="#Dictionaries">dictionary</A>.  This includes enumerating over
   <CODE>[key,&nbsp;value]</CODE> pairs:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">
    for [key,value] = <I>javaObject</I><BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println["$key maps to $value"]<BR>
   </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   All of these Java collections can be treated as enumerating expressions in
   Frink, so all of the functions and methods that can operate on enumerating
   expressions can operate on Java collections.  For example, Java collections
   can be converted to other types using functions like
   <CODE>toArray</CODE>, <CODE>toSet</CODE>, <CODE>toDict</CODE>, or
   manipulated with functions like <CODE>join</CODE>, etc.
  </P>
  
  <H2><A NAME="EmbeddingFrink">Embedding Frink</A></H2>
  <P>
   Not only can you call Java from Frink, but you can call Frink from Java.
   It's quite easy to embed a Frink parser into any Java program and give
   those programs all of the power of Frink.  It can take just a few lines of
   Java:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE class="input">//At the top of your file...<BR>

  </P>

  <P>
   <B>Warning</B>: Frink is a Turing-complete programming language, and
   <CODE>parseString()</CODE> evaluates a string as a complete program.  A
   Frink interpreter normally has the ability to read your filesystem, call
   arbitrary Java code, execute infinite loops, allocate infinite amounts of
   memory, write large amounts of output, and do other things which may
   compromise your security.  Thus, if you're taking input from
   untrusted users, it's critical to call:

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE><I>interp</I>.setRestrictiveSecurity(true);</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   before parsing any user input.  This will enable the highest
   level of security, prohibiting all untrusted actions.
  </P>
  
  <P>
   There are more methods for calling Frink from within a Java program.  One
   of the major problems is that converting from Frink types to Java types is
   almost always a narrowing operation.
  </P>

  <P>
   For example, if you try to put a Frink value into a Java integer:
  </P>

  <UL>
   <LI>It could be too large.

   <LI>It could be a non-integer (rational number, floating point).

   <LI>It could be complex.
    
   <LI>It may have wrong unit types.

   <LI>It could be something else like a String or an Object.
  </UL>

  <P>
   As a result, all of these interface methods throw a variety of exceptions.

  <P>
   Let's say you wanted to fill your bedroom up with water.  How much water
   would it take?  Let's say your room measures 10 feet by 12 feet wide by
   8 feet high.
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">10 feet 12 feet 8 feet -> gallons</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">552960/77 (approx. 7181.298701298701)</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   It would take approximately 7181 gallons to fill it.  Note that you get
   both an exact fraction and an approximation.  (If you don't want to see the
   fraction, put a decimal point in any of the numbers, like 10. or 10.0.)
   How much would that weigh, if you filled it with water?  Frink has the unit
   "water" which stands for the density of water.
  </P>
  
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">10. feet 12 feet 8 feet water -> pounds</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">59930.84215309883</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   So it would weigh almost 60,000 pounds.  What if you knew that your floor
   could only support 2 tons?  How deep could you fill the room with water?
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">2. tons / (10 feet 12 feet water) -> feet</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">0.5339487791320047</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   So you could only fill it about 0.53 feet deep.  It'll be a pretty sad pool
   party.

  <H3><A NAME="Liquor">Liquor</A></H3>
  <P>
   You can set variables on the fly, by using the assignment
   <CODE>=</CODE> operator.  Let's say you want to define a new unit
   representing the amount of alcohol in a can of (quality) 3.2 beer.  Keep in
   mind that 3.2 beer is measured by alcohol/weight, while almost all other
   liquors (and many beers) are usually measured in alcohol/volume.  The
   density ratio between water and alcohol is given by:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">water/alcohol</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">1.267</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Water is thus 1.267 times denser than alcohol.  3.2 beer (measured by
   weight) is thus actually 4.0 percent alcohol as measured by volume.  Now
   let's set that variable in terms of a beer's density of alcohol per volume
   so we can compare:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">beer = 12 floz 3.2 percent water/alcohol</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Then, you wanted to find out how many beers a big bottle of champagne is
   equal to:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">magnum 13.5 percent -&gt; beer</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">14.07</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   You probably don't want to drink that whole bottle.  Now let's say you're
   mixing Jungle Juice (using a 1.75 liter bottle of Everclear (190 proof!))
   and Kool-Aid to fill a 5-gallon bucket (any resemblance to my college
   parties is completely intentional.)  What percent alcohol is that stuff?

  </P>

  <P>
   It's really not <EM>that</EM> strong.  About 8.8%.  But if you drink 5 cups

   What is the price in dollars per fluid ounce of alcohol when buying a keg of

   In the movie <I>Independence Day</I>, the alien mother ship is said to be
   500 km in diameter and have a mass 1/4 that of earth's moon.  If the mother
   ship were a sphere, what would its density be?  (The volume of a sphere is
   4/3 pi radius<SUP>3</SUP>)
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">

   <CODE CLASS="output">280.68</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   This makes the ship <EM>280 times</EM> denser than water.  This is 36 times
   denser than iron and more than 12 times denser than any known element!  As
   the ship is actually more a thin disc than a sphere, it would actually be
   even denser.  Since it contains lots of empty space, parts of it would have
   to be much, much denser.
  </P>

  <P>
   If the object is this dense and has such a large mass, what is its surface
   gravity?  Surface gravity is given by G mass / radius<SUP>2</SUP>, where G
   is the gravitational constant (which Frink knows about):

   <CODE CLASS="output">2.000079</CODE>

  <P>
   The surface gravity of the spaceship is thus at least <EM>twice</EM>
   earth's gravity--and that's on the rim where gravity is weakest.  It
   would actually be much higher since it's much, much flatter than a sphere.

   Say, you eat 2000 Calories a day (again, food Calories with a capital "C"
   are equal to 1000 calories with a little "c".)

  <P>
   So, your average power and/or heat output is slightly less than a 100-watt
   bulb.  (Note that your heat is radiated over a much larger area so the
   temperature is much lower.)  Many days I could be replaced entirely with a
   100-watt bulb and have no discernible effect on the universe.

   I'm heating up yummy mustard greens in my microwave, but I don't want to
   overheat them.  I just want to warm them up.  If I run my 1100 watt
   microwave for 30 seconds, how much will their temperature increase?  I have
   a big 27 ounce (mass) can, and I'll assume that their specific heat is about
   the same as that of water (1 calorie/gram/degC):

   30 seconds should raise the temperature by no more than 18 degrees
   Fahrenheit, assuming perfect transfer of microwave energy to heat.
  </P>

  <P>
   Knowing this, I could see how efficiently my microwave <EM>actually</EM>
   heats food.  I could heat a quantity of water and measure the temperature

  <H3><A NAME="Superman">Why is Superman so Lazy?</A></H3>
  <P>
   Superman is always rescuing school buses that are falling off of cliffs,
   flying to the moon, lifting cars over his head, and generally showing off.
   So why does he still allow so many accidents to happen?  Shouldn't he be
   able to rescue <EM>everybody</EM> who has a Volkswagen parked on their
   chest?
  </P>

  <P>
   While searching for answers, I found out three interesting things about
   Superman:
  </P>

  <OL>
   <LI>He's 6 feet 3 inches tall.
   <LI>He weighs 225 pounds.
   <LI>He gets his strength from being charged up with solar energy.
  </OL>

  <P>
   This is enough information to find some answers.  Frink has units called
   <CODE>sunpower</CODE> (the total power radiated by the sun) and
   <CODE>sundist</CODE> (the distance between the earth and the sun.)  Thus,
   we can find the sun's power that strikes an area at the distance of the
   earth (knowing the surface area of a sphere is 4 pi radius<SUP>2</SUP>):
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">earthpower = sunpower / (4 pi sundist^2)</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   This is about 1372 watts per square meter.  Superman is a pretty big
   guy--let's say the surface area he can present to the sun is 12 square
   feet.  (This is probably a bit high--it makes him an average of 23 inches
   wide over his entire height.)  This allows Superman to charge up at a power
   of:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">chargerate = earthpower 12 ft^2</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="input">chargerate -&gt; watts</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">1530.1602</CODE><BR>
  </P>

  <P>
   Superman thus charges up at the rate of 1530 joules/sec or 1530 watts.  At
   this rate, how long does he have to charge up before he can lift a 2 ton
   truck over his head?  (Knowing energy = mass * height * gravity)
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">2 ton 7 feet gravity / chargerate -&gt; sec</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">24.80975</CODE><BR>
  </P>

  <P>
   So, charging up for 25 seconds allows him to save one dumb kid who is acting
   as a speed bump.  So his power is huge but not infinite.  He couldn't
   sustain a higher rate (unless he showed off less by lifting the car only a
   foot or two.)  Lifting a truck every 30 seconds or so isn't bad,
   though.  He could be saving a lot more people.  So why doesn't he?
  </P>

  <P>
   Well, we've all seen the movie.  He's using his super-powers to pick up
   chicks.  Literally.  Superman decides to take a break from saving lives and
   takes Lois Lane up in the sky for a joyride.  So how long does he have to
   charge up with solar energy to fly himself and Lois Lane (let's say she
   weighs 135 pounds) up to 15,000 feet?
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">(225 + 135) pounds 15000 feet gravity / chargerate -&gt; minutes</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">59.809235</CODE><BR>
  </P>

  <P>
   So, Superman has to charge up with solar energy for an <EM>hour</EM> to
   cart Lois up there.  With the same energy, he could have saved over 120
   trapped kids.  Keep in mind that Lois could do her part, too.  If she left
   her camera or big clunky shoes behind, he'd have more energy left over
   to save people.  If she would manage to leave behind just two pounds of
   cargo weight, Superman would have enough energy to save another kid's life.
  </P>

  <P>
   Sure, he's a great guy, and, sure, he's the Defender of Truth, Justice, and
   the American Way, but can't he find a better use for his super-powers than
   schlepping some shiksa into the stratosphere?  Shovel my walk, he could, in
   3 seconds--and me with the sciatica.

   I received one of those endlessly-forwarded e-mails of dubious but

   months, you'll have enough gas to create the equivalent of an atomic bomb."
   Hee hee.  Cute.  (Thanks to Heather May Howard... being unable to easily
   calculate the veracity of this statement was one of the primary influences
   that showed how existing programs were too limited and inspired the
   creation of Frink.)  But I didn't believe it and wanted to check it.  The
   Hiroshima bomb had a yield of 12.5 kilotons of TNT, which is a very small
   bomb by today's standards.  How many horsepower would that be?

   That's the power produced by a Corvette engine running just at its melting

   17,000 years is still a huge underestimate; I don't know how much of your

  <H3><A NAME="AdvancedFarting">Advanced Farting</A></H3>
  <P>
   The above order-of-magnitude estimate shows how far off the mark that the
   fart e-mail was.  Not content with that, I found some medical studies that
   allowed me to do a more detailed analysis of the average person's available
   fart energy.
  </P>

  <P>
   What do you think are the most flammable gases in a fart?  Most people
   think it's methane, but I found some medical studies that disprove this.
   Most people hardly have <EM>any</EM> methane in their intestines.  For
   example, one study stated that only 4 out of 11 people had any detectable
   methane in their intestines!  So what's the rest of the gas?
  </P>

  <TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=5 SUMMARY="Gases Present in Human Intestines by Volume">
    <TR><TH>Gas<TH>Percent by Volume
    <TR><TD>Nitrogen<TD>64%
    <TR><TD>Carbon Dioxide<TD>14%
    <TR><TD>Hydrogen<TD>19%
    <TR><TD>Methane<TD>3.2%
    <TR><TD>Oxygen<TD>0.7%
  </TABLE>

  <P>
   These studies also note that the average person has 100 milliliters of gas
   is present in their intestinal tract at any given time.  The average person
   expels 400-2000 ml of gas daily (and I'm not talking about through the
   mouth and nose.)
  </P>

  <P>
   Okay, that's almost enough information to figure out available fart energy.
   Now all we need to know is the energy of combustion of the flammable gases.
   Of the above, only hydrogen and methane are readily combustible.  Looking
   up their energies of combustion:
  </P>
  
  <TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=5 SUMMARY="Combustion energy of gases in human intestine">
    <TR><TH>Gas<TH>Energy of Combustion in kJ/mol
    <TR><TD>Hydrogen (H<SUB>2</SUB>)<TD>285.8
    <TR><TD>Methane (CH<SUB>4</SUB>)<TD>890.8
  </TABLE>

  <P>
   Okay, that's plenty enough information to find out how much energy is
   released in a day of farting!  Say you're on the farty end of the scale,
   and you produce the 2000 ml of gas each day.
  </P>

  <P>
   Note that the energies above are given in kJ/mol, but we have volumes in
   milliliters.  As you may have learned in chemistry class, a mole of any gas
   at standard temperature and pressure takes up the same volume.  Frink knows
   this as <CODE>molarvolume</CODE>.
  </P>

  <P>
   The total energy in the hydrogen (keeping in mind that hydrogen makes up
   19% of the 2000 ml volume) is given by:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">h2energy = 2000 ml / molarvolume mol * 19 percent * 285.8 kJ/mol</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">4845.3656205695224816 m^2 s^-2 kg (energy)</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   The combustible hydrogen thus produces 4800 joules (per day.)  Now, for the
   methane, which makes a smaller percentage, but releases more energy per
   mole:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">methaneenergy = 2000 ml / molarvolume mol * 3.2 percent * 890.8 kJ/mol</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">2543.5537223989278488 m^2 s^-2 kg (energy)</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   The energy in the combustible methane is thus about 2500 joules (per day),
   about half the energy produced from the hydrogen.  Thus, the grand total of
   energy produced by combustible farts by a farty person in a day, in food
   Calories (with a capital C, remember--these are what a physicist would call
   a kilocalorie) is:
  </P>
  
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">methaneenergy + h2energy -&gt; Calories</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Which gives a result of about 1.76 Calories/day of energy available from
   burning your farts.  (About 1.16 Calories from hydrogen, and about 0.60
   Calories from methane.)  This is out of the 2000 Calories that an average
   person eats a day.  Or, one part in about 1133 of the energy in the food
   you eat is available in fart energy, (again, for a gassy person.)
  </P>

  <P>
   Thus, a good estimate to the problem stated above is that a real (gassy)
   human would need to save their farts for:

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">12.5 kilotons TNT / ((methaneenergy + h2energy) / day)

   <CODE CLASS="output">1.9379377133697419931e+7</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   or about <EM>19 million years</EM> to make the equivalent of the energy in
   a (small) atomic bomb!  So the estimate given in that e-mail is off by a
   factor of at least 2.8 million!

   The November 2001 edition of <I>Sky &amp; Telescope</I> magazine has a
   charming article called "Stellar Guides for Your Birthday" by Jeff
   A. Farinacci (p. 63), which provides a list of "nearby" stars and their
   distances in light-years or light-days.  This allows you to look at the
   light coming from a star that was emitted the day you were born.  It

   BASIC program, <CODE>daysold.bas</CODE></A> to calculate how many days old
   you are on a certain date. 
   As you know by now, the essential calculation can be done in one line of
   Frink.  For example, the bright star Pollux is about 33.7 light-years away
   (12314 days, based on the Hipparcos satellite's parallax measurement of
   96.74 milliarcseconds) and the light it emitted on the day I was born will

   This gives the same date as the calculation above (May 7, 2003.)  I was
   amazed to find that the universe has conspired to produce a beautiful
   conjunction on this date.  Pollux will form a straight line with the moon
   and Jupiter in the western sky on that night:

   Below is a 45-degree chunk of sky looking due west.  This will give you a

   Pollux and Castor quite clearly.  Castor is the bright star directly
   to the right of Pollux.  Castor and Pollux will appear to make a horizontal
   line at this time.

   It shouldn't be hard to find.  Look west.  The moon will be the brightest
   object in the sky, and Jupiter will be the second-brightest.  Follow the
   line from Jupiter to the moon.  Pollux is by far the brightest star along
   that line (it has a dimmer twin Castor, which will be on the right.)  The
   moon is in the center and Jupiter and Pollux are equal distances on either
   side of the moon.  Follow the wise men.  Bring gold.  I already have lots

   <B>Alan's Editorializing</B>: This article also underlines one of the
   things I am growing to miss in most physical equations and all programs
   written in other languages... the loss of units.  Everything is an
   unexplained number, and inscrutable conversion factors are strewn liberally
   throughout.  This is exactly the type of thing that Frink was designed to
   address.  For example, a line in the article indicates:
  </P>

  <P>
   <I>The parallax-to-distance formula is simple: d=1/p, where p is the
    parallax angle in arcseconds and d is the distance in parsecs (3.26
    light-years).</I>
  </P>

  <P>
   This description is unfortunate.  1 divided by an angle (which is
   dimensionless) is still dimensionless, <EM>not</EM> a distance.  This is
   better specified by saying that the formula is distance=(orbital
   radius)/(parallax angle).  Since the parallax angles are specified with
   respect to Earth's orbital radius, you can write the equation as
   <CODE><I>d</I> = au/<I>p</I></CODE>. "<CODE>au</CODE>" is an astronomical
   unit, the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, which is included
   in Frink's standard data file.  Then, p can be specified in <EM>any</EM>
   angular units and distance can be automatically converted to light-years or
   light-days instead of parsecs (or into feet, if you want).  As always,
   <EM>Frink makes the units of measurement transparent, and helps to ensure
   that your calculations make sense.</EM> So, using the <A
   HREF="http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=HIPPARCOS">Hipparcos</A>
   satellite's measurements for the parallax of the closest star, Proxima
   Centauri (okay, second-closest, smartypants):

  </P>

  <P>
   This way, we learn something about the <EM>nature</EM> of the physical
   calculation which we can generalize, rather than having an equation that
   only works with one weird system of measurement.  (Although professional
   astronomers like to use parsecs, I think it's a horrible, intentionally
   exclusive, geocentric measurement and they're just being difficult.  There
   was even an article in <I>Sky &amp; Telescope</I> a while back which
   intimated that some astronomers would sneer and giggle at you if you used
   light-years in a professional publication or speech.)  Using our deeper
   knowledge, we can see how much more accurate the Hipparcos satellite would
   be if it were put into Jupiter's orbit, or how accurate its instruments
   need to be to achieve a certain accuracy in distance measurements.  We've
   learned something more general.

  <H4>Finding Your Own Star</H4>
  <P>
   Now you want your own star, don't you?  You might take a look at a list of
   <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brightest_stars">the
    brightest stars in the sky</A>
   and look the stars' distances in light-years.  This will give you an idea
   of the bright stars, and give you their Hipparcos catalog numbers.  Using
   the Hipparcos catalog number given in that table, you can look up that star
   from 
   <A HREF="http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=HIPPARCOS&amp;page=multisearch2">this
    Hipparcos search form,</A> find its Geometrical Parallax (field H11, which
   is probably given in milliarcseconds) and plug that number into the
   equation shown above.  At some point, I may make a Frink Server Page that
   automates this.  But you might learn more just by doing the calculations
   yourself.
  </P>

  <P>
   Whether you have a kid who is 8.6 years old (for Sirius which is the
   brightest star in the sky and 3141 light-days away,) someone turning 11.4
   (Procyon), turning 16.8 (Altair) or someone turning 65.1 (Aldebaran,) a
   star is a great gift and  might just start a love of astronomy.  I can't
   promise that the moon and the planets will line up for <EM>them</EM>,
   though.
  </P>

  <P>
   Note that there is some uncertainty in measuring parallaxes, often several
   percent, and thus the dates are somewhat uncertain, so it's a gift you can
   give <EM>any</EM> time around the date.  For example, the standard error
   for the parallax of Pollux is 0.87 milliarcseconds (parallax error is field
   H16 in the Hipparcos catalog, specified in milliarcseconds) which leads to
   an actual date that can vary from around January 17, 2003 to August 27,
   2003 -- a range of over 7 months.  Just have fun and celebrate your stars
   when you want!

   This one is fun.  I didn't have a grasp of the size difference between the
   Earth and the Moon so I wanted to make a little scale model in my home.  It
   would be best to use spheres of the appropriate sizes, but I don't have
   that many balls.  Instead, I decided to cut circles out of paper.  My
   deciding dimension was the size of the piece of paper I used to cut out the
   pieces.  I could only get a 7-inch diameter circle for the Earth (3.5-inch
   radius), so this defined my scale, which I saved in a variable for use in
   later calculations:

   The standard data file contains information about the dimensions of the

   the Moon circle be?

   Okay, using my rolling ruler, I cut out a circle with radius 0.95 inches
   (diameter 1.9 inches).  There's the Moon.  It's interesting to see the
   difference in size between the Earth and Moon:

  <P>
   Now, to place them properly... how far away should they be at that scale?
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">moondist / scale -&gt; feet</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">17.59705489913335 </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Okay, stick the Earth to one wall, and then measure a distance 17.5 feet
   away, and stick the Moon to that.  <EM>Installed!</EM>
  </P>

  <P>
   From each vantage point, you can see how big the other actually looks from
   that distance.  Standing by the Earth, you can see how big the Moon looks
   (you've seen the Moon, but it's a smaller angle than you might guess... the
   Moon really doesn't take up much sky, only about half a degree in
   diameter.)  You can verify this by holding a fingernail out at arm's
   length, comparing it to the size of your Moon model, and then going outside
   and doing the same to the Moon, if you can see it.
  </P>

  <P>
   Now walk over to the Moon and look at the Earth.  It would be pretty big!
   Earth would appear about 3.66 times wider in diameter (in Frink notation,
   <CODE>earthradius/moonradius</CODE>, or 13.4 times larger in area (
   <CODE>pi earthradius^2 / (pi moonradius^2)</CODE> ).
  </P>

  <P>
   Just to verify, I wanted to make sure that the visible angles in my model
   match real life.  The visual angle of an object which does not subtend a
   large angle can be expressed as <CODE>angle = width / distance</CODE>.  The
   angle normally comes out in radians if width and distance are in the same
   units, but this is Frink.  You can get the answer out in degrees, or
   arcminutes if that's where your heart lies:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">1.9 inches / (17.5 feet) -&gt; arcminutes</CODE><BR>
   <CODE CLASS="output">31.10342316424469 </CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Yep, that's just the right number of arcminutes.  From Earth, the Sun and
   the Moon both appear just over half a degree in diameter, or about 32
   arcminutes (an arcminute is 1/60 of a degree).  It all works out.  Note
   that in the standard data file, radians are dimensionless units (a radian
   is defined as "1".)  This is because radians are dimensionless units, but
   you can convert values in radians to other angular units.
  </P>

  <P>
   By the way, a more accurate angular formula that is valid for large
   <EM>and</EM> small angles subtended by a sphere with a given radius at a
   specified distance is:
  </P>
  
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">2 arcsin[<I>radius</I>/(<I>radius</I> + <I>distance</I>)] -&gt; degrees</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   Note that inverse trigonometric functions (<CODE>arcsin</CODE>,
   <CODE>arccos</CODE>, <CODE>arctan</CODE>) have their output in radians.
   This is easily converted to whatever angular units you want, as above.  You
   don't see that the output is in radians (if you use the standard data file)
   because radians are dimensionless numbers.  You just gotta be a bit careful
   here, or make the minor change in your units file to make radians a
   fundamental dimension.  (Read the documentation in the units file... the
   units file is otherwise radians-correct.)
  </P>
  
  <P>
   <B>Nostalgic Digression:</B> I remember a cool black-and-white movie we saw
   in my Kindergarten class about making a scale model of the solar system.
   It involved a <EM>huge</EM> vertical circular sign representing the Sun
   that somebody had built for the film and a car driving a measured distance
   away to look at it.  (A bit confusing, though.  I remember them saying
   "here we are, 93 million miles away!" and they were still in the same
   park.)  Good stuff, and I'm glad I finally made my own model.  It helps me
   understand how cool the Apollo missions were.  But my enthusiasm is
   tempered by the fact that I'm just now figuring out stuff they tried to
   teach me in Kindergarten.
  </P>

  <P>
   Now go make your own model.  Pick your own scale to fit your surroundings
   and materials.  It's fun.  In my model, Jupiter would have to
   be a sphere 6.59 feet in diameter, placed about 5.5 miles away right now.
   I'll have to get a bigger place.

    "The MCO [Mars Climate Orbiter] MIB [Mishap Investigation Board] has

   This is not to take away from the designers of a wonderfully complex
   spacecraft that can travel to Mars; that's an incredibly difficult problem,
   and I couldn't do it.  However, this is just the type of error that Frink
   was designed to help avoid, and because <EM>I</EM> make these type of
   errors a lot, I've designed this tool to help me.  Frink tracks units
   through <EM>all</EM> calculations and makes conversions between them
   transparent.  This is why I'm working toward making Frink a feasible
   solution for calculations of this type.
  </P>

  <P>
   <B>Update:</B>  I received the following from <A

  </P>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P>
    "I ran across Frink, and as a member of the MCO review board, I
    appreciate your efforts.  Note, however that more than just language
    support is necessary.  First, you'd have to have conventions on data
    I/O -- the misinterpreted data was from a file, not from another
    function in the program.  Also, there was an issue of software reuse
    -- the errant portion of the system had been used before on a previous
    mission, and in that case it was used in a non-critical,
    non-navigational way.  It was not properly reviewed because the team
    did not realize that in MCO it became critical."
   </P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P>
   The points above are well-taken.  Proper parsing of units can be easily
   achieved in Frink with a simple, appropriate comment in the data file. <A
   HREF="/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=unittable.frink">unittable.frink</A> shows
   how Frink can parse a file containing units of measure.  All that is needed
   is to add a <EM>single comment</EM> to the data file that contains the
   units of measure of each data column.  Frink then reads each column with
   the appropriate units of measure and scale, using any units of measure that
   Frink knows about as input, and Frink parses them and works with them
   properly.  See its <A HREF="unittable.txt">sample data file</A>.
  </P>

  <P>
   Frink and its <CODE>eval[x]</CODE> function could always trivially handle
   the case where each number in a file has its units of measure specified
   with the number, e.g. "<CODE>3.5 km/s</CODE>".  That's literally
   <EM>zero</EM> effort to parse with Frink, and is slightly less compact, but
   that's a very small price to pay, compared to mission failure.
  </P>

  <P>
   Of course, there's no simple solution for someone completely not reading
   the specification documents, but the fact that a file completely omits any
   units of measure would be a good warning flag to double-check your sources,
   I'm growing to fear and avoid any system that treats every physical
   measurement as an unexplained dimensionless number, as most programming
   languages have for the past few decades.  We can do better.
  </P>

  <H2><A NAME="ChangingSyntax">Changing Syntax</A></H2>
  <P>
   Keep in mind that the syntax represented in this document <EM>will</EM>
   change as Frink evolves.  The current parser just makes it easier for me to
   test certain features, and I intentionally refuse to spend a lot of time on
   it at this point.  The internals of the language should be the first
   concern, and the external representation is free to change.  Frink should
   be equally usable whether you want to load and save your data in the
   current mathematical notation, in a (LISP-like) prefix notation, in a (HP
   calculator-like) Reverse-Polish postfix notation, from a
   visually-based GUI, in MathML, TeX, XML, or whatever other
   flavor-of-the-month format the kids are crazy about these days.  The
   internals of the language are intentionally agnostic on this point, as they
   should be in a flexible design.
  </P>

  <P>
   On the other hand, I always want to keep Frink easy to use and transparent
   for the quick calculations as it is now.  Turning it into a language that
   forces an encumbering programming paradigm is out of the question.
