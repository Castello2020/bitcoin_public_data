<li>Comments not working?: NYbill wanted the comments link changed. It was.</li>
<li>A call for more shows: we ran out of shows. You responded with shows</li>
<li>2 notes on shows: Kevin O'Brien wanted to know if the NELF talks could be put out on the feed. Current policy is <em>We will continue to promote new podcasts and other creative commons

created exclusively for HPR</em></li>
<li>Please use the shownote template files: The template has been updated please use it</li>

<p>
Discussed this month was:
</p>

<h3>Backup Shows</h3>
<p>
In a discussion started by <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.network.syndication.podcast.hacker-public-radio/93">Dave Morris</a>. Some felt that the content was getting stale, and keeping shows for 2 years or even 3 months was too long. Others felt that these shows were contributed with the purpose of been used in an emergency and therefore should be timeless.<br />
Eventually it was left to each of the contributors that had shows in the backup queue to release them, or to set them as emergency shows. The website has been updated to reflect this change.<br />

 <p>Hello All,<br />
  <br /> We are roughly around 10 weeks away from the next 24-hour New Year's show. This a call out for all parties who are interested in helping with this year's show. We mainly need to make arrangements for a Mumble server and a few streaming servers. If you have any of these resources available then please send me your name, email address, available resources, and a day/time that is convenient for you to meet on-line on a Mumble server for organizational purposes.<br />
  <br /> Thank you,<br />

 <h2>TGTM as a general newscast now over</h2><pre>
Hey, Ken,

I just published TGTM news #103, which is my explanation of its
closure and next month's new format.  I now plan to do two audios a
month, one tech piece for HPR and one non-tech for my personal site.

Could you please announce this in the next HPR community news, as well
as putting this link in the show notes:

<h2>New show posting algorithm</h2>
<p>
Following a post from klaatu noting that he was waiting 42 days to get a show released, he suggest simplifying the process to a first in first out solution with some options. Ken replied that the entire scheduling should be first in first out, while giving hosts the option to pick a day in the future that was free. <br />

<pre>
I would like to suggest the following amendments to the scheduling
rules detailed below in ALL CAPS bellow:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
http://hackerpublicradio.org/calendar.php#normal_priority
We now release shows based on when the hosts last had a show aired.
This brings new hosts and returning hosts to the top of the queue to
encourage their efforts, and it also spreads out shows submitted in
batches and gives a wider variety of hosts. Once a host is determined,
the first show uploaded by that host is released. If you wish your
shows to be released in a particular order then make sure you make that
obvious in the title and by emailing admin@hackerpublicradio.org.
You can swap the order of the shows but it involves additional effort
and is frowned upon :).
WHERE POSSIBLE WE WILL NOT RELEASE SHOWS FROM THE SAME HOST IN ANY ONE
WEEK.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

http://hackerpublicradio.org/calendar.php#synicated_shows
Syndicated Shows
We will continue to promote new podcasts and other creative commons
material but due to a lack of slots, we are only releasing material
created exclusively for HPR. If there is a piece of creative commons
content that you would like to promote, then feel free to record a
regular show where you introduce the content and explain why it is
important and providing links to where we can get more information.
THESE SHOWS CAN BE RELEASED EITHER UNDER YOUR OWN NAME OR UNDER
THE GENERIC HOST CALLED "VARIOUS CREATIVE COMMONS WORKS" (HOSTID <a
href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/correspondents.php?hostid=158">158</a>)  
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The amendment "WHERE POSSIBLE WE WILL NOT RELEASE SHOWS FROM THE SAME
HOST IN ANY ONE WEEK." had been included prior to the changes in
January, but I would like to put it back.

The amendment "THESE SHOWS WILL CAN BE RELEASED EITHER UNDER YOUR
OWN NAME OR UNDER THE GENERIC HOST CALLED "VARIOUS CREATIVE COMMONS
WORKS" was discussed in the mail list under the title of "Various
Creative Commons Works" but the discussions got derailed. 

Please keep discussion to these two points only. 

As always Silence, or no comment is assumed to be approval.

Ken.

Also the addition of the following text to the Scheduling Rules: 
Please be aware that we cannot predict when your show will be out, but 
sooner of later it will be released. Sometimes a new host will jump to 
the top of the queue, while other hosts seem to be waiting a long time. 
This is because all the shows at HPR are scheduled according to the 
Scheduling Guidelines, which apply to everyone without exception.

<h2>Reminder of how HPR is governed</h2>
<p>
While Stankdwag pays for the hosting, HPR is run by the community, not the Admins! That means what the community decides is the direction we take it. 
</p>

<h2>Filtering "Clean" shows</h2>
<pre>
The necessary changes to accommodate a per show explicit field has been made. 
To get the filtered feeds, please append 'explicit=0' to the end of any of the fields. 
This will trigger the field 'rss/channel/item/itunes:explicit="Clean"'


http://hackerpublicradio.org/hpr_mp3_rss.php?explicit=0
http://hackerpublicradio.org/hpr_ogg_rss.php?explicit=0
http://hackerpublicradio.org/hpr_spx_rss.php?explicit=0
http://hackerpublicradio.org/hpr_total_rss.php?explicit=0
http://hackerpublicradio.org/hpr_total_ogg_rss.php?explicit=0
http://hackerpublicradio.org/hpr_total_spx_rss.php?explicit=0

This will leave the <itunes:explicit> on the <channel> as "Yes" but will
toggle the <item> to <itunes:explicit>clean</itunes:explicit>.
Currently the only shows flagged as 'explicit=0' are the ones from
klaatu. For those wishing to reclassify your shows please review the
attached guidelines from the FCC and follow the link to Apples website
http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/specs.html. Apple has a policy of
banning incorrectly flagged shows, so we could loose approximately 7 -
20 % of HPR listeners in one fell swoop if you classify your show
incorrectly.

Please alert me or admin@hackerpublicradio.org if anything strange
starts to happen.

Ken (as HPR Admin)
</pre>

<h2>Website Changes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Website Updates, RSS Feeds, Cal page: new list, new post script, explains how the queuing is done. Still need to update the contribute, readme and intro outro.</li>
    <li>HPR Transcode script - Help needed by one and all</li>
    <li>Cannot get the mailing list to archive</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sonar Fundraiser</h2>
<p>
The Sonar Project is to build a Linux operating system focused on accessibility. There are 1 billion people in the world with some type of disability. Jonathan Nadeau is a blind user and has already made the Sonar GNU/Linux distribution completely accessible to blind people. Now he needs our help to take it to the next level.<br />

<h2>Other News</h2>
Only about one third of the downloads are OGG so if you are freedom lover change over to the ogg feed. <br />

If anyone is going to fossdem (<a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/">https://fosdem.org/2013/</a> and would be interested in covering a booth, please get in touch with admin at hpr<br />
This also counts for other podcasters who want to share a table.
</p>
<h2>Reshaping HPR</h2>
<p>
There has been a lot of activity on the mail list this month about changes to the scheduling rules and about the upload formats. 
</p>
<p>
Please start by (re)listening to <a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=0560">0560 - Old soldiers | 2010-08-02</a>
</p>
<p>
As we didn't have shows to fill the feed, we introduced other Non-HPR exclusive content to fill the gaps.<br />
As contributions increased this resulted in a long delay in getting the HPR exclusive content out. <br />
The rest can be read via manually created mail archive <a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/archive/hpr-at-hackerpublicradio.org_2012-10-archive.pdf">http://hackerpublicradio.org/archive/hpr-at-hackerpublicradio.org_2012-10-archive.pdf</a>
</p>
<p>
There is also a discussion about changing the upload to FLAC only
</p>
<h2>Dev News</h2>
<p>
The cpanel website is giving problems and Josh is working to get them fixed. 
</p>
<p>mordancy pointed out that we didn't have a full feed for the ogg and spx. So after thinking about it for too long these have also been added.</p>
</p>
<p>
We made some clean up to the website so please have a look around and report anything out of the ordinary.
</p>
<p>
Epicanis has been working on a upload form which can be found <a href="http://hpr.dogphilosophy.net/hprup.php">http://hpr.dogphilosophy.net/hprup.php</a>

<h2>Ohio LinuxFest 2012 Registration is Open for Business</h2>
<p>
A message from Kevin O'Brien<br />
<em>We are opening up Registration for the 2012 Ohio LinuxFest event, and we'd appreciate it if you could pass along this message through whichever social media you prefer. The Registration page is at <a href="http://ohiolinux.org/register">http://ohiolinux.org/register</a></em>
</p>
<h2>AccessibleComputingFoundation fundraiser</h2>
<p>
We would like to announce the first fundraiser for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.accessiblecomputingfoundation.org" rel="external nofollow">Accessible Computing Foundation!</a>. It will be held on August 25 from 12pm EST until 12am EST August 26. This event will be streamed at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thenewradio.net" rel="external nofollow">The New Radio</a>for the entire event. It's going to be held over at Linux Basix, using their Mumble server. To find out the information for the Mumble server, please visit the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.LinuxBasix.com" rel="external nofollow">Linuxbasix</a>site . We'll be able to have up to 30 people in the room at once, so come and join us in talking about accessibility and Free software.<br>
<br>
So far, joining the event we will be having Jono Bacon from Ubuntu, and Zack the Debian project leader. If you'd like to speak with either of them, please come and join us on August 25. The goal for this fundraiser is to have 1000 people become members of the ACF at $2 a month. We have 3 other levels of membership options if anyone is interested. This would be a great help to the foundation and really get us off of the ground to start bridging the gap between accessibility and technology.<br>
<br>
The reason we're focusing on the $2/month level is because it's only 50 cents a week and we think this is a goal most people could meet, even if living on a fixed income like so many people with disabilities. Since monthly membership is so low, we are really depending on MANY people to become members to make this difference. Granted $2 a month isn't much, but if we can get a large number of people thinking this way, it will add up quickly and help out the Accessible Computing Foundation in a great way. So please, join us on August 25 and help bring Accessible Freedom to people around the world!

<h2>A short report from the HPR Table at LinuxFest Northwest</h2>
<p>
From: David Whitman <br />
<br />
A friend from work got intersted in going to the LinuxFest and helped at the table - Much thanks to Brad Coffey. We got set up on time and were well received. We had a great run on our swag and ran out of the HPR pin buttons by closing on the first day and handed out quite a few informational cards.The little business cards were really a hit also. Lots of good conversation and exposure for HPR. There was a constant stream of people coming by. I have four interviews on my various recording devices and should be able to get about four to six more from the sign up sheet that was available on the table. With a bit of planning and a more formal interview 'track' (using an appointment schedule and a designated room or area) I am sure a well staffed HPR table could easily get 20 interviews at this fest. Of course I will be interested in 
seeing if any of the many we talked to produces and post their own show. There was interest. I sensed that many of the speakers would have loved the extra exposure. HPR is probably becoming the embedded reporters of Linux Fests. The unofficial count of attendees that I heard was at "over 800". The table kit is ready to be shipped to the next venue. My intent is to put together a vertical layout canvas that can easily be shipped and set up as a backdrop and utilize a series of those 20 by 30 photo posters available at Costco Photo. This however will have to wait until after my annual spring fling of shutdown work that begins on May 5 and takes up to 3 weeks to complete. I'll post a G+pic of the backdrop we used at this fest. Best swag for me - a Tux 2012 bumper sticker from Pogo Linux. Look for a scan of this on G+ in the near future.
<br />
Thanks to the HPR community for the opportunity to represent the show. It was much fun.<br />

Back in episode <a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=0980">http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=0980</a> Broadband for Rural North, I suggested that people could sponsor a meter of cable for their project to show your support. Well they have gone ahead and done it

I will also extend the donation deal from the holiday period, so that anyone who donates to this gets some HPR swag when it's available.

<h2>Explicit Tag</h2>
<p>
There was a discussion on whither we should have a ban on swearing. We already have a iTunes explicit tag so assume that all shows may contain controversial material. Hosts are free to add a "safe for work" warning or any other warning they wish to the shows.<br />
We may add an option in the upload forms to support this on a show by show basis.

<p>
Hacker Public Radio is inviting the participants in podcasts and organizations that proceeded HPR and led to it's creation to join a recorded panel discussion  on HPR's origins and history.  We are reaching out to TWATech, BinRev Radio, Radio Freak America, Podfert, the Infonomicon Computer Club, and contributors to the first twelve months of HPR.  Our discussion will be recorded via the LinuxBasix.com Mumble server (mumble.openspeak.cc , Port: 64747) and be released as HPR episode 1024 (Stankdawg's idea).  Episode 1024 should fall on 5 July, but we would like to shoot for recording the panel about two weeks before hand.  In case of technical or other unforeseen problems on the primary recording date, a two week lead would give us time to regroup and make a second attempt.  The date and time will be set  to make it convenient for the greatest number of people who are willing to participate to join in.  Connections over Skype and SIP phone via Asterisk are possible, but it would be simplest for everyone to try to use the open source Mumble client.
<br />
If you decide to join in (and we hope you will), please include the time zone of where you will be in mid June, especially if you are outside the continental United States.  If there are dates, days of the week and/or times you would like me to avoid scheduling the panel (i.e., "I will be gone June 19-21", "I could only do it on a weekend", "only after 8PM", "only before 10PM") I would like to know that as well.  You may contact the organizers at ep1k@HackerPublicRadio.org

Hi All,

We mention it on today's show that /dev/random was in the queue for a
long time and some of the news may have been out of date. Would it be
an idea to switch one of the days to a "News" show so that we can
carry shows that review news. Any shows in there would follow the
regular scheduling rules
http://hackerpublicradio.org/calendar.php#scheduling_rules.

It's a discussion - let your voice be heard

I think this is a good idea, in fact, perhaps people could request a
priority level?  Most show ideas I have could sit in the queue for a while,
and I'd be happy to let more timely shows move ahead.

I Think a certain day could easily be put aside as a day for topical
or timely episodes.  It might be best, though, not to announce it as
being such to the general listenership, so that if there's a dearth of
news-type shows one week, another type of ep can be dropped in without
any need for a special announcement.

I'm going to try this again since I hit the wrong button last time and 
sent it Ken personally instead of to the list.

Just for the sake of discussion it occurs to me that while DeepGeek is 
on a hiatus for the moment, he had a weekly news spot every Friday. I 
don't know if there is any understanding that he will come back and 
resume his spot, but if so, would this mean 2 days a week reserved for 
newscasts? That might be a bit much.

I honestly don't think news should be broadcast over HPR as it dilutes 
the technology how to with mindless dribble that can be found almost 
anywhere else.

I think HPR is a real treasure.  Where else can so many people share
their ideas.  The strength of HPR is anything and everything is
acceptable content as long as it is of interest to hackers.  But as I
look back over the history of HPR, most attempts to add structure or a
rigorous schedule just haven't worked.  The one exception is the
current policy of syndicated Thursdays.

I have to agree with cobra2. If people want to do news shows, that's
great.  But IMHO, unless it is really important (event announcements)
it should take it's place in the queue with everybody else.  Shows
like /dev/random are awesome, but it's not because of the news they
cover.  There awesome because the guests are hilarious.  The stories
just give them something to talk about.  Even when their news is
weeks old, they are still fun to listen to.

So, there's my two cents.  For what it's worth from a long time
listener who has never contributed a show.

Why reserve any day?  One of the things I like about hpr is I don't know

like it.

I'm a great believer in moderation in most things. I look forward to 
many of the scheduled shows, and the ones that may not appeal to me 
probably appeal to lots of other folks. But I would favor not adding to 
them because part of the charm of HPR is not knowing what to expect. 
About one time out of every 30-40 shows I will hit the "Next" button on 
my MP3 player, which is not bad, really. But I would rather the 
occasional show that does not appeal to me than missing out on the gems.

I'm not in favor of dropping rule #2. Unless it is going to be used to 
syndicate some sort of news show. News is not content it's just a 
filler if there is nothing else left to talk about. 

I know the rules state of interest to hackers. But the history of HPR 
and TWAT has been mostly shows that dig deep into a piece of software 
or hardware or are a detailed how to. Shows that have a fairly long 
shelf life not something that can be outdated if a week or two passes 
by.

I tend to agree with this.

Also, as someone who is very new here, I am concerned that, if many 
slots are filled up with scheduled shows, aspiring contributers miight 
be dismayed to find that a show uploaded, say today, might not be 
posted until late June or July.   This can be a demotivator.

As an aside, I can count on both sets of fingers the number of shows 
I've hit "Next" on.  The variety of HPR is one of its main attractions 
for me.  Usually, when I do hit "Next," it's because the topic is so 
technical (say, a programming language) that I can't follow it.  

Once or twice--no more than that--it has been because the premise of the 
show was nonsensical--nevertheless, thanks to HPR, I got to hear and 
evaluate the premise, which, without the HPR's variety, I would not have 
had the opportunity to do.

Hi, Guys,

Just wanted to say that whatever you decide is fine by me. The news
shows I submit to HPR are actually "one half" of my regular show. That
is to say, I do a special tech-only version of my full world+tech news
show for HPR.

Therefore, in theory, a news-lover would be able to go to my website
and subscribe via RSS and get my shows rather quickly, if they so
desired. 

However, I also need to point out two more things.  First, I agree with
another poster that a distinction needs to be made between a show that
is about the guests, with current events thrown in as something for
them to comment upon; as opposed to my show which is purely about the
stories (I do rarely make editorial comments, but I try to keep my
personal opinions to a minimum.)

Second, I disagree with yet another poster that what I offer should be
"filler" and qualifies as something "that can be found almost
anywhere." The whole point of all the stories I cover is that a) they
are not covered by the mainstream media and b) they are, nevertheless,
timely and important news. In regards to this opinion, I ask you to
consider whether or not it is widely held amongst the general
listnership, which to I understand is not entirely present on this list.

Thanks for considering,

I our discussion of whether we want to keep syndicated shows, we should not
lose sight of the fact that last year Ken was really scrambling to find
content to keep HPR broadcasting on a daily basis.  While I think most of
the shows in syndication would understand, I hate to put Ken in the
position of saying, "Thanks, but we don't need you any more".  As for
variety, maybe we consider offering syndicated shows a limited run, 2 or 3
shows, not in consecutive weeks, as an introduction to our listener base.
Afterwards it would be incumbent on our listeners to add those shows to
their queue if they like what they hear.  It will also be up to
contributors and listeners to look for new shows that we can invite for
temporary syndication, like pokey has with http://distributedpodcast.com.

I posted this on Henry Patrick Riley (Goggle+)

What about making a MEGA syndicated day and combining 2 or more shows
together with intro music between and posting the run time when one show
ends and another begins? Rotate the order which show airs first.﻿

The following is more comments not on G+:

I want produce some 'casual' shows  that could go into an 'emergency' queue
in case there are times when the regular queue get close to empty. Things I
want to share, but they are not time critical and I am willing to have HPR
bank (such as How I found Linux, How to run a car in the Auto-X, A vacation
to Moab, Utah, Troubleshooting an MR2 using a volt/ohm meter etc. My idea
is that as soon as the emergency queue gets a month's worth of shows they
could be put out periodically into the regular queue. They could be tagged
with a 1-5 tech rating and the more techie ones used first.

How about having 2 parallel  tracks? or 3? HPR News, HPR Command Line, HPR
Projects, a weekly show track just for news....

All good and fine - I have 3 shows that need editing to help contribute to
the problem.

Thanks to all the HPR community members and admins. I love the show.

I think these thoughts have a lot of merit.  I rather enjoy learning about 
new shows through Syndicated Thursdays (I had not heard of the Sunday Morning 
Linux show until HPR introduced it to me).  Also, I must say I have heard 
some syndicated shows that I do enjoy, but not enough to actually subscribe 
to, so I find the idea of maintaining variety appealing..

My concern is that, if there are too many dedicated days, the dedicated days 
could turn into a regular line-up.  

Just my two cents.

This may be the "healthiest" discussion that I've ever seen on the HPR
mailing list, and I love it. I want to thank each and every person
subscribed for keeping the conversation respectful, and on topic. Most
mailing lists that I've seen could not have accomplished that.

As to the scheduling multi-lemma, I have a few thoughts that I would thank
you all in advance for considering:

We have the kind of crisis that we've always wanted, namely: we have too
many shows. This is an opportunity that I don't think we should squander.
At the same time we're trying to establish a scheduling policy that an
unmanned system can obey. The goal, as I see it, is to create rules that
can deal with an abundance of shows without wasting them. Right now what we
have is a scheduling policy that worked very well with a lack of shows, and
in fact it helped to replenish them. So I believe that we need either: one
set of rules that can cope with either situation, or two sets of rules and
a way for a deterministic system to identify and transition between them.
Please chime in on this if you are good with policy.

As I see it, at least part of what we're dealing with is a resource
management problem. People create content for us, and sometimes they assume
that it has an expiration timeframe. Some content simply must be used
before it's creator feels that it has expired, or we can expect that that
creator will seek other venues in which to publish their content. We need a
way of distinguishing "perishable" content from "non-perishable" content.
We also need a way of putting a date on the perishable content. If you have
experience with user feedback systems, we could really use your help
(especially) with this part.

Since identifying potential problems without offering solutions is just
bitching, I have a couple of suggestions.

Syndicated Thursdays and "timely content"
I for one, am grateful to the shows who have allowed us to fill holes in
our que with their content. While the syndicated Thursday slot was
originally implemented out of necessity, I feel that it is an overall plus
to continue the practice. We have developed friendly and mutually
beneficial relationships with other podcasts that I would be hesitant (to
put it mildly) to sever, and there are other great podcasts that we don't
even know about yet. I agree with Frank Bell in that I think the syndicated
Thursday feed is a great discovery tool, and I'd hate to loose it as such,
but I also see these shows as friends, and I want to make sure that we
treat them like it. I don't think it's in anyone's best interest for us to
abandon that kind of relationship, or the content that has so generously
been offered to us. If (and only if) there is a "Timely news show", I would
like to see it get the Thursday slot, but in order for the syndicated show
to not be wasted, I would like to see that show bumped to Saturday.

Scheduled HPR exclusive shows and normal que shows
I think if people commit to producing scheduled content before they record
it, and live up to that commitment, that we should honor that commitment.
Perhaps there needs to be some limit to the number of pre-schedulable slots
per week and/or month that we make available, so that there is still room
to play shows from our normal que, but we-as a group decided to ask people
to produce content for us, and several people have stepped up and
delivered. Perhaps this is a situation where more than one show should be
posted per day. I don't know.

While it's easy for me to sit here and suggest these things, I don't think
that it's fair for any of us to vote for posting more than five shows per
week unless we are committing to posting more than the requested "one show
per year" if the que ever gets low again.

Lastly, I believe that new hosts should continue to get the first
unscheduled slot. This is critical to getting new people to contribute, and
to return as hosts.

If I'm wrong, or out of line, or TLDR, or whatever... feel free to say so.
I can take it.

I think this is a wise suggestion.  I wasn't here when the goal of five  
days a week was set, but I'm inclined to think that it was intended to be  
a goal, not a limit.

I would suggest, as an aside, that the scheduling rules could be displayed  
more prominently.  Currently, they are at the bottom of the calendar.  I  
think prospective or new (like me) hosts should have their attention drawn  
to them more forcefully, perhaps by giving them their own page linked from  
the front page and linking to them from the calendar and from the  
"Contribute" page.  I also suggest changing the terminology from "rules"  
to "guidelines";  that's not just PR softening of a phrase, for they are  
guidelines as exceptions can be made.

It may also be useful to suggest that new hosts glance as the calendar to  
see when their available slots.  I would also like to see a friendlier  
calendar, meaning one that looks more like a wall calendar.  If you all  
wish, I would be happy to explore the WordPress plugins to see what I can  
find.

I support continuing the practice of bumping new hosts up in the queue.   
It's a recognition of effort and a motivator.  Frankly, I found it a blast  
(if an intimidating one) to look at my podplayer and see my own name  
looking back at me.

> Perhaps there needs to be some limit to the number of pre-schedulable  
> slots per week and/or month that we make available, so  

This might also be a good idea and it speaks to my concern of HPR's  
turning in to a line-up of  a few scheduled shows, rather than a platform  
that's open to newbies like me.

On the other hand, many persons have responded to the need for shows that  
Ken sounded last fall, not only with shows, but by airing promos on their  
own podcasts and websites, which leads to exposre which leads to shows (by  
the way, I think this flowering of support is a tribute to HPR and to the  
place it has amongst the community).

The flowering may yet wither and need to be watered anew.  In other words,  
once the enthusiasm wears off, Ken might be having to appeal for shows  
again.

In other words, I agree with some sort of limit and I lean towards a  
monthly one, but have no idea what would be a reasonable one.  If I were  
to try to word that as a guideline, it might come out like "the number of  
scheduled shows and the intervals between them that HPR can commit to is  
affected by the number of submissions" and leave it at that--that allows  
wiggle-room for adjusting to the realities of now.

"The following is an HPR special presentation . . . ."

I like it.

Just my two cents.

Once again, thanks for the nice welcome.  This is a good place to be.  (I  
have just cashed in some rewards points for a decent headset.)

I've removed the extended calendar so that we have a better view of
what shows are in the queue. There are under four weeks of shows left,
acceptable but hardly anything to celebrate about. Without TGTMNews
and the syndicated shows I would have been back begging for shows by
now.

Just something to keep in mind.

Ken.

Deepgeek. I just wanted to apologize for using words which caused you to
feel like I don't appreciate the work that you do every week. (I pull down
the whole tgtm feed) I'm not going to defend or back down from what I said.
But I just want you to know that what YOU do is appreciated. You've been a
part of this community for as long as I can remember. You also put most of
us to shame on contributing content. So i'm going to go back to my corner
and attempt to not crush people next time I crawl out of my hole.

Sorry again dude.

That is much easier to read.  Thank you.

I'm planning to do a simple tutorial on prepping pictures for posting to 
website with the GIMP.  I started my outline today and hope to have it done 
within two weeks.

Today it's the turn of the Going Linux podcast <a href="http://goinglinux.com/">http://goinglinux.com/</a>. The show is hosted by Larry Bushey and Tom Chaudoir and is aimed as providing a gentle introduction to linux.
</p>

<hr />
<p>
In this introduction to using Linux and Linux applications to record a podcast, we focus on doing it on the cheap. We reveal the hardware and software we use. We discuss that you don't have to have a fast, new computer and expensive recording equipment to make a good quality podcast recording. From recording to editing, and from creating a feed to creating a supporting website, we talk about the free and open source software we use. We also give some tips on the logistics of the recording process and hosting your audio files for free.

<h2>Other News</h2>
<p>
Deep geek will be taking some time off from recording Talk Geek to Me, to upgrade some of his technology. He should be back in June or July.
</p>
<p>
David Whitman says that the HPR conference kit, such as it is, has arrived safely and in time for LFNW (http://linuxfestnorthwest.org/). He has built quite a display to go behind the table, and he'll probably draw quite a crowd. He's making good use of Ken's presentation slides too, and those will play on a loop at the table. LFNW is going on as we record this, so we hope to hear back from David this month.<br />

Kernel Quote<br />
</p>
<p>
"Here’s the different active kernel versions that I am maintaining at the moment:<br />
3.2.y – this will be maintained until 3.3 comes out<br />
3.1.y – there will be only one, maybe two, more releases of this tree<br />
3.0.y – this is the new "longterm" kernel release, it will be<br />
maintained for 2 years at the minimum by me.<br />
2.6.32.y – this is the previous "longterm" kernel release. It is<br />
approaching it’s end-of-life, and I think I only have<br />
another month or so doing releases of this. After I am<br />
finished with it, it might be picked up by someone else, but<br />
I’m not going to promise anything.<br />
All other longterm kernels are being maintained in various forms<br />
(usually quite sporadically, if at all), by other people, and I can not<br />
speak for their lifetime at all, that is up to those individuals."<br />
– Greg Kroah-Hartman<br />
There was also a bit of a dust up between Tim Gardner of Canonical and Greg Kroah-Hartman over maintenance of the 2.6.32 kernel once greg gives it up. It appears to have been started by a misunderstanding and a conclusion jump by Tim.<br />

Microsoft Now Collects Extortion On Approximatley 70% Of All US Sales Of Androids<br />
</p>
<p>
LG is the latest victim to pay Microsoft’s extortion demands. They are the eleventh victim in this extortion scheme. A list of the other victims includes Samsung, HTC, and Acer. This leaves Motorola Mobility as the only major manufacturer to not sign an extortion agreement with Microsoft. I would wager that Microsoft has not even approached Motorola as Google now owns Motorola and those pockets are deep enough to scare off the Microsoft patent trolls. Microsoft now claims that they are collecting "royalties" on over 70% of all Android smart phones sold in the US. The terms of this latest agreement are unknown as Microsoft makes part of the agreement that the parties can not make public the patents covered by Microsoft’s claims. In other words a typical extortion agreement.<br />

The MPAA Instigates A Dustup with Ars Technica<br />
On 1/10 the MPAA (Motion Picture Associtation of America) said on it’s blog, "… Ars Technica, a tech blog with a long history of challenging efforts to curb content theft,". This entire claim by the MPAA appears to be Ars Technica opposing things in the past like the broadcast flag which would have allowed remote control of peoples home entertainment recording devices, along with their stand against DRM that prevents owners from ripping legal backup copies of their DVDs. Ars also has publicly opposed the horrendous SOPA legislation currently in front of Congress. It is obvious that the MPAA’s position is the wacky correlation of fighting for consumers’ rights is the equivalent of having no enforcement at all.<br />
</p>
<p>
Not that any representative of the MPAA would ever engage in outlandish statements to further their cause. Like this quote from Jack Valenti when he appeared before congress in 1982, "I say to you that the VCR is to the American film producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman home alone."<br />

United States Migrates Spy Drone Control Panels From Windows To Linux<br />
Last September the ground control systems for the Reaper drones, which reside at the Creech Air Force Base in Nevada, became infected with a virus. When it happed the Air Force dismissed this intrusion as a nuisance that posed no real threat, it was however taken very seriously.<br />
</p>
<p>
Still the discovery of this virus on the Air Force’s systems was a huge embarrassment. This is what they had to say at the time:<br />
</p>
<p>
"The malware in question is a credential stealer, not a key logger, found routinely on computer networks and is considered more of a nuisance than an operational threat. It is not designed to transmit data or video, nor is it designed to corrupt data, files or programs on the infected computer. Our tools and processes detect this type of malware as soon as it appears on the system, preventing further reach.", they also went on to say, "The ground system is separate from the flight control system Air Force pilots use to fly the aircraft remotely; the ability of the pilots to safely fly these aircraft remained secure throughout the incident,"<br />
Screen shots of drone control computers posted by security researcher Mikko Hypponen show that some of the systems have been migrated from Microsoft Windows to Linux. In a statement Mikko Hypponen said,<br />
</p>
<p>
"If I would need to select between Windows XP and a Linux based system while building a military system, I wouldn’t doubt a second which one I would take."<br />
Open Source Surgery, a Robot called Raven takes Flight<br />
</p>
<p>
The Raven 2 is a surgical robot with 7 degrees of freedom, compact electronics and two wing-like arms which end in tiny gripper claws designed to perform surgery on simulated patients. The robot’s software is compatible with Robot Operating System, an open source robotics coding platform.<br />

Most of the changes are faily simple one-liners, but some qla4xxx driver updates stand out and in fact account for about 40% of the diff ("qla4xxx: fix flash/ddb support"). That, together with a VMWare DRI driver update and some dvb updates and the regular random driver fixes means that 80+% of the changes are in drivers.<br />

Vote On SOPA Delayed Until Mid January At The Earliest<br />
<br />
The SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) vote scheduled for 12/21/11 was postponed until January. A committee spokesperson said that they will not set a new vote date until they return from break in January. This means that the earliest that a scheduled vote could take place would be mid January. This is the second postponement of the committee vote on SOPA, which requires ISPs, Search Engines, and other content providers to alter DNS records and search results. Resulting in the censorship of foreign websites supposedly "dedicated" to providing copyright infringing material. The committee has already had two marathon sessions that ended abruptly after opponents expressed staunch apposition.<br />

Now you know who to boycott, but you also have to let them know why you are boycotting them.<br />
<br />
Several grassroots organizations along with a few tech companies are putting forth a strong effort against this legislation. They have had some effect as arguably the most egregious section has under gone a quick rewrite by Rep. Lamar Smith, Judiciary Committee chair and sponsor of this bill. The changes revealed on Monday 12/12/2011, make the definition of "rogue websites" more narrow. It also clarifies that the take down provisions only apply to foreign websites. There were also several changes intended to alleviate concerns that this legislation would interfere with the architecture of the Internet. Because as it it stands this bill would force American companies to break dns.<br />
<br />
The NetCoalition which counts AOL, eBay, Facebook, foursquare, Google, IAC, Linkedin, Mozilla, OpnDNS, PayPal, Twitter, Wikipedia, Yahoo!, and the Zynga Game Netwrk as members is proposing a blackout day where all of these websites would go down and just show an anti-SOPA message to visitors when they come to these sites, claims Markham Erickson, who heads the NetCoalition trade association. If all of these sites went dark at the same time it would bring national commerce to a screeching halt. This action would also totally disrupt the lives of the majority of Americans hopefully alerting them to this serious issue and causing them to act.<br />
<br />
There is still time to try and defeat this horrendous legislation and the people at "DAILY KOS" have made it incredibly easy. If you click on this link it will take you directly to a page the have set up that will walk you through sending your representative an email telling them to vote no on this steaming pile of fecal matter.<br />

GoDaddy Rescinds SOPA Support After Huge Boycott Initiative<br />
Full disclosure, I have a domain registered with GoDaddy they are just the registrar not the host.<br />
<br />
On 12/22/2011 the fact that GoDaddy was actively supporting SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act). The really egregious part was that not only did GoDaddy support SOPA they actually took such an active roll as righting parts of it. So a boycott was started on reddit, which took off like wildfire across the internet. One day later they announced that they were withdrawing their support for SOPA. It is however to late for many high profile domains. Wikimedia Foundation’s Jimmy Wales announced on Twitter that all Wikimedia’s domains will be moved off of GoDaddy. Cheezburger’s Ben Huh also pledged to move his 1000+ domains off of GoDaddy. Hundreds maybe even thousands more people across the internet joined them in leaving GoDaddy. YCombinator founder, Paul Graham issued a ban on all employees of any company on the official list of SOPA supporters from attending YC Demo Day. Here is what he had to say about the ban:<br />
<br />
"Several of those companies [on the list] send people to Demo Day, and when I saw the list I thought: we should stop inviting them. So yes, we’ll remove anyone from those companies from the Demo Day invite list," He then went on to say this: "If these companies are so clueless about technology that they think SOPA is a good idea, how could they be good investors?"<br />
Warren Adelman, Go Daddy’s CEO, had this to say about them rescinding their support for SOPA:<br />
<br />
"Fighting online piracy is of the utmost importance, which is why Go Daddy has been working to help craft revisions to this legislation - but we can clearly do better," He then went on to say this also: "It’s very important that all Internet stakeholders work together on this. Getting it right is worth the wait. Go Daddy will support it when and if the Internet community supports it."<br />
This is a huge win for the free and open internet. It shows that when you can manage to hit a company where it counts, in the bottom line, you really can make them change their position. When you read GoDaddy’s statement the weasilyness jumps right out at you. Which leads me to believe that they are just trying to take the heat off right now and will jump at supporting the next minor revision of SOPA.<br />

I am going to try and synopsize the information for you, however if you go to http://debian-handbook.info/ you can read the whole story ab out the book. The book is currently published in French under the title Cahier de l’admin Debian. It is the work of two Debian developers Raphaël Hertzog who maintains dpkg along with several other packages and Roland Mas who maintains argyll and a few other packages. They attempted to have several editors take on the English translation but none where willing to take the risk. The two then decided to do the translation themselves, and then self publish the work. In order to facilitate the translation they did a crowdfunding campaign which raised almost 15,000 EUR. They expect the translation to be done around April 2012. They however wanted to take this further and release the book under an open source licenses acceptable to Debian so that the book can be included in Debian as an installable package. Making it a simple apt-get away for anyone running Debian. They have set this goal at 25,000 EUR, you can make a donation to the "liberation fund" here , If you donate 10 EUR or more you are guaranteed a copy when it is ready. If they meet their goal of 25,000 EUR then everyone will be able to get a free copy. I made my donation already if I remember correctly it was about 13.74 USD. So i will get my copy but if we can push this over it would be a great thing. The last time I checked they were at about 65% of their goal.<br />
<br />
And now a little about the book. This book requires no prior knowledge of Debian. It will cover all of the topics that anyone needs to become an effective Debian administrator. From installation and update to compiling your own kernel and creating Debian packages from sources. Along with backup, migration and advanced topics like SELinux, automated installations, and virtualization. The first half of the book is for anyone who wants to run Debian. It will teach the basics like installing Debian with the Debian installer, finding documentation, basic troubleshooting, and problem solving. Then the second half of the book is server administrators. It will discuss things like securing the server, automating installations, using virtualization, and setting up common services like Apache, Postfix, OpenLDAP, SAMBA, NFS and many more. You can check out the complete table of contacts here<br />
<br />
There is also a free sample chapter available "The APT Tools." If you would like to check this out to ensure that the book is up to the quality that you expect then you can click here for a PDF of this great chapter. It covers all of the APT tools like apt-get, aptitude, and other associated tools<br />
<br />
Now to answer some of the questions you may have about this book:<br />
Q) Who is this book for?<br />
A) Anyone who’s interested by Debian. From a regular user, to the administrator of a small network, or that of a large corporation.<br />
<br />
Q) How long is it?<br />
A) The French paperback was about 450 pages.<br />
<br />
Q) What version of Debian does it cover?<br />
A) the current stable version "Squeeze"<br />
<br />
So come people lets get out there and get your copy today and move the project that much closer to their goal of Open Sourcing this book.<br />

2011 The Year Of The Tech Giant Passing<br />
2011 has been a year in which we lost more tech giants than ever before, a total of fourteen. Lets start with arguably the best known on this list and end with the one I believe had the biggest impact:<br />
<br />
Steven Paul Jobs<br />
Febuary 1955 - October 2011<br />
<br />
Jobs experimented with different pursuits before starting Apple Computers with Stephen Wozniak in the Jobs’ family garage. Steve Jobs vision in the consumer electronic market is un paralleled. Hence Apple’s many revolutionary products, such as the iPod, iPhone and iPad. Which are now seen as dictating the evolution of modern technology.<br />
<br />
Robert Morris<br />
The Unix Encryption Guy<br />
July 1932 - June 2011<br />
<br />
Among the Bell Labs researchers who worked on Unix with Thompson and Ritchie was Bob Morris, who developed Unix’s password system, math library, text-processing applications and crypt function. In 1986 Morris left to join the NSA, where he led the agency’s National Computer Security Center until 1994.<br />
<br />
John McCarthy<br />
Originator Of AI<br />
September 1927 - October 2011<br />
<br />
The creator of the Lisp programming language and the "father of artificial intelligence" (he coined the term in 1956). In 1957 McCarthy started the first work on time-sharing on a computer. That original project led to Multics, which then led to Unix. In the early 1970s he predicted online shopping. This prediction led researcher Whitfield Diffie to create public-key cryptography used in the authentication of e-commerce documents.<br />
<br />
Ken Olsen<br />
The Digital Man<br />
February 1926 - February 2011<br />
<br />
When he worked at MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory in the 50s took note of students queuing up to use an older model computer, called TX-0, even when a more modern and much faster mainframe was available. The big diffrence and the reason that the students lined up for the TX-0 was that the mainframe ran batch jobs and the TX-0 allowed for online interactivity. So in 1957 he and a colleague, Harlan Anderson, ran with that information and $70,000 in start up capital to start DEC (Digital Equipment Corp.) DEC went on to create PDP series of computers of which Ritchie and Thompson created Unix on a PDP-7.<br />
<br />
Paul Baran<br />
The Packet Man<br />
April 1926 - March 2011<br />
<br />
Baran while working as a researcher for the Rand Corp. in 1961came up the idea that messages can be broken down into smaller pieces, then sent to a destination even via multiple routes if necessary and then put back together when they arrive to ensure delivery. Arpanet adopted Packet switching as its means of communication, Arpanet then grew into the Internet, and eventually for local-area networks in the form of Ethernet.<br />
<br />
Jean Bartik<br />
Last of the First Programmers<br />
December 1924 - March 2011<br />
<br />
She was the last surviving member of the original programming team for the ENIAC. But that understates her work, she was the only female math graduate in her 1945 college, and she served as a lead programmer on the ENIAC project. Bartik also developed circuit logic and did design work under the direction of ENIAC’s hardware developer, J. Presper Eckert.<br />
<br />
Jack Keil Wolf<br />
Disk Drivin’ Man<br />
February 1926 - February 2011<br />
<br />
Wolf did more than almost anyone else to use math to cram more data into magnetic drives, flash memory and electronic communications channels. In 1984, he moved to the new Center for Magnetic Recording Research at the University of California, San Diego. It was a good choice. Wolf and his students, dubbed the "Wolf pack," cross-pollinated magnetic drive design with information theory, applying compression in increasingly creative ways, and spread Wolf’s ideas throughout the industry.<br />
<br />
Julius Blank<br />
Creator Of The Silicon In Silicon Valley<br />
June 1925 - September 2011<br />
<br />
Julius Blank one of the "Traitorous Eight" engineers who founded Fairchild Semiconductor in 1957. He and his seven colleagues had acquired that unsavory nickname when they left Nobel Prize-winning physicist William Shockley just a year after being recruited to create a new kind of transistor at Shockley Labs. Before going to college, he had been trained as a machinist. Along with eventual venture capitalist Gene Kleiner, Blank built Fairchild’s machine shop, and created the manufacturing machinery that would produce the first silicon based transistors.<br />
<br />
Robert Galvin<br />
Breaker Of The AT&T Mobile Monopoly<br />
October 1922 - October 2011<br />
<br />
Galvin broke AT&T’s monopoly on mobile-phone service in the U.S. when he demonstrated a Motorola phone for president Reagan at the White House in 1981. Ronald Reagan then pushed the FCC to approve Motorola’s proposal for a competing cellular network. By the time Galvin retired as Motorola’s chairman in 1990, the company dominated the cellphone hardware business.<br />
<br />
Gerald A. Lawson<br />
Creator Of The Video Game Cartridge<br />
December 1940 - April 2011<br />
<br />
Jerry Lawson a 6-foot-6, more than 250 lbs. African-American, which was even more of an IT industry rarity in the 1970s than today. Lawson’s creation, the Fairchild Channel F, arrived in 1976, a year before Atari’s first home game system, and sparked an industry of third-party video games. Lawson discovered that the biggest challenge with plug-in cartridges was satisfying the FCC’s radio-frequency interference requirements. In a 2006 interview he describes the process:<br />
<br />
"We had to put the whole motherboard in aluminum. We had a metal chute that went over the cartridge adapter to keep radiation in. Each time we made a cartridge, the FCC wanted to see it, and it had to be tested."<br />
Its biggest impact was on Lawson’s friends at Atari, who rushed their own cartridge-based home system into production. The rise of the video game had begun.<br />
<br />
George Devol<br />
The Man With The Robot Arm<br />
February 1912 - August 2011<br />
<br />
George Devol developed the first digitally programmable robot arm. He also invented a system for recording sound for movies in the 1930s, then switched to systems that used photoelectric cells to open and close doors and sort bar-coded packages. Devol turned his inventiveness to factory automation in the 1950s. The large programmable "Unimate" arm he developed used magnetic drum memory and discrete solid-state control components. It made its factory debut in 1961 on a General Motors assembly line in New Jersey, stacking freshly die-cast (and very hot) metal parts. Within 20 years, Devol’s Unimation was the biggest robotic-arm company in the world.<br />
<br />
Lee Davenport<br />
Anti-Aircraft Innovator<br />
December 1915 - September 2011<br />
<br />
Lee Davenport didn’t invent battlefield radar. He developed an anti-aircraft gun that combined radar with a computer to control anti-aircraft guns. At the Battle of the Bulge, the radar system was also used to spot German ground vehicles in the snowy terrain. In addition, the SCR-584 was used in 1944 to defend London against German buzz bombs. The SCR-584 crews were very effective in shooting down the buzz bombs.<br />
<br />
Wilson Greatbatch<br />
Heartbeat of the Century<br />
September 1919 - September 2011<br />
<br />
In 1956 Wilson Greatbatch, an electrical-engineering professor at the University of Buffalo, made an electronic mistake that led to the invention of the pacemaker. He was building a heart rhythm monitor for the school’s Chronic Disease Research Institute when he attached a wrong-size resistor to a circuit, causing it to produce intermittent electrical pulses. Greatbatch realized that this might be used to regulate a damaged heart. Two years later, doctors at the Veterans Administration hospital in Buffalo demonstrated that a 2-cubic-in. implantable device built by Greatbatch could regulate a dog’s heart. In 1960 in Buffalo, 10 patients (including two children) received Greatbatch’s device, and its battery lasted two years or more. In 1972, Greatbatch was able to re-engineer the device with a new battery that worked for more than a decade.<br />
<br />
Dennis M. Ritchie<br />
An Originator of Unix, Inventor of C<br />
September 1941 - October 2011<br />
<br />
Dennis Ritchie is one of the authors of the Unix operating system, and designed the C programming language. And he promoted both, starting in the 1970s. You may ask how influential all of that work was? Well just look at the number of closed source Unix clones we have today, not to mention their Open Source brethren the BSDs. Along with Linux a Unix work alike. Not to mention C, which eight of the top ten programming languages descend from.<br />
<br />
Raspberry Pi, a Tiny But Powerful $25 PC -<br />
The final Raspberry Pi will come in two flavors: A $25 version with 128MB of RAM and no network connection and a $35 one with Ethernet. Both versions will have USB and HDMI ports as well as analog video and audio outputs. It’s driven by a The 1080p video magic is driven by a 700MHz ARM processor, and the whole thing is powered by a 5-volt power supply.<br />
The Year in Review: Desktop Linux Developments in 2011<br />
The "year in review" pieces that proliferate old and new media alike around this time of year get tedious pretty fast. But because I’ve yet to see a good compilation of the major developments — and there were plenty of them — that affected desktop Linux in 2011<br />

Howdy folks, this is FiftyOneFifty.  <br />
What you are about to hear is the result of me starting a mixdown recording in Mumble when Pokey said he was about ready to stop recording and go to bed.  While it's all pretty tame, it's not entirely safe for work.  I started recording sometime after midnight Central Time and the original file shows we talked for another two hours and fifteen minutes (deleting the pauses brings it down to about an hour and a half).  At the end it's just me and Cobra2, proving that as in real life, I never know when it's time to gracefully leave a party :)  <br />
Among the other voices you will hear are Pokey, Delwin, JNeuster, Deltaray, DoorToDoorGeek, and I thought it was especially cool when the world wrapped around and Ken Fallon came back in after having gone to bed the night before. I didn't have the forethought to make note of all the handles active in the room, and the festivities of the evening did not enhance my recall, so I apologize to those I have overlooked.  With the help of the community, I hope to get you proberly credited in the show notes, even if it is after the fact.  
</p>
<p>
I regret I wasn't able to participate or listen too in the entire thirteen hour scheduled recording, since I am speaking to the future I am sure I will be enjoying those missed hours even as you hear this.  I want to add my voice in gratitude and congratulations to those who organized and participated in making this event a success.

<p>
The discussion focused on how you can support free software and free culture with many paying more for "Free" software than they ever had for proprietary software. Many feel they pay what the can when they can.
</p>
<p>
The discussion move on to how artists can make a living. <br />
Should we draw the line between digital replication and physical replication as copyright infringement, although illegal, is not stealing. Not every download is a lost sale and the argument was made that in some cases "piracy" promotes the use of the software. There was much talk of the continual increase of the copyright terms.
</p>
<p>
Time was then devoted to how artists could be compensated for their art and several examples were brought up of alternative means of generating revenue by cutting out the record labels and other middle men.

<p>
This segment started with a discussion on accessibility. We are looking for a way to convert the audio to text so that deaf/hard of hearing people can enjoy our content. That lead to a discussion on Text to speech and that if you are uncomfortable or unable to record a show for HPR, then there are loads of people who will narrate a scrip for you.
</p>
<p>
The discussion turned to the question of how to pick topics for HPR and while the advice is to pick a topic that you're excited about you can always look at the Requested topics section of HPR at <a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/contribute.php#requested_topics">http://hackerpublicradio.org/contribute.php#requested_topics</a>. If there is something that you would like to hear then mail the mailing list at hpr@hackerpublicradio.org (which you can join at <a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/maillist">http://hackerpublicradio.org/maillist</a> ) or just email admin@hackerpublicradio.org and we'll add it to the Requested topic page.
</p>
<p>
For the record when we say topic we are not talking about the topic choclate bar.<br /> 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_(chocolate_bar)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_(chocolate_bar)</a>
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cb/Topic_%28chocolate_bar%29.jpg" width=400 />
</p>
<p>
After discovering that HPR has a explicit tag in iTunes (<a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/specs.html#explicit">http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/specs.html#explicit</a>) the conversation took a turn to how the topic of Adult content and that there are two sides to the story.<br /> 
<a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=0069">http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=0069</a> There's Pr0n on them there internets!<br />

</p>
<p>
This lead to the question of whither government censorship will force developments in how the Internet is used. This brought up mesh networks (we had a discussion in <a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=0837">http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=0069</a> with Juergen Schinker open wireless network) and how the Chaos Computer Club had a presentation on the Hackerspace Global Grid. From their FAQ "We want to build a distributed network of ground stations to receive satellite communications. The first step is establishing a means of accurate synchronization for the distributed network. Next up are building various receiver modules (ADS-B, amateur satellites, etc) and data processing of received signals. A communication/control channel (read: sending data) is a future possibility but there are no fixed plans on how this could be implemented yet."
<a href="http://shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=project:hgg">http://shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=project:hgg</a> Hackerspace Global Grid. Sounds a bit like an open version of the Iridium satellite constellation

</p>
<p>
After a discussion on Google+, the topic came on whither you needed to encode all 3 audio formats for HPR. The answer is <strong>no</strong>, not if you don't want to. If you do then you can download the script that Code Cruncher made from <a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/incoming/processing/prep_audio.sh">http://hackerpublicradio.org/incoming/processing/prep_audio.sh</a>. That said it's enough to upload the show in almost any format and we'll convert it.
</p>
<p>
To round off the segment was a discussion of the <a href="http://theflatearthsociety.org/cms/index.php">http://theflatearthsociety.org/</a> who argue that "The Flat Earth model is a belief that the Earth's shape is a plane or disk." (source wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth_Theory">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth_Theory</a>. <br />
....

<p>Philip Newborough (aka corenominal) project lead for CrunchBang Linux and their community manager Rebecca Newborough join the session. We interviewed them back in <a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=0873">hpr0873</a>
</p>
<p>
CrunchBang is a Debian GNU/Linux based distribution offering a great blend of speed, style and substance. Using the nimble Openbox window manager, it is highly customisable and provides a modern, full-featured GNU/Linux system without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>
In September 2011, Philip gave up paid employment to concentrate on personal projects and is now working full-time on CrunchBang Linux. <strong>During the interview he mentioned that he couldn't afford to <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2012/">FOSDEM</a> so if you want you can throw him a few credits over at <a href="http://crunchbang.org/donate">http://crunchbang.org/donate</a></strong>

<h3>Kernel News: Mat</h3>
<p>Time: 1:56<br>
Latest RC release is 3.2-rc5 released on Friday 12/9 at 6pm Eastern standard time.</p>
<p>It has been slightly over a week since the last rc release.  And rc5 is bigger in number of commits.  Many of the commits are small, so it is possible that the *diff* will be smaller than both -rc2 and -rc4 were. </p>
<p>A big part of this release is that Ingo is back, and had a backlog.  That isn’t enough to explain it all.  There were xfs and btrfs changes, along with network updates, and the usual 50% random driver updates. </p>

<p>Greg KH announced the release of the 2.6.32.50, 3.0.13, and 3.1.5 stable kernels 12/9. </p>
<p>The 2.6.32.50 kernel had 28 files changed, 164 insertions, and 54 deletions.<br>
The 3.0.13 kernel had 93 files changed, 659 insertions, and 201 deletions.<br>
The 3.1.5 kernel had 135 files changed, 1170 insertions, and 471 deletions.</p>
<p>Kernel Quote of The Week:</p>
<p> Hey Linus stop working on Subsurface, The Scuba Diving Log that doesn’t suck, during the week so you can get the latest RC out before 6pm eastern time so it is easier for me to do these updates. (insert appropriate smiley here)</p>

<p>jQuery Tells The Real Story About Plugin Site, or Why You Should Have a Backup More Recent Than a Year Old </p>
<p> The jQuery plugins site devolopers have finaly told the real story, in a blog posting.  The plugins site went down about a week ago with just this message: “The plugins site is currently unavailable. We’ve been looking to provide a higher-quality, spam-free expierence at the plugins site for some time and we have decided to temporarily shutter the existing site. We will be providing more details on the new plugins site soon, so that plugin authors can hit the ground running with our new submission process.”  What really happened was, in an attempt to clean up the spam using Drupal Views Bulk Operations, all of the plugins were deleted.  And the only backup was a year old.  The developers asked for forgiveness and some help in developing a completely new plugins site.  The plugins site needed renovations for quite some time.  Due to the spam issue and because of how plugins were manged through the CMS that was cluttered and awkward.  They were planning on replacing the site when events caused an imdeiate need.  When I say events I mean the accidental deletion and lack of backup was the impetus to move those plans into action.  jQuery plugin developers should create a GitHub presence, even if they just mirror their existing source code management. The new site still being developed on github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/ and there is currently no date for its launch.</p>
<p>Download.com accused of wrapping nmap in a “trojan installer” </p>
<p> Nmaps author says CBS Interactive and CNET’s Download.com are wrapping the open source application in a proprietary installer.  In the past, they have never altered the application downloads they serve up, they have been changing that over the last six months.  Gordon “Fyodor” Lyon, lays out his issues in a posting to the Nmap Hackers mailing list. He claims the installer does thing like install the ‘StartNow’ toolbar”, makes Bing the default search engine, and then sets the users home page to MSN.  This is how a “trojan installer” functions.  If the installer is seperated from the download and sent to VirusTotal it shows that ten of the 42 scanners, they run it against, identify it as a trojan or adware installer. Also the Nmap trademark is displayed next to offers to install software, as if the Nmap organization supports these products. As Nmap is not under the plain GPL but under an enhanced version that specifically prohibits aggregation into a proprietary executable installer.<br>
  Download.com initially claimed its scheme is simple for developers to opt-out of.  The opt out is not automatic though. Download.com says “all opt-out requests are carefully reviewed on a case by case basis.”  Lyon is looking for a US copyright attorney and wants to get the word to the hundreds of users who use Download.com every week to download Nmap.<br>
  CBS’s Download.com site has been called out for this type of behaviour before.  In August, ExtremeTech claimed similar behaviour with the media player VLC.  According to an FAQ from CBS this installer software was rolled out in July.<br>

  After the fecal matter hit the fan on this Download.COM back pedaled in a big way.  In a statement, Sean Murphy, the Vice President and General Manager of Download.com said, “The bundling of this software was a mistake on our part and we apologize to the user and developer communities for the unrest it caused.”  Then adding that they had “reviewed all open source files in our catalog to ensure none are being bundled”.<br>
Lyon posted an update, stating that Microsoft had been in contact with him and claimed they “didn’t know they were sponsoring CNET to trojan open source software”. Microsoft also stated that they had stopped the practice, which seems odd since they said that they were unaware that it was happening.  So now the Download.com installer changed to install the “Babylon toolbar” which did different search engine redirection.  CNET then later removed that and is now installing its own “techtracker” tool for updating downloaded software.  However they are also restoring the “Direct download link” which allows users to download files without having to download the “download manager”.<br>
  Who knows if these changes will quell the controversey. The changes only affect open source software and the proprietary freeware and trial software on Download.com will still have the Download.com Installer packaging.  A number of open source programs at Download.COM still had an installer wrapping them.  There has been no general apology for bundling GPL software with closed source installers.</p>

<p>Researchers at Google Have Proposed s Fix to The SSL Dilemma </p>
<p> Google researchers Adam Langley and Ben Laurie have proposed a new method for ensuring the trustworthiness of the public key infrastructure (PKI) underpinning HTTPS.  Thier idea is based on a public list of all certificates ever issued by certificate authorities.  The two problems with how the current system works are.  First, if an attacker can comprimise any of the more than 100 certificate authorities and aquire a certificate for a server such as amazon.com, end users would not be able to tell the fraudulant site from the real one. Second, the way the system currently works Amazon would not be able to detect the fraud either.<br>
  Langley and Laurie believe that a public list would mitigate both problems.  Whenever a website offered up a certificate, the browser would check the supplied certificate against one of these public lists.  If the browser did not find the certificate on any of the lists, the site would be treated as untrusted.  Companies would then be able to check these lists regularly, to locate any fraudulent certificates.  Which means that even if a criminal was able to obtain a fake certificate, they could not use it efectively.  Merkle signature trees would be used to maintain the integrity of the lists.<br>

  The proposals might not be implemented and, if it is, noone knows over what sort of timescale.  There are also other alternatives being proposed like Firefoxs’ extension Convergence being pursued by security expert Moxie Marlinspike.</p>

<p>Android’s Revenge on Apple’s iPhone &amp; iPad </p>
<p> Could Apple be regretting its world-wide war on Android?  A German court issued a preliminary injunction on Motorola’s behalf that prevents European sales of all Apple’s 3G-enabled devices.  Android-power Motorola Mobility, soon to be a part of Google, used a patent to thwart the competition. Apple has been using design and software patents in order to attack Android world wide.  So I don’t think this could have happened to a nicer company. </p>
<p> Regretably the patent being used, Method for performing a countdown function during a mobile-originated transfer for a packet radio system, is an excellent example of brain dead software patents.  Almost as bad as Apple trying to block anybody from creating a rectangular phone or tablet as it would infringe on thier “unique” design.  Thing like this sadly are not unusual but equate to little more than Intelectual Property (IP) blackmail.  Just check out U.S. Patent No. 6,359,898 and its European Union equivalent, EP1010336 (B1) ? 2003-03-19.  They basicly describe performing a countdown over a 3G connection.  You know lik, “Ten seconds to complete your download, three, two, one, download complete.”  Oh, obviously an original idea indeed. </p>
<p> So you say why is a countdown mechanism so essential that a court would rule that Apple would be in violation and unable to sell thier products in Europe.  Well so does Apple which is why they have appealled using a  Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory  (FRAND) defense. [Tony this is a link to a PDF that explains a frand defense please embed it <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/jevons/papers/colloquium_2007/jevons07_glader.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/jevons/papers/colloquium_2007/jevons07_glader.pdf</a>]  This defenses core argument is that this feature is not an essential component to 3G mobile telephony.   I and I also assume you all understand that, but the German court wasn’t going for it. </p>

<p> So this will go on for a while in the court system with suit and counter suit.  And in the end it will only delay the sale of Apple products in the EU.  But another side effect is that no matter where you buy your smartphone it will cost you more because thes kinds of court battles do not come cheap.  I  have a suggestion to all of these patent mongers and trolls, knock it off and just compete in the market place instead of the court room.</p>

<p>Get top-quality open source security tools in one distro </p>
<p> If you could have just one toolkit for network security, which one would you choose?  I mean the one toolkit that had all of the functionality you needed for securing, analyzing, monitoring, and validating your network.  Would it be BackTrack, Deft, or Helix?  Well I have used two of those and I have found a distro that I think kicks thier ass. After you have checked out Network Security Toolkit (NST), I believe that you will choose it also. </p>
<p>This live DVD is based on Fedora. NST was designed to bring you easy access to the best Open Source Network Security Applications.  It should run on most x86/x86_64 platforms.  The intent of this distrobution is to provide network security administrators with a complete set of tools.  Most of the tools in INSECURE.ORGs Top 100 Security Tools are in this kit.  An advanced Web User Interface (WUI) is provided for system administration, navigation, automation, geolocation and configuration for many of the network and security applications in distribution. </p>
<p>Here are some of the tools that come with NST: </p>
<p>Aircrack NG: A wireless sniffer and WEP/WPA-PSK key cracker<br>

<p> Installing NST is as simple and easy as any other major Linux distribution out there today.  After downloading the DVD image burn it out to disk, then pop it in and and boot up.  You can choose to either boot into console or graphical mode, recommend the graphical mode even though it is GNOME 3.  If your hardware will not support GNOME 3 you can opt to fall back on Classic GNOME.  After bootup you will see the default live user enter the password nst2003 and let the desktop load.  Once the desktop has fully loaded you can either take it for a test drive or jump right into the install.  In order to install it you have to go to Applications &gt; System Tools &gt; Install NST To Hard Drive.  If you have installed any Linux distribution before you will find no surprises here.  When the installation is complete, or the live version is up and running, you can start experimenting with the tools.  There are hundreds of available tools here to help you monitor, secure, analyze, and do practicly anything else on your network. </p>

Today we're going back in time, to a classic audio drama performance by the Mercury Theater and was originally aired in <em>Aug 29, 1938</em>. It is an adaptation of the classic novel The Count of Monte Cristo, by Alexandre Dumas. </p>
<p>
<h2>Mercury Theatre</h2>
<p>
<img src="http://ia600301.us.archive.org/8/items/OrsonWelles-MercuryTheater-1938Recordings/ORSON.JPG?cnt=0" alt="Orson Welles at old style microphone"><br />
The Mercury Theatre was a theatre company founded in New York City in 1937 by Orson Welles and John Houseman. After a string of live theatrical productions, in 1938 the Mercury Theatre progressed into their best-known period as The Mercury Theatre on the Air, a radio series that included one of the most notable and infamous radio broadcasts of all time, The War of the Worlds, broadcast on October 30, 1938. The Mercury Theatre on the Air produced live radio dramas in 1938-1940 and again briefly in 1946.
</p>
<h2>The Count of Monte Cristo</h2>
<p>
The Count of Monte Cristo (French: Le Comte de Monte-Cristo) is an adventure novel by Alexandre Dumas. It is often considered to be, along with The Three Musketeers, Dumas's most popular work. He completed the work in 1844. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from the plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.</p>
<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Dumas_by_Nadar%2C_1855.jpg" width=400 alt="photo of Dumas" ></p>
<p>
The story takes place in France, Italy, islands in the Mediterranean and the Levant during the historical events of 1815–1838 (from just before the Hundred Days through to the reign of Louis-Philippe of France). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book. An adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy and forgiveness, it tells of a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune and sets about getting revenge on the men who destroyed his life. However, his plans also have devastating consequences for the innocent as well as the guilty. The book is considered a literary classic today. According to Luc Sante, "The Count of Monte Cristo has become a fixture of Western civilization's literature, as inescapable and immediately identifiable as Mickey Mouse, Noah's flood, and the story of Little Red Riding Hood."

<h1 class="entry-title">The Flying Handbag</h1>

<p>Hello all, apologies for the lack of Weekly Rewind updates lately. Things have been crazy. I do have a rather special treat for you today instead. A podcast recorded at <a href="http://barcampblackpool.com" target="_blank">Barcamp Blackpool</a> on <strong>October 15th 2011</strong>.</p>
<p>Let me fill in a little background detail to this. I was in Blackpool catching up with my fellow podcaster <strong>Pete Cannon</strong> of <strong><a href="http://tdtrs.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Dick Turpin Roadshow</a></strong> fame. Our good friend <strong>Les Pounder</strong> of <strong><a href="http://blackpoollug.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Blackpool LUG</a></strong> came over and asked "are you two up for doing a podcast?". Of course we were but had no idea what about or what the structure would be. We also didn't book a space on the barcamp schedule board. This was all very last minute. One of the talk areas at the barcamp was named <strong>The Flying Handbag</strong> after a well known Blackpool gay bar apparently. This caused much hilarity. We saw it was free and planned to record our discussion there. Upon our arrival another bloke was already there waiting to start his talk and he didn't look too impressed by our rag tag bunch.</p>

<p>So off we wandered in search of another recording location and ended up sat on the stairs by the gents toilets in <strong><a href="http://www.blackpoolpleasurebeach.com/" target="_blank">Blackpool Pleasure Beach Casino</a></strong>. You can hear what followed next. A rambling and fun conversation between 6 opinionated blokes, with some additional comedy value added by the really loud hand dryer noise coming from the toilets.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen we present.</p>
<h2>The Flying Handbag Cast!!!</h2>

<h2>Apologies To</h2>
<UL> 
<li>Kris Findlay, and Thistleweb for scheduling mixups</li>
</UL>

<h2>Scheduling Shows</h2>
<pre>
Hi Earthlings,

Along with the scheduling rules
http://hackerpublicradio.org/calendar.php there is the line "while
avoiding having any one host/series repeated in a week". The idea was
to allow for  someone uploading an entire series in one go and us
having to schedule it. That has worked well so that the queue is full
and that host still gets their series played fairly often, but ...

After an event like OggCamp/ILF/OLF/SELF etc we tend to get a load of
shows at once that are outside the traditional series concept. Some of
these have the "feel of the fest" and may go stale after a time.

Should we schedule those according to the same rules meaning there
would be no more than one a week, or should we open the floodgates and
have a few weeks dedicated to post festival interviews ?

Discuss.

<h2>New Outro</h2>
<p>
<P>
We have moved provides some time ago and we need to include an advertisement for our sponsor (Lunar pages) in the outro. I have edited all the episodes that are currently in the queue to have the new outro but going forward I would appreciate it if you could switch to the new outro which can be found here <A HREF="http://hackerpublicradio.org/media/theme-music/outro-mono.mp3">http://hackerpublicradio.org/media/theme-music/outro-mono.mp3</A>. All the versions including the original slick0 master flac, can be found at <A HREF="http://hackerpublicradio.org/media/theme-music/">http://hackerpublicradio.org/media/theme-music/</A>
</P>
<P>
The text for the outro is in the file <a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/media/theme-music/hpr-outro-text.txt">hpr-outro-text.txt</a> and I'd like to get a versions from every host and listener, with the idea of editing them together to have multiple versions with each line read by different people. Please submit those in high quality WAV or FLAC with spaces between each line to allow for easy editing.
</P>
<P>
After recording a HPR news segment at my brother-in-law's studio he was inspired to record a intro and outro for HPR and he'd appreciate your feedback. Give the files starting in <a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/media/theme-music/">http://hackerpublicradio.org/media/theme-music/</a> rollercostermusic.com* a listen.
</P>
<P>
It would also help greatly if you could provide shownotes with your episode in html as otherwise I need to listen to your shows and make the shownotes for you which will result in a delay in your show getting posted. We are now also officially CC-BY-SA so if you are releasing your show in any other format you need to make note of that
in your show and in the shownotes.

<h2>Casting Call</h2>
A while back 5150 proposed that we produce an audiobook using only HPR contributors as actors. Several people Responded positively, and said they would like to participate. Well, we now have a script. It was originally written as a screenplay, so it needs a little work to make the visual bits work as audio only, but I don't think that will take too long. It's almost ready to go as is. 5150 and Integgroll have stepped up to help me make editorial and casting decisions and get other producer type stuff done. <br>

<br>This is a casting call of sorts. We need some voice actors, but we'll also need some sound effects, and perhaps some music. I may ask people to create sound effects, and upload them to the freesound project, or just to find such sounds. I'm not sure what We'll need yet, but I'd like to know who's interested in helping out. I was considering asking the Open Source Musician's Podcast to consider doing a "tune storm" for some music, but I'd like to know if you guys think we should keep it all in house, or collaborate on that.<br>

<br>The story is a SciFi/adventure that's also a lighthearted Free Software allegory, so it's a perfect fit for HPR. It will run between 50 and 80 minutes, I think, so it may be broken up into two or three episodes if it's too long for just one. I'm really not sure.<br>

<br>The plan is to record with actors using mumble but also recording locally to get the best possible sound quality. I'll mix it all in audacity, unless someone else wants that job, or wants to do it with ardour or whatever.<br>

<br>As is, There are 4 male roles, 3 female roles, and 6 androgynous roles. Most of the male and female roles could be swapped also to match our supply of actors. If we get more people than that, We'll add parts to make sure that everyone who's interested can participate. The protagonist and major roll is female. She will have a majority of the speaking parts, thus the biggest time commitment of all the actors. <br>

<br>If you're interested, please send me a voice sample so I can sort out the cast, or let me know what you're willing to do so I have some idea about that too. Please use my personal email address for this so that we don't clutter up the regular mailing list. <a href="mailto:pdailey03@gmail.com" target="_blank">pdailey03@gmail.com</a><br>

<br>Thank you for hearing me out on this.<br>

<h2>The Linux News Podcast</h2>
<p>
Hi fellow podcaster,<br>
<br>
I have just launched a new podcast. You know as well as I do it is hard to get the news out. I was wondering if you would please be so kind as to give it a listen. Any feedback would be appreciated. And if you like it, a mention in your podcast would be very kind. If you do, please email me so I can put a link on my website to your show.<br>
<br>
Also if you ever need a guest on your show, please feel free to email me and let me know. If you want to know a little more about me please check out my website under About. You can also email me any questions you may have.<br>
<br>
So what is my new podcast? The Linux News Podcast. The Linux News Podcast was designed to fill a much needed gap in audio shows covering exclusively Linux, Android, and Open Source news. The podcast aims to be relevant, accurate, fair, clear, timely, interesting and concise. <br>
<br>
The podcast aims to be relevant by focusing on topic of interest to Linux users. I focus on such topics such as software freedom, Linux development, Open Source software, Android and mobile devises, security issues, and Linux distribution releases. Special attention is given to the top ten Linux distributions: Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Fedora, Debian, openSUSE, Arch, PCLinuxOS, Puppy Linux, Sabayon, and CentOS.<br>
<br>
The podcast is less than 15 minutes long and is released every Tuesday and Friday evenings.<br>

<br>
Thank you so much for your help in spreading the news.<br>
<br>
Here is the Official Press Release: <a href="http://www.prlog.org/11624836-new-linux-news-podcast.html" target="_blank">http://www.prlog.org/11624836-<wbr>new-linux-news-podcast.html</a><br>

<h2>RFC Changing show to CC-BY-SA</h2>
<p>
17 hosts have replied and 100% of those that replied gave permission for the change to CC-BY-SA<br />
107 hosts have yet to reply. <br />
This means that a little over 1/3rd of the shows have been re-licensed. I intend to email them directly as they may not be on the mail list.
</p>
<pre>
Hi All,

This is an official request for a change of license that *NEW* shows
are uploaded as.

The proposal is to change from:
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/

To http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/

The RFC will be open for a month and the results will be announced
here and on July's HPR Community News. If approved all shows after
that time will be by default CC-BY-SA unless indicated in the show
notes. Further, I would then contact everyone that has hosted so far
asking if we can relisence their show(s) as CC-BY-SA.

This is entirely up to the community so please use the mail list you
voice your opinion. Even a one liner is fine.

Ken.

<h2>Month in Review </h2>
<p>
This was a busy and bumpy month as I recall it ... Ken went on holidays and the server felt abandoned and went on strike and then it pretended that there is no more space in the queue and once there was more space we almost ran out of shows and we are still looking for people to do HPR-PR at SELF, for which they will get 2 fantastic HPR T-Shirts. Ken? did you also move the server this month?

<h3>HPR Appeal</h3>
<p>
Last month I mentioned that klaatu has not posted a show that month. I was contacted by Karen from the Free as in Freedom oggcast (<a href="http://www.faif.us/">http://www.faif.us/</a>) to tell me that klaatu had been arrested by the department of immigration while urban camping in some corporate head quaters in Cupertino. She wasn't allowed to say much apart from that the department of homeland security is now involved as well and have confiscated his laptop and are holding him at an undisclosed location.<br /> 
We are collecting some money to aid in his release so if you can help please go over and donate at: <BR />

<h3>Scheduling Rules update</h3>
<p>Shows will be released based on the following rules that gives content produced for HPR priority, while avoiding having any one host/series repeated in a week. Hosts are encouraged to release their shows on other feeds after uploading them to HPR.</p> 
<p> 
<ol> 
  <li><strong>Time critical</strong><br /> 
    Where the host has requested a show to be posted at a particular time or that the show contains newsworthy information.</li> 
  <li><strong>Scheduled Slots</strong><br /> 
    Where a host has been assigned a regular day to release a show.</li> 
  <li><strong>New Hosts</strong><br /> 
    In order to encourage new hosts we will prioritize shows submitted from new hosts so they can experience the excitment of podcasting.</li> 
  <li><strong>HPR Content on a First in First Out basis.</strong></li> 
</ol> 
</p> 
<p>Syndicated shows will be released on their own scheduled slot following the same rules as above.</p> 

<h3>HPR Stickers</h3>
<p>
<img src="http://www.hackerpublicradio.org/promote/hpr_sticker.png">
</p>
<p>
Hot off the press ! <br />
The HPR stickers have been distributed to our Global distribution network in North America, Europe and Australia.<br />
For anyone else on this who wants them, now is the time to ask; before they all get handed out at the first couple of Linux fests. They're free as in beer btw.<br />
We're also sending stickers out to the other podcasters who promoted HPR in the past.
</p>

<h3>Audio Book Club</h3>
<P>
Several of the HPR contributors in the IRC channel have formed the beginning of an audio-book club. We'll be doing reviews which include spoilers, so I was wondering if you could announce our first audio-book title in case anyone wanted to listen to it before we spoiled it on them. We're hoping this will become a(n ir)regular show for HPR, but we'll see how the first one goes. All audio-books that we review will be free (as in beer) and easily available, so the barrier to entry for the listeners and participants will just be the time involved in listening to the audio. The first audio book is a short one. It runs about 3.5 hours total, and I can tell you it is a very good book which will appeal to both science fiction fans and political critics alike. 
</P>
<P>
The book is Badge Of Infamy by Lester Del Rey and read by Steven Wilson. It is available from podiobooks.com. The direct url is
<A HREF="http://www.podiobooks.com/title/badge-of-infamy">http://www.podiobooks.com/title/badge-of-infamy</A>.
</P>
<P>
From podiobooks.com: "Daniel Feldman was a doctor once. He made the mistake of saving a friend's life in violation of Medical Lobby rules. Now, he's a pariah, shunned by all, forbidden to touch another patient. But things are more loose on Mars. There, Doc Feldman is welcomed by the colonists, even as he's hunted by the authorities. But, when he discovers a Martian plague may soon wipe out humanity on two planets, the authorities begin hunting him for a different reason altogether."
</P>
<P>
We'll be announcing the next book at the end of our first show.
</P>


<h3>Site improvements</h3>
<UL>
<LI>Each hosts have their own folder ie: hackerpublicradio.org/droops/
<li>Vimeo Group http://vimeo.com/channels/hpr
<li>Site redesign more up-to-date looking.
<li>All comments and posts need a rel=nofollow tag on links.
<li>All the RSS feed needs to be put in the address bar
<li>Each episode title link should link to the individual show page
<li>A separate link/graphic should play the audio, maybe have a built in player and a download link.
<li>Each episode should have a unique url with the shows title in it, ie hackerpublicradio.org/geocaching_with_droops/ 
<li>We need more of a call to action about recording a show, its kinda hidden.
<li>The total comment viewer needs to link to the episode page, so that people can see all of the comments about the episode.
<li>A way to upload our episodes and automate everything.
<li>We also need the ability for the hosts to add episodes of hpr and other shows to a "Select" RSS feed. This way, when we find something super cool that someone else recorded, we can share it with the community.
</ul>

<h3>News from the Admin Channel</h3>
<p>HPR is been blocked by some companies because they can filter the find the word hacker - money well spent. During the spam fest, HPR got listed on sites as a source of malware. I've been contacting the sites but each blames the next one for the listing and the trail runs cold.

<P>I registered Hobby Public Radio but cPanel doesn't seem to have a way to have HackerPublicRadio and HobbyPublicRadio served from the same directory.</P>
<p>
<strong>Question: Off the shelf or Self Build ?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Can we make a HPR site using standard Wordpress plugins ?
  <ul>
  <li>User account management
  <li>Podcast plugins
  <li>Released according to a schedule 
  </ul>
<li>email from the server is broken through cPanel and this is delaying up automation 
<li>Any PHP programmers want to help
<li>Proposal to make droops, finux, klaatu admins
<li>Still no update on the Ice Cast server
</ul>

<h3>Syndicates Shows</h3>
<!--  -->
<p>
I'm running into some difficulties with how best to address syndicated shows and I'd appreciate your feedback.
</p>
<p>
The background is that I'm trying to specify scheduling rules (http://hackerpublicradio.org/calendar.php) trying to been fair to everyone but also with a view to automating the task. I've taken the view that shows produced for HPR will get priority in the schedule before syndicated shows. This brings up the question of what is a syndicated shows.
</p>
<p>
If a show is posted to a RSS feed before been posted to HPR then it would be considered to be a syndicated show. However we have had resubmission of a series that was on a podcast that faded so probably no one heard them. Are theses shows now syndicated or do I schedule them as HPR shows ?
</p>
<p>
We have also had submissions from a host that posts to the HPR FTP server and their own feed at the same time. Because of the delay in HPR scheduling they come out later than their own RSS feed. So are these also now syndicated ?
</p>
<p>
After hearing 635 Dismal Science:: Cloudy Predictions I was reminded that the speech <a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/events/2010/isoc-ny/FreedomInTheCloud-transcript.html">Freedom In the Cloud: Software Freedom, Privacy, and Security for Web 2.0 and Cloud Computing</a> by A Speech given by Eben Moglen at a meeting of the Internet Society's New York branch on Feb 5, 2010 would be ideal for HPR. Then Fifty OneFifty emailed to say "I noticed there hadn't been any recordings from LUG meetings in a while.  I thought you might want to ask for submissions where meetings or talks (from various fests) are already recorded." With the scheduling rules as they are at the moment, the syndicated don't ever get played.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Time critical</li>
<li>Scheduled Slots</li>
<li>New Hosts</li>
<li>HPR Content on a First in First Out basis.</li>
<li>Syndicated shows on a First in First Out basis.</li>
</ol>
<p>
On the other side I've had comments that the "Flood Gates" had been opened on the HPR feed.
</p>
<p>
So thinking about it I was thinking of reserving Tuesday and Thursday for syndicated shows, LUG talks, Speeches and the like.
<!-- We could even create a diet hpr feed that would exclude these shows. -->
