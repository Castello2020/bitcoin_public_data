I figured since there was not a topic already for people to post signatures / avatars / pics, that I would start one.When posting images, try and keep it somewhat small. I recommend somewhere around 300 hight, and 500 width.Feel free to comment on pictures, and carry out all kinds of nerdy nonsense.Since the CPanel for the forum profiles is currently being worked on and the update signature field is not working, I will probably be editing photos all the time and posting them. All feedback is welcome, honored, and respected.If anyone wants a copy of any picture I post big enough for a Screensaver (over 1,000 x 1,000) just let me know.Happy hacking,- NinjexRemoved by Ninjex for securityRemoved by Ninjex for securityRemoved by Ninjex for security

Nice, what editing tools are you using?For some reason I immediately thought about this

"all your base are belong to us" Never rolled with anyone, and not them xDIs that pic from thunder cats?? I used to love that show growing up!I am using Gimp for my image editing, it's fairly easy to use once you get the hang of it. This isn't the best, but photoshop released a older free version: Here

Here listen to this and enjoy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItugh-fFggI checked out aybabtu.com which took me strait to wiki earlier and I read on it. After I noticed that the pic link had sent had aybabtu in it. I noticed a lot of hackers running around throwing that slogan around, I had always precieved it as a group from the whole lulz sec / hb gary deal, among others. Funny part is the slogan is older than me, fuck I have a lot to learn / live for. Well maybe not so much live for, but to learn is priceless, and has no boundaries.

Here's my first shot at a image of my current sig:Made with Paint.NET.The image should update itself.For those who care, here are the steps that I took to get this image:Get a picture of some ones and zeros off the internet.Apply some low intensity noise.Add gradient overlay.Add text: 3vilp4wn + Do not mistake understanding for realization, and do not mistake realization for liberation. + happy hackingNot that great, but it's a good first try.
Do not mistake understanding for realization, and do not mistake realization for liberationEvil Ninja Hackers???٩(͡๏̯͡๏)۶1A4EAMboaXpgvUSmtRbVRqbfJrbyuGhyoo
