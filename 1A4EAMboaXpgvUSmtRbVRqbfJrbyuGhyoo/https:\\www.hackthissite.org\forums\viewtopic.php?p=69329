E-mail	Rasberry Pi

Anyone heard of the new rasberry pi computer recently released in the UK? It's a fully functioning computer that only consists of a circuit board the size of a credit card and costs from 25$ to 35$ (USD). It comes with a 700 mHz processor and 256 mb RAM. It's easy to configure it to run as a server 24/7.What do you guys think of it?http://www.raspberrypi.org/

Anyway, (according to him) they've downgraded the price of the 35$ one to 25$, or at least they did in the US. Also, I created a thread about this a while back:viewtopic.php?f=37&t=8347

Ah sorry, I had a feeling that we've talked about it before, but a few searches for 'rasberry' and 'rasberry pi' didn't bring anything up. Sorry.

I feel like I'm missing something pretty important. I bought a RPi and now have nothing to use it for as my main computer does everything I need it to. Guess I should have thought about some more stuff to do with it before buying it! Whoops NoviceBlackout	New User

Necroing because I recently did a lot of reading on up these and I'm ready to buy 3-4 of them; and nearly everyone who took interest is still here. Anyone get their hands on one of these yet?Project idea: Pocket WiFi MineWrite scripts to automate the process of the hack (aircrack-ng, etc). Alter casing on wireless adapter to also encase raspberry pi. Still want a small antenna. Use a mobile cell charger for power. Idea is to be able to walk around casually and crack wep. wpa/wpa2 handshakes would be stored so I could use dictionaries on them later since that in itself can be a lengthy process. Since I won't need to check the results until later I don't need to go full on cyborg and make a screen attachment for sunglasses and a keyboard attachment on my arm of some sort. Though that would cool too.http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqsAlso Cent: Raspberry-Pi-Supercomputer-Legos

Seriously though, my current PC has the same amount of RAM, and ~3x the processor speed.

The only thing that would need to be done is to make sure it's compatible with the ARM processor. I would love to undertake this project, as I have a love connection with low-level theory and OS modding. <3I haven't done much with it yet, but modding Damn Small Linux would be AWESOME! It seems as though DSL is for x86, but the RPi is ARM Perhaps Tiny Core Linux would be better? See here.I've also been looking at the RPi port of linux form scratch, PiLFS.I have 3 gripes about the RPi:1.) Text is very hard to read on non-HDMI screen. This can be fixed by making all text huge and bold.2.) Getting wireless is... Hard. You need a wifi dongle, and the cheapest one I found was ~$27, $8 less than the pi . Once I got the dongle, I plugged it in, and... The Pi freezes. great. I power cycle and try it again. Same thing. Turns out that I need a better power supply or a powered USB hub to use it .3.) If you plug in a USB while the Pi is on, the Pi reboots .All and all, an awesome little computer!
