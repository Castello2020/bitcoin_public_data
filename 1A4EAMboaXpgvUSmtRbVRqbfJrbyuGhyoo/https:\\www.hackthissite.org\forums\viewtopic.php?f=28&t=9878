Hey there.I'm curious about how long it'll take to crack a DES hash in John the Ripper. The hash that I'm testing it with is a "(Traditional DES [128/128 BS SSE2])" hash (according to JTR). I was unable to find recent info on how long it takes to crack a DES hash, most likely because DES is outdated. Here's what I've found so far:In 1999, it was *possible* to break a DES hash in 22 hours and 15 mins.DES is now considered insecure because a brute force attack is possible. As of 2008, the best analytical attack is linear cryptanalysis, which requires 243 known plaintexts and has a time complexity of 239–43.DES uses approximately 72 quadrillion possible keys.I'm starting to think the best solution is to give up...Thanks for any help you can give .
