I did it in Python as well Seemed to be the quickest tool for the job.

Hello. If you haven`t solved this mission, please do not read below. It might contain spoilers.This message is intended for the administrators of HTS.I found a very small bug in the wordlist.txt file. I didn't expect this mission to be this easy and I have tried many times to discover the encryption algorithm. While researching, I supposed that the scrambled and the unscrambled word have the same size, and so I found that there is only one word of length 9. Reloading the mission's page, I found the only scrambled word of length 9. Now the problem is that the encryption algorithm does not apply to this word(unscrambled word="phurivdli", scrambled word="0ng9ntiho"). For someone who solved this mission, it is obvious that this word does not follow the algorithm.I don`t know if it was intended that the wordlist.txt file contained this word, I just wanted to inform you about this. I also apologise if I wrote this message in the wrong place, I am new to HTS and I have no idea how to send PM.

It's just scrambling the words like an anagram...

Hey,I did this mission using Java and I was wondering what the code would look like in other languages.If you did it in a different language and want to swap codes or just don't mind showing me yours, please let me know.Thanks

E-mail	Programming 1 whats goin on ?
by xalastras on Sun Jul 21, 2013 11:51 am	([msg=76551]see Programming 1 whats goin on ?[/msg])
So , i tried to create a program in c++ [although im a c++ noob and i had to google search a lot]My general idea is this:*Open wordlist and a file with the scrabbled words in list.*give the first line of wordlist in a string array*check if the first character of the scrabbled word exists in the string array/ if yes, check if the next character is '/n' else check if the next character exists in the same string array with the previous . and this goes on inside a loop.if the character does not exist in the string array, then get the next line of the wordlist.next/ if yes check next and so onNow here is the point. When, after checking that all the characters of the first line in the scrabbled word lists exist in the same string array. and our last character is a new line "\n" character, then output the array as result [not 100% sure result though coz we havent checked if the wordlist line has the same length as the scrabbled word list line | but im gonna check this later]after this, im getting the next line of the scrabbled word list file and return @ the begging of the wordlist.txt at the same time.And now im doing the same for the 2nd .. the 3d... the 4th... the 5th word . etc. I dont know if this is a good idea. Even though i cant get it to work propably because of a lot of errors. But i would like sum more opinions . ThnxMoved

Am I the only one that solved this with Javascript? Edited: Let people figure it out on their own. Don't offer your code --LoGiCaL__
