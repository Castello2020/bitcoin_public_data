Reply	sherif says:	May 15, 2007 at 12:31 pm	United States has the same thing, only instead of tents we have trailers, and the people that live in them are called “white trash”. What are these hut-people called in Russia?
Reply	p1k3y says:	May 15, 2007 at 1:31 pm	Those houses are very rare. Only mongol look alike people use them in South of East Siberia. They dont have any special name. Those people prefer to live in their traditional houses. Not just because they are cheap.
Reply	Boris Abramov says:	May 16, 2007 at 6:47 am	Many white hut peoples in Moscow. Because huts are mobile, I never get tired of living on the same street. I like it much more than my old flat. Now when I get drunk and need to pee, I can just open my door and go.
Reply	Texas1 says:	May 16, 2007 at 9:27 am	You are so uncouth. At least go behind some bushes.
Reply	Pacific NW says:	May 15, 2007 at 3:27 pm	Yurts are popular with hippies and you can also rent them in certain campgrounds. Sherif is an ignorant to compare people living in a yurt with some beer-guzzling NASCAR reject and their trailor.
Reply	Delicious says:	May 15, 2007 at 12:36 pm	I have one of these. The acoustics are awesome. My DTS 7.1 surround sound systems sounds fantastic.
Reply	Pete says:	May 15, 2007 at 1:08 pm	THATS WHAT I AM TALKIN ABOUT!!!
Reply	Pete says:	May 15, 2007 at 12:46 pm	Yo slap a 40″ plasma tv and a hot tub and you will totally be pimpin!
Get one of those Russian Hummers to pull it and you will be popin bottles all over Siberia!
Reply	Chukchi Man says:	May 15, 2007 at 1:15 pm	AFAIK this houses named jurt, yurta — nomad’s tent – these days are being used for funerals, etc. as a tradition… OR in the remote/high mountains pastures…
Reply	pete says:	May 16, 2007 at 9:04 am	thanks for the info that is totally awesome that they still keep the tradition alive!
Reply	Boris Abramov says:	May 15, 2007 at 2:31 pm	I wonna live in one of those huts with Sarah and Texas1.
Reply	marc says:	May 15, 2007 at 4:06 pm	Texas 1, Sarah, and Boris … Now that’s a menage a trois!
Hey, if you two can lay off the vodka and the gay sex for a few minutes, check out the Communist Manifesto set to classic American cartoons.

Reply	Texas1 says:	May 15, 2007 at 9:39 pm	I’m sure that Boris will like the cartoon because it features Bullwinkle (Boris Abramov).
Reply	Boris Abramov says:	May 16, 2007 at 8:23 am	Everyone knows that you are Bullwinkle. Anyway, what is Bullwinkle? Which one in the cartoon is he?
Reply	Sickmind Fraud says:	May 25, 2007 at 8:20 pm	Bullwinkle is the cartoon moose seen at 5’19″ into the cartoon
Reply	Texas1 says:	May 15, 2007 at 9:38 pm	Puuuleezzz! I’ll be like king tut and stock mine full of naked Russian girls. You two can stop over for a few brews though.
Reply	Boris Abramov says:	May 16, 2007 at 8:26 am	I do girls as well you know! I only like Sarah because he looks like a girl Do you look like a Girl?
Reply	Texas1 says:	May 16, 2007 at 9:32 am	No, I look like a man. Do you have a sister that likes the sexy time?
Reply	Boris Abramov says:	May 16, 2007 at 9:55 am	Texas1, just because it’s acceptable in your family, doesn’t make it acceptable in mine. Speaking of sexy time, how is that sheep doing? Reply	Texas1 says:	May 16, 2007 at 5:53 pm	The sheep should be giving birth to your child any day now. I hope you will be a responsible father. Will your sister join my Russian herum?
Reply	Boris Abramov says:	May 17, 2007 at 3:19 am	I don’t have a sister. Will my brother do? Reply	Texas1 says:	May 17, 2007 at 8:39 am	Stop making it look like I am Bullwinkle by answering for me. Everyone knows that you are Bullwinkle!
Reply	eye says:	May 15, 2007 at 3:03 pm	Yurt is the origin of the English word ‘horde’. As the Mongols moved into Western Europe from the East, the West Europeans were terrified of the sweeping success of the Mongol warriors. Since the Yurts were a symbol of the army moving forward, the Westerners referred to the approaching Yurt which in their minds became the Horde.
Reply	Pacific NW says:	May 15, 2007 at 3:33 pm	It’s too bad Cheetahs may become extinct because of the opulants that kept them as pets and forced inbreeding upon them.
Reply	Pacific NW says:	May 18, 2007 at 1:00 pm	Yes, I know all about the population bottle-neck. It was caused by opulants that kept cheetahs as pets and hunting animals. Now, members of their species are so genetically similiar that one could take a skin graft from a one cheetah and apply it to another with no rejection whatsoever. Try that with a housecat.
Reply	Bullwinkle says:	May 15, 2007 at 3:36 pm	What kind of plumbing facilities do these have?
Reply	Bullwinkle says:	May 15, 2007 at 5:58 pm	This sounds more like Afghanistan style housing.
Reply	Bullwinkle says:	May 15, 2007 at 5:59 pm	Texas? I live in England.
Reply	Pacific NW says:	May 15, 2007 at 6:15 pm	Enland is creepy.
Reply	Washington says:	May 16, 2007 at 7:52 am	Texas1, you are about as English as George Bush is intelligent. lol
Reply	Chingau Wei says:	May 15, 2007 at 4:07 pm	I like these little things and they look extremely cheap and easy to build. I wonder if anyone has considered starting a project to house the homeless in these things?
Reply	TexasTriangle says:	May 15, 2007 at 4:08 pm	actually these “huts on wheels” your talking about originated during the Qin Empire in China many many years ago…
Reply	R. Sieben says:	May 15, 2007 at 9:01 pm	Nothing wrong living in a yurt. Not to far from where I live there is an acreage with a yurt residence. As building costs and real estate became prohibitive, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a yurt community in Canada.
Reply	Etienne says:	May 16, 2007 at 6:53 am	Learn to read: he said “in Canada”. As far as i know, trailer parks are way more common in the US. I guess the great canadian weather has something to do about it.
Reply	rusominimo says:	May 16, 2007 at 3:02 am	Hey there! In Madrid we have the same problem, the houses are too expensive…..this yurtas are very nice, look at the inside paintings of the door.
I really like your blog!! I´v started a blog with “minimal” russian language classes, and I´ll post your blog into it for my listeners, is that ok?
Paká!
Reply	Doug says:	May 16, 2007 at 3:30 am	I remember reading in a college anthropology class many years ago that cultures with round houses also have a higher incidence of insanity. This same thing holds true for people who lived in round houses in the West or worked in a facility that had round walls. I do not know if this was ever disproven.
Reply	Bullwinkle says:	May 16, 2007 at 5:13 am	In Russia one must also take into account all of the inbreeding.
Reply	Washington says:	May 16, 2007 at 7:49 am	In Russia? Come on now, you know a well as I do “Inbreeding” is all the rage in rural south, especially Texas – you should know!
Reply	Pacific NW says:	May 16, 2007 at 11:01 am	Just look at Jerry Lee Lewis, he married his 14 year old cousin (Which was legal throughout the southern states). Texans and southerners not in the media spolight behave even worse.

Reply	Boris Abramov says:	May 16, 2007 at 11:08 am	I don’t drink, I have enough money and I’m certainly not a comrade lol Reply	redwhite&blue says:	May 16, 2007 at 11:40 am	are you a new breed of counter-culture Russian? Like those hippies who don’t eat meat?
Reply	Boris Abramov says:	May 16, 2007 at 2:18 pm	YES Reply	redwhite&blue says:	May 16, 2007 at 2:33 pm	go to Estonia you fake Russian.
Reply	Boris Abramov says:	May 16, 2007 at 2:41 pm	Ok Reply	Boris Abramov says:	May 16, 2007 at 2:47 pm	But make shure they don’t put me in a gas chamber or burn me alive. It funny how they brought all the Soviet “criminals” to “justice” but havn’t brought “ONE” Nazi criminal before the law.
Reply	RedWhite&Blue says:	May 16, 2007 at 4:07 pm	What are you talking about? The biggest Soviet criminal is the president. HEIL PUTIN! Boris, you would sell your mother out to Putin wouldn’t you? You little Hitler Youth.
Reply	Boris Abramov says:	May 16, 2007 at 4:44 pm	Oh I know why, becuse all the remaining nazis are now in Estonian governmemt. Why should they prosecute one of their own? BTW, my grandfather and pleny other Jewish friends who he knew, were killed in the gas chambers similer to those that Estonian “freedom fighters” helped to build for Nazi Germany.
You think you’ve done Jewish comunity a great favor for allowing the First ever synagogue to be build after the Holocaust? – YOU HAVE NOT! Jewish comunity will NEVER forget all the atrocities committed by Estonia, until the perpetrators are brought to justice and there will be a public apology from the Estonian government!
Go night my Nazi friend, have nice dreams..
Reply	RedWhite&Blue says:	May 16, 2007 at 5:55 pm	What are you talking about? The holocaust never happened. Don’t you read any Aryan newspapers? I’m sure you would know since you live in Russia. There are tons of neo-nazis there. Who are you preaching to btw? If memory serves me correctly, I haven’t said anything racist. Btw, Orthodox Jews have their fingers deep into Nazi Putins pockets. I suggest reading this weeks NYTimes article on it. In Soviet Russia, apology comes from you!

Boris Abramov says:	May 17, 2007 at 9:44 am	No! I refuse to believe! I cannot believe that Texas1 could have so much hate towards Jewish people. Texas1, please tell me – you didn’t make these awful comments.
redwhite&blue says:	May 17, 2007 at 10:15 am	Boris! I assure you that texas1 and I are not the same. Have faith, buddy! Let’s not start another cold war! I am not an anti-semite or a racist (don’t know about texas1 tho) I don’t know how anyone got that idea. Please don’t sully my good reputation by saying that I am texas1!!! God Bless!

redwhite&blue says:	May 17, 2007 at 7:52 am	there are Jews in Russia. However, a lot of them left for Israel after the Cold War. I see a lot of them immigrating to the US as well.

Yerts are awesome! I would like to live in a yert!
Reply	Doug says:	May 16, 2007 at 2:03 pm	Not to change the subject off of personal insults and vendettas, but do these people ever roll up their houses and put them in a washing machine?
Reply	redwhite&blue says:	May 16, 2007 at 2:31 pm	due to the constant presence of vodka inside and near the huts, no cleaning is necessary. the fumes act as a sterilizing agent.

Reply	RedWhite&Blue says:	May 16, 2007 at 6:44 pm	Good thing there is no rules on Vice Presidency. I hope McCain wins this one and sends Obama packing back to boarding school. Cheney can run the country again through McCain. Why do you hate America, John from Kansas? Don’t you love God? God loves you.
Reply	John from Kansas says:	May 16, 2007 at 7:19 pm	Cheney is President, and I have no doubt that Cheney would run the country through McCain. I have no problem with America, only the phony patriots who are destroying us with greed and coruption. God feels the same way.
Reply	Noggin says:	May 17, 2007 at 10:40 am	America despises Bush and Cheney and the repiglican party has commited political suicide by having Bush as its head honcho

Reply	Boris Abramov says:	May 17, 2007 at 11:40 am	Lets hope american people will be smarter this time. Just a tip; – keep redncks as far as possible form the ballot papers.
Reply	redwhite&blue says:	May 17, 2007 at 1:03 pm	Unlike Soviet Russia, we allow all citizens the equal opportunity to vote in the US.

Although Kazakhstan a glorious country, it have a problem, too: economic, social and Jew.
I don’t even live in TX. If I did I would have a name like texas1. I was being sarcastic about the holocaust. I’m not dat unedumacated.
Reply	Washington says:	May 17, 2007 at 1:37 pm	No you not “unedumacated” you are just uneducated. Boris do not don’t steep to his level, he belongs in the zoo.
redwhite&blue says:	May 17, 2007 at 2:03 pm	You’re exactly right, Washington. I am ignorant because of the way I was raised. If I was in a more diverse environment, I would not have turned out this way. Unfortunately for you, I was raised in a zoo. My parents were monkeys.
John from Kansas says:	May 17, 2007 at 4:55 pm	But you said you would rig the voting machines to favor the facists. How is that allowing all citizens the equal opportunity to vote?
Reply	John from Kansas says:	May 18, 2007 at 2:22 am	You have defined yourself rather well. What you believe to be sophisticated humor is just sneering, caustic remarks.

Apparently, we are bad. damn liberals.
#2. I wouldn’t be in Baghdad because we can just get young kids who are easily manipulated into fighting for us. Nothing like a squeeze on oil to squeeze the economy! Let me tell, securities/commodities manipulation, even after lawsuits, still pays! Look at US judges and their conservative rulings. Unfortunately, I am on the plaintiffs side.

I know, we would all feel sorry for him, only if he wasn’t a sick racist as well as smelly trailer trash!

I think it is hilarious that people think we are the same. Boris, you didn’t answer texas1′s question though… Is she ready for the sexy time???
Boris: This is Sarah. She is my sister. She is number-four prostitute in whole of Russia.
Reply	Washington says:	May 17, 2007 at 1:32 pm	Boris really, for a Jew you seem to be a bit naive. Just look at the time sequence, language and the general objective of the comments made by Bullwinkle and redwhite&blue. Texas1 IS Bullwinkle and redwhite&blue.
He used these names to express his true HATEFUL RACIST opinions! If I were Jewish, I would be truly offended.
Reply	Boris Abramov says:	May 17, 2007 at 4:38 pm	I am offended. And it just proves that my preconseptions about Texas1 and rednecks in general were right. I guess I was a bit naive..
Reply	Texas1 says:	May 17, 2007 at 4:50 pm	Boris, I am offended that you don’t believe me. C’mon, does this person even write like me? You should know my writing style by now. Also, I think this person posted a few weeks back in a post section and I told him to get lost then. Usually, I don’t attack anyone without first being attacked. In addition, I’ve always included enough absurdities that a normal could not possibly take my comments seriously.
Anyway, I have suggested to methods to show that this person isn’t me. So either provide some proof that it is me or stop blaming me.
Reply	John from Kansas says:	May 19, 2007 at 5:53 pm	The proof is in your comments. Would you care for some crow?
Reply	Texas1 says:	May 17, 2007 at 4:40 pm	No! I would never make such comments. You run this site. Look at the IP’s and do a trace. My guess is that they aren’t even from Texas.

Reply	John from Kansas says:	May 17, 2007 at 6:16 pm	But everyone likes yours? Get real.
Reply	Texas1 says:	May 17, 2007 at 7:26 pm	People like my comments more than they like yours. You bore the hell out of people.

Reply	Washingotn says:	May 17, 2007 at 3:37 pm	You sound like a rally naive little boy who watched far too much Fox news. You have never been in Russia, have you?
Ok, why does Russia under Putin keeps “Falling and Falling”?
As far as I’m concerned the avarage salary keeps on increasing and increasing, GDP per capital has increased dramatically form the Yeltsin years, foreign investments are increasing every day, russians are much happier under Putin then they ever were under Yeltsin, mafia and corruption of the 90′s haS virtually disappeared, Russians are enjoying foreign holidays, foreign cars, fashion, etc, russian people can start up enterprises without the fear of the mafia and the need to pay protection rackets. Also, if you have some initial capital there are great undiscovered business opportunities.
Honestly man, if you go to Moscow or St.Petersburg you will see the bigest amount of luxury cars, apartments, designer shops you ever seen in any city of the world. Modern russia is not about Putin of fake western democracy, it’s about MONEY MONEY AND MORE MONEY! If you have a brain in moderen russia, you will go very far, and that’s what I like about this unique country.
I suggest, you finish school, ask your dad for some money and go see what russia is realy like, and speak to some people before making totally groundless and childish comments.
Don’t forget to finish your homework – its bedtime soon!

Reply	Texas1 says:	May 17, 2007 at 5:11 pm	I think it is Borris/Pacific NW/John from Kansas and FAO. He couldn’t find anything new and interesting to post so he decided to create this drama.
Reply	John from Kansas says:	May 17, 2007 at 6:32 pm	No drama ‘ere m8, just holding you accountable for your own comments.
Reply	Texas1 says:	May 17, 2007 at 7:25 pm	Everyone on here hates you John. Why don’t you do us all a favor and slit your wrists.
Reply	John from Kansas says:	May 17, 2007 at 7:59 pm	Hey man, take it easy. Have a shot of vodka and get some rest.
Reply	Boris Abramov says:	May 18, 2007 at 1:16 am	Who is everyone – you, you and you?
Reply	Texas1 says:	May 17, 2007 at 7:46 pm	Please dont forget distribute my photo http://img515.imageshack.us/my.php?image=tmp2080an0.jpg
Reply	John from Kansas says:	May 17, 2007 at 8:05 pm	You can distribute your photo tomorrow. You are tired and need some rest. Have you poured that shot yet?
Reply	Texas1 says:	May 17, 2007 at 9:34 pm	John, quit having sex with sheep!

Reply	wstm says:	July 12, 2007 at 4:40 pm	They are probably Yakut Turks of Sakha Republic, North-East Russia… These yurts were so common. Many Central Asiatic nomad nations (Turks, Mongolians and others) used them in past…
Reply	Zinn says:	July 28, 2007 at 11:13 am	You are totally wrong here. These pictures are taken in the capital city of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar.

Reply	Rutana Laurel And Hardy Shirts says:	July 17, 2010 at 5:38 am	Once your business is launched it is only a matter of imagination as to how far you can go! If you need money now, like I mean in the next hour, try what I did.
