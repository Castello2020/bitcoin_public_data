Reply	Gerry says:	March 5, 2012 at 10:37 pm	There are various agencies in Ukraine that offer excursions to Pripyat. And recently the Ukrainian state wants to take control of this dark tourist business (seems they smelled lots of money and want to get some good share).
Reply	Nectar says:	March 6, 2012 at 5:03 am	Is it not possible to visit other abandoned cities in and around the zone without any shepard? I dont know how much of the zone is guarded, yet i saw on google maps still tons of abandoned towns apart from Pripyat standing.
Reply	Alan says:	March 5, 2012 at 9:25 pm	It is really sad to see the abandoned city that used to be a great city. How did or can you get a permit to enter Pripyat?
Reply	TRatio says:	March 6, 2012 at 5:49 am	You need to go with a tour guide. I don’t think you’re allowed to just wander around on your own.
Reply	Augis says:	March 6, 2012 at 2:54 am	I think this whole city should be turned into museum.
Reply	Buddyben says:	March 6, 2012 at 10:08 am	Pripyat is well rendered in video games such as Modern Warfare 2. However wanting to visit that only 30 years after the fact is crazy. I wouldn’t even go near there unless 70-100 years have passed. The radiation there is still harmful. Do what you feel you must.
Reply	West-Europe says:	September 8, 2012 at 4:21 am	Its true, its still harmful. But the amount of radiation is far off being harmful if you dont go near the powerplant itself.
Reply	xoen says:	March 7, 2012 at 10:32 am	f modern warfare, go S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
Reply	Mercal says:	March 11, 2012 at 3:24 pm	All brought by Communism and the non-value of human life.
Reply	Jozef says:	March 14, 2012 at 11:37 pm	Tours to Pripyat have been banned
Reply	javox says:	March 28, 2012 at 6:43 am	so sad how did end this….if this wouldnt happen im sure now a day it would still up the communist´s machine….was designed very futurist…i love it…well done
Reply	BringBackSovietUnion says:	August 9, 2012 at 11:52 pm	A nuclear plant was indeed a mistake, later learned the hard way and Russia never again build another one.
That plant needs to be removed, it’s still in danger of exploding. If it explodes, it will be 4X much worse than reactor number 4.
Reply	mark a clark says:	August 23, 2013 at 6:36 pm	“All brought by Communism and the non-value of human life” yea right mercal, kind of like TMI and what it came very close to being. if any system devalues human live it’s the corrupt, mostly unregulated, type of american capitalism that people like mitt romney love. yesterday a man was sentenced to 35 yrs for trying to inform the american people of the atrocities of it’s government and will serve more time in prison than some “heroes” that murdered women and children in iraq. how’s that for valuing human life?
Reply	javox says:	October 30, 2013 at 7:27 am	well said…yup…gosh mercal is so annoy sometimes =)
