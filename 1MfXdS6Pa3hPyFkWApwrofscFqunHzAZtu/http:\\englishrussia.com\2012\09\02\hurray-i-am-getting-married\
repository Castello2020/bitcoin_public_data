What reasons made this girl get married? Unexpected pregnancy? Rich husband and no love? The whole story may stay behind her face.
Hey, babe, give us a single smile on the happiest day of your life!
Maybe we just haven’t seen her “unhappy” face yet?

Reply	skopeil says:	September 3, 2012 at 12:20 am	she’s been force to married that man…he look so happy though
Reply	Tiger says:	September 14, 2012 at 6:56 am	maybe he cheated on her during the stag party and she knows it – thats why he looks so happy and relaxed and gives a shyte about her bad mood Reply	Sasha says:	September 3, 2012 at 12:38 am	Maybe she is one of those kidnap brides from the South?
Or without Jaguar for 4 hours….
Reply	TrulyRestlessSoul says:	September 3, 2012 at 1:09 am	Life’s too short to get married
Reply	Gerry says:	September 3, 2012 at 1:57 am	He doesn’t look like a rich guy (unless they are from some remote village that the “rich guy” is the only man there who owns a Lada) and if there was pregnancy at least she should have a liiitle sympathy for him. So little just to draw a fake smile. All these people who spend their lives digging vk and facebook for such photos can inform us about the rest of the story.
Reply	JimBeam says:	September 3, 2012 at 2:13 am	I found the reason: Wedding day on photo is 29/04/2011, Royal wedding day of Prince William. So probably she’s sad that she lost her beloved price forever and she has to settle for a villager instead. Anyway sweetie, if you think your wedding was a failure, I’m sure lot of nice guys reading this forum could gladly give you a second chance!

Reply	Sasha says:	September 3, 2012 at 11:53 pm	Dentists made a fortune. Now everyone is a dentist and the competition is so strong that you won’t make much money at all.
Reply	Tiger says:	September 14, 2012 at 6:53 am	The dentist bubble is about to explode…and then there will be a big chattering of teeth when it bursts…
Reply	(r)evolutionist says:	September 3, 2012 at 6:56 am	Maybe they’re ideological opposites. (a true horror)
Reply	Mark says:	September 3, 2012 at 8:24 am	I’m saying it all has something to do with the party the night before…
Reply	Jeebs says:	September 3, 2012 at 8:54 am	100 bucks she makes a run for America the first chance she gets ha ha ha
Reply	JP says:	September 4, 2012 at 8:11 am	No thanks, we don’t want her.
Reply	Jordan says:	September 3, 2012 at 10:06 am	Maybe she’s hung over?
Reply	Richard S. says:	September 3, 2012 at 12:24 pm	A forced arranged marriage?
Reply	spiderplant says:	September 3, 2012 at 1:25 pm	no 29/4/11 she was in tune with the lunar cycle. which controls all moods of half the population across our planet. The moon beams and moon gravity stopped her from smiling!
Reply	hugo says:	September 3, 2012 at 2:00 pm	She is not pretty enough to complain.
Reply	Fred Johnson says:	September 3, 2012 at 2:01 pm	Awww….. they’re gonna be SO happy!!!
Either she’s drunk, or this is another arranged marriage, or otherwise forced into it.
I hope they don’t live in an apartment with thin walls, their neighbors will NEVER get any sleep with them screaming and yelling and throwing things.
Reply	econobiker says:	September 26, 2012 at 12:18 am	I say she is drunk
Reply	René says:	September 4, 2012 at 3:36 pm	The grandmom in purple coat has distinctive Eastern Asian physical features, if that’s really the grand mom.
