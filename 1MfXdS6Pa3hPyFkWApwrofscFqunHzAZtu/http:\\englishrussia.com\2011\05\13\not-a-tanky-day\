Posted on May 13, 2011 by With all this parade stuff and tons of troops marching across one event left unnoticed at one of the post Soviet space capitals. In Kirgizia they upend the tank. Watch.
What a shame, huh?! A tank that passed all the WW2 obstacles got overturned on the flat surface of modern paved city roads.
“It was a very slipper road”, – commented the commander.

Reply	testicules says:	May 16, 2011 at 10:43 am	I smell vodka. I think I posted the same comment last year when the tank overturned.

Reply	L.S.Zlatopolsky says:	May 14, 2011 at 4:34 am	Or a Polish worker-intellectual… Reply	Boritz says:	May 14, 2011 at 5:57 am	T-34 has quirky steerage mechanism. Sometimes, it is difficult to stop the turning. Looks like that is what happened here while loading.
