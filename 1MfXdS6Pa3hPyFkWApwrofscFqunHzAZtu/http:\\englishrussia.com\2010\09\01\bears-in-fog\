Lake Kambalnoye is situated in the Yuzhno-Kamchtsky Federal wildfire preserve, in the south of Kamchatka, somewhere between Kambalny volcano and cape Lopatka. These places are known in Russia as the bad weather record breakers. But those who love nature and are eager to see these amazing creatures, come here despite the adverse weather. And they are rewarded indeed as they may take such great photos.
