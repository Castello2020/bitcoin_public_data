Reply	Murka says:	January 13, 2012 at 10:31 pm	How long a russian man serve in army?
and how much they receive the payment?
Reply	ayaa says:	January 14, 2012 at 12:20 am	One year mandatory service. After that you can stay as long as you want till you’re 60.
The payment depends.
Reply	YJ says:	January 14, 2012 at 12:56 am	Much more orderly than the Dags.
Reply	Matlok says:	January 14, 2012 at 7:53 am	Someone please tell me what the food was on the plates. Obviously, the bread, butter, and hard boiled egg,are easy enough for me to recognize, but what about the other stuff? Looks like pretty decent chow, and there is plenty of it. Has food service in the Russian military been privatized to civilian contractors?
Reply	ayaa says:	January 15, 2012 at 1:00 am	Yes. Previously conscripts did everything, from the cooking to serving. They also did all the cleaning and all the “menial” tasks. Now, everything is being delegated to civilians, leaving the troops time to train, instead of having to scrub the latrines.

Reply	A.Oscar says:	January 14, 2012 at 1:02 pm	I have looking into your magazine English Russia many times: but I’m sure not be manipulated from what have seen. But when I was a teenager: without any politics involved, I admire Russia: because most of times, many countries like Mongolia, France, Germany try conquered Russia, and never succeed at all. USA always want to demolish your people, because since the time came independent, just born to be aggressive, and not win one war. But still thinking is de best army in the world. But Special brigade’s Russian has: must be proud and the conditions the treatment, make them more Patriotic. Something else: Russia continue to be, the bigger country in the world, from that point , not that easy to be conquer, at the same time your country could have another 100.000.000 one hundred million more people, star to think about that, and accept emigration of good skilled people from many countries. Special now: take advantage of so many problems the world having, and developed industry, agriculture and go further, because with more people and the resources Russia have, even China cannot try put foot in. During summer Siberia could be developed into growing grain ship to supply the world. Canada have a country just about like Russia, and only on the summer, grows any kind of grain to sell too many countries. Russia could have mines of any kind of metals .I even love your gorgeous women: if could be possible I will marry one. Do all of you know in Portugal when we seeing a blonde we call Russa? I may one day go there and show something so special: which until now stay reserved for Russians Cosmonauts, discover by me some years ago, and stayed until now been mention about it. I’m not jock: and it’s through no lies! Somebody could write to me I live in Portugal and I’m Portuguese. A.Oscar
Reply	ayaa says:	January 15, 2012 at 1:02 am	I got what you said. But could you put some spaces next time. It makes for a easier read.
Reply	ayaa says:	January 15, 2012 at 1:05 am	So in Portugal there are no blondes? I must see this for myself.
Reply	Pedro Silva says:	January 15, 2012 at 5:46 am	Dás um belo exemplo do nosso país. Devias mas é tar calado e não dizer merdas.
Sorry for Oscar but he’s a tard. But yes there’s just a few ones indeed. Like 5%. And no we don’t associate blonds with russia. Way more associated with northern europe where most tourists come from because most of them are blonds. But that’s not a problem since our brunettes are gorgeous. Pedro from Portugal.
Reply	OldBikr says:	January 15, 2012 at 5:19 pm	I think dark haired women are better looking, for the most part, than blondes. I am somewhat more fond of reddish brown hair though, like in Scotland.
Reply	OldBikr says:	January 15, 2012 at 5:26 pm	You might consider a re-read of history before you extend too many opinions pardner.
Try to remember who started ALL of the wars of conquest in Europe. Review which leaders wanted to actually rule the World and where they actually were from. Remember, prior to WWI the USA was not in the least interested in World politics, kindly remember why the USA entered those politics friend.
Try to remember why there was a WWII while you are at it too, I am referring to the policies of France at the end of WWI that resulted in the rise of Schikelgruber aka Hitler.
In view of these simple historical FACTS, the situation Greece finds itself in takes on a new piquancy. Those that refuse to learn history are doomed to repeat it.
Reply	René De Beaumarchais says:	January 15, 2012 at 4:11 pm	Are hazing deaths media-exaggerated in the Russian army?
Reply	ayaa says:	January 15, 2012 at 6:35 pm	Not quite. It’s more like there isn’t enough media coverage.
Reply	shovel head says:	September 6, 2012 at 2:24 pm	During expeditions food is cooked by military specialists…this consists of opening cans and heating the contents Reply	Leave a Reply
