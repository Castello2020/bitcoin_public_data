This app will give you a quick overview of the current time in the 4 commonly used timezones in America. &lt;br&gt;No need to get out your clunky world clock and having to manually set your desired location, simply open up US Timer and in a single glance get all the information you need.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This app was made on request for a Reddit user who had very few feature requests. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.</description></item><item><title>Crypto Dice Suite</title><link>http://www.appbrain.com/app/crypto-dice-suite/gridlockdev.dicesuite</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.appbrain.com/app/crypto-dice-suite/gridlockdev.dicesuite</guid><comments>http://www.appbrain.com/app/crypto-dice-suite/gridlockdev.dicesuite#comments</comments><pubDate>Fri, 27 Dec 2013 02:35:36 +0000</pubDate><description>This app allows you to check up on the current affairs of Just-Dice and Doge-Dice in near real-time.&lt;br&gt;Every 5 minutes, the various charts are updated with the newest info straight from the respective APIs for Just-Dice and Doge-Coin.
