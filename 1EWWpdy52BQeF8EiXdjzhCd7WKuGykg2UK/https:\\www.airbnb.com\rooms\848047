The hosts were fantastic - just the right mix of sociability and privacy. The room was perfect, and it's true, as stated, that the bed was very comfortable. I had enough space for my needs. I loved the location - a great residential area near two parks, shopping, and easy tube access.
Expect great coffee and fresh baked goods in the morning and a beautiful garden behind the house where you can pick strawberries to go with your breakfast.
The hosts were helpful with everything I asked, from directions, advise on the best airport, places to go, and anything else I needed.

Juergen and Sabine are wonderfull hosts, always ready to help and give advise about London discoveriing. I felt myself absolutly free. The house is well equiped and situated at the fine district with victorian houses, 8 min from overground station. The room is nice and very suitable for the person travalling alone. Thank you!

I could not have asked for a better location or a host. Juergen was highly professional in ensuring that I had all the instructions to get to his place from Gatwick. He was very welcoming and offered my a cup of coffee (of the highest quality). The house is very quaint and I felt instantly at home. It was as though I was staying with an old friend. My room was spotless and the facilities for cooking etc were fantastic. I slept very well and comfortably. Juergen is a tremendous host - he offered his bicycle one morning and I followed him to visit another German chappie who makes German bread and drives all the way to Windsor. It was a wonderful insight into this quaint area near Forest Hill. there is a nature reserve on Jurgen's doorstep full of birds, foxes and a couple of great cats that look like miniature snow leopards. Getting to and from London's city centre was simple and the overground station was a ten minute walk. Great restaurants and pubs nearby. The greatest value of this place (other than Jurgen himself), was how quiet the neighbourhood was. When I was staying there, there was a tube strike and Juergen and his lovely partner Sabine went out of their way to arrange a cab for me to get to the airport. All in all, my stay was memorable having sampled Juergen's cakes and passion for culinary gadgets - from a coffee maker, to a machine that makes you a meal in minutes. I don't think Juergen lacks any kitchen gadget. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Juergen and Sabine for making me feel part of your home.

We enjoyed our stay with Juergen and Sabine. The room was warm, quiet and comfortable, the bathroom spotlessly clean and the kitchen facilities very good particularly the coffee machine. There is a lovely sunny garden in which to enjoy breakfast. Juergen and Sabine are friendly and helpful hosts, have good recommendations about the local shops pubs and restaurants, and also bake delicious cakes. Rail and bus transport is easily accessible. Thanks again Lindsay and Chris.

My stay here was wonderful, I stayed for 2 weeks and it was very comfortable and enjoyable.
Juergen and Sabine were such lovely hosts and i'm sure I will see them again soon!
The house is clean and tidy and the room is great to stay in with a comfy bed and plenty on storage for my baggage after my flight from Australia.
They were very helpful with getting around London and knew a lot about the different area's as I was looking for a place to rent while staying there.
Also just to add, the internet is fast, the coffee machine is great and the backyard is so nice to sit out and relax.
I highly recommend it to anyone who is considering staying here :)

Excellent séjour ! Je suis allé chez Juergen et Sabine dans le but d'améliorer mon anglais, j'ai découvert des gens très accueillants et très ouverts avec qui j'ai pu avoir de nombreuses et intéressantes conversations, notamment avec Juergen qui est souvent présent. De plus, la maison est agréable, calme et propre. Seule petite chose qu'il faut savoir, il y a d'épais rideaux dans la chambre mais pas de volets. J'ai vraiment passé un agréable séjour à Londres en compagnie de Juergen et Sabine. Je recommande cette "quiet room". Merci de m'avoir accueilli ! February 2014

Juergen and Sabine are friendly and welcoming hosts - I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in their Honor Oak house. The room is clean and comfortable - bathroom immaculate. Short walk to the station and nice restaurants/bars.

Juergen and Sabine are wonderful hosts and I would be more than happy to stay with them again. Nothing seems too much trouble, and I really enjoyed talking with such nice, friendly people. The room is adequately sized, and the house has everything you could ever need for a short stay.
Thank you for your excellent service!

I enjoyed my stay at Juergen & Sabine's place and had virtually the whole place to myself for the first 3 days of my 6 day stay. The guys (Juergen and Sabine) are really wonderful people and it was a wonderful experience for me - using Airbnb for the first time.

I had the most comfortable stay at Juergen and Sabine's lovely home. They are truly the most welcoming hosts, in addition to being two of the nicest people I've met. The room has everything required for a pleasant stay, while the washroom and kitchen are well equipped and always clean. The house is within walking distance of restaurants, a grocery store, and the London overground. I enjoyed my stay there and will definitely book with them again while visiting London :)

This was my first time with Airbnb, and Juergen and Sabine made it memorable !
They are a very friendly couple who make you feel at home as soon as you cross the doorstep. They are ready for any queries you may have and give you tips during your whole stay. They own a peaceful house in a verdant and quiet neighbourhood which is ideal for resting after sightseeing in London. Every room is tidy and clean : the sheets, the towels are just waiting for you. And the matresses, oh !, just what your body needs to forget an all day walking in the capital.
I highly recommend their house to whoever is looking for a nice place with kind hosts. I keep their address in my address book!

Accueil chaleureux. Petite chambre agréable donnant sur le jardin. Quartier avec peu de commodités et situé un peu loin du centre de Londres

Juergen and Sabine are very friendly and hospitable people. They always gave us advises where to go. They have cosy, tidy and spacious house. We spend a lot of time in their wonderful English backyard. The neighbourhood is safe and quiet. We really enjoy to spend time there. There are some bars, shops and Overground station in 5 min from the house. Thank you for your host and we recommend everyone this kind place to stay.

非常开心在伦敦的这次旅行住在Juergen和Sabine家！他们是非常热心及有责任心的host。我和朋友fanny在伦敦的日程很赶，每天早出晚归，他们给我们很大的自由空间，还有很多很好的出行建议。在家的日子，我们相处得非常愉快，一起聊天，做好吃的，骑自行车…很开心的时光。Juergen和Sabind家安静舒适，浴室很大，各种生活用具齐全，住得很舒服。下次来伦敦，一定会继续住这里，推荐给朋友们！

Sabine and Jürgen are very open-minded and friendly people. They created a warm and welcoming atmosphere in their house. They treated us as friends what I really appreciated. The neighbourhood is quiet and calm. The house is approx. 6 minutes away from Honor Oak Park Station from where you can reach the city centre in 15 minutes either you take the train or the overground...so it is a fantastic location.
Needless to say more, I gladly recommend it!

It was a pleasure to stay one month at Sabine and Juergen's home. They are lovely hosts, always ready to help and give us advise. Our room was perfect for a couple with a view on a lovely garden where is possible have breakfast and take the sun and the beds are very comfortable. The neighbourhood is safe. Thank you for all, for your kindness and to help us to try to speak in english. May 2014

My friend and I are two girls from Taiwan and the first time to London. Juergen and Sabine were very good hosts. Actually we had busy schedule in London, always went out early and came back late. They didn't mind we came back home late and gave us such freedom to arrange our time by ourselves. Their house located in a very quiet neighborhood, near the overground station and pretty safe. There was a beautiful yard in their home, a really beautiful view from our room and kitchen. Most of all, Juergen and Sabine were very nice and kind. We caught a cold when the third day in London, they provided relief powders to make us feel more comfortable and gave us concerns all the time. We were so lucky to have a comfortable, relax and warm house to stay in London. Recommend everyone can have a good trip with them.

Wir können das B&B von Jürgen und Sabine wärmstens empfehlen: Ruhig, sauber, sehr freundliche Hosts, verkehrstechnisch gut gelegen, mit einem herrlichen Garten zum Frühstücken und relaxen. Bei unserem nächsten Besuch in London, wählen wir gerne wieder dieses B&B. Christoph und Christin

Juergen and Sabine were very forthcoming. We didn't see them much because we spent most of our time with our son's family nearby. The room is indeed very quiet and comfortable, and next to the bathroom. It was no problem to park our car in front of the house.

I have known Juergen and Sabine for more than 8 years and both of them are very nice and easy going. We go to London every year and stay at their place. It is a really nice and clean house. Not to mention the big guest room overlooking the garden and nature reserve, which is nice to wake up and look outside into a green area with lots of flowers in their garden. February 2013
