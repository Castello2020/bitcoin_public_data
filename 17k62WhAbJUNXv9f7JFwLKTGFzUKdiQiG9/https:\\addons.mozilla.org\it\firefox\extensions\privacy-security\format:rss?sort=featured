TinyURL Generator is now hosted at &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/29515ece96139c59debab1fa454da586421501f23d56059177ccda1d394d2ea6/http%3A//code.google.com/p/tinyurl-generator/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://code.google.com/p/tinyurl-generator/&lt;/a&gt;. If you would like to contribute by helping with code or reporting bugs please use that site.

This add-on allows you to generate a TinyURL for the page you are currently viewing in the background. The URL created is then copied into your clipboard so that it can be pasted into e-mails or IM messages instantly.
You can choose to create a direct link, or one that allows the recipient to preview the link before visiting it.

The add-on also expands any TinyURLs it finds while you are browsing the web to show you where they are going to take you, giving you more confidence to click.

== Usage == 
There are several ways to generate TinyURLs:
 1. Simply click the icon in the status bar at the bottom of the window. A TinyURL is created as defined in the options dialog (default is normal TinyURL)
 2. Right Click the icon. This will give you the choice to create a normal TinyURL or one which is 'Previewable'. The default type is shown in bold. This can be changed using the Optioins dialogue.
 3. Right Click anywhere on the page and select 'Create TinyURL for this Page' to create a TinyURL for the current page.
 4. Right Click any link on a page and select 'Create TinyURL for this Link' to create a TinyURL for the link destination.
(These context menu options can be removed using the Options dialogue)
 5. Use the toolbar button to create a TinyURL for the current page. To add the toolbar button, right click the toolbar, select customise and then drag the TinyURL Button onto the toolbar where you want it.

TinyURLs are generated using the TinyURL API

****************

Better Privacy serves to protect against special longterm cookies, a new generation of 'Super-Cookie', which silently conquered the Internet. This new cookie generation offers unlimited user tracking to industry and market research. Concerning privacy Flash-cookies are most critical.
This add-on was made to make users aware of those hidden, never expiring objects and to offer an easier way to view and to manage them - since browsers are unable to do that for you.
 
Flash-cookies (Local Shared Objects, LSO) are pieces of information placed on your computer by a Flash plug-in. Those Super-Cookies are placed in central system folders. They are frequently used like standard browser cookies. Although their thread potential is much higher as of conventional cookies, only few users began to take notice of them.
 
BetterPrivacy allows to list and manage Flash-cookies, e.g. to remove those objects automatically on browser start, browser exit or by a configurable timer function while certain desired Flash cookies can be excluded from automatic deletion. So this extension becomes sort of "install and forget add-on". Usually automatic deletion is safe (no negative impact on your browsing), especially if the deletion timer is activated. The timer can delay automatic deletion for new or modified Flash-cookies which might be in use. It also allows to delete those objects immediately if desired. Users who wish to to manage all Flash-cookies manually can disable the automatic functions or exclude certain Flash-cookies from automatic deletion. 

Some Flash-cookie (LSO) properties in short...
- they are never expiring - staying on your computer for an unlimited time.
- by default they offer a storage of 100 KB (compare: Usual cookies 4 KB).
- browsers are not fully aware of LSO's, They often cannot be displayed or managed by browsers.
- via Flash they can access and store highly specific personal and technical information  (system, user name, files,...).
- ability to send the stored information to the appropriate server, without user's permission.
- Flash applications do not need to be visible
- there is no easy way to tell which Flash-cookie sites are tracking you.
- shared folders allow cross-browser tracking, LSO's work in every flash-enabled application
- the Flash company doesn't provide a user-friendly way to manage LSO's, In fact it's incredible cumbersome.
- many domains and tracking companies make extensive use of Flash-cookies.
This kind of cookies is not harmless.



------------------------- IMPORTANT -------------------------
IF YOU PERMIT DELETION OF LSO's, 
THEN COOKIE-STORED INFORMATION LIKE 
GAME SETTINGS OR LOGIN DATA (YAHOO SEAL) 
MIGHT BE LOST! MAKE SURE THAT YOU EXCLUDED 
IMPORTANT COOKIES FROM DELETION (SEE FAQ)

For web forms, the typical usage is as follows:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Navigate to the page containing the login form.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right-click on one of its fields and select from among "Save login info" (to create a new entry), "Edit login info", and "Delete login info".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If another popup appears, select the username for the entry you want to operate on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If adding a new entry, everything except the username and password should be filled in automatically. Fill in anything that is missing or incorrect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If adding or editing an entry, reload the page or return later. If the form doesn't get autofilled, most likely the page is asking the browser not to autofill it by declaring autocomplete="off". Try clicking twice on the username field and selecting from the dropdown list.

This add-on is designed to protect you against them. &lt;em&gt;Facebook™ Phishing Protector&lt;/em&gt; will warn you when an unusual activity is detected, such as a script injection attempt or a website other than Facebook™ requesting your credentials (see screenshots)

Currently there are some white-listed domains which are allowed to inject scripts, please refer to the Versions History to know them.

Feel free to contact us if you think you've found a "false positive", we'll study it and if it's really harmless we'll whitelist it as well. May do you wonder why such whitelist isn't public (configurable from the addon's preferences), well.. it's just that it wouldn't be enough secure.

Please note that to be able to analyze/study a certain script injection we need the exact details of what is being blocked and where. While you can just copy and paste what is said on the inline popup, we prefer the more helpful information which is being logged into the Firefox's Error Console (You can open it using CTRL+Shift+J) - In the other hand, if you aren't using Inline Popups but rather Firefox's Notification Popups the Error Console will be opened by clicking the "Details" button.

&lt;em&gt;If there is something else around your mind, don't hesitate to let us know it and we'll try to help.&lt;/em&gt;

It also implements the DoNotTrack tracking opt-out proposal by default, see &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/bd4266094d321e473190ea27c5ce1eeb6f3ae9aaa99ce33f14cdf3ec1d7dd070/http%3A//snipurl.com/nsdntrack" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://snipurl.com/nsdntrack&lt;/a&gt; .
Such a preemptive approach  prevents exploitation of security vulnerabilities (known and even unknown!) with no loss of functionality...

You can also add arbitrary text in the form of "metadata fields" by selecting "Edit metadata" in the context menu or pressing "m" while the row is focused.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE DESCRIPTION AND DEVELOPER COMMENTS BEFORE REPORTING A BUG!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Usage:
Install the extension and restart your browser to get the QJ Toolbar icons.  Configure the options by right clicking on any visible icon and selecting "Options".  Customize the toolbar with which buttons you choose and enjoy.  It's that simple!  There are way more options to play with, for help with those right click any visible icon and select "Help and FAQ".

(Note, if you don't know how to customize the toolbar icons google it)

Also please note that the scope of this extension is NOT as extensive as NoScript, and was not designed to compete with it.  This includes whitelisting/blacklisting sites and remembering their settings!  If you like NoScript then that's fine and this may not be the extension for you.  However this extension is ideal for those who prefer a simpler to use, less invasive interface while still having easier access to the controls.

So if you right-click the link in order to copy it you get some gibberish instead of what you wanted. This extension disables that behavior – on any Google or Yandex domain, without having to configure anything. Simply install and enjoy! As an added bonus, the search engine can no longer track your clicks.

&lt;b&gt;Known limitations&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;This extension cannot recover links after they have been modified. This means that it doesn’t work on Google Search if JavaScript is disabled — Google will produce modified links from the start rather than changing them when you click the link.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

It also allows to remove affiliate/tracking tags from URLs by the use of configurable patterns, being the most common used ones defined by default (ie, UTM, AFF, REF, etc)

The Add-On has two working modes:

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOM Traversing&lt;/b&gt;: When a website is loaded its DOM is scanned and any suitable link is cleaned. On this mode when some links are cleared the toolbar button will change and you'll be able to mouse-over it to open its popup where you can see the number of fixed links on the current website.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Delegation&lt;/b&gt;: This is a less intrusive mode by just listening to click events. Note that unlike for DOM traversing real-time highlighting and counters will not work then, even though the performance should be much better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
DOM Traversing was the default mode prior to version 2.4, on later versions Event Delegation mode is set as default, and under Firefox for Android and Thunderbird it shouldn't be changed.

You can disable the add-on at anytime by clicking the toolbar icon, which will become black/greyed when it's turned off.

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt; Convert the add-on to restartless. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;- done&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Once it's restartless, make it compatible with Android Devices. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;- done&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Implement a "linkify text links and then clean" feature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Work over the address bar for pasted links rather than just clicked ones (?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Unshorting links feature &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;- done, sort of (Redirect Watcher)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
All of the above requires a good amount of job, and thus the user base needs to grow to be accomplished. Hence, if you like CleanLinks please rate it and spread the word.

&lt;i&gt;Bloody Vikings!&lt;/i&gt; simplifies the use of temporary email addresses, helping you to protect your real address from spam and to stay anonymous.

Instead of exposing your real email address to every random site asking for it, simply right-click on the designated input field and select "Bloody Vikings!". &lt;i&gt;Bloody Vikings!&lt;/i&gt; automatically inserts a temporary email address and opens the corresponding mailbox in a new background tab.

KeeFox connects Firefox to KeePass Password Safe, the most popular open source (and free) password manager.

Here are just a few of the reasons to use KeeFox:

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Secure and automatic login to all your favourite websites, even for sites with multiple login "steps" or pages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your passwords stay under your control, protected by the respected KeePass Password Safe application and available to all applications on your computer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Free and open source with no adverts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Further information can be found at &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/b501a3bfc571f6ff83195338a535bbd13a026a88a2fca938b14be83bf6a95f4e/http%3A//keefox.org"&gt;http://keefox.org&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Note that this add-on will install KeePass Password Safe 2 on your computer if it is not already installed; KeePass requires the Microsoft .NET framework which will also be installed for you if required.

The built-in Firefox password manager will no longer prompt you to save passwords after you install this add-on. Any existing data will not be affected but you are strongly advised to delete any stored passwords from your Firefox password store in order to increase the security of your personal data and to avoid possible confusion in future. However, KeeFox will not work correctly if you clear your saved passwords every time Firefox closes.

If you uninstall KeeFox, you can re-enable the built-in password manager if you want by going to the main Firefox options dialog, clicking on the security tab and ticking "remember passwords for sites".&lt;/strong&gt;

Thunderbird support is in beta testing. Please see this page for more information and ask on the forum if you need help. &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/c12582c5cc0aa9a8b7fc501e123991d7dde7f75d3ff7d882a01f308c72331026/http%3A//sourceforge.net/apps/trac/keefox/wiki/Manual/Thunderbird"&gt;http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/keefox/wiki/Manual/Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;

Using interactive visualizations, Lightbeam enables you to see the first and third party sites you interact with on the Web. As you browse, Lightbeam reveals the full depth of the Web today, including parts that are not transparent to the average user. Using three distinct interactive graphic representations — Graph, Clock and List — Lightbeam enables you to examine individual third parties over time and space, identify where they connect to your online activity and provides ways for you to engage with this unique view of the Web.

&lt;b&gt;How Lightbeam Works&lt;/b&gt;
When you activate Lightbeam and visit a website, sometimes called the first party, the add-on creates a real time visualization of all the third parties that are active on that page. The default visualization is called the Graph view. As you then browse to a second site, the add-on highlights the third parties that are also active there and shows which third parties have seen you at both sites. The visualization grows with every site you visit and every request made from your browser. In addition to the Graph view, you can also see your data in a Clock view to examine connections over a 24-hour period or in a List view to drill down into individual sites.

&lt;b&gt;How You Can Use Lightbeam to Help Us Illuminate the Inner Workings of the Web&lt;/b&gt; 
As a part of Lightbeam, we're creating a big-picture view of how tracking works on the Internet, and how third-party sites are connected to multiple other sites. You may contribute your data to our crowdsourced directory by simply turning on the share switch within the add-on. To disable crowdsourcing, you can turn it off at any time. You can view your local data stored within Lightbeam at any time, or save your data by clicking the "Save" button under the data section on the left side of the add-on.

&lt;b&gt;How is my information stored? &lt;/b&gt;
As a default, all info generated and used for Lightbeam’s visualizations and features are only stored locally on your computer. You can save a copy of your connection history at any time, which is also where you can see the specific data collected by the add-on. You may also reset Lightbeam to erase your locally stored connection history, disable it to stop data collection or uninstall it to instantly remove all locally stored data related to Lightbeam. Additional information related to Lightbeam’s file format is available &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/e6faa2368f9fdd828b8443633e7b8c60337602584b1282ecdc03e8e4ccb2ef28/https%3A//github.com/mozilla/lightbeam/blob/master/doc/data_format.v1.1.md" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;  

&lt;b&gt;The origins of Lightbeam&lt;/b&gt;
Lightbeam began in July 2011 as Collusion, a personal project by Mozilla software developer &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/225abfe6296b383886331e9f55970b90ac8cb481453a4921df5c6273887df020/http%3A//www.toolness.com/wp/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Atul Varma&lt;/a&gt;. Inspired by the book &lt;i&gt;The Filter Bubble&lt;/i&gt;, Atul created an experimental add-on to visualize browsing behavior and data collection on the Web.

In February 2012, Gary Kovacs, Mozilla CEO at the time, introduced the Collusion add-on in a &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/368f827c03ff1b7db95f66a18f7ba5eeea359f0458bbc1811b1b8c25f2144eb8/http%3A//www.ted.com/talks/gary_kovacs_tracking_the_trackers.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;TED talk&lt;/a&gt; (now one of the most watched TED talks) about exposing online tracking.

In September 2012, Mozilla joined forces with students at &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/9d03ec7111b19d7b1070016b09e5c2a54bd57860159b5de7c2ecbf08b15e47e3/https%3A//www.ecuad.ca/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Emily Carr University of Art + Design&lt;/a&gt; to develop and implement visualizations for the add-on. With the support of the Ford Foundation and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), Collusion has been re-imagined as Lightbeam and was launched in the fall of 2013.

Cross-site requests are requests that your browser is told to make by a website you are visiting to a completely different website. Though usually legitimate requests, they often result in advertising companies and other websites knowing your browsing habits, including specific pages you view throughout the day. Among the attacks that cross-site requests are used in, they are particularly dangerous with Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks where your browser is told to make a request to another website and that other website thinks you (the person) meant to make the request.

With RequestPolicy, the default for any cross-site request is to deny it. Users are notified when requests on the current page have been blocked (the status bar flag icon at the bottom right of your browser turns red). Clicking on this status bar flag icon gives you a menu where you can view and modify which requests are blocked and allowed. You can whitelist requests you approve of by origin site, destination site, or specific origin-to-destination.

RequestPolicy is not a replacement for NoScript! Each focuses on different, important issues. For the best security, we recommend using both RequestPolicy and NoScript. More information on the difference between the two is available here:

*********************************************************************************
NOTE: As with any extension that blocks content, some websites will not work properly until you have allowed the required content. If a website you visit isn't working, you can use the RequestPolicy menu to allow the cross-site requests the website needs. After a short while of using RequestPolicy, you will have whitelisted all of the required cross-site requests for sites you frequently visit and you will use the RequestPolicy menu much less.

&lt;strong&gt;Note about using Disconnect with other filtering add-ons like Adblock Plus:&lt;/strong&gt; Disconnect is compatible with other filtering add-ons, but if you want Disconnect to show blocking info, uninstall then reinstall any other filtering add-ons you have (i.e., Disconnect must be added first).

With AutoProxy, you no longer need to switch your proxy status between on &amp;amp; off manually. If you prefer to visit a website via proxy, just add it's domain to AutoProxy's preference. After that, when you surfing, specified websites will be transfered through proxy while leaving others connect directly.

What's more, you can subscribe to rule lists maintained by people who have similar requirements as you. So, you don't need to add all proxy rules by yourself.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
"gfwList" is a list for people in mainland China suffering from the censorship of GFW. If you aren't in mainland China, please do NOT subscribe to "gfwList". AutoProxy should contain lists for other requirements. If you'd like to share your proxy rules to people in the same state/school/company/network...by maintaining a rule list, it would always be most appreciated, please check out &lt;a href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/46b81fb80799021aefa486e59c72f199721f238a/http%3A//autoproxy.org/en/subscriptions" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://autoproxy.org/en/subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; .


AutoProxy is derived from Adblock Plus, thanks the ABP community especially it's author Wladimir Palant!</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">lovelywcm</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2013 12:59:14 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://addons.mozilla.org/it/firefox/addon/autoproxy/versions/0.4b2.2013051811</guid></item><item><title>CookieKeeper 1.7.4</title><link>https://addons.mozilla.org/it/firefox/addon/cookiekeeper/</link><description>&lt;i&gt;Keep the cookies you want, delete the rest.&lt;/i&gt;
