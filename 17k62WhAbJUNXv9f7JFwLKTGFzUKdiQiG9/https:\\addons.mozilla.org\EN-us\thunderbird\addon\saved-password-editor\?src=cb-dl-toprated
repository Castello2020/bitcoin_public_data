Version 2.7.2 Info
January 25, 2014
Released under GNU General Public License, version 3.0 About this Add-on
This extension allows you to enter data into the Password Manager database instead of relying on Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey, etc., to do it, as well as making changes to existing entries. For web forms, the typical usage is as follows:Navigate to the page containing the login form.Right-click on one of its fields and select from among "Save login info" (to create a new entry), "Edit login info", and "Delete login info".If another popup appears, select the username for the entry you want to operate on.If adding a new entry, everything except the username and password should be filled in automatically. Fill in anything that is missing or incorrect.If adding or editing an entry, reload the page or return later. If the form doesn't get autofilled, most likely the page is asking the browser not to autofill it by declaring autocomplete="off". Try clicking twice on the username field and selecting from the dropdown list. There is a video demonstrating this workaround.This add-on also adds commands to the Password Manager window, which it makes accessible through Tools > Saved Passwords as well as a toolbar button.A short tutorial video is available.If you need support, please go to the support web site I have listed or email me (link on the details page, next to this description). Never use a review for this, as I have no real way of contacting you. For anything else, please see the Developer Comments near the bottom of the details page.Bitcoin donations: 17k62WhAbJUNXv9f7JFwLKTGFzUKdiQiG9 . Suggested amount 0.01-0.02 BTC.
Developer’s Comments
Currently supported applications: Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, and Conkeror.If you find this add-on useful, you might find QuickPasswords useful as well. For those more stubborn sites where the Password Manager and this add-on completely fail, try iMacros for Firefox.Logo/icon by PlastikManiac — thanks.You can find the source code repository at GitHub. To report bugs, you may use the issue tracker there, or just use the support email link in the "About this add-on" section. Please email me for any other support requests.Translations welcome. I have submitted this to BabelZilla, so I encourage you to use it to contribute (you'll need to register an account if you don't have one). The relevant thread is at http://www.babelzilla.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=6024 (note: this is for discussing translations, not general support; for that, see the "E-mail your question" link on this page).Current locales:bg-BG: "ExaFlop", "arris"de: "/usr/bin/tux"el: George Malamas "Grg68"eo: "milupo"es-ES: Ricardo A.
