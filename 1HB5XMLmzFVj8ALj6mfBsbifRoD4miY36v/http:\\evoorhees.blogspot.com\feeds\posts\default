Forget the mining. Forget the cryptography and the peer to peer networks and the open source code. All of these things are secondary to an understanding of money itself. &amp;nbsp;The core of the Bitcoin experiment is not about tech at all, it’s about money.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, most people do not spend enough time pondering the nature of money.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;This is strange and somewhat tragic, because we spend our lives chasing it. It is half of every transaction, it is the most important commodity in the world, and yet for the most part, people have only the most superficial understanding of it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;But from an early age, we understand that money is good. We want it. We’re happy when we have it, and sad when we don’t. We learn that to obtain money, we must work for it, and as we leave childhood we go to school for many years, and work very hard, so that we may obtain money.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;And so, much of our lives is spent searching and grasping for something we don’t understand.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;On the surface, the reason we seek money is simple: money lets us buy things. The utility of a new car, or the entertainment of an Xbox, or the taste of a nice steak dinner is apparent, and since we want those things, we seek money.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;But what people don’t spend enough time considering is why the money we use actually enables us to obtain the car, the xbox, and the dinner. Why is the shoemaker willing to give us his shoes for our money?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;You cannot answer this by saying that the shoemaker can in turn trade the money to someone else, for that begs the question, why does that person want the money?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;If nobody actually wants the money, and they only want what the money can buy, how did this whole crazy system get started? Who was the first person tricked into accepting something so silly as money in return for something real?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part II&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is what we want to examine. How we got to this point.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;In school, we learn that before we had money, we had a bartering system. Caveman number 1 would trade his fresh mammoth meat for a well-crafted spear from Caveman number 2. Bartering in this way makes intuitive sense, and even as children we engage in it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;School then tells us there is something wrong with bartering. Something called a “Coincidence of wants.” If Caveman 1 wants the spear from Caveman 2, then great. But what if he has no need for a spear? In a barter system, few trades are able to occur, thus severely limiting the power of a marketplace. Again, this makes intuitive sense.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;We then learn that to get around the Coincidence of Wants dilemma, money was invented. Money is the name for a common medium of exchange, whereby everyone agrees to trade for money instead of other objects.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;We learn that things like wampum shells were early forms of money, and that eventually people used gold and silver, and ultimately people started using the fiat paper bills we have today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Since this narrative is presented as one of ongoing human progression, children tend to grow up assuming their dollars, or euros, or yen, are proper money and that things like gold and seashells are outdated relics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Further, they come to perceive dollars as a very physical item, because they can hold physical bills in their wallet, and we all see movies with bank robbers stealing bags of physical cash. Even though nearly all your dollars are digital today, we still tend to understand them as something physical.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;With this as our frame of reference, Bitcoin looks kind of absurd, doesn’t it. If one compares dollars to Bitcoin, Bitcoin looks like a joke. It’s purely digital? Not backed by any trusty Government? Unregulated? No presidential heads or latin incantations printed on it?! &amp;nbsp;Clearly, it is nothing more than made up magic internet money. An absurd fad. A bubble. Tulip mania. Pets.com. A Ponzi scheme.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;PART III&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;So why is it that some people believe in Bitcoin as money when it is so clearly different than dollars, which are the best form of money we could possibly have?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;I think it’s because these people have a different understanding of money itself, one that isn’t really taught to us in school.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Consider that a crucial question may have been overlooked during our school education: why were seashells, or gold, chosen as money in the first place?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Was there a vote? Did people just wake up and start using it? Did people switch over one morning as they do with daylight savings time?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;I believe that the question of why gold became money is in fact one of the most egregious lapses in modern education. &amp;nbsp;Gold was the money of the world all the way up until 1971. Why was this the case? Why was it gold, and not rubies, or eggs, or feathers?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;And if gold was chosen as money, and nobody ever seems to have enough money, then why wasn’t something more plentiful, like grass, chosen as money? &amp;nbsp;Certainly if grass had been chosen, then we’d all have plenty of money! Poverty would’ve been eliminated long ago. So who’s bright idea was it to choose gold?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;In absence of a proper education, most assume that society just arbitrarily decided to make gold money, and that any other commodity would have worked roughly as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;They perceive money as an arbitrary token, but this is a mistake, and this is where the grand misunderstanding of Bitcoin begins, because if money is an arbitrary token, and we already have a great arbitrary token backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government, why should we get distracted by some other arbitrary token?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Because… Money is not arbitrary; it is selected with very good reason through a very natural process.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Gold became money, gradually over time, not by mistake, but &lt;b&gt;because it had specific attributes that made it highly useful in exchange&lt;/b&gt;. We can call this an attribute-based theory of money.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;It is these attributes, these specific properties of gold, which led it to be used increasingly as a medium of exchange. &amp;nbsp;Simply, it has better properties than basically everything else.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;It is scarce (unlike grass)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;It is fungible and uniform&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;It is transportable, because it has a high value-to-weight ratio&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;It is easily identifiable&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;It is highly durable&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;And its supply is relatively steady and predictable&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;If you understand that these attributes make gold a great means of exchange, you’ll understand why gold was increasingly sought in the natural marketplace.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;And what this means is that a money-based system is not actually something separate from a barter system at all. It’s just a barter system that’s been running for a while. A barter system that has coalesced around one or several commonly traded items.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;We’re still in a barter system, but the good most people prefer to barter for now is gold or dollars or bitcoin, and we called these most exchangeable of goods, money.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;So money is thus nothing more than the natural outcome of barter. &lt;/b&gt;Historically, this tended to be gold, simply because it had the best attributes for use in exchange.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;And if we see the genesis of gold’s monetary use – that it was nothing magical or arbitrary – gold simply had the best properties for exchange and was thus frequently bartered for, then it should not be a stretch to imagine that a commodity with even better properties might be an even better form of money.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is what I found when I discovered Bitcoin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part IV&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;“But wait, Erik,” some of you might say. “We already have something better than gold, it’s called the United States Federal Reserve Note. &amp;nbsp;(also known as the dollar)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;“Certainly, the Federal Reserve Note is superior to gold, and that’s why we use it today,”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Well let’s examine the properties of this form of money.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Dollars are fungible and uniform, that’s good. They are transportable, perhaps even more easily then gold. They have a high value-to-weight ratio. They’re fairly easy to divide and recombine. Looking pretty good so far. But what else?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Well, they’ve lost 98% of their value since the Federal Reserve started creating them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Really? Why is that?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Well, it’s because they are constantly created out of thin air. Every year vast new quantities of it are produced. &amp;nbsp; This is called inflation, and most people assume it’s just a natural phenomenon like rain and sunshine, but nope, it’s just money being printed. It may be the greatest scam ever devised.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;But a scam needs a victim, why would anyone accept a form of money that could be constantly created out of thin air and thus looses purchasing power every day. Because they’re forced to pay tribute to the government using this money through a scheme called taxation, and through legal tender laws.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;In other words, dollars are not used over gold because the attributes of dollars are superior. A free market did not choose dollars based on the dollars’ merit. Dollars are used because people are forced to use them. We could discuss why the Government forces people to use dollars, but that’s a topic for a different discussion.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;These are the concepts behind money that people need to understand. Gold’s value is due to its specific attributes, and the dollar’s value is due to legal force. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;So how does this relate to Bitcoin?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Bitcoin’s value as money needs to be understood like gold, which comes not from legal force, but from its specific attributes. Bitcoin’s attributes make it an amazing form of money and it was engineered for just that purpose.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;It is easy to divide and recombine&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;It cannot be counterfeited&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;It is highly durable, so long as certain precautions are taken&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;It can be sent anywhere, instantly, at near-zero cost&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;If you were going to make a super hero currency, this is one of the traits you would give it&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Can’t do that with gold due to physical constraints, or dollars due to legal constraints&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;It is scarce, with a known supply and a known inflation schedule&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;And it cannot be manipulated, restricted, or seized by any central party (shares this property with gold). Nobody has special privileges. In this way, it is very democratic, and very egalitarian.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Just as mankind has engineered houses to be used as shelter and cars to be used as transportation, so too can we engineer something to be used as an ideal medium of exchange. &amp;nbsp;But while the dollar is a poorly engineered money (so poor in fact that it relies on coercion for its value), Bitcoin is a brilliantly engineered money.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;It might not be perfect, but it’s pretty damn good, and this is why people are using it as money, despite the fact that nobody is forced to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;And given that it is so useful as money, due to its attributes, it should not be a surprise to anyone that it commands a market price. Any good that is useful and scarce will have a price on the market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Economists and journalists get very caught up around the question, why does Bitcoin have value? The answer is easy: because it’s useful and scarce.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;The corollary here is that Bitcoin’s value can never reach zero unless it is no longer useful, or no longer scarce.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part V&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;And this brings us to the more interesting topic.&lt;/b&gt; For if Bitcoin is so well-engineered as money, won’t it necessarily begin competing with other forms of money?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;A fair question would be, “well if that were true Erik, why have people not tended toward gold over the dollar? Isn’t gold, as you claim, a superior form of money?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;The reason is that while gold works very well as a store of value (indeed the best the world has ever known), it doesn’t work so well as a means of exchange in our modern society.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;And this should be obvious.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Transacting in physical gold is, unfortunately, quite a burden, and while services like e-gold had huge potential, they inevitably fail because they get beheaded by the government. If a digital gold company is too successful, the government destroys it. Anyone who tries to make it useful as a currency gets shut down – GoldMoney is another great example.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;This is why gold remains safely in vaults, used for storing wealth, not so much as a currency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;So we see a physical bullion currency is too inconvenient, and a digital bullion currency is a fantasy (because it requires backing by a party that can be shut down).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;This is also why anyone who suggests Bitcoin should be backed by something like gold is gravely misunderstanding the situation. Backing injects counter-party risk, because a specific person or entity must be obligated to fulfill the backing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Bitcoin doesn’t need backing, because it is a digital commodity that is valuable itself, and valuable in large part because it carries no physical burdens or constraints. It is this lack of physical backing which enables it to move anywhere, instantly, at near-zero cost.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;One can see then that Bitcoin is revolutionary in this regard. For the first time ever, a form of money, superior to all others due to its specific attributes, has been successfully decentralized and decoupled from the material world in such a way that nobody can turn the system off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;The world has never seen this before, and there is now a certain inevitability that markets around the world will gradually gravitate toward this superior money. &amp;nbsp;Money is a good like all others, in that it competes for the attention of those using it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part VI: Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;So I think it is fair to say that Bitcoin is a monumental invention that has finally been captured by mankind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;And if you understand the deep and central role that money plays in every aspect of our lives, then might Bitcoin not be as important as the printing press, the automobile, and the internet. &amp;nbsp;In fact, not everyone is literate, not everyone has a car, and not everyone is online, but everyone uses money. (And for those who are wondering, you do not need internet access to use Bitcoin.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;All of you who are involved in this, right now, are making history.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;And perhaps most exciting about all this, is that the only thing which can derail this invention is an even better invention. If you play through the various scenarios in your mind, you’ll realize that Bitcoin can only fail if a superior currency takes its place, in which case mankind is even better off, and the promise of Bitcoin will carry forward into its successor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;The genie is truly out of the bottle. &amp;nbsp;And we are now right in the middle of a very grand experiment to see what that genie is capable of.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The point is this…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Bitcoin, like gold, has properties that make it an excellent form of money. However, unlike gold, Bitcoin can actually be used in our modern economy for day to day exchange.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Unlike gold, Bitcoin, as an asset with no counter-party risk, can be transferred to anyone on the planet in one second. It is super hero currency. And nobody’s permission is needed. There are no terms of service.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Further, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature means that it is not in danger of being shut off by the incumbent monetary monopolist. Thus Bitcoin can achieve critical mass.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Nothing has ever been able to claim these attributes before, and this is why it’s foolish to compare Bitcoin to any other digital currency from Facebook Credits to World of Warcraft Gold to our most favorite virtual currency, the United States Dollar itself.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Bitcoin’s attributes enable it to operate freely and grow within an increasingly larger sphere of activity.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Inevitably, this means it will start displacing monies with inferior attributes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Bitcoin will grow like a benevolent hydra, with heads sprouting up in every country and community. It will gobble up commerce that has, until now, been shackled to the economic witchcraft of a decrepit fiat financial system, and will leave an expansive, frictionless marketplace in its wake. &amp;nbsp;It is up to all of you, to capture and grow that new marketplace.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Someday, in school, the curriculum will be different. The children will be taught the true nature of money. They’ll learn the difference between a real asset, like Bitcoin, which is based on merit, and virtual currency, like the US dollar, which based on coercion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;They’ll learn how powerful a market can be, when its medium of exchange is honest. And they’ll learn how a small group of idealistic entrepreneurs saved the world from a monetary dark age.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;I feel very excited for my children to grow up in such a world, &amp;nbsp;and I am deeply honored to be here in San Jose, working on this project with so many great minds all over the world.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;Thank you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;

font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;There has been much talk about Bitcoin within libertarian and economic circles. It&#39;s becoming a buzzword, but like all new systems that break onto the public stage quickly, Bitcoin brings with it excitement, speculation, rumor, and downright confusion. To be sure, Bitcoin is complicated. After all, it&#39;s an entirely new global monetary system - both a currency and a payment network for that currency. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ancientlasers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Bitcoin.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.ancientlasers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Bitcoin.jpg&quot; height=&quot;213&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Like all powerful tools, it&#39;s important for those interested in using Bitcoin to spend some time engaging in the due diligence of education. Similar to a bicycle, once you know how to use Bitcoin, it will feel very easy and comfortable. But also like a&amp;nbsp; bicycle, one could spend years learning the physics that enable it to operate.&amp;nbsp; Such deep knowledge is not necessary to the actual rider, and in the same way one can enjoy the world of Bitcoin with little more than a healthy curiosity and a bit of practice.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;This article is a primer on Bitcoin: an overview of the fascinating new phenomenon from the perspective of a humble libertarian who cares more about the ramifications for human liberty than about the technical protocol and brilliant science underlying the network. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;The basics of Bitcoin are all covered here, ranging from a light technical overview to due diligence to monetary economics and theory.

Both the currency unit and the payment network share the same name: Bitcoin.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;As a currency unit, consider Bitcoin like other currencies.

As a payment network, Bitcoin replaces the function of banks (especially the Federal Reserve as money creation is not at the whim of any person nor group), inter-bank funding networks (like SWIFT and SEPA), payment processors (like PayPal) and remitters (such as Western Union). The entirety of these massive industries as they relate to the creation, storage, accounting, and transfer of money has been usurped by Bitcoin. If Bitcoin succeeds, it is likely that PayPal and Western Union would be removed from the marketplace. The Federal Reserve (and every central bank) would be made redundant. &quot;Disruptive technology&quot; is thus an understatement.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;How does it work?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;But how does Bitcoin work, you ask? How does it replace the functions for which we&#39;ve so long relied on (and been beholden to) governments, banks, and payment companies?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;To use Bitcoin, you traditionally download the software (though you can also use an &quot;ewallet&quot; system, discussed later). The software acts as your &quot;bank account.&quot; It stores a secret code on your computer, and this code enables funds to be spent from your bank account. In Bitcoin terminology, this bank account is called your &quot;wallet.&quot; So your wallet sits on your computer, and as soon as one has this wallet software one can receive and send Bitcoins to other wallet-holders anywhere in the world. It is as fast and easy as sending an email (easier because you don&#39;t have to bother writing a message!). &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;You don&#39;t need a name, an address, a Social Security/Slavery number, or any personal information of any kind. Nobody &quot;approves&quot; you for Bitcoin. It&#39;s free and open-source software. You get it from &lt;a href=&quot;http://bitcoin.org/&quot;&gt;Bitcoin.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Transactions are sent and accounts are secured using what&#39;s known as &quot;public key cryptography.&quot; Every account has a &lt;i&gt;public key&lt;/i&gt; and a &lt;i&gt;private key&lt;/i&gt; - both of which are long strings of numbers and letters. Your wallet software knows your &lt;i&gt;private&lt;/i&gt; key, and this allows it to send money. To send money to someone, you merely need to know their &lt;i&gt;public&lt;/i&gt; key (basically their bank account number). If you have your private key plus their public key, a transaction can be created and the funds are deducted from your account and credited to the receiver&#39;s account, without anyone else having a say in the matter. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;As mentioned, your account is merely defined as a long string of numbers and letters: &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;1PGFCtrJHUsc7fs4LGWLmXUEwuKyDaHuRa&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Thus, your account has no personal information attached to it. You do not need to divulge any information whatsoever in order to obtain a Bitcoin account. This means you can receive, store, and spend Bitcoins with &lt;i&gt;relative&lt;/i&gt; anonymity. The anonymity is relative because if you post your address anywhere that can be attributed to you (like on your Facebook page), then of course one can see that the account belongs to you, and money going to it would not be anonymous. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Bitcoin therefore works as a peer-to-peer network upon which account holders can transfer Bitcoin currency between accounts instantly and with relative anonymity. So long as an account holder protects her &lt;i&gt;private key&lt;/i&gt;, her funds remain perfectly secure and only she can send them to someone else (and nobody can stop her).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Screenshot_of_Bitcoin-qt.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Screenshot_of_Bitcoin-qt.png&quot; height=&quot;388&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Why is Bitcoin valuable?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;This is perhaps the most important topic to address, as nothing else matters if Bitcoin has no value. What makes Bitcoin worth anything? Isn&#39;t it just &quot;fake&quot;? Isn&#39;t it just a made-up pretend virtual currency? Many say, &quot;I can&#39;t hold it, I can&#39;t see it, and thus it&#39;s artificial and not worth my time.&quot; Let&#39;s challenge this understandable initial reaction. Let&#39;s demonstrate why Bitcoin is valuable, and very much worth one&#39;s time. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Financial privacy has long been symbolized by the notorious &quot;Swiss bank account.&quot; Yet, anyone with a Swiss bank account has to trust that bank, and as we&#39;ve seen in the last couple years, &quot;bank privacy&quot; even in Switzerland is a myth - banks there have been bending over for the US government and divulging customer information. So imagine having a private, numbered Swiss bank account, but without having to bother with the Swiss bank itself. That is Bitcoin. Instead of placing your trust in a regulated bank governed by fallible humans, Bitcoin enables you to place your trust in an unregulated cryptographic environment governed by infallible mathematics. 2+2 will always equal 4, no matter how many guns the government points at the equation.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Bitcoin is thus the only currency and money system in the world which has no counter-party risk to hold and to transfer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;This is absolutely revolutionary and you should read the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;preceding&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;sentence again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt; Gold advocates will point out that physical gold bullion has no counter-party risk, but that is only true for storage in your own home. Store it in a vault or bank and you have counter-party risk. And sending gold? You have to trust all sorts of people if you wish to transfer your gold somewhere else or spend it across distance. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Bitcoin means complete ownership of money both in storage &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; transfer. Nobody can prevent you from having it. Nobody can prevent you from spending it. Even if one&#39;s home is broken into, or even if the government issues a &quot;confiscation order&quot; (as they did with gold in 1933), one&#39;s Bitcoins are perfectly safe. Try fleeing a country with $1,000,000 in bullion without the government knowing about it. Easier said than done. With Bitcoin, it&#39;s almost easier done than said - you could put $1,000,000 of Bitcoin on a USB drive, or even write the private key on a piece of paper, or just email the wallet file to yourself to be retrieved outside the country. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Starting to see the value? Never in the history of the world has an individual had this ability. It is unprecedented.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;No really, WHY is Bitcoin valuable???&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;At this point, skeptics should say, &quot;okay fine, you can store and spend Bitcoins without interference, but what gives them initial value? Why do they have a price?&quot; It&#39;s a very good question, and even expert economists have struggled with the answer. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;But really, the answer is simple. Bitcoins have value because A) they are useful and B) they are scarce. Combine those two attributes in any asset and you will discover it has a price. The moment the first Bitcoin was traded to someone in exchange for something else, an exchange rate (market price) was established. Subsequent exchangers agreed or disagreed with that rate, and made further trades accordingly. Bitcoin thus spontaneously developed a price, as do all things in an open market if they are sufficiently useful and sufficiently scarce. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Let&#39;s look at value a little further, because it&#39;s a contentious issue with Bitcoin. There are many (including Paul Krugman) who believe Bitcoin isn&#39;t worth anything and is no more than a speculative bubble fad. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;I wouldn&#39;t expect Krugman to &quot;get it,&quot; but wiser/real economists need only observe metals to start understanding why Bitcoins have value. After all, any strong advocate of gold or silver as money should hopefully understand &lt;i&gt;why &lt;/i&gt;these metals should be money. The answer is that these metals tend to be chosen in an open marketplace as money, &lt;i&gt;because their specific properties make them useful as a means of exchange. &lt;/i&gt;It is the properties of gold and silver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;unique to these metals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;which make them excellent money. They are scarce, fungible, uniform, transportable, have a high value-to-weight ratio, are easily identifiable, are highly durable, and their supplies are relatively steady and predictable. Contrast other goods like chickens, or seashells, or sand, and you discover that none of them are as good on the above attributes as precious metals. Chickens can&#39;t well be cut in half or recombined, seashells are not uniform, and sand is too plentiful to be used as money. Why not other metals... why don&#39;t we use iron as money? It&#39;s not scarce enough - you&#39;d need carts of it at the store to go shopping. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;As any Austrian economist can tell you, money is merely that commodity in an open market which best satisfies the properties necessary for useful exchange. Gold and silver take the cake every time a violent government doesn&#39;t get in the way... or at least, this is true historically. But, this doesn&#39;t mean that gold and silver are &quot;perfect, infallible money.&quot; Indeed, there are practical problems. One can&#39;t easily divide and combine silver coins to make change. One can&#39;t easily send large values of gold across distance without hiring security and waiting for transport. One must pay storage fees, or risk theft at home. And, while difficult, it is possible to make fake gold and silver ingots and pass them off in trade as real.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;So then it follows that if gold and silver are not perfect money (though admittedly the best we&#39;ve had), perhaps mankind could discover or invent something that was even better. This is the Bitcoin experiment - the question of whether Bitcoin, with its specific attributes, is an even better form of money than what the marketplace currently enjoys (or in the case of state fiat, is forced to use). If the Austrians are right, and a marketplace tends to chose the medium of exchange which best works as money, and Bitcoin&#39;s specific attributes make it excellent money, then perhaps the marketplace will, over time, increasingly use it for such. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;The answer so far, is yes. Bitcoin is finding more and more niches for early adoption, which further supports its market price, providing confidence to holders that it will retain value, and this further lends Bitcoin to be used for still more purposes. It&#39;s an organic and messy process, full of trial and error, potholes, brilliant innovations and terrible failures. But that&#39;s what an open marketplace is, no? Every day a more resilient economy is being built, and not at the point of a gun, but voluntarily - not by decree of Bernanke, but by spontaneous, self-interested private order.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Many have made the argument that &quot;nothing backs Bitcoin.&quot; And this is true. Bitcoin cannot be redeemed for any fixed value, nor is it tied to any existing currency or commodity. But, neither is gold. Gold is not backed by anything - it is valuable because it&#39;s useful and scarce. Cars are not backed by anything, they are merely useful as cars and thus have value. Food is not backed, nor are computers. All these goods have value in proportion to their usefulness and scarcity, and one merely needs to see the usefulness of Bitcoin to understand why, without backing from any government nor corporation, without being tied to any fiat currency or existing commodity, it commands a price on the market and rightly so.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;How does one obtain it?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;When one understands why Bitcoins are useful and therefore valuable, one might wish to obtain some. But how? Well, how does one obtain any currency? There are two basic ways, either by selling goods and services for it, or by buying it at an exchange.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;We&#39;ll examine buying at an exchange first. &quot;Exchanges&quot; are simply websites where buyers and sellers come together to trade one currency for another. If you have an account at an exchange, and fund the exchange with Bernanke Bucks, you can buy Bitcoins.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;The practical steps for doing this are as follows:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; margin-left: 40pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Step 1)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; Create a free account at a trustworthy exchange like &lt;a href=&quot;http://bitstamp.net/&quot;&gt;BitStamp.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; margin-left: 40pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; margin-left: 40pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Step 2) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Put money in the exchange, typically by linking your bank account or sending a wire. &amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; margin-left: 40pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; margin-left: 40pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Step 3)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; Once your funds are at the exchange, you can buy Bitcoins at the current market price. The coins then stay at the exchange in your account until you send them somewhere else (to your personal wallet or someone you&#39;d like to pay, etc). If you want to sell Bitcoins for dollars, you simply do the process in reverse - send the Bitcoins to an exchange, sell them at market price, and transfer the USD to your bank.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;The Bitcoin market is fully-liquid and operates 24/7 with no holidays. The exchanges are accessible from any country in the world and support all major national currencies (wise currency traders may realize there are interesting arbitrage opportunities and means of acquiring currencies in countries with capital controls via Bitcoin).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;The other way to get Bitcoins is to sell goods and services for them, just like you sell goods or your labor for dollars. Being able to receive Bitcoins is as simple as putting your Bitcoin address on your webpage, and you get this address automatically once you have a Bitcoin wallet. There is no &quot;sign up&quot; or &quot;approval&quot; to be able to accept Bitcoin. You can be any age, and in any country. Just get the wallet software (from &lt;a href=&quot;http://bitcoin.org/&quot;&gt;bitcoin.org&lt;/a&gt;) or use an &quot;ewallet&quot; such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://paytunia.com/&quot;&gt;Paytunia.com&lt;/a&gt;, and paste your Bitcoin address for the world to see. Anyone who knows your Bitcoin address can send you Bitcoins instantly.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;For small businesses who would like a more advanced way to accept and track Bitcoin payments for website orders, there are a few good merchant solutions. &lt;a href=&quot;http://paysius.com/&quot;&gt;Paysius.com&lt;/a&gt; is the best - it will plug into your site (using common shopping cart plugins) and enable your customers to select &quot;Bitcoin&quot; as payment during checkout instead of credit card or PayPal, etc. (this doesn&#39;t replace those methods, it merely gives your customers a new option). Further, because very few businesses can pay their salaries and suppliers in Bitcoin (yet), systems like Paysius give the business the ability to auto-convert incoming Bitcoins into normal USD and have that deposited in the company bank account. Fees are much lower than credit card processing, and Bitcoin payments have zero chargebacks or reversals (it&#39;s impossible to reverse a Bitcoin payment) so merchants can securely accept payment from any country with no more risk of reversal, which should be a welcome relief to those who have been burned by PayPal or credit card fraud. Other than &lt;a href=&quot;http://paysius.com/&quot;&gt;Paysius.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit-pay.com/&quot;&gt;Bit-pay.com&lt;/a&gt; is another good option for merchants to accept Bitcoin.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;So that&#39;s it - that&#39;s how you get Bitcoins. Just buy them, or sell stuff in exchange.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Being careful with money&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;This is where many people have justified concerns. Bitcoin requires a high degree of personal responsibility, and so users need to know the basic rules for using Bitcoin safely. The bad news is, if you screw up, you can lose money and never get it back. The good news is, with a few basic pointers and some practice, you can use Bitcoin &lt;i&gt;extremely &lt;/i&gt;securely, without fear of loss. Do not get into Bitcoin without understanding these basic concepts:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; margin-left: 40pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Concept 1)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; Bitcoins are like cash and are thus stored in a specific physical place. This means, you must always be mindful of where your Bitcoins are, and what risks that location presents. For example, if your coins are on your computer, and you don&#39;t back them up somewhere else (yes, they can be backed up easily), and the computer crashes, your money is gone. There is no company you can call to complain about it... the money is lost forever. Similarly, if you store your coins with an online service (like an ewallet or exchange), then you are trusting that service to hold your coins safely. If you give your coins to someone who is not trustworthy, they can run away and you&#39;ll never get them back. You wouldn&#39;t give $100 cash to someone you don&#39;t trust. The same is true with Bitcoin. So if the coins are in your possession (on your computer or smartphone), you must be mindful of them, back them up, and keep your systems secure. If the coins are held for you by someone else, then you must be able to trust that party.&amp;nbsp; This is the most important safety concept of Bitcoin.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; margin-left: 40pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; margin-left: 40pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Concept 2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; Wherever you keep your Bitcoins, they will be protected with passwords. If coins are on your computer in your wallet file, and someone learns your wallet password and they obtain your wallet file, then they can spend your coins! Similarly, if you keep coins with a service provider, and someone learns your login information, they can steal your coins. Use strong passwords whenever you deal with Bitcoin (more than 12 characters) and keep them always in a safe place. Funds are not protected by government-mandated and taxpayer-subsidized FDIC insurance - a Bitcoin bank cannot just type in digits into your account to replenish funds stolen by your own carelessness with your password.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; margin-left: 40pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; margin-left: 40pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Concept 3)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; When coins are on your own computer (meaning you&#39;re using the wallet software from &lt;a href=&quot;http://bitcoin.org/&quot;&gt;bitcoin.org&lt;/a&gt;), the first time you open your wallet software you will need to make a password to encrypt your wallet (see above). After making this password (don&#39;t ever forget it), &lt;b&gt;you MUST backup your wallet file&lt;/b&gt; in a different location. This file is where your money is stored. The file name is &quot;wallet.dat&quot; and backing it up is as simple as copying the file and putting it somewhere else. To find your wallet.dat file:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; margin-left: 40pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; margin-left: 40pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;---------&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; margin-left: 40pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;On Windows, you must first tell your computer to &quot;Show hidden files and folders&quot; - look up how to do this online.

Burn it to a CD and put it in a bank safety deposit box. Put it on a different computer. You can even email the file to yourself. Better yet, do two or three of the above. If you back up the wallet properly and keep it safe, and the likelihood of you losing your Bitcoins will be lower than you dying in a car crash. If you don&#39;t back it up, the likelihood of you losing your coins is high. &lt;i&gt;Important Note: if you use more than 100 Bitcoin addresses with your wallet, you will need to make a new backup file (the first backup will not know about the 101st address).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; margin-left: 40pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; margin-left: 40pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Concept 4)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; Liberty advocates love free markets. But, with freedom comes responsibility. Bitcoin exists in a free market. It is not regulated, tracked, or overseen by anything other than cold hard mathematics. Thus, the companies and organizations you find in Bitcoinland are often unregulated and private. A Bitcoin-based company doesn&#39;t even need to be registered as a company anywhere, because it doesn&#39;t need a business checking account or an IRS extortion number (known as an EIN). While this means Bitcoin enables truly free trade on a global scale, it also means Bitcoin users need to be careful and prudent. Don&#39;t buy things from companies or websites you don&#39;t trust. You may never see your money again, and there is no way to &quot;reverse&quot; a payment. With Bitcoin, reputation and history are everything. If you wouldn&#39;t give cash to a stranger in an alleyway, don&#39;t give Bitcoins to a stranger online. Enjoy the free market, and be a responsible adult.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; margin-left: 40pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; margin-left: 40pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Concept 5)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; Remember that Bitcoin should still be considered an experiment. As resilient as the system has proven to be, it is still new. The value of a Bitcoin could drop to zero tomorrow. This means under no circumstances should people invest money in Bitcoin which they cannot afford to lose. Bitcoin is a highly volatile commodity with an extremely uncertain future. Grandmothers should not be putting retirement money into Bitcoin (nor in US dollars, for that matter). &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;What can one do with it?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7X6966wBkLM/TkRH__TYTEI/AAAAAAAAAvs/6s_FK2bVtlY/s400/bitcoin-node-globe.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7X6966wBkLM/TkRH__TYTEI/AAAAAAAAAvs/6s_FK2bVtlY/s400/bitcoin-node-globe.jpg&quot; height=&quot;273&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;The short answer is that you can do anything, but you might have to build it first! Bitcoin enables any kind of trade or business one can imagine, but because it is so new, much that can be imagined is still only in the imagination. Entrepreneurs have been building and testing Bitcoin-systems for a couple years now, but the vast majority of Bitcoin&#39;s global potential remains untapped. Every liberty-minded entrepreneur should be considering this point.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;As for what&#39;s currently available, the most basic thing one can do with Bitcoin is buy products and services from anyone who accepts Bitcoin.

Accessing Silk Road requires further security precautions such as the use of Tor, which is beyond the scope of this article.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Next, donations are made very efficient via Bitcoin. Groups from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikileaks.org/&quot;&gt;Wikileaks&lt;/a&gt; to indie film companies and animal shelters accept Bitcoin donations. Bitcoin works great for donations because micro-transactions are possible (you can&#39;t send $0.10 to a charity via PayPal, because the fees are larger than $0.10... but with Bitcoin you can). If you want to accept donations for anything, put a Bitcoin address on your website. It costs you nothing. Want to donate to Wikileaks? Here&#39;s their address:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: white; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 10.5pt;&quot;&gt;1HB5XMLmzFVj8ALj6mfBsbifRoD4miY36v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: white; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 10.5pt;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: white; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10.5pt;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Like to gamble? Bitcoin lets US players actually play poker online. The government can&#39;t stop the payments, after all. Sites such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://sealswithclubs.eu/&quot;&gt;SealsWithClubs.eu&lt;/a&gt; are gaining popularity, with larger casinos being built.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Want to send money to friends or family overseas? Use Bitcoin. Instead of paying Western Union $40, just send Bitcoins for free. Remittance markets are one area where Bitcoin really shines, because it passes across borders instantly and with no possibility of regulation nor interference. Similarly, if you&#39;re in a place like China or Belarus with capital controls, if you can get your hands on Bitcoin then you can immediately transfer wealth outside the country to other currencies.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Want gold or silver to store value acquired via Bitcoin? Try a site like &lt;a href=&quot;http://coinabul.com/&quot;&gt;Coinabul.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Work with freelancers or have a business that pays people in other countries? Use Bitcoin. After all, Bitcoin enables &quot;under the table&quot; payments to anyone, anywhere. Paying a contractor in Italy or India is now as easy as sending an email.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Want to protect wealth or move it privately? Bitcoin transcends all borders and regulations. No longer do you need to have your wealth sitting in an account that can be frozen or seized. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Basically, anything you can do with &quot;money&quot; generically, you can do with Bitcoin - yet you now have no governmental restriction upon that activity.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;re a merchant, why not start accepting Bitcoin as payment? It&#39;s easy to integrate if you use a system like &lt;a href=&quot;http://paysius.com/&quot;&gt;Paysius.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;If you think Bitcoin could be used in a creative new way, then go build the system! Just as few people understood the power of the internet in the early &#39;90s, the same is true with Bitcoin. And just as with the internet, it is attracting builders and entrepreneurs all over the world.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Bitcoin vs. The State&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Now we get to the more fun part, which is especially relevant to any libertarian discussion of Bitcoin. This is the manner by which Bitcoin supersedes government control. &quot;Okay,&quot; people say, &quot;so Bitcoin is new and the government doesn&#39;t regulate it yet, but they will!&quot; Unfortunately for the government, they cannot. No person nor group of people can defy the laws of mathematics upon which Bitcoin is built.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/620x413/a_c/bitcoins_1.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/620x413/a_c/bitcoins_1.png&quot; height=&quot;213&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;But first, let&#39;s look at the ways the government &lt;i&gt;could &lt;/i&gt;interfere with the Bitcoin system. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Private websites on a hosted server can be taken down by the government. We saw this in amazing clarity recently when MegaUpload was taken down by the US government, even before any trial or finding of criminal activity had been accomplished. It should be assumed that the government can take down any site it wishes, with or without the legal cover of legislation like SOPA and PIPA (which merely give legal blessing to powers already assumed and demonstrated). So this means that any website that dealt in Bitcoins could be removed and shut down. The exchanges would be the first target.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Yet, even here the government runs into trouble, because websites can be mirrored, copied, and hidden very easily. Taking down Bitcoin websites would be like cutting the heads of a Hydra - for each successful severance, publicity and the profit motive would compel more sites to spring up (case in point: how many file sharing sites exist, other than MegaUpload?). &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;In fact, certain sites have proven impossible for the government to take down altogether. Take the example of The Silk Road, which is a brazen website selling illicit drugs. US Senator Chuck Schumer expressed angst in this regard, though he&#39;s pitifully impotent to remove the site because it exists on what&#39;s known as the &quot;dark web,&quot; on servers hidden via cryptography. If the above-ground Bitcoin websites are shut down, the below-ground sites will flourish. And every time a high profile site is taken down, Bitcoin would get free publicity around the world.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;So taking down websites is an inadequate strategy if the government wishes to impede Bitcoin. What else could they do?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Within one country, at least, a government could prohibit individuals and businesses from openly accepting Bitcoins (and if this happened in the US, it&#39;d be the ultimate sign that the Supreme Court had fully abandoned its proper responsibilities). Suppose the US Government did ban the acceptance of Bitcoin: it would mean Bitcoin could only be accepted in secret. This would harm the economy significantly, but wouldn&#39;t come close to stopping Bitcoin (and indeed, unless every government did this, Bitcoins could be openly accepted in other countries leading to capital flight which would pressure governments not to outlaw it in the first place).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;But what about the more obvious attack method - can&#39;t the government just &quot;shut down&quot; Bitcoin transfers? Amazingly, no. Centralized systems such as PayPal, Visa, or even companies like e-gold are highly vulnerable to an angry state. The thugs must merely break down the door, confiscate the servers, and throw the owners in jail. This is why any centralized system must ultimately bend to the government&#39;s will, acquiescing to money-laundering and taxation regulations, divulging allegedly-private information about clients, and preventing payments the government deems problematic. If they don&#39;t, they&#39;re shut down.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Bitcoin is not vulnerable to this risk, because there is no central point of failure. There is no Bitcoin office. There are no central Bitcoin servers. There is no president nor employees of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has no home country, it is licensed nowhere. It is a distributed network, a protocol, that can operate as long as the internet exists (and, in fact, even without the internet per se). Transactions occur peer-to-peer, meaning no governing body approves them. Accounts cannot be frozen, because nobody has the freeze button. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Bitcoin cannot be turned off - it is like a benevolent virus which, so long as a few hosts survive somewhere in the world, can perpetuate itself and regrow at the speed of information. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Bitcoin and Disruption&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Once one makes this realization - that the government is actually quite powerless to stop Bitcoin, then a few ramifications might spring into mind. If Bitcoin doesn&#39;t fail on its own, then to some extent it will succeed, and as it succeeds, it starts to replace many of the institutions which have caused so much trouble for humanity. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;First on the chopping block are market actors which compete for the business of money transfer. Mega-companies like PayPal and Western Union (and even more deeply rooted companies like SWIFT) discover that they have to compete with a system that transfers money at practically zero cost. The &quot;service&quot; these companies provide is made redundant, and just as the buggy-whip manufacturers were out of a job at the onset of the automobile, so too will payment services be useless at the onset of the frictionless global transfers afforded by Bitcoin. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://files.campus.edublogs.org/blogs.umb.edu/dist/2/123/files/2012/01/countries-v5q30e.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://files.campus.edublogs.org/blogs.umb.edu/dist/2/123/files/2012/01/countries-v5q30e.png&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;From a market efficiency standpoint, if these companies are earning billions of dollars a year for providing a service which can be done for free, then if that service catches on, humanity will be billions of dollars per year richer. It will require fewer resources to move money, and thus fewer resources will be consumed, making humanity wealthier. Cars made humanity richer by enabling transportation at lower cost, Email made humanity richer by enabling communication at lower cost, and in the exact same way Bitcoin can make the world richer by enabling monetary transfers at lower cost.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;If Bitcoin grows large enough to start replacing financial transaction networks, its value will stabilize further and more confidence can be imbued in the long-term price. Subsequently, Bitcoin will become an increasingly better (more stable) means of value storage, which threatens banks first and then national currencies second.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;All the work done by banks to hold and account for money (and transfer it between individuals and companies) can be done natively by Bitcoin. And so just as the payment services become redundant, so too do many services provided by banks, shrinking the banking sector down to those areas where it still serves useful value.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;A Bitcoin world would still have banks, of course, but the banks would be properly placed into those market roles where they do useful work. People don&#39;t necessarily want to store value on home-based PC&#39;s, and a bank with security staff and safe systems may make a smart place to hold funds (but instead of everyone &lt;i&gt;having&lt;/i&gt; to hold funds at the bank, it would be their option based on their risk-profile). Similarly, there will always be a need in a capitalist system for loans and interest paid on deposits. Banks would enjoy this ability with Bitcoin so long as they were efficient and could compete in the open market.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;And as we move further along the adoption and growth curve of a Bitcoin monetary system, we see that national currencies themselves become challenged quite quickly. Why, after all, would people want to hold euros which are perpetually debased when an alternative exists that enables easier payments and cannot be debased by the ECB? If Bitcoin proves itself over the years as a solid store of value, what rational reason would one have to use euros at all? Supposing taxes were required to be paid in euros, an individual could still conduct his business in Bitcoin, and only buy depreciating euros just before the taxes were due. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Why don&#39;t we see this with gold today? Because gold has no good payment system built into it - physical bullion is not efficient for daily trade, and digital vaults backed by gold have all come under fire from government AML concerns, as we&#39;ve seen the transfer systems of companies like GoldMoney be pressured into shutting down (last year, GoldMoney discontinued it&#39;s account-to-account transfers). &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Remember, Bitcoin automatically makes both the storage &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;transfer of funds easy, secure, private, and instantaneous. With a history of price stability earned over time, or in conjunction with gold and silver as an even more reliable store of value, why use state fiat at all?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;The final domino to fall, of course, is the power which governments wield over their flock via their ability to print, regulate, and control the nation&#39;s money. When a state currency is challenged, the state itself is challenged, and market forces move swiftly around sickly, depreciating inhibitors. The press conferences of someone like Bernanke would become less and less important, because the currency he printed would be used in narrower and narrower circles. Instead of fighting the government, Bitcoin enables individuals to sidestep it - to ignore it to a large degree. Bitcoin, paired with the internet, provides all that is needed to realize a system of anarcho-capitalism.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://coinabul.com/images/bitcoin_flyer5.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://coinabul.com/images/bitcoin_flyer5.png&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; width=&quot;247&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;After all, what power would the Zimbabwe government have if its people had had Bitcoin in their communities - money they could hide and spend via cell phones and email accounts. What cause would there be in Greece to riot at the ECB mandates when the country can abandon the euro in favor of a money that each of them controls unto themselves. And from where would the US get the resources to deficit-finance its wars and welfare programs when it no longer has the ability to print money and pay back debt with debased currency? Like a gold standard, Bitcoin shackles a government and forces it to subsist only on what it can tax openly and legitimately borrow, but unlike a gold standard, Bitcoin doesn&#39;t require any official status to become a standard. The market can arrive at the standard sans government approval, again because it works elegantly both for storage and transfer and it cannot be stopped because it exists in decentralized form.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;We see that along Bitcoin&#39;s growth and adoption curve, some exciting and quite revolutionary possibilities occur. Instead of trying to change governments with a useless vote, or pathetic pleading, we merely abandon the government&#39;s powerbase - the power derived from control of exchange and currency. The awkward inconveniences and growing pains of this new monetary system should be easily outweighed by the gift given to the noble cause of liberty if it should succeed.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Time for a reality check. A prudent person should assume Bitcoin will fail, if for no other reason than that most new things fail. But, there is a very real chance it will succeed, and this chance is increased with every new user, every new business, and every new system developed within the Bitcoin economy. The ramifications of success are extraordinary, and it is thus worth at least a cursory review by any advocate of liberty, not just in the US but around the world.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Spend some time with Bitcoin.

The “coins” themselves are encrypted codes, and they exist on users’ physical computers stored in a “wallet” file. It’s like cash in your pocket. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;But unlike cash, an owner of Bitcoins can literally send her coins to someone else anywhere, anytime, with no transaction cost, no “clearing house” that might freeze or impede the transfer, and total anonymity. Review that sentence again and you’ll understand why Bitcoin is a big deal. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;There are a few caveats: “instant” really means “up to an hour,” and one may pay a small fee (much less than 1%) to have a transaction processed more quickly. Anonymity can be achieved with basic precautions, but is not fool&lt;span class=&quot;msoDel&quot;&gt;&lt;del cite=&quot;mailto:Kristen&quot; datetime=&quot;2011-06-01T16:50&quot;&gt;&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;msoDel&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;proof. Backing up one’s wallet is also recommended, as Bitcoins can be lost forever (again, like cash).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;So Bitcoins are special codes that can be traded securely from one computer to another over the internet. But does that make it a “money?” &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;Bitcoins as Money&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;For something to be used as money, it must be valuable. Why are Bitcoins valuable? Why would anyone want them in the first place? The answer is simply that they possess the very attributes that make any medium effective as money, just as the attributes of gold and silver make them monetarily useful. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;Just like gold and silver, Bitcoins are divisible (down to eight decimal places, actually), homogenous (every Bitcoin is equal), durable (they don’t decay), portable (extremely), identifiable (hard to counterfeit), and scarce. Unlike gold and silver, Bitcoins can be transferred across the world instantaneously and a zillion dollars-worth can fit in your pocket.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;On the topic of scarcity, there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoins in the universe, 6 million of which exist currently. The mechanism by which they’re produced isn’t crucial for this introduction, but it’s important to understand that Bitcoins are produced on a &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;predictable&lt;/i&gt; pattern of &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;diminishing&lt;/i&gt; inflation (whereby inflation will end at zero percent). The USD and all fiat currencies, by comparison, are produced on an &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;unpredictable&lt;/i&gt; pattern of &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;increasing&lt;/i&gt; inflation (whereby the currency itself will end at zero value). Anyone who dislikes having their wealth stolen from them by a central bank may well be interested in this feature.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;Enough econ talk, we understand that these nerdy Bitcoins can be effectively used as money, but who cares? &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Governments&lt;/i&gt; will care, and this is where the idea gets interesting.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;Bitcoins and Governments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;You can be sure that Bitcoin will be impugned for enabling illicit activities. Drugs, gambling, prostitution – &amp;nbsp;all these industries (and others that are actually bad) could benefit from using the new money. And yet, plastic baggies make the drug trade more efficient; &amp;nbsp;playing cards enable gambling; discount hotels drop the transaction costs of prostitution –&amp;nbsp; should the mere fact that a particular invention advances a distasteful industry make the invention itself distasteful? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;Effective tools can be used for both good and bad behavior, and only a fool would try to ban the tool itself . &amp;nbsp;We can thus expect that Congress will try to ban Bitcoin– sacrificing the good it will do for people and markets in order to reduce the harm to central banks and fiat currencies.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;Yet fixating on the illicit uses distracts us from a more important discourse. To truly understand the revolutionary nature of Bitcoin, one’s focus should be squarely on its decentralization. There is no central organization keeping track of transactions. That important function is handled by the peer-to-peer network &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;as a whole&lt;/i&gt;. This means the government may not stop Bitcoin usage without shutting down the entire internet (though it could certainly try to prosecute vendors who publicly accepted Bitcoins – and this is no minor concern in the U.S.S.A.). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;This decentralization also means the government cannot inflate or otherwise “manage” the money supply.&amp;nbsp; It cannot centrally control the most crucial part of an economy – its monetary system. In fact, the government can’t even determine who possesses Bitcoins, so long as the user is careful with her identity. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WgiNgLtLPH4/Teld3oFwmGI/AAAAAAAABys/j5CgFhkcI7U/s1600/burning-money.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WgiNgLtLPH4/Teld3oFwmGI/AAAAAAAABys/j5CgFhkcI7U/s200/burning-money.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Bitcoin enables users to realize true monetary freedom and privacy, with all the benefits and concerns inherent in such a system. Free markets and free people (redundant terms) everywhere should rejoice.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;Others will be less enthused. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;Central planners will be infuriated by the crippling effect of Bitcoin on their authority and ability to control. Bernanke will complain at the sudden loss of the Fed’s economic hegemony.&amp;nbsp; There will be YouTube videos of Geithner tilting his head forward and looking serious as he addresses Congress. Paul Krugman may throw a tantrum. His paper, the New York Times, will explore how Bitcoins hurt the children and kill old people. The pretty girls on Fox News won’t get it until Bitcoins arrive in the mail as credit cards. The banking cartels – perpetually in bed with the government – will not be pleased. The IRS? Let&#39;s just say its thievery will be more difficult.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;One can imagine that every authoritative force in the world may bear down on Bitcoin if it grows in popularity. The countervailing power will be capitalism itself – the incessant need of men to produce and trade toward efficiency with effective and honest money. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;The Real Impact of Bitcoins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;In the same way that “a nation of laws” is preferable to a “nation of men,” an economy of lawful money is preferable to an economy of fiat. Lawfulness is here derived from a kind of natural law written into the coding of Bitcoin – and this natural law cannot be manipulated at the whim of anyone, no matter how benevolent and wise they perceive themselves to be. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;With Bitcoin, a man in London can send his friend in China a payment at the click of a button and the exchange is between the two of them, administered by the entire peer-to-peer network. The full value sent by one is received immediately by the other. The exchange doesn’t pass through a bank, nor through PayPal. It doesn’t pass through border check points, nor the clutches of hungry and murderous governments. It’s not carried via courier nor armored truck. It is efficient.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;Bitcoin enables a kind of global free market that has never been possible before, and it arrives at the twilight of the United States’ fiat dollar.

My question is, what’s wrong with the other half?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/TO6es3n2uTI/AAAAAAAABv8/jZXmxottoNs/s1600/landofthefree.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/TO6es3n2uTI/AAAAAAAABv8/jZXmxottoNs/s320/landofthefree.jpg&quot; width=&quot;206&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Never mind the fact that since 9/11 the TSA has spent billions and delayed millions and caught not a single terrorist, the actors in the transportation security circus now fondle children, grope women, and embarrass the elderly who may have lingering memories of a time when an American’s body was still his own – yet half the nation bows down and bends over, with a smile on its face and a flag in its hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this is explainable on the grounds that at least 1 in 2 hasn’t yet flown under such conditions, but I doubt that’s the reason. The real explanation is that the sheeple believe such procedures – while admittedly invasive – make us safer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether the body scans or TSA grope-fests make us safer is not the point. Let us stop debating the effectiveness of such tools, for this detracts from a more important issue entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let’s assume these new “security” procedures work as intended. Let’s assume it could be proven that such tactics, invasive as they are, reduced the risk of terrorism by a significant degree. Is such invasion, such treason against the 4th Amendment, justified if it makes us safer? Is “effectiveness” the test of what makes a search and seizure “reasonable?” That is the real question, and that’s what the country needs to review with due haste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For if the test of appropriate government intervention is whether or not we are thereby made safer, then should we not expect a steady kaleidoscope of new security transgressions deployed as threats continue? Should we not expect an endless parade of shiny security innovations, each conveniently rolled-out after the modest outrage from the former has subsided?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, safety can always be furthered by increasing restrictions on risky behavior. Can one not always be made safer by being locked in a sealed room? Is there not always some new place to put a camera? London is currently attempting to answer this very question – over a million security cameras and counting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the porno scanners make us safer at airports, then why on Earth do we not install them at train stations (already proposed by Big Sis)? Why are we not groped at malls; do we not spend more time there than in the sky? Why not strip down for daily entry into our large commercial towers; for do they not hold more people than a mere aircraft? And the schools! Our children should be protected, above all. We ought to grope them all to keep them safe, for why should this logic apply only at airports? And consider all the new TSA jobs we could create to help the economy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet as troubling as the porno scanners and gropings may be (a choice nearly as worthless as selecting from the nation’s two wretched political parties), let’s consider the possibility that technology may improve. Imaging will get better. When the new scanners which see into every layer of skin are released on the market, and provide their images in full HD color – thus making the TSA more effective and efficient– would it not be foolishly imprudent to resist the installation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If indeed safety is the litmus test of intervention, shall we not be overjoyed in 20 years to accept mind scanners at every busy intersection? Reading thoughts, or simply sensing motivations, would immensely help the police protect and serve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where does this line get drawn, or will it not be? And more importantly, why would we – a supposedly free people (does that mean anything anymore?) – allow such lines to be drawn by the largest, most intricate, convoluted, and powerful government ever hatched from the good intentions of well-mannered politicians? Are we so dim, so shortsighted, so naive as to see no problem with this? Only half the country is upset, and what percentage of these justified critics intends genuine resistance, I wonder?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our nation has nurtured a gross and dangerous lack of resistance in the face of diktat – at best, we passionately grumble. What evidence is there that any future transgression will be resisted with any resolve? There is little. Answer this, has the government’s oversight ever shrunk? And what future may be reasonably foreseen under circumstances in which a government believes its role to be the reduction of risk, and half the citizenry cheers this coddling paternalism, while the other half does little more than moan at the television? Nineteen eighty-four does not suddenly happen on the first of January.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/feeds/7264558333697483910/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=513710724906503704&amp;postID=7264558333697483910&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/7264558333697483910'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/7264558333697483910'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/2010/11/one-small-step-for-tsa-one-giant-leap.html' title='The More Important Question'/><author><name>Erik Voorhees</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01780045950459697961</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='28' height='32' src='http://bp2.blogger.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/R5sK0XtoHvI/AAAAAAAAAA8/NMS9qZv6DOA/S220/self-photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/TO6es3n2uTI/AAAAAAAABv8/jZXmxottoNs/s72-c/landofthefree.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-513710724906503704.post-9190777538212082478</id><published>2010-09-23T05:12:00.008+04:00</published><updated>2010-09-27T02:44:36.004+04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Paul Krugman"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Political Theory"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Taxation"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="The Poor"/><title type='text'>Response to Krugman – “The Angry Rich”</title><content type='html'>Paul Krugman recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/20/opinion/20krugman.html?_r=3&amp;amp;hp&quot;&gt;clawed an NYT piece&lt;/a&gt; entitled, “The Angry Rich.” In his puffy I-don’t-know-where-money-comes-from-so-I’ll-critique-it-in-order-to acquire-some-of-it-myself tone, the tyrannical pop culture Nobel Laureate advances the idea that wealthy people are entirely unjustified in their anger toward the government – anger arising from the “modestly higher taxes” which are headed their way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/TJqqK8pLD6I/AAAAAAAABvM/Fk6QFlTrGKQ/s1600/ts-krugman-190.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/TJqqK8pLD6I/AAAAAAAABvM/Fk6QFlTrGKQ/s320/ts-krugman-190.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The Princeton Prince assures us that the landed gentry is being much too noisy and wholly inappropriate, for in a proper society there should be no brouhaha coming from that direction – they go golfing, after all. Only the poor are justified in their complaints, because they are “underprivileged.” The woman who finds herself with a healthy bank account should bend over, drop the overpriced designer skirt, and take it for the collective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Krugman’s world, resources belong with those who don’t yet have them – so long as they’re Americans. If we discover a woman with a nice house and fancy car, and a man with torn jeans, a ’98 Taurus, and five children forced to share only one Xbox between the lot of them, Krugman will ensure that the privileged woman gives of herself freely… for she has much to give. If he’s lucky, maybe the man will then be blessed with a sixth child, and then have even further claim to the labors of others. To be fair, Krugman wouldn’t force the woman to strip down entirely – only 39% of her marginal assets need be removed.  She can leave her Prada heels on, if she so pleases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The right to property, whether speaking of one’s own body or the product thereof, is of no concern to Krugman. To people like him, property is rightly owned by the collective – again, so long as that collective is American. Of course, the property wasn’t produced by the collective, but that doesn’t seem to matter. From each according to her ability, to each according to his need… and there’s a lot of need. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But upon any academic examination of “need,” one will find the term to be almost meaningless. What is needed by humans? Some food, some water, some shelter, and an Xbox. Americans, even the poorest of them, already have these things. The strict needs of 99.99999% of Americans are met. The fact that, beyond these needs, many Americans don’t have the job they want, the car they want, or enough cash to spend both on movie nights and fresh vegetables from the fertile fields of Italy doesn’t make them “in need.” Rather, they are, like all humans both rich and poor, simply “in want” – a perpetual condition that no increase in marginal tax rates will alleviate.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Krugman really cared for the poor, for those truly in “need,” he would be eyeing the comfy $30,000 made by blue-collar Americans. That kind of income is WAY more than anyone needs, but it’s not enough for what everyone wants – and that is what truly bothers Krugman. Indeed, there are starving children in Africa, and starving not in the sense that their Twinkies have run out, but starving in the sense that they’re dying and will soon be rotting in the streets (made even more tragic by the fact that they’re then unable to continue plowing the fields and sewing the blue collars for the “poor” Americans). Poor is relative, and anyone who has traveled even a week abroad knows that Americans are not poor – even the poor ones. Krugman is not advocating for those in poverty, he’s advocating for those in wealth… but those who just don’t have as much wealth as Krugman arbitrarily deems appropriate for his utopian hive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Krugman’s festering antagonism towards those who produce vast quantities of valuable things –value being evidenced by the fact that others are willing to voluntarily exchange their own wealth in return –  is, frankly, pathetic. Citing Oliver Wendell Holmes, Krugman asserts that “taxes are what we pay for civilized society.” I’ll cite myself here and suggest that forced servitude, aka taxation, is precisely anti-civil. A society is civilized to the extent that force is avoided. The very march of civilization has been a prolonged and noble struggle against force – it’s wrong to murder, it’s wrong to steal, it’s wrong to enslave… but it’s just fine to partially enslave so long as Oliver Wendell Holmes stamps it with approval? Force is the antithesis of civility, not its beacon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here’s a little hint for you, Krugman. Perhaps the rich aren’t angry just because their marginal tax rate is going from 37.5% to 39%.  Perhaps they’re angry because they’re increasingly realizing that almost the entire 39% they’re forced at gunpoint to surrender to your preferred collectivist regime ends up not as the tuition for underprivileged youth, but as the piggy bank for the most wasteful, inefficient, lying, cheating, corrupt, militaristic empire that has ever existed in the history of the Earth. I’m sure the wealthy would gladly part with more of their income if they could hope to receive something of value in return. The fact that you have to wrest it from them under threat of imprisonment is indicative of the nature of your operation. Pizza Hut doesn’t have to point a gun to your head, because what they serve is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, perhaps the rich do owe their pound of flesh to the hive… how ought we determine the proper amount of flesh?  How much of herself must the wealthy woman surrender to you, Krugman, before you’re satisfied with her sacrifice? To how many hours of her day are you entitled? Why must she go without 39% of the product of her body, merely because a bunch of men in Washington deem it so? Is it because other people voted those men into power? Being in power, as they are, are they entitled perhaps to 50% of the woman’s efforts, so long as the majority – along with Oliver Wendell Holmes – agrees? What about 80%? And yes, slippery slope arguments are legitimate when you’re pushing people down a hill… so could, perhaps, the majority rightly vote away 100% of the lady’s efforts so long as it was “for a good cause?” Does any cause justify enslavement? Does the cause of alleviating starving cannibals justify the pushing of a fat, tasty man down a hill? No? What if the cannibals have hungry children and a mortgage?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why is it that the wealthy be forced to give the product of their labor to the less wealthy in America, but the less wealthy in America need not be forced to hand over their goods to the truly poor in Mexico? And why should the Mexicans get cars when the Nigerians have no food? What right does the Nigerian have to three meals when the Chinese peasant hasn’t but two? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are people suffering, are there not? Is there not someone in need who could send their child to school for the mere price of your laptop, Mr. Krugman? How many Somalis-worth does your apartment cost per month? That photo of you in the New York Times – what ludicrous sum was paid to the photographer? Is it really equitable to have such a pompous and wholly unnecessary visage printed when hundreds of children have starved to death in the time it takes to enduringly wade through your hypocritical editorial?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your concern for the poor ends, Krugman, when you force others to be charitable in your place. It ends when you advocate the enslavement of those who produce more than they consume in order to coddle those who consume more than they produce. It ends when you decide it’s okay to point a gun at someone so long as they earn over 250,000 shreds of fiat toilet paper per year. It ends when you forget that anyone owning a house, a car, refrigeration, cable television, a cell phone, a waste disposal system, running water, soap, and an Xbox is living at some level of luxury, by any objective measure of humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So long as you have food to spare, don’t steal it from your neighbor… and if you ever run out of food to spare, try producing something of value, for once, and then feel free to donate it to a deserving individual. I would praise you for that, for you would then be a man, instead of a shivering, lecherous coward crouched behind the force of government while waiving your transparent flag of feigned philanthropy.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/feeds/9190777538212082478/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=513710724906503704&amp;postID=9190777538212082478&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/9190777538212082478'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/9190777538212082478'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/2010/09/response-to-krugman-angry-rich.html' title='Response to Krugman – “The Angry Rich”'/><author><name>Erik Voorhees</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01780045950459697961</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='28' height='32' src='http://bp2.blogger.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/R5sK0XtoHvI/AAAAAAAAAA8/NMS9qZv6DOA/S220/self-photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/TJqqK8pLD6I/AAAAAAAABvM/Fk6QFlTrGKQ/s72-c/ts-krugman-190.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-513710724906503704.post-5651024980588230958</id><published>2010-09-19T01:16:00.016+04:00</published><updated>2010-09-19T01:43:45.488+04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Buying Local"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Economics"/><title type='text'>A Troubling Affinity for Localism</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/TJUwl8sKzFI/AAAAAAAABuo/B8UgcmhmGOM/s1600/BuyLocalSimpleL.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/TJUwl8sKzFI/AAAAAAAABuo/B8UgcmhmGOM/s320/BuyLocalSimpleL.jpg&quot; width=&quot;277&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;For a long time, the people with whom I most closely related on issues of economics and politics were those who understood and advocated free trade in every aspect of life. Free trade, we agreed, was not only legitimate for moral reasons (i.e. it’s wrong to point a gun at someone and force them not to exchange their labor or property with someone else), but also for economic reasons (i.e. more wealth tends to be produced under circumstances of freedom).  Thus, my ideological comrades were very supportive of such things as outsourcing, international trade and finance, and multi-national corporations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, as I’ve become more involved with the liberty movement, I’m increasingly observing those who, for some reason, advocate free trade while at the same time encouraging each other to “buy local.”  Go local, buy local, is the motto.  This has concerned me, because such talk tends to come from the leftist hippie-commune types – those who ardently oppose international trade and capitalism – those anti-Wal-Mart crusaders who believe the proper role of business is to make as little profit as possible, hire as many people as seek to be hired, and grow only to the extent that their carbon footprint remains neutral.  So, why are my uber-capitalist colleagues now advocating the “buy local” message right along with the hippies? What has happened?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To avoid broad generalizations, I’ll point out that those most likely to advocate localism tend to be those who promote precious metals as real money (a label I would happily affix to myself, if asked).  Proof of this theory is even stamped on many of the AOCS silver coins – go local, buy local. Why is it that these unapologetic capitalists, who have come so far to understand the evils of fiat currency, suddenly about-face and stamp leftist rhetoric on the very foundation of freedom – sound money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t really have an answer to this question, but my guess is that these types of people have become acutely aware of the fact that the larger a company grows, the further it slides into bed with the state. This sentiment is certainly true… the lobbying, the special favors, the exemptions and privileged rules, the subsidies and the downright protectionism for incumbent organizations is a nasty blemish on what many still consider to be a capitalist country (how wrong they are). So I suppose, by association, that because the biggest companies are the most connected with government, and because government is the root of most evil, these radical capitalists have adopted the idea that large firms simply shouldn’t be supported, and that a prudent and principled free marketeer will choose instead to purchase from smaller, more local, less government-entwined companies. Thus, buying local becomes a pure expression of capitalist sentiment – a revolt against the corporatism pervading every modern nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if that’s the reason that “buy local” is stamped on AOCS’ silver coins, then fine.  I understand the reasoning. What if, however, localism is advocated, in part, due to the same “anti-bigness” ideology so emblematic of the left (except, unfortunately, when it comes to government). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ayn Rand writes at length about this sentiment – that many people seem to simply despise “bigness,” and that this hostility arises from a combination of unacknowledged jealousy and the misunderstanding of the process by which wealth is created. For if, in a free market, money is earned only to the extent that one provides a marketable service to others, then the bigger a company gets, the more good it has done – the more wealth it has produced. However, to those who somehow believe that wealth is static and that it’s simply “distributed” amongst people, a large company would indeed represent a problem, for by being large it has by definition acquired wealth at the expense of those who lost it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hope is that my ideological allies don’t suffer from this “anti-bigness” ailment. I hope indeed that they’re able to appreciate the greatness in those people who, by their strength of will, their intelligence, and their creativity, are able to create massive organizations – organizations which manufacture wealth for their owners, employees, and customers. Yet, if that’s the case, then why buy from smaller, local firms? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could this local advocacy arise instead from a misunderstanding of economics? This too, concerns me. For how can someone be so economically aware as to realize the fraud of central banking, yet be so economically ignorant as to believe that “keeping things local” is a wise course of action? These people don’t really believe that hoarding money in a certain geographical area will make them wealthier, do they?  The sad fact is that some do. Today, I stumbled upon the website of the “Northern Colorado Community Barter” organization.  Perhaps this is just some hippie-commune organization, but the fact that they promote AOCS coins means they’re running close to some very free-market circles; circles that are too close for comfort. Some of AOCS’ most popular coins are imprinted with the visages of Mises and Ron Paul, after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This community barter organization states the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“The benefits of keeping money in the community and patronizing local businesses are numerous. Locally spent money generates more local tax revenues leading to improved services. Local businesses employ more people, contribute to local charities, and bring unique character to their communities, making the community a great place to live and visit.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fears, it seems, are indeed true. Economic ignorance – just like that terrible feeling after eating a Happy Meal – is recurring, unyielding, and ever-present.  How can it be that free-market advocates don’t understand the fallacy here? Perhaps the aforementioned organization shouldn’t be considered free-market, but then why are they promoting the usage of metals as currency, for in so doing they deprive the state of its ability to print money for the poor and underprivileged? If they’re not free-market, how can they advocate metals? If they are free-market, why in the world would they make a claim such as that quoted above?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think what’s really going on here is yet another incidence of Bastiat’s “unseen” – the thrust of which suggests how people tend not to account for costs which are not visible. An easy example is the public sports stadium: people see the monolithic structure and praise the government for constructing it, yet the taxed wealth extracted from the city’s citizenry is now no longer able to be spent on other things – new companies, new ideas, new advances. These missing things are the “unseen” and so far as they are missing from public view, the public doesn’t realize they were lost. This fallacy pervades all public expenditures, sadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how is localism related to the “unseen?”  Simply this – by buying local, one is sacrificing either A) quality or B) price. This must be true, for if the local product was a higher quality, or a better price, then people would buy it naturally, and a call to “go local, buy local” would be wholly unnecessary.  Indeed, such slogans are required only to the extent that a local product is inferior – superior goods require little such propaganda. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The “unseen” is thus the value lost by the consumer – it is that value or wealth which otherwise would’ve existed had the superior product been purchased in lieu of the local product. However, this is just half of the unseen, for when a foreign product is purchased, the compensation or revenue earned from the sale is sent to a faraway land. The benefits of that revenue to the producer are not seen by the consumer or his community, simply because they don’t live “over there.” The happy Chinese family – now with food on the table and a new pair of shoes – is not ever known, in any visceral sense, to the community in which the purchaser lives. This unseen wealth causes the purchaser to discount the reciprocating utility of his purchase, and makes him more sympathetic to those community organizations advocating localism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the honest observer should realize that by buying local, more benefit is “seen,” even though less benefit is created. In trade, every transaction creates value (for the most part), and by buying local one is cordoning that value into a smaller geographic area – an area more easily witnessed by one’s neighbors. Yet, by sacrificing price or quality for more “seen” value, the net effect must be negative relative to the consumer who seeks out superior products over those produced locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A critic here may direct my attention back to the quotation from the Northern Colorado Community Barter organization:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Locally spent money generates more local tax revenues leading to improved services. Local businesses employ more people, contribute to local charities, and bring unique character to their communities, making the community a great place to live and visit.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I don’t want more tax revenue to be generated at all, but that’s a separate issue. Assuming tax revenue is a good thing, the organization’s statement simply strengthens my point. It is because these benefits are seen in the local community that observers advocate localism. But unseen are the tax revenues, charities, and unique character of foreigners which will no longer be realized – even though the foreigner is producing the better product. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/TJUwxlcYw2I/AAAAAAAABuw/Qx0ZvNptZzo/s1600/buy_local_poster.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/TJUwxlcYw2I/AAAAAAAABuw/Qx0ZvNptZzo/s320/buy_local_poster.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Once analyzed objectively, the issue betrays an embarrassing argument on the part of localists – that a certain community should benefit because it is nearby at the expense of a community further away producing superior work. Of course, we all want our own communities to thrive, but is it not a tad disingenuous, or even xenophobic, to advocate behavior which benefits our people at the expense of more deserving people further away?  That shouldn’t sit right, especially with any “we love the world” leftists unfortunate enough to be reading this piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things being equal, if the Chinese producer and the local producer create the same quality item at the same price, there is no reason not to give the business to your neighbor. It is an arbitrary decision, and a slight whim of deference towards those you know harms nobody at the margin. But alternatively, if the Chinese producer creates the superior product, then to give the business to your neighbor implies, at least tacitly, that he is more deserving that the Chinese. Why should that be the case?  What’s more, the local supplier usually isn’t even one’s neighbor, but rather a stranger who happens to reside somewhat nearby. So to give the nearby stranger the business at the expense of the far away stranger who produces more effectively is to make some kind of value judgement that an ethical person may want to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there is the moral problem with localism, but there is also a logical problem. If indeed we should buy local in order to support those communities which are closest to us, then why stop at the state or town level?  Why should we not prefer to buy from our own neighborhood? Or, even better, let’s try to purchase only from those on our street. The most enlightened of us can purchase solely from our own household, and reaching localist nirvana would simply mean producing all goods oneself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When focusing in closer than a state level, the absurdity of localism should become clear. Of course you shouldn’t try to produce everything yourself… you’d be inefficient at everything and, on net, be much poorer than if you specialized and traded with your neighbor. As this should be self-evident, then of course a community shouldn’t try to trade with itself, but rather should specialize and trade with other communities. A state should trade with other states, a nation with other nations, and indeed our world should trade with other worlds to the extent we can make such fortunate contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Localism is one of those economic superstitions – like the broken window fallacy – that for some reason continues to trick people into irrationality. It is a great thing to support ones neighbor, but that greatness dwindles quickly when you account for the support no longer going to someone else’s neighbor – and in this day and age, probably a much more deserving, hardworking, and underprivileged neighbor in Asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have little hope for the Colorado Community Barter Organization, perhaps those kindred spirits who advocate liberty and sound money will realize their misguided affinity for localism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy the best products at the best prices – give your business to that producer who is most deserving. If it’s your neighbor, buy from him… but don’t buy from him simply because he’s your neighbor.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/feeds/5651024980588230958/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=513710724906503704&amp;postID=5651024980588230958&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/5651024980588230958'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/5651024980588230958'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/2010/09/troubling-affinity-for-localism.html' title='A Troubling Affinity for Localism'/><author><name>Erik Voorhees</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01780045950459697961</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='28' height='32' src='http://bp2.blogger.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/R5sK0XtoHvI/AAAAAAAAAA8/NMS9qZv6DOA/S220/self-photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/TJUwl8sKzFI/AAAAAAAABuo/B8UgcmhmGOM/s72-c/BuyLocalSimpleL.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-513710724906503704.post-8752804123963514228</id><published>2010-07-23T22:04:00.003+04:00</published><updated>2010-07-23T22:18:52.960+04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Economics"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Gold"/><title type='text'>On the Intrinsic Value of Precious Metals</title><content type='html'>&lt;meta content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot; http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&gt;&lt;/meta&gt;&lt;meta content=&quot;Word.Document&quot; name=&quot;ProgId&quot;&gt;&lt;/meta&gt;&lt;meta content=&quot;Microsoft Word 12&quot; name=&quot;Generator&quot;&gt;&lt;/meta&gt;&lt;meta content=&quot;Microsoft Word 12&quot; name=&quot;Originator&quot;&gt;&lt;/meta&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;file:///C:%5CUsers%5CErik%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml&quot; rel=&quot;File-List&quot;&gt;&lt;/link&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;file:///C:%5CUsers%5CErik%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_themedata.thmx&quot; rel=&quot;themeData&quot;&gt;&lt;/link&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;file:///C:%5CUsers%5CErik%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_colorschememapping.xml&quot; rel=&quot;colorSchemeMapping&quot;&gt;&lt;/link&gt;&lt;style&gt; &lt;!--  /* Font Definitions */  @font-face 	{font-family:&quot;Cambria Math&quot;; 	panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; 	mso-font-charset:0; 	mso-generic-font-family:roman; 	mso-font-pitch:variable; 	mso-font-signature:-1610611985 1107304683 0 0 159 0;} @font-face 	{font-family:Calibri; 	panose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; 	mso-font-charset:0; 	mso-generic-font-family:swiss; 	mso-font-pitch:variable; 	mso-font-signature:-1610611985 1073750139 0 0 159 0;}  /* Style Definitions */  p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal 	{mso-style-unhide:no; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:&quot;&quot;; 	margin-top:0in; 	margin-right:0in; 	margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; 	mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; 	mso-bidi-language:EN-US;} .MsoChpDefault 	{mso-style-type:export-only; 	mso-default-props:yes; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; 	mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; 	mso-bidi-language:EN-US;} .MsoPapDefault 	{mso-style-type:export-only; 	margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	line-height:115%;} @page WordSection1 	{size:8.5in 11.0in; 	margin:1.0in 1.0in 1.0in 1.0in; 	mso-header-margin:.5in; 	mso-footer-margin:.5in; 	mso-paper-source:0;} div.WordSection1 	{page:WordSection1;} --&gt; &lt;/style&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;It is often said that precious metals have no intrinsic value, and thus the man who claims it as a safe asset and store of wealth has been mislead by superstition. Economists, financial advisors, and politicians of all stripes perpetuate this sentiment. Gold, they claim, is just like anything else – it’s only valuable to the extent to which it’s trusted by people. Yet, this is not quite accurate. Gold, silver, and other precious metals do indeed have intrinsic value, and it’s time for the source of this value to be understood. Certainly, financial experts have no excuse for ignorance on this subject. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;To understand the value of precious metals, let’s first examine other commodities. Most commodities have an obvious intrinsic value. Lumber can be used to build houses and furniture, grain can be used as food, and oil for energy and a variety of industrial purposes. Spectators are quite able to see the intrinsic value in these things. No reasoned individual would claim that oil is simply a shiny goo, valuable only because people “have faith” in it. It is valuable because it can be turned to gasoline and, when combined with an automobile, is able to convey you and all your stuff across vast distances. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Likewise, it is not from mere faith that grain derives its value, nor from trust and international contract that lumber commands a price on the market. Value in these commodities is clear and demonstrable, and it summons no great mental effort to comprehend.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;But where is the intrinsic value of gold? Or silver? One can’t build houses, nor eat, nor drive a car with these commodities – their value must come from elsewhere. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/TEnc8TTGTVI/AAAAAAAAAfU/gKfIMbWThVA/s1600/bullion.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/TEnc8TTGTVI/AAAAAAAAAfU/gKfIMbWThVA/s320/bullion.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;To be sure, gold is shiny and has long been used in the crafting of jewelry and ornamentation. It is always desired for these purposes. However, few wars have been fought over pearls, which also make lovely jewelry. No, it is neither the glimmering earrings nor necklaces which comprise the majority of gold’s intrinsic value. It is something else. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;As to silver, we know it as a wonderful conductor of electricity. As such, the metal has intrinsic value in the production of circuits and electronics. Yet, this benefit was entirely irrelevant for most of man’s history, yet silver has always been precious. Like gold, the intrinsic value of silver must come from something other than these obvious societal uses. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;So where do precious metals get their value? &lt;b&gt;Their value derives from nothing less than their efficacy as a medium of exchange – as a money.&lt;/b&gt; It may sound weird at first, or perhaps tautological, to claim that gold is valuable because it can be used as value, but this is precisely the point. Precious metals, by their natural characteristics, are simply those commodities which are best suited to be used as money. A brief examination readily testifies the point.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Ponder, for a minute, what possible product on Earth could be used as money? Technically, anything could be used as money. We could all trade with cattle, or with sand, or with venti mocha lattés. But, what is it about these things which make them impractical as money? Cattle die, for starters, which is not ideal for savings. Sand is too plentiful… try to buy an ice cream cone with sand. You will need much of it. Venti mocha lattes are the most valuable per ounce, but they get cold, and will certainly expire with time. Continue this thought experiment with other items – you will come to realize that most things, while very useful for certain purposes, are lousy as money.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Eventually, you will stumble upon gold, and you will realize that it works beautifully as money. It is durable (it never rots or rusts), it is divisible and combinable (unlike diamonds), it is homogeneous (every ounce is the same as every other – unlike cigarettes, seashells, and birthday cakes), and it is scarce (unlike sand or grain). &amp;nbsp;Silver mirrors these attributes, though it seems to be less scarce and thus less valuable per ounce.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;It should then become apparent that gold has intrinsic value because of its natural properties and the circumstantial geological composition of the Earth. Perhaps on another planet, if gold extended forth from every hillside, it wouldn’t make a practical money, as truckloads would be required for the smallest of purchases. But we’re not on another planet, and thus gold and other precious metals have proven themselves, over thousands of years, as the most &lt;i&gt;effective&lt;/i&gt; money. This is where their intrinsic value comes from.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;How do we then consider these metals against fiat paper currencies (such as US Dollars), which have been the &lt;i&gt;modus operandi&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp; since the gold standard was fully abandoned in the 1970’s? Well, there’s really only one important difference. Dollars can be, and are continually, printed at whim by governments that need to buy the votes of the public. Gold and silver do not suffer the same embarrassment. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;So the next time you hear a commentator state that gold has no intrinsic value, remember what is being overlooked – its ultimate value as money itself.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/feeds/8752804123963514228/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=513710724906503704&amp;postID=8752804123963514228&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/8752804123963514228'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/8752804123963514228'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/2010/07/on-inherent-value-of-precious-metals.html' title='On the Intrinsic Value of Precious Metals'/><author><name>Erik Voorhees</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01780045950459697961</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='28' height='32' src='http://bp2.blogger.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/R5sK0XtoHvI/AAAAAAAAAA8/NMS9qZv6DOA/S220/self-photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/TEnc8TTGTVI/AAAAAAAAAfU/gKfIMbWThVA/s72-c/bullion.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-513710724906503704.post-8659052447945136252</id><published>2010-07-04T23:06:00.000+04:00</published><updated>2010-07-04T23:06:34.700+04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Independence Day"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Political Theory"/><title type='text'>Independence Day, 2010</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/TDDbcxtSTdI/AAAAAAAAAew/NrAq7uJh9XA/s1600/UpsideDownAmericanFlag.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/TDDbcxtSTdI/AAAAAAAAAew/NrAq7uJh9XA/s320/UpsideDownAmericanFlag.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;As the 234th 4th arrives and passes, a prudent and reflective people should consider the meaning of the date, ponder the ramifications of the events which took place, and examine with a certain tenacity whether the goals set forth in those days have been met and maintained. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon such reflection, of immediate and practical alarm is the terminology now used to refer to the occasion. “Independence Day,” as a moniker, is employed rarely, set aside in favor of the much more arbitrary and meaningless “4th of July.”  Why should this be so?  Christmas is not celebrated as “December 25th” and New Year’s not as “January 1st.”  One does not hear of the “January 1st Weekend Holiday Sale.”  Why, then, does a far more important date than those mentioned above – a date (amongst others) when men stood up to tyranny – become reduced to mere Gregorian arrangement?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly, the explanation may be little more than circumstantial. Perhaps there is no good reason for the change in terminology other than that it “simply happened.” Such a position would be more defensible, however, if the citizens of America had upheld the principles of Independence Day elsewhere in their lives and in their government. Yet such principles have not been upheld, but in fact routinely and systematically marginalized, trodden upon, and lambasted to the point where all it takes to now be considered a treasonous extremist by both the government and the public is to carry a gun, protest taxation, and proclaim under the 1st Amendment that one is doing so. Indeed, the opinions espoused by Thomas Jefferson may have, in today’s America, put him in heady competition with bin Laden as enemy combatant number one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sad irony of today’s Independence Day is that one cannot, at the same moment, hold the Declaration of Independence in high regard while also holding in high regard the State under which Americans now trudge. One cannot maintain a straight and honest demeanor while advocating the principles of limited government – so clearly enshrined in the Declaration – while also saluting the leviathan empire of the modern Federal Government. It is no less than intellectual folly to simultaneously advance the principles of liberty while giving consent or credence to the overgrown brambles that suffocate that very concept in a pattern strikingly congruent with the election cycle. Put more simply, one cannot pledge allegiance to the flag without spitting on the very ideas that made those arbitrary colored stripes of cloth worthy of respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The United States of America has many fitting labels, yet the one Americans hold most dear – The Land of the Free – has not been appropriate for some time.  Perhaps one can then understand the subtle change in terminology for this national holiday, as it betrays a tacit admission by the citizenry that independence is no longer found in sufficiency to warrant celebration, and instead the mere historical date of past men’s liberation has become adequate justification for the fireworks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Independence Day to those out there still fighting for freedom.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/feeds/8659052447945136252/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=513710724906503704&amp;postID=8659052447945136252&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/8659052447945136252'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/8659052447945136252'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/2010/07/independence-day-2010.html' title='Independence Day, 2010'/><author><name>Erik Voorhees</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01780045950459697961</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='28' height='32' src='http://bp2.blogger.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/R5sK0XtoHvI/AAAAAAAAAA8/NMS9qZv6DOA/S220/self-photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/TDDbcxtSTdI/AAAAAAAAAew/NrAq7uJh9XA/s72-c/UpsideDownAmericanFlag.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-513710724906503704.post-8384517630086732805</id><published>2010-04-28T10:06:00.002+04:00</published><updated>2010-07-28T05:12:59.455+04:00</updated><title type='text'>Response to “Pay Inequality”</title><content type='html'>&lt;link href=&quot;file:///C:%5CUsers%5CErik%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml&quot;

width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Almost every time I visit Digg.com to learn about interesting stories, I inevitably come across the most absurd and foolish articles regarding politics and/or the economy.&amp;nbsp; I literally get a sick feeling, because I see these articles and read the comments – hundreds of readers cheering on ignorance with the vapid moral superiority and smugness of Gore &amp;amp; Co.&amp;nbsp; So, I don’t often visit Digg anymore, but today I went back, only to find this:&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://digg.com/d31OkJ3&quot;&gt;http://digg.com/d31OkJ3 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The article is called, “Pay inequities hurt America.” The thesis, obviously, is that because CEO’s tend to make large multiples more than base-wage workers, the moral fabric of society is being torn asunder. The author suggests that it is unfair, morally wrong, and economically harmful for such CEO’s to take home so much money while the working man struggles beneath his Versace shoe.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;First of all, let’s abolish this idea of “the working man.” This term is deceitful and absurd, for of all those who “go to work” it only refers to those who have been unsuccessful in their career advancement. Why is it that the most successful of working men suddenly are no longer able to assume that label? Put in too many hours? You’re no longer a working man. Design something brilliant and revolutionize an industry? You’re no longer a working man. Do something better than average? You won’t be a working man for long!&amp;nbsp; To suggest that “those at the top” are not working – that they are not working men – is to begin the debate upon false pretenses. If this debate is to happen, let us at least employ honest terminology.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;So, to the article, let’s address some key points:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;“The ratio of CEO compensation to average worker pay rose from 24:1 in 1965 to 262:1 in 2005. This rapidly swelling pay divide certainly raises some serious concerns.”&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;I will not debate the statistics, as they are irrelevant (though it’s interesting the author excluded ’05-’09). It matters not whether CEOs make 2x the salary or 2,000,000x the salary because the money paid to CEOs is paid by a company’s Board of Directors. This Board is the elected body of representatives of the shareholders – the owners – of the organization. As the Board represents the owners, it has every right and certainly every responsibility to determine salaries. &amp;nbsp;When the representatives of the company decide to pay X employee Y dollars, they are exercising their property rights. This should be the end of the story, but for some reason it’s not.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;The same principle which permits the “working man” to spend money on the things he values is the exact same principle which, when upheld consistently, permits owners of a company to spend &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; money on those things which &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; value. In the case of CEO pay, the owners desire to compensate at a level according to their own discretion, just as a hungry shopper compensates the grocer for his bread and cheese at his own discretion. If the bread costs too much for the shopper, he will seek it elsewhere. If the CEO charges too much for his services, the owners will seek management talent elsewhere. The right to dispose of one’s property as one wishes must be upheld everywhere if it is to be upheld anywhere.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; To vilify a Board for paying too much for a worker is little different from vilifying a worker for paying too much for his supper.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;It’s worth noting that if a Board is foolish with its resources, the prudent man will be quick to avoid investing in such a company. In a free society, mistakes made by one need not interfere with the more enlightened decisions of an intelligent neighbor.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;“In the first place, pay disproportions of this magnitude may serve to undermine worker morale and motivation and thereby further America’s already growing decline in world competitiveness.”&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;If this assertion were true, would it not logically mean that the less a CEO was paid, the more motivated his subordinates would be? If all workers received equal compensation, might we expect a sudden surge in moral, because it would be “equitable?”&amp;nbsp; Perhaps if pay was simply inverted – so that entry workers made the most and CEOs were paid minimum wage – that would usher in a new era of American economic dominance? I can imagine how empowered the staff would feel, knowing that every time they were promoted they’d have to move into a smaller apartment.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The author, concerned as he is for worker morale, should examine the money removed from each paycheck by Washington, which has conjured up an almost unlimited number of uses for that money over the past century. How much does the “working man” lose to Social Security taxes, to Medicare taxes, to income taxes? How much more does he subsequently lose to sales taxes, to property taxes, to state and local taxes? How much yet again does he lose to the hidden costs of regulation priced into the goods he buys? How much does he lose to the Federal Reserve, every time a new dollar is printed and his savings usurped? How much money never sees his paycheck because his employer suffers a similar burden and must reduce costs where he can? To be sure, the aforementioned costs are not created by greedy CEO’s, no matter how big their “pay multiple.” If one is concerned about the worker’s morale, one may want to point the finger at the man stealing such a portion from his paycheck, not at the man providing what’s left of it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Finally, since in many cases these senior executives have also been the ones who enact the layoffs of millions of American workers, this compensation unfairness spreads damage far beyond the walls of the individual firms involved.”&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Nevermind that the same senior executives also created the jobs in the first place. Nevermind that these senior executives are bound by the same laws of scarcity which affect all human activity. Nevermind that the combined salaries of those laid off vastly exceed the salary of these executives, and therefore a drastic reduction in CEO compensation would do almost nothing to prevent the necessity of broader layoffs.&amp;nbsp; Nevermind that these senior executives are determining the usage of their own resources, just as a family decides what to grow in its garden or how many televisions to keep in its house. Nevermind all that. What’s implied here is that somehow a CEO &lt;i&gt;owes&lt;/i&gt; her fortune to any arbitrary worker whom she hires – that there is an indefinite responsibility to support subordinates.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Somehow, implicitly, the one who has agreed to trade money for services is alleged to be morally responsible to pay &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; money than the employment contract stipulates. Why should anyone be required to perpetuate a contract beyond its mutually agreed duration? If the baker in your town decides one day to close his shop, is there reason to chastise him, simply because you’re burdened to seek out a new source of bread? If the nice man shoveling your driveway after every snowstorm decides, after years of service, to move to Florida, is there cause for confrontation? It seems not the case. In any trade, the two parties are involved because both benefit. The moment one believes he is no longer benefiting is the moment the trade should end. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Upon inspection, an impartial arbiter of a labor severance will notice that neither party can be materially worse off than they were before the employment contract began. When an employee is terminated from employment, it would be difficult to claim that he’d been made worse off by the experience… for if he had been made worse off, he’d surely have terminated his own employment on an earlier day. So how much damage is caused when a firm fires an employee? Not enough damage to outdo the benefits earned while the employment was in progress. No real harm has therefore been done, and those claiming harm are exaggerating the short-term cost of separation and forgetting the long-term benefit of employment.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Just as the shopper may decide to forfeit the services of an expensive local tailor, so too may a business decide to forfeit the services of an expensive employee. Critics may claim, “a minimum wage job can’t be said to be expensive when the CEO makes millions!” To which, of course, the answer is that if the minimum wage employee were producing more than he cost, his termination is unlikely to have occurred. Similarly, if the CEO costs more than he produces, his termination will be imminent. The fact that a Board may not know correctly which is which is good reason to neither work nor invest in said company.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Layoffs create a double taxpayer burden, since laid off workers are no longer able to contribute to, and must now be supported by, the tax base.”&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Laid-off workers do contribute to the tax base so long as they’re buying things (sales tax plus the corporate income tax on the flip side of the transaction) or renting or owning property. However, the more important fallacy in the sentence is that ex-workers “must be supported by the tax base.” First of all, nowhere in the Constitution is the Federal Government authorized to support the unemployed. Again, it should end there, but for some reason it doesn’t. Critics may mention the “General Welfare” clause, to which the proper response is, “so does that mean anything which the Government believes to be for the general welfare is Constitutional?”&amp;nbsp; If so, there would be no point in writing such a document in the first place. Every tyrant in history has abided by its own interpretation of the General Welfare Clause, has it not?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Furthermore, even if Constitutional, the Government does not have to pay the unemployed for their service of doing nothing. The Government chooses to engage in this transgression, but why should an unemployed individual have claim to the income of those still working? He certainly has the right to ask – to petition – his neighbors for help, but certainly not to demand it, certainly not to force it. The unemployed man certainly does not have the right to use the threat of violence to extract the income of those still working, does he? If not, then through what magic does he turn over that right to the Government to do the same on his behalf? It would seem that a right never held by a man could not be surrendered by him to a group of men.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The problem is that the laid-off worker is permitted to be a publicly-funded burden, not that he was laid off. If society is poisoned by his dereliction, then the means of poisoning should be addressed, not the distance from which he poisons. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Thus the question arises whether these executives are increasing their corporate profits – and their own paychecks – at the expense of not just their own employees but also of all working taxpayers.”&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;To address this properly, one must look at the source of the income. The source of the income was not the firing of an employee, but rather the production and sale of a good.&amp;nbsp; It is the &lt;i&gt;expense&lt;/i&gt; of an employee which prevents the profits from otherwise being realized. Removing the expense permits the current owner of that wealth to keep it. The same is true for the “working man” who cuts his ties with the expensive local tailor. The man does not gain his income by ending the relationship; he simply keeps what already was his from a former transaction or would be his from a future transaction. Thus, profits can never be made by firing employees – profits previously earned can simply be retained.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;It is therefore absurd to claim that a business owner is harming taxpayers by shrinking his payroll. On the contrary, the business owner no doubt helped that very group when he sold them his goods. The fact that he wishes to keep the wealth earned through selling such goods is his decision and in no way brings burden upon anyone else. Again, the burden now befalling the terminated worker must necessarily be less than the benefit received during employment, thus his individual burden is a moot point because, on net, benefit was the larger part of the equation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Besides, one need not look far to find the real cause of taxpayer expense. It is not the business owner to whom the taxpayer surrenders his money; it is more accurately the politicians hiding behind a veneer of feigned legitimacy – the Federal Government. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;“&lt;b&gt;After all, aren’t these the same employees whose solid efforts and long hours created their corporations’ profits in the first place?”&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The answer to this is… no.&amp;nbsp; The profit was created through the organization of the resources of production. If it were true that the base employees created the profits, why are they giving them to the executives? Why don’t these same industrious workers head on home and make the same profit for their own family?&amp;nbsp; The reason is that they don’t have the capital goods, nor the organizational resources, nor, frankly, the grand vision and strategy, to produce the same wealth at home as they do when they arrive at the office. By going to work, the employee is able to harness the capital goods and organizational structure to &lt;i&gt;increase&lt;/i&gt; his output. Part of that increased output goes to him, in his paycheck, and part of that increased output goes to the company which provided the capital and organization. An employee can be rightly considered as leasing the capital goods and organizational structure from the shareholders of the company. As his efforts produce more than the cost of the lease, he is able to take home the remainder in the form of a salary.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Consider the workers in a Ford factory. Many believe that they are the ones who build the cars and produce the product, and Michael Moore clearly agrees with them. If true, these workers could certainly leave the treacherous Ford Motor Company and create their own cars, keeping the vast profits for themselves. Of course, they cannot do this because they lack the machines which permit their muscles to lift thousands of pounds. They lack the financing to purchase raw goods. They lack the knowledge of design and engineering. They lack the relationships with 10,000 suppliers of components. They lack the ability to convey the benefits of the product to a potential buyer. They lack the legal resources to navigate and comply with 100,000 pages of government regulations. &amp;nbsp;All these resources are provided by Ford, and the workers are lucky enough to have the benefit – the great advantage – of having access to such resources, which amplifies the productive capacity of their labor and allows them to produce a surplus. Some of this surplus remains with the company and the remainder is taken home in salary.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Profits arise when one can produce and sell a good for more than its cost. So long as fraud was not involved, the profit is legitimate and the producer ought to own the profit outright. All free people are welcome to produce. No CEO has ever prevented his workers from leaving and creating profits elsewhere. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Final Thought&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The issue of CEO pay is one of the great distractions to which people allow themselves to fall victim. Wealth gained by one does not come at the expense of another (so long as it’s honest), and thus one cannot portend that his neighbor’s Ferrari excluded the purchase of his own. Nobody has a right to claim the earnings of another. For the same reason that slavery was wrong – where the full amount of a man’s production was taken by force to feed another man – so too is &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; system which permits a partial amount of one’s production to be forcefully diverted into feeding another. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The “pay multiple” is perhaps an interesting piece of data, but in no way should this multiple cause concern nor should it warrant policy mandates among a free (i.e. capitalist) people.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fullpost&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/feeds/8384517630086732805/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=513710724906503704&amp;postID=8384517630086732805&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/8384517630086732805'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/8384517630086732805'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/2010/04/response-to-pay-inequality.html' title='Response to “Pay Inequality”'/><author><name>Erik Voorhees</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01780045950459697961</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='28' height='32' src='http://bp2.blogger.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/R5sK0XtoHvI/AAAAAAAAAA8/NMS9qZv6DOA/S220/self-photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/S9fQTqCwx0I/AAAAAAAAAes/eXBa_u76wGY/s72-c/house_of_rich_man.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-513710724906503704.post-7237356980669227997</id><published>2010-04-22T03:06:00.003+04:00</published><updated>2010-04-22T05:31:33.713+04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Income Gap"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Political Theory"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Redistribution"/><title type='text'>The Myth of the Income Gap</title><content type='html'>We are routinely subjected to the truism that there exists an “income gap” in America, and that this gap is perpetually growing as the forces of capitalism pry apart the “haves” from the “have-nots.”  The income gap is of great concern to a great many people, if for no other reason than the vivid, chasmatic imagery it elicits. Politicians are prone to lament this gap at every opportunity, quickly following up the frightening metaphor with their intended strategy for narrowing this dastardly, gaping maw of monetary inequity. Too bad, then, that such a gap is nonexistent. It is a myth, and just as we don’t discuss federal unicorn tariff policy nor airport screening for tooth fairies, neither should the income gap merit time in the public discourse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The income gap, as it’s generally considered, refers to the perceived distance between the middle class and the upper class of America in terms of what they earn (how one defines these alleged classes is an entertaining exercise in subjectivity). The impression, amidst many in the United States, is that there is a vast “working class” and “middle class” who are fraternally symbiotic in their race to pay the bills, while resting atop their blood, sweat, and character exist the rich, parasitic elite. The rich elite are somehow removed from humanity on account of their wealth, and they somehow exist as a separate society on the other side of the income gap, safely pent up in their gated communities, and using the poor, dried-up homeless as their preferred source of firewood. As the story goes, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, and thus this fabled chasm grows more expansive year by year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where does this impression originate, I wonder? Likely, the vision of the wealthy as somehow “above” or “apart” from the peasantry has its roots in the monarchies, serfdoms, and aristocracies of the past. In those days, there indeed was a gap between very definable classes. Usually, this separation was legally upheld by the governments, who kept the plebeians in their place. Also likely is that Marxist ideology – which ironically arose just as class boundaries were becoming lenient and flexible during the industrial revolution – nurtured this centuries-old conception of the rich versus the poor. Fast forward to modern America and these ideas still hold firm amidst a poorly-educated populace, augmented by politicians all too eager to elicit support from those voting masses who can’t wait to get their hands on the bourgeoisie’s medical insurance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to back up the assertion that the income gap is a myth, it needs to be shown that no such gap exists. Income, while clearly not distributed equally (the idea that income is “distributed” is another fallacy), is in fact acquired by individuals along a relatively smooth curve. One need only review the U.S. Census Bureau’s HINC table, which lists the number of households receiving various levels of income, to see the inaccuracy of the fable. Here is 2006 as an example, but any year has a similar pattern:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/S8-FHb_7lLI/AAAAAAAAAek/OFE_pjQl1yQ/s1600/IncomeGraph.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;208&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/S8-FHb_7lLI/AAAAAAAAAek/OFE_pjQl1yQ/s640/IncomeGraph.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;Source: US Census Bureau. Table HINC-06&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From this graph, you can see a smooth slope in income distribution. Notice that the spike above $100k is a result of the change in x-axis incrementation. The Census Bureau does not seem to provide a breakdown of the top two tiers, yet it should be quite clear that the pattern of distributional proportion does not change significantly along the x-axis. Readers are also welcome to examine the Census data above $200k, for it follows the same downward slope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I challenge the reader to determine where one class ends, and the other begins. I would assert that any such categorization would be fairly arbitrary and not based on any obvious statistical grouping. The percent of households at any income level slops gradually downward to zero (zero percentage of households earn $100 billion in a fiscal year). So, where is the gap?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there were an income gap, then you would see a large distributional divide somewhere between what is considered “middle class” and what is considered “upper class.”  For example, if we consider households making $150k per year as “upper class,” then we would expect a void to exist so that a large group was earning under $100k and a large group was earning over $150k per year, but very few were earning incomes between these two levels. That would be an income gap, and that would signify that there was something structurally askew. No such gap exists. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The percentage of households earning income all along the income curve is quite remarkably very smooth. There is no vast distance between the “haves” and the “have-nots.” At any given level of income, there is a percentage of households which is roughly equivalent proportionally to the percentage of households on either side of it (though always sloping downwards). This signifies, quite clearly, that there are not two or three classes in America, as politicians, the media, and “academics” would have us believe. Rather, there are an essentially infinite number of classes, which is to say that “class” is a meaningless term. There is the “class” making $10-$20k per year, the class making $20-$30k per year, the class making $30-$40k per year, all the way up the income chain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Critics will cite something like, “well, the top 1% makes 25% of the income.” This phenomenon does not represent a “gap,” for if you then examine the top 2%, then the top 3%, then 4%, then 5% and so on, you will see a relatively uniform curve of incomes. If one gets angry at the steepness of this curve, one likely has great hatred toward compound interest, which is akin to throwing a tantrum after learning that 3+3 tends to equal 6, or that water tends to run downhill. Regardless of one’s anger, it would be folly to legislate that water should run down hill more slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is no structurally imposed “jump” in income levels that an individual must overcome to switch classes. There is no point at which one says, “alright, to get from my current socio-economic class to the next one, I’ll have to overcome a huge systemic obstacle. I’ll have to somehow jump the gap.” An individual may look out at the wealthy neighbor nearby and say, “That is where I want to be, he is clearly in the class above my own,” but this individual needs to remember that there are countless individuals at every income level between himself and the rich man in the house he envies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Classes do not exist in America, in any definable way, because between every two classes exists another class of similar proportion. Those who would divide and categorize Americans into distinct classes are not only committing a statistical and empirical error, they are sowing the seeds for unwarranted tension between neighbors. Interestingly, these tend to be the same people brandishing “Peace” stickers on their cars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consequences of this fabricated divisiveness, while good for the politician who can leverage it, harms the cohesion of American society, turning every community into a jealous antagonist, bent on forcing closed a divide that doesn’t exist. Let us banish this term, “income gap,” to the magical fields of children’s fables, where it can frolic and dance with the unicorns and, over tea, discuss with the fairies their ordeals at the airport.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/feeds/7237356980669227997/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=513710724906503704&amp;postID=7237356980669227997&amp;isPopup=true' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/7237356980669227997'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/7237356980669227997'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/2010/04/myth-of-income-gap.html' title='The Myth of the Income Gap'/><author><name>Erik Voorhees</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01780045950459697961</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='28' height='32' src='http://bp2.blogger.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/R5sK0XtoHvI/AAAAAAAAAA8/NMS9qZv6DOA/S220/self-photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/S8-FHb_7lLI/AAAAAAAAAek/OFE_pjQl1yQ/s72-c/IncomeGraph.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-513710724906503704.post-6788246082364807535</id><published>2010-04-14T07:15:00.004+04:00</published><updated>2010-04-14T07:26:50.366+04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Debt"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Economics"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Spending"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Taxation"/><title type='text'>The Deceptive Debt Ratio</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot;

style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;The United States has a growing debt problem. It also has a problem measuring the same.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The statistic normally used is the “Debt to GDP” ratio, referring to the amount of debt versus the nation’s sum total of transactions. As of Q1 2010, the US debt to GDP ratio was 87%. However, the Debt to GDP ratio should be ignored, because it is meaningless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;It is worse than meaningless, because it disguises the true problem and lulls us into a false sense of solvency.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Why is Debt to GDP a poor metric?&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Because the debt must be paid off with the &lt;i style=&quot;&quot;&gt;income from taxation&lt;/i&gt;. It cannot be paid off through some relative percentage of economic expenditure. This is an important distinction. The debt is not serviced from a portion of the economy’s activity as a whole; it is serviced from tax revenues. As such, the &lt;i style=&quot;&quot;&gt;ability to repay &lt;/i&gt;debt is based on tax revenues, not on the GDP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;It cannot even be said that a growing GDP will necessarily assist in the payment of debt. Consider that when the Government spends money it increases the GDP side of the ratio, thereby helping to minimize the appearance of its own debt! In other words, if Washington spent four gazillion dollars, our Debt to GDP would only be about 100% (roughly 4 gazillion in debt and roughly 4 gazillion in GDP). This is only 13 percentage points higher than our current level. Greece could actually &lt;i style=&quot;&quot;&gt;decrease &lt;/i&gt;its Debt to GDP ratio by spending 4 gazillion Euros – from its current 125% to a much more manageable 100%. Debt to GDP is a highly deceptive metric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;“Debt to Tax Revenue” is a much better statistic for examining government debt (it is also much more accurately calculated). If the Government owes $1 trillion (wouldn’t that be nice?) and takes in half a trillion in tax revenue, then the Debt to Tax Revenue ratio would be 2:1, or 200%. Using all tax revenue to service the debt, it could be paid in 2 years (if, of course, &lt;i style=&quot;&quot;&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; other government services were canceled for those two years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;Using this much more honest metric, how does the US fare?&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;There exists currently about $12.7 trillion in national debt (this doesn’t include state debt nor unfunded future liabilities). The 2008 tax receipts were $2.5 trillion (2009 data is not yet available). Thus, the Debt to Tax Revenue ratio is roughly 12.7:2.5, or 508%.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Put another way, it would take 5.08 years’ worth of taxes to pay off the debt assuming every single federal program was cancelled during that time. Not even the Washington accountants administering the debt payments would receive a paycheck.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;Soldiers in Iraq would receive neither pay nor ammo nor a plane ticket home. &lt;i style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Everything&lt;/i&gt; would have to stop, and it would still take over half a decade to pay the debt.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This is akin to an individual spending absolutely nothing for 5 years in order to pay off his credit cards. Within a few weeks he’d be dead of starvation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;Let’s compare with Greece. Greece currently has $405 billion in national debt, with the CIA estimating its most recent tax revenue at $108 billion. Greece therefore has a Debt to Revenue ratio of about 375%. Take California, the state everyone knows is already bankrupt – it had a debt in 2008 of $122 billion and 2008 revenue of $151 billion, creating a Debt to Revenue ratio of only 81%. Relative to tax revenue, both Greece and California are significantly better off than the US Federal Government. &lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Yet, that’s not the impression people get when observing erroneous Debt to GDP figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;Spending more of one’s money does not make one more credit worthy, yet that absurdity is propagated when we use the nation’s Debt to GDP ratio as our gauge of solvency.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If every citizen went out and bought a car this year, the GDP would skyrocket, and suddenly the Government’s debt ratio would fall.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Does anyone really believe that a better fiscal situation would have been attained? No. In fact, a much worse situation would exist, because Americans would be then less able to pay for other expenses – such as government debt – after purchasing the new car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;In short, we are currently measuring sovereign debt with an arguably deceitful statistic. Whether one believes that the Federal Government should increase or decrease spending, we should all agree that dishonest accounting is not a policy of prudence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;Debt to GDP examines debt based on a nation’s volume of transactions. It therefore suggests that debt burdens can be reduced to the extent we consume. How does that make any sense? Conversely, Debt to Tax Revenue examines debt based on a government’s &lt;i style=&quot;&quot;&gt;ability to pay it back&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;Which metric should the sincere accountant use?

A year-long construction manager position would also be one job created.  They’ve claimed to create 3,236 jobs thus far with these standards.  The article’s investigation finds that the average work-time for these “jobs” is actually just 35 hours each!!!  If we re-calculated based on jobs being 1 year, full time, then the state has created just 54 jobs.  The article further states that, if they continue at the current rate of job creation, they will create 688 full-time, year-long jobs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; &quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;Oregon&#39;s state program (separate from the Federal stimuli) has a cost of $176,000,000. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; &quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;Thus, the Oregon State Government will have been able to create full-time, year-long jobs for as little as $255,813 each, assuming the program remains as effective as it has been. I would suggest that the marginal cost of each job will actually get higher, because those jobs which are easiest to create, and those most “shovel-ready” (an excellent moniker when one considers the economic grave-digging which is occurring), will be utilized first. It will become more difficult over time to effectively spend the funds… the easy, obvious programs will be exhausted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; &quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;A legitimate businessman creates jobs which produce more wealth than they cost.  The state creates jobs which cost more than they produce. Businessmen have the incentive to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;produce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;.

This fundamental schism cannot be overstated.   Politicians don’t worry, however, because they think wealth comes from the number of people employed, instead of the amount of production per person employed.  It is no wonder they have this view… every job created is a vote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; &quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;As a final point, I would suggest that individual states are better able to efficiently allocate spending programs than the Federal Government. It is unlikely the Federal Government, with $787 billion to spend, will be more efficient per dollar than Oregon with its much more manageable $176 million.  Continuing this line of reasoning, districts are likely to more effectively allocate resources than states, towns more effectively than districts, neighborhoods more effectively than towns, and, wait for it… &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;individuals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt; more effectively than neighborhoods. Case in point: it would not cost me a quarter million dollars to create a job.  Yet, I must be missing something here, for if individuals could allocate their own resources, then hundreds of thousands of government jobs wouldn’t be necessary and the government has not suggested that such is the case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; &quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/feeds/7125938218447878889/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=513710724906503704&amp;postID=7125938218447878889&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/7125938218447878889'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/7125938218447878889'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/2009/11/alleged-job-creation-quick-case-study.html' title='The Alleged &quot;Job Creation&quot; - Quick Case Study'/><author><name>Erik Voorhees</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01780045950459697961</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='28' height='32' src='http://bp2.blogger.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/R5sK0XtoHvI/AAAAAAAAAA8/NMS9qZv6DOA/S220/self-photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/SvwU5cPykdI/AAAAAAAAAc4/r53-XVz3GLM/s72-c/shovel2_lg.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-513710724906503704.post-6449148662159712287</id><published>2009-11-12T17:34:00.011+04:00</published><updated>2009-11-12T17:47:01.670+04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Debt"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Keynes"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Spending"/><title type='text'>On Spending and Keynesian Displacement</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/SvwRKFYProI/AAAAAAAAAcw/c5lis58yBvg/s1600-h/keynes.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 304px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/SvwRKFYProI/AAAAAAAAAcw/c5lis58yBvg/s400/keynes.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5403212517877984898&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: normal; &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;Squeezed forth by the global financial crisis, certain detestable economic myths are bubbling through every legislative orifice.

Virtually every political leader, save perhaps Czech’s prescient Vaclav Klaus, is enamored with spending. Why do politicians give credence to Keynesianism? Because it provides an intellectual veneer under which to usurp power, grant favors, and spend the wealth of the peasantry (benevolently preventing peasants the burden thereof). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: normal; &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: normal; &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;The Keynes allegory suggests that heightened spending creates “demand,” which then allows companies to produce goods and make money, thereby enabling subsequent spending. The corollary is of course that without such spending, demand will plummet in a vicious cycle, leading presumably to a revisitation of the stone age economy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: normal; &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: normal; &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;What is overlooked (or more likely intentionally ignored for political purposes) is that spending necessarily involves an important opportunity cost – when you spend today, you can’t spend tomorrow. Whatever is purchased now not only comes at the expense of the money in your pocket, but more importantly at the expense of the future purchase otherwise made. It is not so much &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;money&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt; that one surrenders to acquire the new television as it is next month’s potential patio furniture. There is thus an unseen – to gratefully utilize Bastiat’s term – cost in every expense: that of the future product which is never purchased because the means by which to purchase it have been depleted in the present. The future purchase is sacrificed in favor of the present purchase, so while the television producer is pleased with his increased sales today, the patio furniture factory will unknowingly have one less sale in the subsequent month.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: normal; &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: normal; &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;This unavoidable mechanism of economics is why the concept of a “Keynesian Multiplier” is so absurd (unless one realizes the multiplier is likely less than 1). For by increasing demand in the present, one is necessarily decreasing demand in the future. The Keynesian Multiplier doesn’t provide a net gain in wealth and demand, it provides a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;transfer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt; of wealth and demand from the future to the present. And when a wide array of future demand is transferred to the present, for example by the Federal Government, one should not be surprised to see macro indicators, such as GDP, increase. Such figures indicate present activity but do not account for the forgone activity in the future. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;The positive GDP figure appears on the front page of the paper, the public cheers, the politicians wave, bow, and then feign surprise at corporate earnings in subsequent quarters. Could any example be more perfect than the Cash for Clunkers program?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: normal; &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: normal; &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;The Keynesian witch-doctors will retort that when a man spends now, it allows the next guy to spend, and then the next, and so on until finally someone down the line is able to buy from the first man. Well, ask yourself, has any wealth been created by this circular transaction? To the extent that some of those products are consumed after the trade, one is likely to find a net loss in wealth after all the trades have completed. This is because production did not occur, and when each man in the chain bought something from the next man, he sacrificed his ability to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;produce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt; with that wealth. Unless enough of the men traded their wealth for some asset which allowed productivity to increase, a net loss will have occurred. For this reason, individuals can’t just spend money to make money. Intelligent investment must be accomplished, and this is not usually an easy or expedient challenge. One might suggest that when the government spends a trillion dollars, a great deal of that is unlikely to fall into the “intelligent investment” category… it would fall into the “consumption” category. While GDP figures will have increased, wealth will not have been created. If the government had any skill in investing, what need would there be for taxes?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: normal; &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: normal; &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;Sacrificing future consumption in favor of present consumption should be at the discretion of individuals considering their own finances. Such sacrifices should not be forced upon the public through government spending diktats, euphemistically referred to as “stimulus.” One should not require unnatural prescience to take such a “stimulating” policy to its logical conclusion. By transferring future consumption to the present, the government can appear as the benevolent shepherd guiding its flock, but this illusory growth is of course temporary, for future spending will have been sacrificed. Further, the capital savings required for real investment will have been consumed; businesses will find it more difficult to acquire resources as those resources will already have been depleted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: normal; &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: normal; &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-family:georgia;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;Just as one man cannot spend his way out of debt, neither can two men, nor five. A small community could not spend its way out of debt, nor could a village, nor five. How many individuals must be added to the shopping spree before their collective wealth starts rising? How many times must a man trade money for goods with his neighbor before they both retire wealthy? Clearly, something more than a transaction is required for wealth to grow.

Despite all the discussion in the news right now, it is important to understand that such discussion is irrelevant and will not stand in the way of reform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s why I&#39;m holding a finely-pruned press conference tonight at 8pm ET, and having one of my secretaries write this email to let everyone know where we claim to be, what we imagine is ahead, and why further health insurance regulation is so important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me be clear: although Congress is still debating parts of the legislation, such as how to pay for it and whether it’s a good idea or not, we have pushed through a critical consensus using political pressure and imaginative statistics on several key areas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you already have health insurance: &lt;/b&gt;regardless of whether you’re happy with it, our new regulation will mandate more security and stability. It will limit your own out of pocket costs by subsidizing them with money from rich people and prevent your insurance company from adjusting its business model to ensure profitability. Nobody should make a profit on something as essential as healthcare. We’ll also force the rich to pay for affordable insurance options for you if you lose or change your job, which will become more likely as our spending policies adjust business competitiveness and the value of the dollar some have inequitably saved during this time of crucial consumption. Further, we’ll force the rich to pay for your preventive care like check-ups and mammograms so that you can enjoy your natural right to a premium cable TV football package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you don&#39;t have health insurance:&lt;/b&gt; regardless of the reason you have not purchased it,  you will finally be compelled to register for guaranteed, fairly-rationed access to healthcare paid for by people you won’t have to confront, and because it’s a free country you can choose the plan that best suits your family&#39;s desires. No insurance company will be allowed to deny you coverage because of a pre-existing medical condition. They will be forced to pay for your problems, even though it will raise their costs and force alterations in others parts of their policies which we haven’t yet had the time to regulate. But don’t worry, because we’re already drafting legislation to cover the loopholes we may create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I realize that the last few miles of any race are the hardest to run, but we can&#39;t stop now, because my political reputation will suffer. There&#39;s no dispute about it: we cannot control our long-term fiscal health as a nation without health insurance reform. The dispute is only regarding how to do this, but such details are irrelevant and inhibitive to the change I promised on the campaign trail. Americans understand that the health insurance status quo, which has thankfully been extensively regulated by the actions of your former overlords, is still awash with problems. Using my wit, I’ve helped American businesses understand that it is American businesses which caused these problems. The stability and security that comes with knowing that you can get the treatment you want (as long as its approved) when you want it (as long as a quota-based appointment is available), is paramount to a fair system in which everyone can be first in line. Without reform, we are consigning our children to a future of skyrocketing premiums and crushing deficits. Contrary to some 3rd party economic analysis and historical precedent, the reform I’m mandating will not consign our children to such stresses. Anyone who says otherwise is just playing politics, and hates poor people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have to seize this opportunity and pass health insurance mandates this year, before the economic consequences of my ongoing central planning begin to cast doubts over my macrofinancial omniscience. You will do your duty by forwarding this email to your family and friends and letting them know what&#39;s at stake in this debate, namely my reputation and the axiom that governments allocate resources better than profit-seeking robber baron mega corporations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Barack Obama&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Tune in to tonight&#39;s press conference on health insurance reform at 8pm ET on WhiteHouse.gov so you can be reminded of my charisma and confidence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/Smg-E2hlaiI/AAAAAAAAAbw/NvQ7fdvjf2g/s1600-h/visit.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 364px; height: 50px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/Smg-E2hlaiI/AAAAAAAAAbw/NvQ7fdvjf2g/s400/visit.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5361603609461352994&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/feeds/828266158305912184/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=513710724906503704&amp;postID=828266158305912184&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/828266158305912184'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/828266158305912184'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/2009/07/dear-serf.html' title='Dear Serf - A Letter from the President, edited'/><author><name>Erik Voorhees</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01780045950459697961</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='28' height='32' src='http://bp2.blogger.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/R5sK0XtoHvI/AAAAAAAAAA8/NMS9qZv6DOA/S220/self-photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/Smg9-dGtM8I/AAAAAAAAAbo/VV3HS8V3emA/s72-c/stamp.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-513710724906503704.post-1379274642336470487</id><published>2009-07-22T21:11:00.016+04:00</published><updated>2009-07-22T22:17:49.063+04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Economics"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Federal Reserve"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Gold"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Political Theory"/><title type='text'>The Record of the Federal Reserve</title><content type='html'>Let’s talk about The Federal Reserve.  Consider the following facts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;From 1776 to 1912 (136 years), the value of the dollar, relative to the Consumer Price Index,&lt;b&gt; increased 11%&lt;/b&gt;. A dollar could buy 11% more goods in 1912 than in 1776. Thus, if in 1776, you sat on your savings pile of $1,000,000 for 136 years, it would then be worth $1,110,000 in purchasing power (it will have appreciated in value by 11%). A loaf of bread for Thomas Jefferson cost the same as a loaf of bread for Lincoln 50 years later and again the same for J.P. Morgan 50 years after that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;The United States Federal Reserve was created in 1913. The stated purpose of the Fed, by its own definition taken from its website, is to “conduct the nation&#39;s monetary policy by influencing money and credit conditions in the economy in pursuit of full employment and &lt;b&gt;stable prices&lt;/b&gt;.” Note that “stable prices” is another way of saying “stable dollar,” they are two sides of the same coin (couldn’t resist the pun).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then after The Fed’s creation, from 1913 to 2008 (95 years), the value of the dollar, relative to the Consumer Price Index, &lt;b&gt;decreased by 95%&lt;/b&gt;. A dollar could buy 95% fewer goods in 2008 than in 1913. Thus, if in 1913, you sat on your savings pile of $1,000,000 for 95 years, it would then be worth only $50,000 in purchasing power (it will have depreciated in value by 95%). One would now need to pay about 20X more than J.P. Morgan for one’s bread. Ask my mother how much the price of milk has increase just in the last ten years alone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, the value of the dollar remained extremely stable for 150 years, then The Fed was created in order to “stabilize the value of the dollar” and the result has been a 95% devaluation of the dollar in less than 100 years following its creation. Below is a graph of this hisotry, which I’ve marked with the year 1913 so you can see the change. The graph is also marked with the years of decoupling from the gold standard, as no examination of dollar value would be sound without such mention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img110.imageshack.us/img110/3417/thevalueofthedollar1776.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; text=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;While we all take inflation as a “given” – as something that “just happens” in the economy – we would do well to remember that this belief is utterly incorrect. Inflation, which is the loss of value in your saved dollars, is &lt;i&gt;caused &lt;/i&gt;by The Federal Reserve through its management of the money supply. Next time you see Ben Bernanke on the television, telling you that they “will take the necessary steps” to help the country, consider their track record so far, and their dismal failure at their stated objective – preserving the value of America’s money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outrage doesn’t even begin to describe what Americans should feel in response to this.  Yet, Americans aren’t very upset, and indeed the vast majority has no idea about any of this information. I would wager that this is because Americans are educated in Government schools, which barely teach basic accounting, let alone macroeconomic monetary theory. In public school I was forced to memorize the names of every country in Africa, yet never was there a discussion of the nature of money.  Half the nations of Africa have been renamed since, but the economic principles which cause such political turmoil remain the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Federal Reserve system is fraudulent. Whatever its stated purpose, its &lt;i&gt;effective &lt;/i&gt;purpose is to create a mechanism of deficit spending by politicians, through the insidious invisible taxation of monetary debasement (aka inflation).  With printed money, the Government can buy services for its voters before the effects of inflation are felt.  It is then the voters whose money buys less the following year, as the new money has raised prices, and they are none the wiser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obama is now mandating that The Fed is to have more oversight, more authority and control over the markets of the United States. If we can learn anything from The Fed, it’s that the best way to succeed as a politician is to stretch one’s failure over a long enough period that people won’t remember it.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/feeds/1379274642336470487/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=513710724906503704&amp;postID=1379274642336470487&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/1379274642336470487'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/1379274642336470487'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/2009/07/record-of-federal-reserve.html' title='The Record of the Federal Reserve'/><author><name>Erik Voorhees</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01780045950459697961</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='28' height='32' src='http://bp2.blogger.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/R5sK0XtoHvI/AAAAAAAAAA8/NMS9qZv6DOA/S220/self-photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-513710724906503704.post-234103910912976762</id><published>2009-07-21T21:51:00.024+04:00</published><updated>2009-07-21T23:20:40.885+04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Alec the Communist"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Economics"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Ethics"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Political Theory"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Taxation"/><title type='text'>Response to Alec the Communist</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;It so happens that a friend of one of my family members is a self-proclaimed communist. I applaud him for his honesty. In a couple of emails, Alec the Communist presented some arguments on the following topics:&lt;/div&gt;1) Why it&#39;s okay to redistribute wealth&lt;br /&gt;2) Why governments should spend our way out of recession&lt;br /&gt;3) Why income taxes should be more progressive&lt;br /&gt;4) Why the world would collapse without government programs&lt;br /&gt;5) Why savings doesn&#39;t create growth&lt;br /&gt;6) Why the rich will just keep on workin&#39; if you tax them more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I took the opportunity to discuss with Mr. Communist why he is mistaken.  The resulting document is about 20 pages long, and I would encourage anyone who must interact with statists of similar persuasions to read it. The discussion is annotated to make clear the two authors&#39; points of view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot; ;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;I object on principle to calling those who take government jobs created by the stimulus as &quot;immoral beggar mobs.&quot; Is he channeling Ayn Rand? I have never seen a more blatant example of classism in my life. It is grossly insensitive, incorrect, and itself immoral to refer to the unemployed that way. Poverty is not a moral failing.&quot; -Alec the Communist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Click here for the full discussion...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fullpost&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot; ;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fullpost&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin, the dialogue starts off with a discussion of tax rates and the economic strength of America...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;&quot;&gt;Alec 1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Our current tax rate for the rich and corporations is less than it was during the Clinton years which was the longest continual expansion in our economy in US history.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Now I am not a Democrat and so I do not want to be drawn into defending Clinton or the Democrats generally because I do think their economic policies are generally terrible.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The point is that empirically we had higher taxes and yet the economy did better.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Also, doing cursory research on the competitiveness of global economies shows the US either in first place by a very small margin or somewhere near the bottom of the top ten.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The other countries in the top ten are countries with significantly higher tax rates than the US.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Any libertarian has to respond to the fact that even when rich people and corporations are taxed heavily the economy not only does well, it can flourish.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I can already hear Jacques saying “but if the tax rate was 10% the economy would grow so much more quickly than the US during the Clinton years or Northern European countries,” but as Kristen has pointed out on multiple occasions, appeals to utopian hypothetical scenarios does not constitute an argument in favor of an economic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Erik’s Response:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;This is a case of correlation and causation, and I’m sure Alec understands that the former doesn’t necessitate the later.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The fact that taxes were higher under Clinton and that the economy was stronger under Clinton is not sufficient evidence on which to base the claim that higher taxes encourage economic activity.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Likewise, the fact that other countries have better economic growth amidst higher taxes than the US is also not sufficient evidence on which to base the claim. There are billions of factors that influence a macro-economic environment, and to attribute either growth or loss simply to tax policy is naïve. If tax rates are high in a country and the economy is doing well, this is happening &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;despite&lt;/i&gt; the tax rate, not &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; of it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;To suggest that taxation encourages economic growth is utterly preposterous. A similar suggestion would be that entrepreneurs do better under an environment with high borrowing costs. Another similar suggestion would be that businesses thrive to the extent that their profits are shrinking. Yet, another similar suggestion would be that joggers can run faster with lead weights tied to their ankles. For Alec’s claim to be true, the Government would have to be able to generate profits... and it isn’t.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;In theory&lt;/i&gt; it &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; encourage economic growth if the government invested the majority of tax revenue back into profitable ventures. However, A) this doesn’t occur and B) even if the Government tried to do this it would fail.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;If the Government could invest resources profitably it wouldn’t need to tax.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The assertion that an individual working for Government can “out-invest” an individual in the private sector relies on the belief that Government employees are smarter than non-government employees.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;On what evidence does Alec base this? &lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The Government cannot even run a mail service profitably (The Postal Service). The Government cannot even run a train profitably (Amtrak). The Government can’t even run &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;itself&lt;/i&gt; profitably… every year the Government falls further into debt. Government is unable to generate sufficient revenue even to run its own activities, let alone those in the marketplace. This is not because those currently in office are ill-informed or insufficient for their jobs, rather it is because of the &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;incentives&lt;/i&gt; which exist within governmental structures relative to the incentives which exist outside of it.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;If Alec believes that taxation increases economic growth, then why do we not tax ourselves at 100% and all become wealthy overnight? Alec will surely respond that there is an “ideal equilibrium” point somewhere above 0% and below 100%.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This is like saying the ideal number of lead weights for a jogger to drag behind him is something more than 0. Taxation removes wealth from those who produce it, and hands it to those who are less able to produce. Taxation is the extraction of wealth to be redistributed in some way, like on military expenses, farm subsidies, “promotion of the arts,” etc.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;One can make the argument that we should have taxes in order to have those services, but one cannot make the argument that we should have taxes in order to promote economic growth.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Finally, a 10% tax rate on the economy is not a “utopian hypothetical scenario,”&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;A) it is not utopian because the tax rate is still much too high and B) it is not hypothetical because the US, for most of its history, had taxes lower than that. That someone would suggest that a 10% tax rate is some kind of “unreachable ideal,” and to be joking about the “ideal” part, is a tragic but not unexpected condemnation of the state of America’s citizenry. Has the nation moved so far from its ideals of liberty and limited government?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Is a 10% tax rate so unbelievably low as to be laughable?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If so, I should give up trying to fix the US and instead encourage industrious Americans to relocate to nations which respect their liberties and understand basic economics. Dubai, Singapore, and Hong Kong are well on their way, and have little competition to fear if Americans scoff at a 10% tax rate because it’s “unrealistically low.”&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I wonder if Alec can explain (or is even aware of?) the hundreds of US companies which have relocated here to Dubai over the past few years. Here’s a hint… it’s not for the sand.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;&quot;&gt;Alec 2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;I think Jacques overestimates the dampening effect taxes has on entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;In fact, I think his understanding of the situation is childish because his argument amounts to all these investors and business persons saying “I don&#39;t to share *humph* I am going home.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;You&#39;re mean!”&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;He says people wont quit their day jobs to start a risky but potentially profitable enterprise or make a big investment in a risky but potentially profitable enterprise.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I am highly skeptical that someone will give up a $50,000 a year for the potential to make two million but not to make one million.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The amount of money a person would not make because it is taxed away is not enough to dissuade them from undertaking the enterprise in the first place.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Also, a significant number of these types of people are not in it purely for the money.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They engage in entrepreneurship and venture capitalism because it is what they like to do.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Jacques implicit belief is that people always seek our the job that will give them the most money.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;That is a rather depressing and myopic view of humanity and human motivations.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;While it is true to some extent, people more commonly seek out the job that they like to do the best or makes them the happiest.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Taxing these investors more wont prevent them from doing what they like to do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Also, I suspect that people are more willing to make risky investments or quit their jobs to start a new business if there is a social safety net.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;People are more willing to take risks when failure does not mean death through starvation and exposure.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Erik’s Response:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;I would emphasize that Jacques actually &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; an entrepreneur and can perhaps attest to their motivations. However, if anything, Jacques underestimates the dampening effect taxation has on individuals. When one judges the risk/reward ratio of a proposed venture, if the perceived reward doesn’t compensate for the perceived risk, the venture will not occur. Period. Taxation reduces the reward while the risk remains the same.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Thus, in proportion to the tax rate, individuals’ interest in pursuing ventures declines. The investors aren’t being “childish.” On the contrary, they are being responsible adults. They are making rational decisions about their property, just as Alec does when he decides to take out a loan, buy groceries, or start a business. Raising the tax rate will certainly not cause all economic activity to stop, but what is important is to look at the “&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;marginal effect&lt;/b&gt;.” What is the net marginal effect of taxing an activity?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The answer is that is reduces profitability, and thus reduces the &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;incentive &lt;/i&gt;to pursue it. &lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;To not understand behavioral changes in response to incentives at the margins is to not understand economics.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Alec continues:&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;“&lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;The amount of money a person would not make because it is taxed away is not enough to dissuade them from undertaking the enterprise in the first place.” &lt;/i&gt;The question is… at what point does the dissuasion occur?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It is different for each individual.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If Alec thinks that moving corporate tax rates from 25% to 30% won’t dissuade economic activity, then he has little understanding of the profit margins that companies generally make. I wonder what profit margin Alec believes that Shell, routinely labeled as accruing “windfall profits,” actually enjoys? Would he be surprised that last year when Shell made “record profits” from surging oil prices its profit rate was 7.9%?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I wonder if Alec knows that the US government gets substantially more profit per gallon of gasoline than any oil company (meanwhile they berate oil companies for “gouging the consumer”)? &lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Alec should realize that a 5% increase in taxes can very easily mean the difference between profitability and loss for many companies. Even the very &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;possibility&lt;/i&gt; that tax rates will increase tomorrow or in ten years dissuades ventures from ever occurring because, simply, the perceived risk is higher than the perceived reward. Again, it is not that &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; stops producing when tax rates increase, rather it is that &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; do- those at the margins. The extent of the tax burden is the extent of the marginal change in behavior.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Further, Alec seems to think that capitalists will continue producing despite incessant taxation because “that is what they like to do.”&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Well, many of them indeed love their jobs. They love producing, they love being creative and problem solving, they love the infinite challenge of growing a business.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But capitalists also like… capital.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Is this a “sad view of humanity?” Not unless one believes money to be evil, and if this is the case one is welcome to surrender it to the Government at one’s own expense. Alec forgets that while capitalists may love their jobs, they’ll love their jobs even more if they get paid. Thus, those companies which offer to pay the highest salaries will likely get their services. Thus… the most profitable companies, in the regions where taxation is lowest (Dubai again?), will more easily attract the capitalists over time.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Additionally on this point, all investments require &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;risk&lt;/i&gt;, and whether an investor “loves investing” or not, he will simply not risk his assets if the reward is not high enough.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;No investor invests simply because he sadistically loves putting his money in danger. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;To Alec’s last point regarding safety nets… capitalists don’t assume the government will be there to help them (although that may change with Obama bailing the failure out). They also don’t generally “bet the farm” in order to get returns.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Generally, they are well-off individuals who are at no risk of starving, even if all their bets go south, because they don’t make bets which are, as previously mentioned, too risky! Safety nets for the least productive are of little concern to the most productive (yet of course they’re the ones who are forced to pay for it all).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;&quot;&gt;Alec 3.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Why is taxing people at 10% not stealing when anything higher is stealing?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Or is it simply that any taxation is stealing (hello Ayn Rand!) but a limited amount of stealing is alright so the government can run.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If it is the first explanation, then that is the most ludicrously arbitrary and ad hoc double standard I have ever seen.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;There is absolutely no reason to think that 10% is the dividing line between stealing and not stealing.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If it was, why not 20% or 50%?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I suspect that Jacques is more likely to defend the second explanation, that some stealing is justified.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If that is the case then Jacques should check himself because he is a lot more utilitarian and socialist then he realizes.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If a limited amount of “stealing” (and I do not concede the point that taxation is stealing) is justified for practical, empirical concerns then really our debate boils down to a disagreement over what amount of stealing is practical.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;At this point I have already won the debate because Jacques is not respecting property rights like a good libertarian ought to.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But because I like debating anyway, I will continue...&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Erik’s Response&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-indent:35.45pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Taxing people at 10% &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; stealing, but it is not as bad as taxing at 15%, so I’d be in favor of any legislation which moved us in that direction. A step in the right direction is good, even if the result is not good enough to subsequently justify complacency. So Alec doesn’t need to worry about a “ludicrously arbitrary and ad hoc double standard.” On the contrary, libertarians tend to be the most consistent in their beliefs. We believe in freedom &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;on every issue&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I’d guess Alec supports free association between people when it comes to personal relationships, but not when it comes to the trading of property?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;One might call that an arbitrary double standard. I’d guess Alec claims to support free speech, though he would willingly promote legislation which mandates that the media should treat news in a “balanced” way. One might call that an arbitrary double standard. Alec likely believes that a man working for Government should be allowed to own a gun, though a man not working for the government should be prevented from the same. One might call that an arbitrary double standard. &lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Alec’s also made it clear that the poor shouldn’t pay taxes but the rich should. One might call that an arbitrary double standard. I’m sure on some issues Alec supports the concept of private property (does one own his clothing?), though when it comes to “big business” I know he’d like to give unions special privileges, thereby undermining the property rights of the company’s owners.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;One might call that an arbitrary double standard. I’d suppose Alec defends the rights of minorities, but when it comes to the most vulnerable minority – the individual – his defense is absent. One might call that an arbitrary double standard. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-tab-count:1&quot;&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;Any taxation is legalized theft, so of course by definition it isn’t technically theft. However, labeling taxation as theft can be legitimate because they are both wrong by the same moral reasoning, and they both cause a similar effect.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It does not matter if your neighbor across the street robs you, or if several guys from across town rob you, or if a whole mob with uniforms promising to provide “services” robs you… if legitimate property is removed by force, it is immoral. Now, if Alec thinks that no property is legitimate because he’s a communist, then that’s his opinion, and we must leave it as a fundamental disagreement on the rights of man. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;&quot;&gt;Alec 4.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Diminishing returns.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;An extra 100 million for someone who already has 500 million is essentially meaningless.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;That person does not need that money.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;And since we all agree that we can take money when it is empirically expedient to do so, I suggest we take it.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Jacques suggests we let them keep it because they will spend it (increasing some businesses profitability meaning they can hire more people) or invest it (giving a business more money to work with and so increasing jobs) or saving it (giving a bank more money to lend to people who need houses or want to start a business).&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Ultimately these are less than ideal ways of using that money.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Spending it will ultimately have a negligible effect.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This is true for a couple reasons.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The first is that consumer spending is not directly correlated with wealth levels.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The vast majority of consumer spending is not done by those with the vast majority of the wealth.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It is done by the middle class and the upper-middle class.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;That means that letting them keep the money isn&#39;t going to be directly going into that part of the economy which is the most important.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Secondly, the types of things they will be buying with all that extra money will not benefit anyone else.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Buying Brazilian hardwood floors instead of the laminated crap the rest of us have will not create any more jobs.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Getting $500 dinners, buying expensive jewelry, or fancy imported German cars instead of a Subaru will not lead to a creation of more jobs.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;And even if it does, there are much more efficient ways to create those jobs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;So what if they invest it?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The reason &#39;trickle down economics&#39; is such a good metaphor is because you start with a gallon at the top and by the time it reaches the huddled masses yearning to breathe it is but a few precious drops.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Even if they invest it in American companies so the benefits stay here, it will still be less of a benefit than if it had been given to the poorest in the form of government sponsored jobs, education, health care, ect.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This problem is also subject to the problem of diminishing returns.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;These people are already investing millions.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Why would I want to give them another million to invest when I could give several others a college education, healthy food, or a home with that money?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Those benefits are not only more needed but more immediate.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Finally, Jacques says they could save it.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I am glad he admits this is an option because this is what most people do with they money when they are given tax cuts.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Saving it in the bank does absolutely nothing to stimulate the economy and can actually lead to a slowdown by creating unexpected contractions in the money supply.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Putting it in the bank does not increase loans.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Banks, in 99% of circumstances, have plenty of money to lend out (they are required to have plenty of cash on hand by federal law).&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Moreover, the amount of lending banks engage in is only tangentially affected by how much money they have saved in their accounts.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Much more relevant factors are, for example, the state of the economy and economic forecasts.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;When the economic contracts because everyone is stashing away their money rather than spending it businesses will in fact loan less.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Erik’s Response:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Okay, now things are getting ridiculous and I’m going to need to just list bullet points of refutations, else my keyboard will crack and I’ll be forced to ask the government to subsidize a new laptop. I apologize for resorting to bullet points.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol style=&quot;margin-top:0in&quot; start=&quot;1&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;li class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1&quot;&gt;An extra 100 million for      someone who already has 500 million is not meaningless for the      millionaire. It’s clearly meaningless to Alec, because it’s not his money,      and he doesn’t feel the pain of having the product of his life’s work      ripped away from him to pay for government programs he neither advocates      nor supports.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I will simply suggest      to Alec that he speak with someone who is that wealthy and get their      opinion on the subject. No matter how much property one man has, if he got      it legitimately then it is his to do with as he so pleases. Even if the      money were “meaningless” to that person (if Alec can find someone to whom      100 million dollars is meaningless I will concede the point), the fact      remains that the money is owned by that individual and thus no other person      has the right to force him to surrender it. Again, if Alec thinks property      rights are illegitimate than we must simply disagree here.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1&quot;&gt;The vaporous, indefinable concept      of “need” does not give a man a blank check to enslave another man. No      matter how much a man “needs” something, it does not give him the right to      take it by force from someone else.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;If a man needs something, then by all means &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:      normal&quot;&gt;help him out!!! &lt;/i&gt;Or, &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;convince&lt;/i&gt;      others to help him out without resorting to government force . It is      incredible that some people have no moral qualms about holding a gun to      someone’s head and forcing them to pay for their “charities.” Robbing from      one man to give to another is no different than robbing from one man to      give to yourself, contrary to what Disney movies teach us. A man in need      is entitled to exactly the amount which others are voluntarily willing to      provide. I’d also like Alec to define “need,” an exercise which quickly      becomes absurd once attempted.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1&quot;&gt;Jacques is not suggesting      that we let the wealthy keep their wealth because they “spend” it.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;He will be the first to tell you that      spending doesn’t necessarily create growth.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Rather, he is suggesting that rich      people &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;invest&lt;/i&gt; which is      altogether different than spending (Obama is struggling hard with this      concept).&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Here’s the      difference:&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I’m consuming when I      buy a computer to play games on, I’m investing when I buy a computer to      manage my business. The former creates no net increase in my productive      capacity, the later does. &lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Successful      investing creates net gains in the productive capacity of capital&lt;/b&gt;. By      so doing, the wealthy make labor more productive and it is the poor, not      the rich, who benefit most relative to their effort and expense.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;What kind of living can a basic worker      make today? What kind of living could he make before capital was developed      over the past few hundred years?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;Investments in capital are what brought society from a life of      subsistence agriculture to a life of surplus. Alec is welcome to return to      the subsistence agriculture in many parts of the world, but he is not      welcome to take me there and it is unfortunate that he advocates policies      which would return vast swaths of mankind to that state of living.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1&quot;&gt;Buying Brazilian hardwood      floors does create jobs (and eliminates jobs in competing industries). If      Alec disagrees, he’s welcome to inform the Brazilian hardwood workers that      they’ve been swindled. I’m sure they’ll be grateful to be released from      the delusion. Alec can start with these guys:&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brazilianhardwood.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.brazilianhardwood.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1&quot;&gt;Everything that we have      today, which seems like a “necessity,” used to be a luxury. One’s bread      was once a rare commodity. One’s toaster used to be in the category of      hardwood floors.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;One’s Xbox used to      be a pipe dream. One’s car would’ve been killed-for by the wealthiest      kings only 150 years ago.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Who is      Alec to mandate that certain luxuries are okay for people to buy, and      others are not?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Again, one might      call that an arbitrary double standard.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1&quot;&gt;If Alec knows “much more      efficient ways to create jobs,” all he needs to do is put a business plan      together and perhaps I’ll invest in it.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;Then he can make lots of money and donate it to all the charities      which he supports.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, Alec      doesn’t understand that “creating jobs” is not the goal of economic      innovation. He has it backwards. In fact, “destroying jobs” is the goal of      economic innovation. Weird huh? This is why all the spear hunters went out      of business. This is why the typewriter union no longer exists.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This is why the Pony Express workers      were all fired.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This is why      chainmail and battleaxe artisans are no longer paid what they used to      be.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Economic progress is about      producing more, with fewer inputs.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;Until Alec comprehends this he will be eternally under the delusion      that everyone should try to “create jobs.”&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;This does not mean companies should necessarily fire people in      order to grow, of course.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It simply      means that whenever an increase in efficiency allows a company to let      someone go, real economic growth has occurred.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1&quot;&gt;Alec states, “&lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;Why would I want to give them another      million to invest when I could give several others a college education,      healthy food, or a home with that money?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;Those benefits are not only more needed but more immediate.”&lt;/i&gt;      Here Alec seems to be arguing that he wouldn’t give his own money to rich      people because there are better uses for his own money. That’s his right      to make that choice.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Alec can do      what he wants with his own money, but he shouldn’t force &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; to do what &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:      normal&quot;&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; wants with &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;my&lt;/i&gt;      money. Why is that so hard to understand??&lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:      normal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1&quot;&gt;Alec states, &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;“Saving it in the bank does absolutely      nothing to stimulate the economy and can actually lead to a slowdown by      creating unexpected contractions in the money supply.” &lt;/i&gt;He must be      joking, but in case he’s not here’s Banking 101:&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Alec, banks loan money based on their      reserves (among other things).&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;When      they have more reserves, they can loan more money.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This is managed through the mechanism of      “interest rates” which fluctuate relative to a bank’s reserves.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;When a bank has no money, its interest      rates rise.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;When a bank is flush      with cash, its interest rates can fall.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;As interest rates fall, more people can borrow for their projects,      and any borrowing which increases the productivity of capital (ie new      businesses) will subsequently “stimulate” the economy and produce profits.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If Alec needs some evidence of this very      basic mechanism… Here in Dubai when the credit crisis hit, people from all      over the world took their money out of Dubai banks and brought it back      home (understandably, they wanted to be more safe during the crisis). This      caused huge shortfalls in the banks’ capital levels, and interest rates      here skyrocketed.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;A home loan last      summer could be had for about a 5% interest rate.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;In January of this year, banks &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;couldn’t even loan&lt;/i&gt; and the very few      loans that did occur paid around 11-13% in interest. As a real estate      company, this hit us hard. Because people couldn’t get loans they weren’t      buying property, and thus we had to fire over 300 people.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;As the economy seems to be through the      worst (according to some people), tons of money is flooding back into      Dubai banks and, guess what, interest rates on a home loan are now around      7%.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Just as I wouldn’t argue      chemistry before learning what a “periodic table” was, so should Alec      perhaps learn about interest rates and banking before debating economics. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1&quot;&gt;As a final point in this      bullet list, regarding “trickle down economics,” Alec- who do you think      pours the “gallon at the top?”&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Have      you ever pondered where that gallon came from? &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:.5in&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;&quot;&gt;Alec 5.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Jacques also argues that if the income tax was reduced to a 10% flat tax and corporate taxes eliminated that economic expansion would be so rapid that the government would actually take in more money in the long run.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This argument demonstrates a reckless misunderstanding of economic and tax policy.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;In order for the government to actually see a net increase in tax revenues people&#39;s wages would have to rise to something like 6, 8, 10 times their current levels.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Such rapid wage increase would lead to incredibly high inflation that would destroy any economic improvement and offset and gains in tax revenue.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;There is no way that reducing taxes to the level Jacques recommends would actually boost revenue.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Erik’s Response:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;First of all, Alec may be surprised to learn that no matter what the top marginal tax rate has been in the US, over the past 55 years government tax revenues hover around 19.5% of GDP, regardless.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This is known as Hauser’s Law. Consider this for a moment… no matter the top tax bracket, tax revenue remains at 19.5% of the economy’s output.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Assuming this “law” is accurate, a rational person may suggest that a government which seeks to &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;increase&lt;/i&gt; tax revenues should do everything possible to grow the GDP of the economy. A great way to do this is to lower tax rates.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I’m sure Alec will be extremely confused at how Hauser’s Law can be true, given his assumption that wealthy people will “just keep on goin’” no matter their tax burden.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;He’s welcome to try and refute half a century of data below.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Actually, he might suggest that the top tax bracket is only a minority of the total tax revenue and thus the graph is misleading.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I would then remind him that the top 5% of income earners (those in the top tax bracket) pay 60% of the government’s tax revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/SmYOuIArDVI/AAAAAAAAAaI/Yd4HcxH8dF4/s320/Hausers+Law.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5360988592018230610&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 249px; &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;I think it would further surprise Alec if he found out that we could eliminate income tax in America altogether, and the Federal budget would have to shrink down to the size of... the mid 1990’s.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;That’s how much government has grown in just over a decade. The entire income tax, 20-30% of the &lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal&quot;&gt;entire nation’s work effort&lt;/b&gt; during the year, could be returned to them forever, if we just shrank government all the way back to where it was under Clinton. &lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;From what I remember, Americans were just fine when the government was so “small” 15 years ago. Whatever additional improvement we’ve gotten in the last 15 years from new Government “services” is certainly not worth 20-30% of EVERYONE’s salary. So, when I advocate the abolition of income tax, Alec need not be frightened that bridges would collapse and the police would disappear. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Regarding Alec’s “6, 8, or 10x” assumptions… how does he get these figures?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If tax rates fell from 30% to 10%, then a $100,000 salary which yielded $30,000 for the Government will now only yield $10,000. In order to beat the previous tax revenue, the salary needs to rise to $300,000 (times 10% = $30,000) which is an increase of 3X… not 6,8, or 10.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;Salaries of $14,000 or $752 have the exact same dynamics.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Salaries must increase by 3X to make up for a tax rate 1/3 as large. Furthermore, and more importantly, Alec is forgetting the millions of ways that revenue is sheltered, hidden, mis-reported, and moved off-shore, so it’s only the “taxable amount” which needs to increase by 3X, not the actual salary. Taxable amounts could increase by 3X without &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; increase in the actual salary. Also, people would be encouraged to move back to the US and work there (like myself), if the tax was lowered.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Businesses would likewise return to the US.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It is not hard to imagine 3X taxable revenues if the tax rates lowered to 1/3 of their present level. It wouldn’t happen in the same year, but 10 years later the government would be raking in substantially more if it reduced its income taxes to 1/3 of their current level. Any Big Government proponent should vehemently defend lowering marginal tax rates, because it will yield &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; income for government in the long term. Unfortunately politicians don’t much care for the long term, as they likely won’t be in office, and the sheeple that ironically call themselves “citizens of a free nation” are inexcusably ignorant when it comes to financial understanding (ask a random person the difference between APR and APY). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Regarding wage increases and inflation: wages could all go up substantially without any price increases at all (inflation is different than price increases).&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Don’t believe me?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;All it requires is for production to match consumption.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If 20% more goods were produced, and salaries were 20% higher (allowing people to consume 20% more), the price of goods would not increase, because they wouldn’t be any scarcer.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Inflation is an increase in money supply, not prices (although almost every politician gets the term confused).&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Alec stated that Jacques had a “reckless misunderstanding of economic and tax policy.” This is the claim I would make about Alec.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;One of us is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Alec 6&lt;/b&gt;. Another reason such an approach would be folly is because, even if it worked in the abstract (and I am not even admitting that), it does not work in the real world.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;A government which slashed taxes and along with them nearly every regulatory oversight and every social program would utterly crush business confidence, consumer confidence, and consumer spending.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The abrupt shift in policy alone would be enough to send most businesses and investors diving for cover, especially considering most benefit from government programs that make it easier and cheaper for them to offer their employees health care coverage or to start a new business.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The absence of any social programs at all would mean the vast majority of people would start stashing their money under their mattresses rather than spending it for fear of the inevitable rainy day when they will have no assistance from the government.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;That decrease in spending means a decrease in business revenue which leads to a decrease in employment which leads to a decrease in spending and so on and so forth in an ever increasing spiral of economic decline that will go unabated because the libertarians just took away all of the government&#39;s fiscal policy tools.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Importantly, such a strict libertarian policy with no social programs necessarily means condemning millions to die each year.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Even with full employment, there will still be 2-3% of the population unemployed.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;These are people not jobless because of any moral failing on their part or because they are lazy or anything, its because even the best of economies cannot employ everyone.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The unemployed in Jacques&#39;, Kristen&#39;s, and Erik&#39;s ideal world will be condemned to die of preventable, treatable, and curable illnesses, of malnutrition, of exposure, and of starvation.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;There will be absolutely no safety net to support them and they will die.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Now I can already hear Kristen saying that there will be private charities to support these people but that is ultimately not enough.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Contrary to what Kristen claims, Americans only give about $250-$300 billion a year, significantly less than what the government spends in all its social programs.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Worse, charity donations dip during recessions, exactly when they are needed most and exactly when the government can increase its spending.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Private charities absolutely do not provide enough of a safety net and would do nothing to abate to reverse the spiraling economic decline that would result from any decrease in consumer spending.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Erik’s Response:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Again, to Alec, we could eliminate &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;the entire&lt;/i&gt; income tax and have all the great services and benefits that we enjoyed in the 1990’s.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This isn’t exactly “slashing nearly every regulatory oversight and every social program,” as he claims.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;And to suggest that “business and consumer confidence” would be “utterly crushed” because tax rates were lowered... which businesses and consumers does Alec hang out with???&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I would love to meet a business owner who would feel “utterly crushed” when his tax burden was lifted. As a consumer myself, I would be overjoyed! I would save more money, I would spend more money, I would invest more money, and I would donate more money to the causes I support.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If Alec thinks the problem is that rapid policy changes can be destabilizing, he’s being prudent… so let’s reduce taxes slowly!&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I’m not against that.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Alec says, “&lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;the absence of any social programs at all would mean the vast majority of people would start stashing their money under their mattresses rather than spending it.”&lt;/i&gt; Well, Alec is speculating here, but I know in Dubai there are almost no social programs at all… MANY fewer than existed in the US during the mid 1990’s… and people don’t stash money in mattresses.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;What do they do?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They rely on themselves, their friends, and their family for support instead of resorting to coercion. People here don’t force others to make sacrifices for them. There is also much lower unemployment and almost nobody out on the street.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;All people should have the right to ask for assistance, but no person should have the right to force it.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Alec’s presumed never-ending spiral of death and destruction is not based on reality, but I can understand why he’s a communist if he thinks that’s what occurs when government gets out of the way.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I wonder how, during the 1800’s, the US went from a rural nation of farmers to one of the most powerful industrial economies on the planet, surpassing nations that had existed for hundreds or thousands of years, without any income tax and without any corporate tax?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;How did mankind survive, let alone thrive, without social security and medicare?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;By 1900 the US was the envy of the entire world, and it all happened in an environment where the government was a tiny tiny fraction of what it is today. A popular joke in the early 1900’s was that the only time they ever were aware of the Federal Government was when they went to the Post Office. Just 100 years later the Federal Government claims a third of our income. How times have changed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Regarding the lack of social safety nets for the “millions who would die every year without government,” he mentions private charity is around $300 billion per year.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The stats on government “social program” spending put its number around $1-1.3 trillion.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;So, it appears government spends about 4x as much as private individuals.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Two questions are immediately crucial. Is each government dollar as effective as each private dollar given to charity?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;And, if people weren’t forced to pay the government, would they not A) have more money to donate to charity and B) feel more responsible for helping the poor, since Government didn’t claim to do it for them.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I think any academic analysis of these questions would suggest that if Government weren’t involved in charity, the private sectors would, at the very least, be close to matching the effectiveness.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This though is a conservative answer, for the more likely result would be A) more money in aggregate going to charity and B) that money being better spent. This is of course just an assumption on my part. Also you can bet that a good chunk of the Government’s “social spending” goes to projects which are “disagreeable” to put it nicely. With private charity, I have a choice of what I support.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;With Government controlled charity, I don’t; I’m forced to pay for programs which I think &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;damage&lt;/i&gt; the very people they claim to help.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I’m thus forced to be an accomplice in funding harm upon others. I don’t sleep well with that on my mind. &lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;However, &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;even if&lt;/i&gt; private charity didn’t match the effectiveness of government charity, it still wouldn’t give one man the right to force charity upon the public. No man has the right to force servitude on another, if no crime has been committed. As stated before, &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; is not a legitimate claim with which to enslave, in full or in part, another human being.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Shall we discuss how often southern plantation owners claimed they “needed” slaves for their livelihood? “Need” is not justification for aggression. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Is human suffering terrible? Yes. So help those who warrant it and encourage others to do the same. Ridicule, lambaste, and ostracize anyone who is more selfish than you deem appropriate. But, don’t throw people in cages, or hold a gun to their head, for not agreeing with your idea of what’s best for society. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;&quot;&gt;Alec 7.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Furthermore, giving people jobs is actually the less expensive solution to the problem.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If these people do not have jobs now then they will be forced to collect unemployment benefits and welfare and medicade.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They money they receive from these programs plus the bureaucracy needed to run them would be more than it would cost to pay them to build a road in the first place.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Additionally, since poverty is cyclical their children, instead of going to college, will get poor paying jobs with terrible job security and will most likely be collecting government benefits as well.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;All of this is to say nothing of how large the recession will become if the government does absolutely nothing about it.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Paying someone to build a road or repair a bridge nips the problem in the bud and prevents it from becoming a much larger and more expensive problem.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Erik’s Response&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Alec is welcome to provide people jobs at his expense, not at mine.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The fact that if someone is unable to find a job (ie has no skill demanded in the labor market at his desired price) he will attempt to collect government unemployment benefits and welfare is not a legitimate moral reason to take my money and create a job for that person.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If unemployed will cost “society” more money, then perhaps one shouldn’t force “society” to pay the unemployed, no? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;&quot;&gt;Alec 8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;(1)Erik says that anyone who believes they have the right to the labor of another is part of the immoral looter mobs.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;To him I pose the question of whether or not he has ever ridden the Summit Stage?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Even attended public school?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Gotten government subsidized student loans?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Used the post office?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Benefited from the protection of the US military?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Have you ever benefited from the protection of the local policy or fire department?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Why should I pay taxes for your public transportation?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Why should I pay taxes for you to attend school?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Why should I pay taxes for you to get to send letters at a cheaper than market rate?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Why should I pay for you to be protected?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Erik, you have absolutely demanded the right to other people&#39;s labor and you do it every single day.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The only way to make your position consistent is to advocate that all taxes be voluntary (as Ayn Rand believed).&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Anything less is nothing more than hypocrisy beneath a thinly coated hatred for the poor.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(2) If you do believe that all taxes should be voluntary (unlike Jacques who believes that stealing 10% of our money is alright) then please say so.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;That is a whole other can of worms I would be delighted to debate you on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;(3) Erik says that public school&#39;s are a joke and that instead people should have their money given back to them so they can spend it as they please.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But what about the family that only makes $20,000 and already loses almost nothing to taxes?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;There is absolutely no way they can afford private school?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;What about the family now making $10,000 a year because the minimum wage has been abolished?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;What about the women makes 50 cents on the dollar because fair wage statues have been abolished because they were seen as intrusive government regulation and bureaucracy?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;(4) Erik says that under his system that people are not forced to pay for things they don&#39;t support.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The problem is that such a world is not possible, people will always be forced to pay (in one way or another) for something they do not disagree with.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Under your proposals I would be unable to go to college because I would not have any student loans from the government.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Under your proposal I would not have health care because I get insurance through my parents from their employer and they would be unable to offer health care to employees anymore.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Under your system I would be unable to go to work or...anywhere because I rely on public transportation to get where I am going and if I paid the actual cost of what a bus ride costs I would unable to afford it.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I absolutely have to pay to support your opinions; I am absolutely forced to support them.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Frankly, I don&#39;t care if you have to pay for things that you don&#39;t support&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Everyone has to put up with policies they don&#39;t approve of, that is the necessary cost of living under a government, in a society.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The alternative of trying to create the impossible system where no one has to support anything they disagree with creates much more significant harms than the status quo has.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;(5) Ultimately, I believe Rawl&#39;s was right when he said that policies should be judged by how they help the least advantaged among us.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I am entirely uninterested in the impact that economic and tax policies have on millionaires and billionaires.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;These people already have enough advantages, enough power, and enough people looking out for them.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We do not need to rush to the defense of the richest people in the world.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I am entirely interested in the impact that economic and tax policies have on the poorest people in America.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;In fact, I think that the impact on the poorest people is the only thing we should worry about.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Only once everyone has access to food, water, shelter, and essential medical care should we worry about the property rights of billionaires.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Erik’s Response (&lt;/b&gt;numbered according to the above paragraphs from Alec):&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;1. Yes I have ridden the Summit Stage, that does not mean I support it as an institution.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If I could snap my fingers and abolish it I would, and I would be happy to live with the consequences of not having that transportation option. My parents, living in Summit for over 20 years, have had to pay taxes that fund that damn bus. They’re forced to subsidize the transportation costs of others, and it’s absurdly immoral. A small piece of every day that my father works is taken from him, by force, and given to someone so they can have free bus travel.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Does the Stage help the economy of Summit, allowing easier transport for skiers?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Well, probably.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But most ski tourists would (and should) pay for the bus if it ran like any other legitimate business.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Those who couldn’t pay for the bus travel aren’t exactly contributing much to the economy, I’d imagine.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Regardless, even if the Stage did wonders for the economy, it wouldn’t give the right to usurp wealth from the residents to pay for it. I could think of a hundred programs which could claim to bolster the economy… does that give me the right to take everyone’s money to prove so? It does not.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Government takes my wealth, and the wealth of everyone else (everyone who produces wealth, that is) regardless of whether we use the services or not.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;So, is Alec suggesting that I stop using the services I’ve been forced to pay for?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If I was forced to pay for satellite TV, one can bet I would subsequently sit down to watch it from time to time. This does not mean I support it, or condone it, or that it’s legitimate.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The fact that I use something I’ve been forced to work for doesn’t mean that thing has my sanction.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Only a fool wouldn’t use something he’s already been forced to pay for. If I stole Alec’s wallet, bought Das Kapital, and then gave it to him, should he throw the book away? Well, he should, but for a different reason.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Regarding the Post Office…&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I’ve used it because the Government &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;prevents&lt;/i&gt; competitors from entering the market.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Government doesn’t even allow competition in basic mail delivery!&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Why is this so? The Government sues Microsoft billions for being an alleged monopoly (even though it isn’t) and yet it runs its own monopoly in the mail service (amongst countless other concurrent coercive monopolies). One pays FedEx every day that one uses it. One pays the Post Office every day that one doesn’t use it, and then also on those days when one does.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Regarding the military… I don’t necessarily disapprove of all military spending. There is a lot of room for discussion on this point, although I think the military’s general strategy of policing the world makes me less safe, not more safe. There’s a reason the terrorists didn’t crash a plane into Zurich on September 11.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Regarding Alec’s questions on “why should he pay taxes for my…fill in the blank”&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;He shouldn’t!!! He shouldn’t pay for my mail, he should pay for my transportation, he shouldn’t pay for my school, why does he?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Because he’s forced.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;And let’s get one thing straight, I do not “demand the right to other peoples’ labor.”&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This is a fallacy I can’t let slide.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It is not me condoning policies which force sacrifice on others. One has no right to other peoples’ life nor labour; this is consistently my thesis. The fact that the government forces everyone to pay, and then doles out services at its whim, doesn’t mean I am responsible for such treachery.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Every vote I’ve cast, and every word I’ve written, has occurred with the explicit intention of reducing the state in every possible way, or in other words, reducing the burden that any man may place on any other. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;2. Yes, I would like all taxes to be voluntary, though I acknowledge it may not work. The government would have to be much much smaller than it is, and that is exactly what I want. Since voluntary funding would require a miniscule government, the US Gov has kindly provided me a list of those agencies I’d like to discuss eliminating: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usa.gov/Agencies/Federal/All_Agencies/index.shtml&quot;&gt;http://www.usa.gov/Agencies/Federal/All_Agencies/index.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;You can bet that I’d donate to the US government if its role was limited to the protection of life and property. Ultimately, if we got to such a situation of voluntary taxation and it simply didn’t work – as in there simply were not enough voluntary donations to form a government which protected domestic life and property – then I’d be open to discussing alternatives. We can debate this later, but let’s focus on the issues at hand first.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;3. Public schools &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; a joke, and I say this because American students are taught garbage, and everyone is forced to pay for this garbage. Does Alec think US public schools have done a good job? While there are certainly some public schools that are enviable, they are the minority. The majority are incompetent. Many public schools still debate whether to teach “evolution” or “intelligent design,” as if those two concepts belong in the same classroom. Basic literacy has fallen over the past hundred years. Literacy!!&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Let alone advanced education. &lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;I recommend this article for Alec: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.learninginfo.org/illiteracy-statistics.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.learninginfo.org/illiteracy-statistics.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-list:Ignore&quot;&gt;-&lt;span style=&quot;font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;“After edging upward for apparently more than a century, the reading, writing, and mathematical skills of American students from elementary school through college are now in a prolonged and broad scale decline unequaled in history.

Now the point is approaching when one can be graduated without a knowledge of English.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-list:Ignore&quot;&gt;-&lt;span style=&quot;font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;“Sunday Times reported in 1997 that the standards of education are so low in the U.S. that black Americans are returning to Kenya to get better schooling.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Now, it’s widely believed that US literacy rates are actually wonderful, at around 99%. This figure is of course taught in… Government schools.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But this figure is very basic literacy, and is thus very misleading.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The more important definition is “functional literacy.” I wouldn’t expect most Americans to understand the difference between “literacy” and “functional literacy” because they aren’t, ironically, functionally literate. From our wonderful Government’s own data, here is the breakdown in 2003, which was the last National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL).&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Notice that a whopping 13% of US adults are considered “proficient” in “functional literacy” by the US Gov. (whose standards aren’t exactly Dartmouth level)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/SmYQ5VTvlHI/AAAAAAAAAag/R_xsk0mhcls/s1600-h/proficient_literacy.jpg&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/SmYQ5VTvlHI/AAAAAAAAAag/R_xsk0mhcls/s320/proficient_literacy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5360990983589696626&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 144px; &quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Only 13% of The Public is categorized as “functionally literate,” yet they vote on policies which affect the trajectory of international economics! When education is a joke, democracy is a joke. Here’s some more information from Wikipedia (and I know Wikipedia isn’t omniscient), if Alec’s still not convinced that public education is a joke: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_in_the_United_States&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_in_the_United_States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Perhaps the most telling quotation from this page, &lt;span style=&quot;mso-bidi-;font-size:12.0pt;&quot;&gt;“&lt;span class=&quot;apple-style-span&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:black;&quot;&gt;They [the CIA, who reports the official US literacy levels] also considered individuals literate if they simply stated that they could read and write, and made the assumption that anyone with a fifth grade education had at least an 80% chance of being literate.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Public education is making people more stupid, but hey at least it’s making the poor stupid equally, right?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It’s a shame that I’m forced to pay for the organization which dumbs down those most in need.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Americans should get their education from competing institutions, just like they get food from competing grocery stores, and computers from competing manufacturers. I know Alec distrusts the free market, because the all-knowing and never-motivationally-biased Politburo isn’t in control, but how difficult is it to see the dismal failure that is American public education?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;And with our nation’s childlike intellectual state, is it any wonder that “The Public” votes in politicians who promise free candy?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;So what about the family that only makes $10,000?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Well, in a free market there will be very cheap private schools (there are already). If parents still don’t make enough to get their children very cheap basic education &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;then they shouldn’t have children&lt;/i&gt;. Alec probably thinks this is cold and cruel, but I think it’s cold and cruel to bring a child into the world if you can’t support it, and it is definitely cruel to force others to pay for one’s bundle of joy. Do parents have a right to have children?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Yes (or more specifically they have the right to pursue it), but they don’t have a right to take other peoples’ wealth to pay for it. Just like if a family can’t afford food, they shouldn’t have children! Does Alec think I should be forced to pay for the food of a couple who wishes to have a child? Clearly he does, I guess. We don’t centrally control food just because it’s “important,” and actually the fact that it’s important is precisely why it should not be handled by a coercive, politically motivated monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The bottom line is this – in a free market there would be cheap schools, just like there are cheap foods and cheap cars in the market. If a family can’t afford a child with their income, they ought not have a child. Fornication doesn’t create a legitimate claim on upon the work efforts of other people who had no part in the fornication.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Finally, if we lived in a free society, and there were families asking for financial help with their children, I would sure as hell try to help them, but only to the extent I believed them to be responsible and deserving… a criteria absent in forced Government handouts.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;4. On point 4, Alec is suggesting that he has a right to my money to pay for his education.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;How is that not stealing?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;On health care, it shouldn’t come from his parents’ employer anyway. Why don’t companies pay car insurance? Life insurance? Property insurance? Is he saying his parents don’t have those because their employer doesn’t provide it for them? This is important for Alec to understand – employers pay healthcare because it isn’t taxed as income to the employee, whereas if employees buy their own healthcare, they are taxed on the money first.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Not complicated.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Again, this is a government-created distortion. Regarding public transportation… perhaps if gas wasn’t taxed, and cars weren’t taxed, and Alec’s salary wasn’t taxed (does he have a salary?), and the companies who make cars and gasoline weren’t taxed, and the companies who provide those companies with their supplies weren’t taxed, Alec might have a better chance of paying for his own transportation, instead of forcing others to do so. Alec thinks he has a right to be moved around the world at others’ expense… how is that not slavery?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Alec is honest, at least, when stating, “frankly, I don’t care if you have to pay for things that you don’t support.”&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The true morality of communism emerges.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;5) On point 5, let’s assume for a moment that Rawls was a moral man.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If we ought to judge policies by how they help the least “advantaged” among us, then we ought to judge centralized control of production as an enemy to be resisted at every opportunity.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Welfare does not help the poor, it perpetuates poverty.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Minimum wages do not help the poor, they prevent employment.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Public education does not help the poor, it keeps them ignorant.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Taxes on the rich do not help the poor, they stifle production and wealth creation.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;However, what all these “social” programs do is to help those who feel guilty for living in a nation of builders, those who think wealth is evil, those who think trade is immoral, those who think thought and reason are crimes against the needy, those who think that by building a business, they are robbing the resources of their customers (and therefore prefer to hire the government for that purpose), those who think that by enjoying their bread, they are preventing others from eating… it is these people whom the “social” programs help, not the poor. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The poor are helped when you allow producers to produce and trade amongst the populace, but this is not the main reason to allow production and trade.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;These activities should be allowed because all men deserve to be free, whether poor or rich, and we can thank the natural mechanism of economics for the result that all people tend to be improved when each person is allowed the right to his own life. If you want to help the poor, either do it yourself, or get out of the way so that the world can be built for them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;&quot;&gt;Response to Alec’s follow-up, “Crystallizing important points”:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Alec:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacques says that he supports a social safety net and also a government 10% its current size.  I assume 10% of its current size means collecting 10% of its current taxes, not 10% of the current spending or number of programs because that would mean the death of a social safety net.  So the only way he could have a government with a safety net but 10% of the taxes is the belief that elimination 90% of taxes would result in such a large increase in tax revenue that it would offset the 90% loss.  If cutting taxes by 90% does not yield a net tax increase then Jacques will either have to abandon his support for a social safety net or his support for libertarianism.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Erik’s Response:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned in my former diatribe, we could eliminate the entire income tax and have the size and services of 1990’s government. Quite clearly we could eliminate 90% of the income tax and Jacques will not have to abandon his support for social safety nets nor libertarianism.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If such a miracle were to happen, the US economy would surge and Jacques’ safety nets would be ever more secure.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Alec:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My argument was that in order for net tax revenue to increase after a 90% cut in taxation that wages would have to rise dramatically.  That dramatic rise in wages would cause an increase in inflation and would result in a decrease in actual purchasing power for individuals and the government.  Jacques says that inflation is caused by the government expanding the money supply by printing more money.  This is incomplete because there are other causes of inflation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Erik’s Response:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;This is discussed also in my diatribe.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Only “taxable income” needs to increase, which is very different from income.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;See diatribe for details.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Regarding inflation, there are other ways for money supplies (m1, m2, m3, etc) to be inflated, but they are generally self-correcting and temporary.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;These ways involve the actions of commercial banks, and the actions are self-correcting so long as interest rates are allowed to move freely.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Again, as mentioned, incomes can increase without any inflationary effects (price increases) so long as production keeps pace.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Production would keep pace if taxes were lifted.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Alec:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacques says that since the richest pay most of the taxes only the richest have to see an increase in their salary in order for the government to see a net increase in tax revenue.  So his argument is that only the super rich need to, and will, experience a dramatic increase in wages.  Awesome, the government will have a net increase in tax revenue because millionaires will become billionaires and billionaires will become trillionaires all the while everyone else sees no increase in wages.  Increasing the salary of the richest 1% tenfold while there is absolutely no increase in the salary of the poorest Americans, or any other Americans for that matter, is hardly a good argument for an economic policy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Erik’s Response:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The top 5% pay 60% of the nation’s income tax. This means that 1 in 20 people pay the cost of all government services for about 11 of the other people. How much more does Alec think is just to tax them?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Alec is twisting Jacques argument severely.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Jacques is not saying that only the rich will see wage increases, he is saying only the rich &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; to see wage increases for government revenue to increase.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Big difference.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Alec says that it is bad policy to “increase the salary of the richest 1%” I agree!&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Policy should not dictate salaries, although Alec thinks it should when it comes to certain peoples’ wages.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Is this another arbitrary double standard, or did I already cover this?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Alec:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Additionally, Jacques is living in the land of gumdrops and lollipops if he thinks the country can experience that kind of massive increase in wages and not see any inflation.  If millionaires and billionaires are now making 10 times more than that money will have to come from somewhere.  Either the money supply will increase to adjust for the massive increase amount of money they are being paid or that money will have to be taken from somewhere else.  That means either there will be inflation or regular workers and the poorest will have their wages cut   The bottom line is that the necessary increase in wages to result in a net increase in tax revenue would either mean a dramatic increase in inflation which would cripple the economy or a dramatic decrease in everyone else&#39;s wages.  Either way it would to a decrease in the real purchasing power of almost everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Erik’s Response:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Once again, price increases are only inevitable if production doesn’t keep up.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;More money chasing more goods won’t increase prices.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Prices increase when more money chases the same or fewer goods (which is the current course Obama is speeding down).&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Now, if we lived in a truly free market (the kind which the world is claiming has “failed” even though it never existed), then what would occur is that wages may rise or fall nominally, but the &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;cost&lt;/i&gt; of goods would tend to fall across the economy over time, so purchasing power would increase.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;All of Alec’s concerns are a great argument in favor of a commodity backed monetary standard, but this would prevent prolonged federal budget deficits, something Alec would support in Bush’s case but not in Obama’s… another arbitrary double-standard!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Alec:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is such a dramatic increase in wages inherently undesirable but it is incredibly unlikely.  The tenfold increase in executive wages would not only be very unlikely but would not be indicative of and proportional to an increase in the productivity and profitability of the company they work for.  Additionally, the majority of tax profits come from corporate taxes rather than income taxes on individuals.  In order for individual income to increase enough to offset the loss in tax revenue from the elimination of corporate taxes the income of the richest 1% would have to increase by more than tenfold.  it would have to increase fifty fold or one hundred fold, or more.  The bottom line is that it is utter fantasy to expect a net increase in tax revenue after a 90% cut in income taxes and the elimination of the corporate tax.  There is absolutely no way for that to happen and for Jacques to both support a social safety net and a libertarian tax policy is inconsistent.  He must abandon one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Erik’s Response:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;I believe Alec is pulling his numbers out of, as he called it, “the land of gumdrops and lollipops.”&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;He states, “the majority of tax profits (the Government doesn’t make profit, fyi) come from corporate taxes rather than income taxes on individuals.”&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;So, how does Alec explain this chart from the Congressional Budget Office for Federal Taxes in fiscal year 2008:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/SmYRlGmczqI/AAAAAAAAAao/rL04mZPYFSs/s320/FedTaxRevenue2008.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5360991735555870370&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; cursor: pointer; width: 167px; height: 320px; &quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;I guess technically he is correct (although I have a feeling he was referring to just corporate income tax, in which case he’s somewhat exaggerating).&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;48% of the above revenue comes from Payroll + Corp Income taxes, and only 45% comes from individual income tax.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Alec says, “In order for individual income to increase enough to offset the loss in tax revenue from the elimination of corporate taxes the income of the richest 1% would have to increase by more than tenfold.  It would have to increase fifty fold or one hundred fold, or more.”&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Let’s do the math, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;Disclaimer: ignore all laws of economics which would suggest that treasury income may increase when tax rates decrease. Let’s assume for the below analysis that when rates decrease, income decreases proportionately, even though that’s preposterous.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;If we eliminate the corporate taxes (income and payroll) then the tax revenue will have lost 48% of its former total.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Since the income of the richest 1% pays for 35% of the IRS’ personal income tax revenue (&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  line-height: 20px; font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncpa.org/sub/dpd/index.php?Article_ID=13984&quot;&gt;http://www.ncpa.org/sub/dpd/index.php?Article_ID=13984&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  line-height: normal; font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;, that means they pay 15% of the entire federal budget (.35 x .45 = .15).&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Since we lost 48% of the budget, the richest 1% will need to pay an additional 3X on top of their current payment to make up for it.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If all factors are held constant, that means the salaries of the top 1% need to increase by 300%, or “three fold”… not fifty fold or one hundred fold or more, as Alec asserts. If the top 1% had a salary increase of 100 fold, that would mean the Federal Revenue would grow about 15 times larger! (100fold x 15% of federal budget = 15 federal budgets)&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;The land of gumdrops and lollipops, indeed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;If we cut 90% of the personal income tax, &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the entire corporate income tax, the federal budget would be&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;4.5% income + 36% payroll + 4% other + 3% excise =&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;47.5%&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;So, if we shrank government by just over half, we could eliminate 90% of the personal income tax and the entire corporate income tax… pretty incredible.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;And, as according to the disclaimer above, this all assumes that the economy wouldn’t grow under conditions of lower taxation, which is of course preposterous.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Alec then claims… “There is absolutely no way for that to happen and for Jacques to both support a social safety net and a libertarian tax policy is inconsistent.  He must abandon one or the other.”&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Well… I think a government 47.5% as large as the one in 2008 would be able to provide a few safety nets, at least, so Jacques is being utterly reasonable.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Yet, I fear this isn’t a fair critique of Alec’s philosophy, because communism and math have never mixed very well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Alec:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacques also claims that I do know know what the Laffer Curve is.  This is both the uncharitable interpretation of my argument and slightly insulting.  Of course I know what the Laffer Curve is.  My point is that we are on the opposite of the curve that Jacques believes we are.  I believe that it is possible to raise taxes and still raise net tax income.  Our disagreement is in many ways which side of the curve we are on and to simply accuse me of not understanding what it is in the first place entirely sidesteps the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Erik’s Response:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Alec is allowed to believe whatever he wants regarding where we are on Laffer’s Curve. However, if he’d read anything recently about the thousands of millionaires who are moving their money out of the US, then perhaps he’d alter his opinion. If he’d read anything recently about companies relocating to tax-friendly nations like the UAE, then perhaps he’d alter his opinion.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If he’d read anything recently about the relocation of jobs and divisions to subsidiary outsource companies that aren’t subject to US taxation, then perhaps he’d alter his opinion.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If he’d ever earned a good income, or run a business, and felt the relentless sting of taxation poisoning his efforts every quarter, then perhaps he’d alter his opinion. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Alec:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacques also claims that there were a number of other factors that lead to the expansion in the economy during the Clinton administration.  This is fair enough, I am not making claims about what causes the economic expansion during the Clinton administration.  My argument is that low taxes are not a necessary part of economic expansion.  My argument is that the economy can expand and become more competitive even when taxes are high and that is empirically true.  Since that is the case, low taxes are not a necessary component of economic expansion and high taxes do not necessarily lead to economic contraction.  This is the final nail in the coffin of Jacques position.  His libertarianism is not based in principle, only expediency.  So unlike most other libertarians, he should actually be forced to abandon his position if it is shown that it does not or cannot work.  The empirics are not on his side.  The economy has expanded when taxes are high.  The economy has retracted when taxes were low.  There is no way for there to be a net increase in governmental revenue when taxes are cut by 90%.  There is no principle that supports his tax policy, there are no empirics to justify such a policy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Erik’s Response:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Alec is correct that “low taxes are not a necessary part of economic expansion.” Economies can expand under high taxation (the US is evidence of this).&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The crucial idea here, however, is that high taxation suffocates/limits/restricts growth, so that even though a nation can grow under taxation, it would grow faster without such burdens.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;And, because the poor are most easily helped the richer a nation is, anyone who advocates help for the poor should do everything they can to unshackle the economy.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;It comes down to a question of short-term and long-term.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Short-term, it may help some families to give them free __________, but long-term it is much better to allow the economy to surge ahead.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Every child Alec feels good about helping in the present is helped at the cost of being less able to help children in the future.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I suppose that’s a personal judgment, except that it’s not because Alec forces me to abide by his short-term philanthropic strategy. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Regarding the “final nail in the coffin of Jacques’ position”… I fail to see how the statement “high taxes do not necessarily lead to economic contraction” is a nail in any coffin.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;High taxes, if other factors aren’t held equal, may not visibly cause the economy to contract.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;However, high taxes, if other factors &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; held equal, will prevent the economy from growing as quickly as it otherwise would, and if they’re high enough they’ll cause the economy to indeed contract.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;An increase in taxation will virtually always stifle, to some degree, economic growth (though it doesn’t necessarily make it contract), and so the only “nails in the coffin” must be for the poor who would have otherwise been helped, had the economy been just marginally stronger.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Jacques also never claimed that his libertarian ideology was based on principle. I believe he is a libertarian for pragmatic, rational, and utilitarian reasons. The empirics &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; on his side, though Alec disagrees.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Not only is it possible for there to be a net increase in governmental revenue when taxes are cut by 90%, it’s just a question of how long it would take (1 year? 10 years?).&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The principle that supports Jacques’ tax policy is called the principle of “economics,” and there are numerous empirics to justify such a policy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;I encourage Alec to attempt refutation on any of the above.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Some final thoughts for Alec…&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-indent:35.45pt&quot;&gt;Take two identical countries, and hold all factors equal except the size of government. In one country keep the government small. In the other country, let the government grow (and let it provide any and all services). Then, let’s make a bet on which country will have the highest standard of living at the end of 100 years. I’ll bet that the small government country will win, and you’ll bet that the large government country will win.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-indent:35.45pt&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, because you’re a statist, you’ll also &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;force&lt;/i&gt; me to bet on your country. You won’t give me a choice, whereas I would never make you bet on my country.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This is the difference between us. You force other people, through government, to accept your opinion, whereas I do not. &lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;I respect your right to bet on whatever you want.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;You not extend the same respect to me. Statists &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;force&lt;/i&gt; others to agree with them, libertarians do not.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;So even if your bet happened to be correct (!), and your country was better off after 100 years, the libertarians would still have the moral upper ground, because they didn’t hold a gun to anyone’s head and force them to surrender their property for the experiment.&lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;-Erik&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div style=&quot;mso-element:footnote-list&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/feeds/234103910912976762/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=513710724906503704&amp;postID=234103910912976762&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/234103910912976762'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/234103910912976762'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/2009/07/response-to-alec-communist-alec-1.html' title='Response to Alec the Communist'/><author><name>Erik Voorhees</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01780045950459697961</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='28' height='32' src='http://bp2.blogger.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/R5sK0XtoHvI/AAAAAAAAAA8/NMS9qZv6DOA/S220/self-photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/SmYOuIArDVI/AAAAAAAAAaI/Yd4HcxH8dF4/s72-c/Hausers+Law.gif" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-513710724906503704.post-7836586174213419460</id><published>2009-06-28T12:18:00.004+04:00</published><updated>2009-06-28T16:47:02.698+04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Political Theory"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Redistribution"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Taxation"/><title type='text'>On Lifeboats and Redistribution</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/SkdkJCIeMVI/AAAAAAAAAZk/JM4qcoX8sS0/s1600-h/Atlas1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 272px; height: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/SkdkJCIeMVI/AAAAAAAAAZk/JM4qcoX8sS0/s320/Atlas1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5352356788507128146&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;color:#660000;&quot;&gt;Justification for wealth redistribution rests on the presumption that resources are finite in number and, being finite, should not be horded by any one person or group. Consider the useful example of a lifeboat, with a set ration of resources aboard and a suffering manifest of starving, apprehensive passengers.  Indeed, if there were a fixed quantity of resources in the world, it may be most ethical to distribute it evenly amongst the populace. If we lived in a world in which one man could only gain by another’s loss, in which one passenger’s dinner came at the exclusion of another passenger’s breakfast, then it may well be most ethical to “redistribute” resources evenly, ensuring no person enjoyed two dinners before all had enjoyed their first.   Fortunately, this is not the world in which we live. Our world is not a lifeboat and it ought not to be considered as such.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;color:#660000;&quot;&gt;Our world, most thankfully, is one in which wealth is created by man.  Wealth is not finite.  If one requires compelling evidence of this assertion, one may simply look at the material benefits enjoyed by man 50,000 years ago. These benefits included sticks, rocks, some meat and pelts, and the occasional cave.  Fast forward to 2,000 B.C. and material goods have increased dramatically – the average human then owning pots and pans, bronze tools, musical instruments, styled garments, spices, various types of food (bread and butter!) and usually a hovel of humble standard.  All these new goods were not “discovered” in the forests, they were created by man’s effort and traded amongst men, each trade benefiting both traders.  All this new wealth existed for the average person, despite the fact that the human population had increased substantially. There were more goods for more people. The lifeboat analogy is thus an inadequate representation of reality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;color:#660000;&quot;&gt;Fast forward again, to 2000 A.D., and once again an incalculable amount of new material wealth exists for a vastly larger population.  Stereos, advanced medicines, Teflon-coated cooking pots!  The average family (in the freest parts of the world) owns all these things and much more. Cars, microwaves, sonic toothbrushes and the cappuccino – the material goods enjoyed by people today are unimaginably greater than those which existed only a few hundred years ago. Again, the wealth was not found in the forests… it was created by man, and not created by man as a group but by individual men and women, each working in their own self-interest; each seeking profit and plentitude.  The new wealth is created and traded amongst those who combine the proper skills and resources, which in turn originated from still other producers, engineers, and organizers. Wealth is not found, and the vast majority of wealth was never consciously “distributed” in the first place. Wealth is created just as songs, poetry, and paintings are created, and it would make little sense to “redistribute” these items, though some may claim to suffer from an art deficiency. Should vast sums of art be usurped from the current owners and presented to anyone in need of a Monet?   This is a preposterous question.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;color:#660000;&quot;&gt;It should thus be apparent that goods tend to increase in number – that the “pie” (a terrible metaphor itself) expands – and that this occurs as the result of man’s efforts and industry. To deny that wealth increases is to deny the computer screen upon which this sentence is written.  Understanding this concept – that wealth is created – is fundamental to any argument against “redistribution,” because by redistributing goods, one is changing the incentives which produced those very goods in the first place. Whenever goods are redistributed, it alters the mechanism by which they originate.  If wealth grew on trees, it would be ill-advised to harm the tress, and it is similarly imprudent to harm productive individuals. Those people who tend to produce the most wealth are, in our society, typically labeled the “rich,” and it is these people whose incentives change when the product of their life and work are taken from them by force and given to someone else.  The result, as one should expect, is for less production to occur in aggregate.  When the rich have less to trade, less trade will occur, and society as a whole will suffer for it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;color:#660000;&quot;&gt;Society suffers because every dollar in the millionaire’s bank account represents more than one dollar of benefit gained by whoever gave him that dollar. When one sees a man with a million dollars, one should be thankful to him, because he has likely provided over a million dollars worth of gain to other people, for to obtain that money legally he is required to produce and trade. His million wasn’t “taken” from someone else; his dinner came at the expense of nobody’s breakfast. One could relatively easily audit the rich man’s bank account, highlight the deposits, call the depositors, and ask whether they received more in value than the amount of their deposit.  The answer is likely to be… “yes.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;color:#660000;&quot;&gt; The rich man didn’t produce and trade to be generous; his sole intention was to help himself, just as the people with whom he traded were helping themselves.  So long as theft and fraud are avoided, when people are permitted to help themselves, one can expect that people will tend to be helped. People will tend to be better off, because they are trying to that end; they are producing for that result. This, of course, was Adam Smith’s central argument; this was his revolutionary idea, as he famously suggested, “it is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.” As such, it can be expected that by discouraging the self-interest of the butcher, brewer, and baker – by punishing them in the form of taxation levied upon their work – one is likely to discourage someone’s dinner, or someone’s breakfast, from appearing at the table.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;color:#660000;&quot;&gt;When one grasps these concepts, the notion of redistribution quickly becomes preposterous.  For the best way to help the poor is to allow the producers to produce, to their fullest and greatest capacity. By so doing, more wealth will come into being, and over time (though not necessarily over the time of a political term) the standard of living of people will tend to rise. Most importantly, living standards will rise justly and morally because they happened through the voluntary actions of individuals, instead of through the violent force of Government.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;color:#660000;&quot;&gt;By engaging in redistribution, by handing Bob a welfare check, Government helps Bob at the expense of at least two other people: the unwilling wealthy man who provided the money, and the unknowing poor man with whom the former will no longer be transacting, for he has now been robbed of the wealth and the motivation to do so. Unfortunately, people see Bob smiling with his new check, and see the rich man who can certainly still afford dinner, and they rest easily believing that “the poor” have been helped by their forceful intervention and that the rich man resists only because he is selfish and uncaring.  The other poor man, Bastiat’s crucial “unseen,” is the tragic victim who goes unnoticed as his business sells one fewer goods the next day. You can perhaps understand that he may be the next man in line at the welfare office – a second welfare check then required. And so it continues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;color:#660000;&quot;&gt;For anyone who values individual liberty (each man’s right to live his life as he sees fit so long as he respects the same right of others), the only compatible political system is one which gets out of the way so that unbridled production and trade may occur.  For anyone who values charity (helping others who warrant assistance), the only compatible political system is likewise one which gets out of the way so that unbridled production and trade may occur. It is wonderfully fortunate for those who fall into both categories, like the author, that the solution to both concerns is the same. It is woefully unfortunate that society prevents the solution from occurring, believing us all to be stuck in a lifeboat with ever-dwindling rations. The irony is that the lifeboat is becoming increasingly applicable to our situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/feeds/7836586174213419460/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=513710724906503704&amp;postID=7836586174213419460&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/7836586174213419460'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/7836586174213419460'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/2009/06/on-lifeboats-and-redistribution.html' title='On Lifeboats and Redistribution'/><author><name>Erik Voorhees</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01780045950459697961</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='28' height='32' src='http://bp2.blogger.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/R5sK0XtoHvI/AAAAAAAAAA8/NMS9qZv6DOA/S220/self-photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/SkdkJCIeMVI/AAAAAAAAAZk/JM4qcoX8sS0/s72-c/Atlas1.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-513710724906503704.post-2768868349124124651</id><published>2009-06-14T19:48:00.015+04:00</published><updated>2009-06-29T17:57:45.748+04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Economics"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Political Theory"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Taxation"/><title type='text'>The Morality of Progressive Taxation</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;To suggest that one man should be given the property of another requires the implication of a right. The claim that the poor have a right to the wealth of the rich is perhaps the most pernicious fallacy in our society, for by what right can this be so? In America, a man is alleged to have a right of property. This was one of, if not the most, fundamental assertions in the founding of the nation. This was the great breakthrough of America, that man owns himself and thus his property, and that he is free to do with either so long as he extends the same respect to other men. This is the very principle of “America,” that each man is free from theft and violence, regardless of whether the intrusion originates from other men or from the “State” which is, of course, just more men. Because of this simple principle, America became the great nation that it was (note the dismayed usage of past tense), with capitalism the inevitable social result and practical implementation of freedom and property rights. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/SjUdRm8SLJI/AAAAAAAAAWk/v9EFSlDCHPg/s1600-h/NemoMeImpuneLacesset.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5347212320920710290&quot; style=&quot;FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; WIDTH: 300px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 306px&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/SjUdRm8SLJI/AAAAAAAAAWk/v9EFSlDCHPg/s320/NemoMeImpuneLacesset.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Today, somehow, we’ve turned into a country where this prime principle of America’s founding is all but completely inverted. Today, a man only has a right to his property until a politician wishes to expropriate it. This means that no right exists in the first place. Rights today are an illusory relic from America’s past. Americans, now, do not own property by right but instead by permission from whatever administration happens to be in charge that year. Whatever a man earns, whatever he produces and saves, is no longer his. Instead, he merely is permitted to use it until it’s required “for the benefit of society.” Society is just a collection of individuals, so Americans must now surrender their earnings, the product of their life’s work on Earth, to other individuals at the sole discretion of Washington, or in other words, at the sole discretion of still other individuals. This is utterly antagonistic to the concept of America and will lead not to a “progressive” era of universal prosperity, but instead to a regressive era of universal mediocrity, at best. Wealth redistribution is not the policy of a nation of free men, but of slaves – each man to everyone else. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question of “how much redistribution is appropriate?” is only applicable after society has decided that “redistribution” itself is morally legitimate. Clearly, today, the Government and most Americans believe that redistribution is indeed morally legitimate. However, it does not matter if 1% or 99% of a populace believe something if that something in question is supposed to be an inalienable right of man. If 99% of the nation votes that one man must give up his property to another, that does not make it legitimate. Men’s property, like their lives, are not supposed to be up for popular vote. Rights cannot be voted away, and in fact this is their defining attribute. When a man is taxed, he is working (he is spending his life) for the benefit of the recipient of those taxes. This is no different than slavery in principle, it is only a question of extent. 99% of the nation should not be able to vote a man into slavery. For the same reason, 99% should not be able to vote a man’s life into servitude through taxation. What is man’s by right is his by right, not by permission of his neighbors. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;-&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;If private property is not a right of man, if America wishes to alter its founding principles, then let it proclaim loud and clear to the rest of the world that such is the case. If America does not value freedom, then let it proclaim as such. As politicians usurp men’s liberties, let them at least be honest about their activity. The nation has already implicitly and explicitly denounced capitalism, which is simply the combination of freedom and legal property rights, so why does America still hide behind the false pretense of liberty? America has become a nation of a fraudulent philosophy, proclaiming to be the beacon of freedom, though resting atop the same socialist tyranny that exists elsewhere in the world. When Russian newspapers condemn America’s policies as “overtly Marxist,” what further indication of impending tyranny is needed?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;-&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;If some salaries are too high in this country, then denounce them as such and convince the men paying those salaries that they’re bargaining incorrectly. But do not legislate against other peoples’ right to trade their property as they wish, for you have no right to do so. If some people who are unable to help themselves are rotting under bridges, then organize charities to help them. But do not legislate the confiscation of one man’s wealth for the sake of those upon whom you personally take pity, for you have no right to do so. If the Government is so effective at allocating resources, then by all means hand yours over to them as an investment and convince others to do the same voluntarily. But do not assume that all people agree with your assessment of the fiduciary finesse of Government, and do not legislate that others must agree and submit to your investment strategy, for you have no right to do so.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;-&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;By what justification does one man have the right to enjoy life at the expense of another man, if that other man has committed no crime? It is slavery, partial but in fact. If slavery is immoral in principle, so too is wealth redistribution, and for the very same reason. If wealth redistribution is moral in principle, then so too is slavery, and any argument against slavery must be made on the basis of degree, not of principle. Slaves must surrender 100% of their work to their master. Should slaves be freed because they simply endure “too much servitude” and all that’s needed to remedy the injustice is to tax them at a lower rate, something less than 100%? Or, should slaves be freed because men, by their nature, should be free? If a 50% tax is moral, but a 100% tax is not, then at what tax rate does the morality invert? Is it simply a matter to be left to popular vote? And if so, can America please openly proclaim as such, so that those still clinging to delusions of liberty don’t waste their breath in vein?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;-&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;After all the taxes, today’s American must surrender 40-60% of the product of his work to other individuals at the discretion of still other individuals voted into power by the former. So I must wonder, is America supposed to be a nation where nobody is a full slave but everyone half so? &lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/feeds/2768868349124124651/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=513710724906503704&amp;postID=2768868349124124651&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/2768868349124124651'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/2768868349124124651'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/2009/06/morality-of-progressive-taxation.html' title='The Morality of Progressive Taxation'/><author><name>Erik Voorhees</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01780045950459697961</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='28' height='32' src='http://bp2.blogger.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/R5sK0XtoHvI/AAAAAAAAAA8/NMS9qZv6DOA/S220/self-photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/SjUdRm8SLJI/AAAAAAAAAWk/v9EFSlDCHPg/s72-c/NemoMeImpuneLacesset.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-513710724906503704.post-6771347639309699501</id><published>2009-06-11T16:06:00.005+04:00</published><updated>2009-06-11T16:18:55.565+04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Jobs"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Obama"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Political Theory"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Taxation"/><title type='text'>On Job Creation</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/SjD1duYPZlI/AAAAAAAAAWU/_Arbu77JlY8/s1600-h/green-jobs-101.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5346042648703493714&quot; style=&quot;FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; WIDTH: 320px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 214px&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/SjD1duYPZlI/AAAAAAAAAWU/_Arbu77JlY8/s320/green-jobs-101.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Obama’s plan to create jobs is very interesting and unexpected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let’s analyze this plan a bit… after all, important issues warrant analysis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each Federal Department seems to have the task of “creating jobs.” For example, quoting from Biden’s “Road Map”: &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The Department of Education will fund 135,000 education jobs&lt;br /&gt;-The Department of Transportation will begin improvements at 98 airports and 1,500 highways&lt;br /&gt;-The Department of Justice will hire or maintain 5,000 law enforcement officers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we want to be honest with ourselves, we will acknowledge that there are the benefits of the job creation AND the negatives of the cost of the jobs. It’s fair to calculate the costs of a program, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For each department’s initiative, let’s just add one simple phrase to more accurately account for this cost:&lt;br /&gt;-The Department of Education will fund 135,000 education jobs &lt;strong&gt;at the expense of the taxpayers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The Department of Transportation will begin improvements at 98 airports and 1,500 highways &lt;strong&gt;at the expense of the taxpayers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The Department of Justice will hire or maintain 5,000 law enforcement officers &lt;strong&gt;at the expense of the taxpayers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s a reason Obama leaves “at the expense of the taxpayers” off of his sentences, but let’s continue. In America, because of “progressive tax rates” the wealthy are forced to pay much much much more than everyone else. The top 5% of income earners (making about $150k or more) pay 60% of the nation’s tax revenue, or in other words, they pay the majority. The wealthiest 5% pay the majority of the taxes in America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we can rewrite this job creation plan more accurately still:&lt;br /&gt;-The Department of Education will fund 135,000 education jobs &lt;strong&gt;at the expense primarily of the wealthiest 5%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The Department of Transportation will begin improvements at 98 airports and 1,500 highways &lt;strong&gt;at the expense primarily of the wealthiest 5%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The Department of Justice will hire or maintain 5,000 law enforcement officers &lt;strong&gt;at the expense primarily of the wealthiest 5%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We could actual abstract this plan to all government programs in the US as follows:&lt;br /&gt;-The Department of ____________ will _____________ &lt;strong&gt;at the expense primarily of the wealthiest 5%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it any wonder that politicians operate in this manner? All they must do is tax a very small minority and in return give “benefits” to 95% of Americans.

Next time Government discusses “job creation,” consider the following ideas (GE’s life-support is equally applicable):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;Some claim that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;War&quot; style=&quot;-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;war&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt; is a benefactor, since historically it often has focused the use of resources and triggered advances in technology and other areas. The increased production and employment &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;War economy&quot; style=&quot;-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_economy&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;associated with war&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt; often leads some to claim that &quot;war is good for the economy.&quot; However, this is an example of the broken window fallacy. The money spent on the war effort, for example, is money that cannot be spent on food, clothing, health care, consumer electronics or other areas. The stimulus felt in one sector of the economy comes at a direct—but hidden—cost to other sectors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, war destroys property and lives. The economic stimulus to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Defense industry&quot; style=&quot;-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_industry&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;defense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt; sector is offset not only by immediate &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Opportunity costs&quot; style=&quot;-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_costs&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;opportunity costs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;, but also by the costs of the damage and devastation of war. This forms the basis of a second application of the broken window fallacy: rebuilding what war destroys stimulates the economy, particularly the construction sector. However, immense resources are spent merely to restore pre-war conditions. After a war, there is only a rebuilt city. Without a war, there are opportunities for the same resources to be applied to more fruitful purposes. Instead of rebuilding a destroyed city, the resources could have been used to build a second city or add improvements.&lt;br /&gt;….&lt;br /&gt;Special interests request money from the government (in the form of subsidies, grants, etc.), and the government then forces the taxpayer to provide the funds. The recipients certainly do benefit, so the government action is often regarded by the people as benefitting everyone. But the people are failing to consider the hidden costs: the taxpayers are now poorer by exactly that much money. The food, clothing or other items they might have purchased with that money will now not be purchased—but since there is no way to count &quot;non-purchases,&quot; this is a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Hidden cost&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_cost&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;hidden cost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;, sometimes called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Opportunity cost&quot; style=&quot;-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;opportunity cost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;. Bastiat referred to this in his essay as &quot;what is not seen&quot;. Because the costs are hidden, there is an illusion that the benefits cost nothing. Hazlitt summarized the principle by saying, &quot;Everything we get, outside the free gifts of nature, must in some way be paid for.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As examples of the popular prevalence of this absurdity in those who drive the opinions of America:&lt;br /&gt;- Keynes famously suggested that, at times, it would be a good idea for the government to build completely useless pyramids so as to employ workers and get money flowing.&lt;br /&gt;- More recently, Keynes’ lovechild Paul Krugman suggested that the destruction of the World Trade Center may benefit the American economy because “rebuilding will generate at least some increase in business spending.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keynes and Krugman are Nobel-winning economists. We really do still live in the dark ages of popular economic understanding. Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr., of the Mises Economics Blog, states it well, &quot;[The Broken Window Fallacy] sounds like an unexceptional claim. But herein rests the core case against everything the government does. Perhaps, then, we can see why the allegory is not better known. If we took it seriously, we would dismantle the whole apparatus of American economic intervention.&quot; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;For more comment, read an excellent article from Mr. Rockwell here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mises.org/story/2868&quot;&gt;http://www.mises.org/story/2868&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/feeds/3040109422982618803/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=513710724906503704&amp;postID=3040109422982618803&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/3040109422982618803'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/3040109422982618803'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/2009/06/timeliness-of-broken-window.html' title='The Timeliness of the Broken Window'/><author><name>Erik Voorhees</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01780045950459697961</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='28' height='32' src='http://bp2.blogger.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/R5sK0XtoHvI/AAAAAAAAAA8/NMS9qZv6DOA/S220/self-photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/Si-xPQbEQzI/AAAAAAAAAWM/IiaibWaMp_0/s72-c/BrokenWindow.png" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-513710724906503704.post-7344862836193396964</id><published>2009-05-09T19:28:00.006+04:00</published><updated>2009-05-09T21:48:32.646+04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Credit Cards"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Obama"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Political Theory"/><title type='text'>Big Credit and Big Government</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/SgXB3SgTQ_I/AAAAAAAAAVs/QcCXv9-yj3U/s1600-h/credit-cards.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5333882489294504946&quot; style=&quot;FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; WIDTH: 200px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 181px&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/SgXB3SgTQ_I/AAAAAAAAAVs/QcCXv9-yj3U/s320/credit-cards.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Send me a bill that stops credit card companies from taking advantage of consumers, and do it by month&#39;s end, President Barack Obama is demanding of Congress&quot; - AP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Obama-Send-me-credit-card-apf-15192120.html?sec=topStories&amp;amp;pos=main&amp;amp;asset=&amp;amp;ccode&quot;&gt;http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Obama-Send-me-credit-card-apf-15192120.html?sec=topStories&amp;amp;pos=main&amp;amp;asset=&amp;amp;ccode&lt;/a&gt;=&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet again, the US Government is regulating voluntary actions between individuals through the use of coercive force. And, yet again, it is doing so under the false and self-defeating pretenses of &quot;protection&quot; and &quot;fairness.&quot; Obama has taken it upon himself to protect every American by relinquishing them of their adult responsibilities and is in fact punishing credit providers for an offense his own organization is much more guilty of committing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purpose of Obama&#39;s regulation du jour is to prevent Americans from &quot;being scammed&quot; or &quot;tricked&quot; by manipulative credit card companies (I&#39;m still awaiting the imminent moniker &quot;Big Credit&quot; to spew out of some populist Senator&#39;s mouth). Surely, nobody wants to be tricked, and for this reason it is likely Obama&#39;s scheme will have substantial support. After all, who wouldn&#39;t want to be absolved of their obligations to fulfill burdensome credit card contracts?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me first say this: If the credit card companies are actually tricking or manipulating their customers, then let the victims bring suit against these fraudulent actions. This is the way a lawful society works... upon breach of a law, the victim has the right to claim reparation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, Obama - with the full faith and encouragement of the US population, no doubt - is deciding that adults are not capable of being responsible for themselves because they have the possibility of misreading their mail and misunderstanding advertisements. I wonder if this will become a precedent for new avenues of Government intervention. I wonder if the same argument will soon be used to legislate peoples&#39; mortgage contracts (given the recent issues associated with mortgage repayment). I wonder if Obama will be surprised when these policies make debt more expensive for the consumer (and the lender) and thus more burdensome and costly for society in aggregate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obama continues...&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Americans know that they have a responsibility to live within their means and pay what they owe, but they also have a right to not get ripped off by the sudden rate hikes, unfair penalties, and hidden fees that have become all too common.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From this statement, Obama clearly wants to uphold the illusion of personal responsibility while in the very same breath demolishing the concept completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further Obama states...&lt;br /&gt;&quot;You shouldn&#39;t have to fear that any new credit card is going to come with strings attached...&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is an &quot;attached string?&quot; Could that refer to a &quot;term&quot; or a &quot;condition?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Translation: you shouldn&#39;t have to understand finance in order to obtain it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, Obama has now mandated that Americans have the right to avoid &quot;unfair penalties.&quot; Of course, one might consider that having 40% of his wealth seized from him by the IRS is an unfair penalty on his earned income, but it is unlikely Obama will include that obvious injustice within the scope of this new legislation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Continuing...&lt;br /&gt;&quot;nor should you need a magnifying class and a reference book to read a credit card application.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can Obama bash credit card companies for their complicated contracts when the US Tax Code is by far the most convoluted document in all of existence (is this an exaggeration?). Most people can understand credit card contracts if they actually read them. Most people cannot understand the Tax Code, if for no other reason than that its intricacies have required volumes of books to detail and its practice has become a full-time profession for thousands of people throughout the country. An entire industry has sprung up to help people navigate the tax code (or are they just profiteering?). The same cannot be said of credit card contracts. Now, it is true that these contracts may require some &quot;thinking,&quot; but if one can&#39;t understand them, one doesn&#39;t have to sign up for the card in the first place. The same cannot be said of the tax code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obama is thus going to punish credit card companies for a crime that his own organization is most guilty of committing. The outlawing of &quot;sudden rate hikes, unfair penalties, and hidden fees,&quot; is almost criminally ironic, for this description is utterly more applicable to US tax policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the real scam? Who is a bigger threat to Americans- credit card companies or the Internal Revenue Service? Who siphons off more money? Who provides a better service for the debts? Whose policy is easier to understand? Who&#39;s subjected to the competitive marketplace and who hides behind a coercive monopoly? Most importantly, whose service is voluntary?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Americans are coercively forced to pay income taxes, subjected perpetually to sudden rate hikes, unfair penalties, and hidden fees. All Americans have the choice to take advantage of debt from credit card companies, subjected only to rate hikes, penalties, and fees which were stipulated upfront in their contracts (failing this the individual is entitled to sue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, really, is Obama’s latest cry for change directed at the right thing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/feeds/7344862836193396964/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=513710724906503704&amp;postID=7344862836193396964&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/7344862836193396964'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/7344862836193396964'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/2009/05/big-credit-and-big-government.html' title='Big Credit and Big Government'/><author><name>Erik Voorhees</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01780045950459697961</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='28' height='32' src='http://bp2.blogger.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/R5sK0XtoHvI/AAAAAAAAAA8/NMS9qZv6DOA/S220/self-photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/SgXB3SgTQ_I/AAAAAAAAAVs/QcCXv9-yj3U/s72-c/credit-cards.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-513710724906503704.post-880320516830953027</id><published>2009-01-28T22:11:00.007+04:00</published><updated>2009-05-23T14:10:47.534+04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Economics"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Paul Krugman"/><title type='text'>Paul Krugman is Smarter than You</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;TEXT-ALIGN: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;201&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2006/04/02/opinion/ts-krugman-190.jpg&quot; width=&quot;190&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;On January the 25th, 2009, &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:130%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Mr. Paul Krugman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; graced the world with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/opinion/26krugman.html?_r=2&amp;amp;em&quot;&gt;a brilliant op-ed piece&lt;/a&gt; published (appropriately) in The New York Times. This piece is a &quot;refutation&quot; of the critics of Obama&#39;s massive government spending plan. I&#39;d call it a &quot;New Deal&quot; plan but of course there is nothing new about it - logarithmic spending increase is the standard practice in Washington. When Obama speaks of &quot;change,&quot; the size of government is certainly not up for consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Krugman is a very famous columnist, and recently he won the &quot;Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences,&quot; an award just slightly more worthless than the US dollar would be if he were to be President. Fortunately for him, Obama will enact just about every policy Krugman lusts after, so maybe his next Nobel prize can cost-effectively be written on an actual dollar bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This article is called &quot;Bad Faith Economics,&quot; which I think is a completely accurate title. The essence of the article is Krugman introducing arguments made by &quot;conservatives,&quot; who are &quot;reaching for any stick they can find with which to beat proposals for increased government spending.&quot; Making their job easier, however, Krugman provides a sufficiently large stick with which to beat himself. Whether conservatives choose to exploit the opportunity or not, I figure I&#39;ll take the first swing at the pinata.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, let&#39;s analyze his article bit by bit. First paragraph:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic;font-size:85%;&quot; &gt;&quot;Some of these arguments are obvious cheap shots. John Boehner, the House minority leader, has already made headlines with one such shot: looking at an $825 billion plan to rebuild infrastructure, sustain essential services and more, he derided a minor provision that would expand Medicaid family-planning services — and called it a plan to “spend hundreds of millions of dollars on contraceptives.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:100%;&quot;&gt;I&#39;m not going to comment on Boehner&#39;s criticism, (the money shouldn&#39;t be spent period, regardless of whether it&#39;s buying condoms or a 5-month bankruptcy referral for GM) but understand how Krugman sets up his first point. First of all, he mentions that Obama&#39;s spending program is going to &quot;rebuild infrastructure.&quot; Well, might one ask why, if government is so effective at everything, is the infrastructure in need of repair? Why do our roads need rebuilding? Why do bridges need new steel replacement? Why does the powergrid suffer? Interesting that the organization which has allowed infrastructure to decay is now being granted almost a trillion dollars to continue managing it. Second, Krugman speculates that the money will &quot;sustain essential services.&quot; What services is he talking about? Roads? Electricity? Bridges? Weren&#39;t those covered in his previous remark about infrastructure? He must be referring to different services, like subsidization programs, wealth redistribution programs, pet-projects for the politically-connected, and school monopoly rackets. Whatever he&#39;s referring to as &quot;essential services,&quot; if they were really essential then people would pay for them and no bailout would be needed. Krugman is, of course, referring to extremely expensive programs which, in a liberty-oriented, market-based society, would probably not exist. Whether or not one supports these programs, they are the kinds of non-profitable endeavors which sap wealth out of society. I wonder why Krugman then seeks to spend money on them in a time of &quot;economic crisis.&quot; The reason is that Krugman, and most other incompetents in Washington, believe that a group of people can consume their way out of a recession. Perhaps I&#39;m not smart enough to understand how a nation can spend it&#39;s way out of debt. &lt;span style=&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;But, Krugman won a Nobel prize! &lt;/span&gt;Well, so did Milton Friedman a long time ago. One of them is wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Krugman&#39;s next paragraph has little substance, except for this great recommendation, &quot;any time you hear someone reciting one of these arguments, write him or her off as a dishonest flack.&quot; Does that sound like an intellectually honest, truth-seeking, scientific economist? This sounds similar to what the religious do... whenever someone disagrees with them, they write them off to hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving along, Krugman has one legitimate point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;&quot;First, there’s the bogus talking point that the Obama plan will cost $27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;5,000 per job created. Why is it bogus? Because it involves taking the cost of a plan that will extend over several years, creating millions of jobs each year, and dividing it by the jobs created in just one of those years.&lt;br /&gt;It’s as if an opponent of the school lunch program were to take an estimate of the cost of that program over the next five years, then divide it by the number of lunches provided in just one of those years, and assert that the program was hugely wasteful, because it cost $13 per lunch. (The actual cost of a free school lunch, by the way, is $2.57.)&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:100%;&quot;&gt;Well done, Krugman, you can do math better than the Republican spin-doctor who crafted that misinterpreted statistic. Now you&#39;ve convinced me that spending $800 billion of other people&#39;s money on roads, healthcare, and schools which your beloved monopoly has crippled beyond repair is legitimate and proper. And nice manipulation of children and their lunch money to pretend that you&#39;re actually helping people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#39;s get to the REAL absurdities of the article:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;&quot;The true cost per job of the Obama plan will probably be closer to $100,000 than $275,000 — and the net cost will be as little as $60,000 once you take into account the fact that a stronger economy means higher tax receipts.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:100%;&quot;&gt;Why is this absurd? Because Krugman is saying that a $100,000 price tag is actually only $60,000 because the government expects to be able to steal most of that money back again by re-taxing it. Of course, the real cost of the $100,000 is borne by the taxpayer, and when the mystical $40,000 is recuperated, not a penny will be going back into their hands. So, yes Krugman, the real price tag IS $100,000 and even if the price were just $10,000, I&#39;d rather keep my money and hire an employee at my own company. What Krugman, and so many others, just don&#39;t get is that what the government gives, it must first take away. Maybe Obama can create thousands of jobs, but the wealth paying for those jobs was removed from somewhere else and the jobs that would&#39;ve been created naturally will never exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we go again:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;&quot;Next, write off anyone who asserts that it’s always better to cut taxes than to increase government spending because taxpayers, not bureaucrats, are the best judges of how to spend their money.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:100%;&quot;&gt;Write me off, Krugman! I understand that putting my money into ANY sort of savings account will bring me better yields than sacrificing it to the jaws of &quot;Social Security.&quot; The fact that Krugman openly states that bureaucrats spend peoples&#39; money better than themselves is appalling, but completely telling of why American is in such a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wait... it gets better:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;&quot;Here’s how to think about this argument: it implies that we should shut down the air traffic control system. After all, that system is paid for with fees on air tickets — and surely it would be better to let the flying public keep its money rather than hand it over to government bureaucrats. If that would mean lots of midair collisions, hey, stuff happens.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:100%;&quot;&gt;Okay, this is the portion of Krugman&#39;s article that compelled me to write this essay. What Krugman is saying is that, if the government wasn&#39;t here to set up airport watchtowers, all the airplanes would crash into each other and we&#39;d all die. Planes would just run into each other because government wouldn&#39;t be here to tell them not to!! How unbelievable is this guy!?!? Did he not consider the more likely scenario in which privately run airports would &lt;span style=&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;organize their own watchtowers&lt;/span&gt;??? Are private individuals so incompetant as to spend a billion dollars on an airport, billions on airplanes, billions on logistics, and then not build a watchtower and traffic control system to ensure those billions don&#39;t collide in midair? This guy is a Nobel Prize winner!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to read the remainder of Krugman&#39;s article, it attempts to counter a couple more paltry arguments against Obama&#39;s massive spending. This may be the best Krugman can muster to defend the government, and to be honest I think it falls short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/feeds/880320516830953027/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=513710724906503704&amp;postID=880320516830953027&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/880320516830953027'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/880320516830953027'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/2009/01/paul-krugman-is-smarter-than-you.html' title='Paul Krugman is Smarter than You'/><author><name>Erik Voorhees</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01780045950459697961</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='28' height='32' src='http://bp2.blogger.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/R5sK0XtoHvI/AAAAAAAAAA8/NMS9qZv6DOA/S220/self-photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-513710724906503704.post-457941714362688275</id><published>2008-11-24T21:25:00.004+04:00</published><updated>2008-11-24T22:51:02.589+04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Ethics"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Obesity"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Political Theory"/><title type='text'>Rob from the rich and give to the fat</title><content type='html'>Everywhere one looks, one can see the socialists engaging in the redistribution of property.  It is not a new phenomenon, and it grows more extensive with every incoming freshman class.  However, I was sent an article that makes me look once again at the absurd course the world is taking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSTRE4AJ8G020081120?feedType=nl&amp;amp;feedName=usmorningdigest&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSTRE4AJ8G020081120?feedType=nl&amp;amp;feedName=usmorningdigest&quot;&gt;Article Link Here - Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;;font-family:&amp;quot;;font-size:11;&quot;  &gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;This article describes how The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that &quot;obese individuals have the right to two airline tickets for the price of one on domestic flights.&quot;  Pause for a moment and re-read that statement if you must. This is not some peculiar, local district court ruling or some scribbled platform of a fringe advocacy group... this is a ruling from Canada&#39;s Supreme Court.  It is now ILLEGAL for an airline company to charge the price of two seats when those two seats happen to be filled by one individual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The thought of someone being so fat that they required two seats to fly is almost as disgusting as forcing the person in the third seat to ponder the fact that he is actually subsidizing the presence of the huge monstrosity next to him.  Not only is the person in the third seat unable to go to the restroom when he pleases, due to the blockade, but he is also unable to spend $X on something else he desired, because a tiny portion of his ticket price will reflect the loss the airline must endure in light of the Supreme Court&#39;s decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt; Because, you see, by giving a fat person two seats for the price of one, that&#39;s the same as selling two tickets at half price.  Halving the revenue of two seats will actually cost the airline more than it makes, because less than half of one full ticket price constitutes profit (few industries in the world can claim a 50% profit rate).  The airline will thus be selling the fat man his tickets at a loss... which is the same as the airline &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;paying&lt;/span&gt; to fly the fat man to his desired destination.  An airline is just a group of people, so really this means that a group of people is being forced to fly the fat man to his destination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Further, because the fat man can choose to fly whenever he so chooses, and because the group of shareholders must pay for his flight (either through direct loss, or opportunity costs, or slowed business due to budget restraints, etc), Canada&#39;s Supreme Court has essentially given the fat man the right to steal property from the shareholders. And the Supreme Court states it as a right! The Court proclaims the fat man has a &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt; to the half-priced seats... so he thus has a &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;right, &lt;/span&gt;a god-given &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;, to usurp wealth from those he desires service from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt; Let there be no delusions that what is going on is in any way a just, moral, voluntary transaction.  The price at which the airline is willing to sell the seat is not the price being paid, yet they are still forced to make the sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;There is no fundamental difference between this scenario and one in which a man offers to sell an apple at a certain price, only to be forced to sell it at half that price.  Can it honestly be claimed that a man owns an item of property if he has not the authority to set the price at which he is content to part with it? Can it honestly be claimed that  shareholders really own an airline if their ability to set the price of its seats is not honored?  What defines property if not the ability to utilize or sell as desired? Why, exactly, would one buy something he did not have the right to sell?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;If private property is no longer honored, let society stand up and truthfully pronounce it. If the age of ownership is over, let the history books record this transition with integrity. If it is truely moral and just to take, by force, from those who have in order to give to those who have not, purely for the sake of ensuring the two groups are drawn ever closer together, then why all this meandering about? Why all this scribbling outside of the lines? Why all this pretending that property rights still have a place in society?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt; This is an issue of ownership over one&#39;s property. Do we, as a society, respect private property? It doesn&#39;t seem to be the case. It should not matter whether legislating the rights of an individual or a group of individuals, the pillar of private property is essential to any society that can be considered just and good by order of being &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;voluntary&lt;/span&gt;. A society that abandons property must fall ever into the darkness of force and violence, and any Court that advocates violence in order to alleviate the lives of fat people is no Court to be respected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;There is nothing new about socialists or &quot;egalitarians&quot; trying to bolster the situations of the underprivileged.  It is noble to care about the downtrodden, and real charity is always to be commended.  However, the problem with socialists is that they do not provide charity, rather they &quot;help&quot; the downtrodden by downtrodding upon others.  They give to one person by taking away from another.  They steal, or &quot;redistribute,&quot; property from Group A to Group B, thereby patching up the wounds of one by inflicting wounds on the other.  Why this is not real charity is a question for another essay. Needless to say, socialists accomplish their moral goals with immoral acts and this is made frighteningly stark in Canada&#39;s ruling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;;font-family:&amp;quot;;font-size:11;&quot;  &gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;;font-family:&amp;quot;;font-size:11;&quot;  &gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/feeds/457941714362688275/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=513710724906503704&amp;postID=457941714362688275&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/457941714362688275'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/457941714362688275'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/2008/11/rob-from-rich-and-give-to-fat.html' title='Rob from the rich and give to the fat'/><author><name>Erik Voorhees</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01780045950459697961</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='28' height='32' src='http://bp2.blogger.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/R5sK0XtoHvI/AAAAAAAAAA8/NMS9qZv6DOA/S220/self-photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-513710724906503704.post-278327555712424795</id><published>2008-10-27T22:09:00.006+04:00</published><updated>2008-10-27T22:58:00.677+04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2008 Financial Crisis"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Ethics"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Political Theory"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Richard Fuld"/><title type='text'>Richard Fuld and the Crooks</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/SQYK1qawhBI/AAAAAAAAAPk/l_Nii4RslcE/s1600-h/fuld.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/SQYK1qawhBI/AAAAAAAAAPk/l_Nii4RslcE/s320/fuld.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5261905131664868370&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:130%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;On Oct. 7&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;th&lt;/span&gt; 2008&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, amidst falling financial markets and looming global recession, I found this photo. After looking at the photo for several minutes, I’ve gotten angry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who aren’t sure what this is a photo of… it is the CEO of Lehman Brothers, Richard Fuld, as he exists a congressional hearing that took place on Monday Oct. 6, 2008. I watched much of this hearing from my living room in Dubai as it was broadcast live on CNBC.  He was called before the congressional hearing because congress will be investigating the months leading up to the collapse of Lehman Brothers (the company filed for bankruptcy last week).  As is apparent in the photo, Mr. Fuld is being heckled by some angry and passionate individuals.  The one pink paper slip in the background sums up the sentiment perfectly… CROOK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what am I upset about?  Here it goes…. Richard Fuld, a man who has spent his entire life working for Lehman Brothers, a man who has worked his way up through the ranks of the company over decades, a man who, presiding as CEO, led the company through the greatest growth it had ever experienced, a man who had more invested in Lehman Brothers, both financially and emotionally, than perhaps any other individual, is now being racked against the boards.  He is being punished, ridiculed, berated, embarrassed, tarred, feathered, and chastised for what has occurred, not just to Lehman Brothers, but to numerous financial institutions and markets around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Fuld is a man who, until now, had been utterly successful, utterly deliberate, and utterly passionate about his business.  He is what some consider a Great Man, a mover and shaker, a player in the game of industry.  He was someone who, simply put, is a man better than many others, because he accomplished more than many others. He achieved more than many others.  He pulled the world forward as only real leaders are able.  He made his fortune, not by theft or deceit, not by violence or coercion, but by organizing and leading others through the noise of the modern world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However great he was, however, his success came to an end.  Whether it was his choices that led Lehman over a cliff or actions of others he could neither control nor was not aware of, the company collapsed and he, as CEO, can rightly be blamed (at least in part) for its demise.    However, the anger and ridicule Richard Fuld is facing has little to do with his strategic decisions, with his leadership skills, or with his incorrect assessment of the inherent risk in credit derivatives and default swaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The members of the panel in the congressional hearing were not condemning Fuld’s management (of course, the market does this without “help” from the Government). Rather, they were condemning him for being wealthy while others are poor.  They were condemning him for having much while others have little. The man was being torn apart from one side by covetous vultures and from the other side, a gang of thieves. These people, who do not even understand the financial industry enough to legitimately criticize Mr. Fuld, ripped him limb from limb in front of the entire world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Fuld is being lambasted because he has money, because he stands taller than those sniveling commoners who, unable to generate their own wealth, spend their lives writhing in the mud of jealousy, leeching off the producers of the world.  He is being torn apart because politicians, not satisfied with the billions of dollars in taxes they have wrested from the involuntary pockets of Lehman Brothers, its employees, its stockholders, and Mr. Fuld himself, are now, in the form of an inquisition, demanding that he explain to America why he still has millions of dollars while 20,000 employees have lost their jobs (the same jobs which upper management produced, of course), as if he has stolen something from both society and his own employees.  How is it, I wonder, that Mr. Fuld is justly derided for the salary that was voluntarily given to him by the owners of the company, the owners of that salary before it was transferred to him, yet the Government – which seized through force of imprisonment – billions in taxes from the company, takes no blame for the collapse? How can this be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;However much money Richard Fuld brought home as legitimate compensation for his work, exponentially more was illegitimately wrested from Lehman Brothers by the Government.&lt;/span&gt; For every dollar that Fuld took home, the Government took a hundred. And while Fuld earned and worked for his dollar, the Government simply claimed a hundred as their own, expecting payment else threatening imprisonment. Yet, it was Fuld that was the criminal?!? How dare the politicians sit around in their counterfeit thrones and condemn the man who led one of the very organizations which paid for the gavel being slammed down upon him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Government cloaks its own purveying of misery and economic suffocation behind the fines and condemnation it slaps on others.  It steals the earned money of men and then howls at them for earning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tearing apart of a great individual, not for valid reasons of managerial disagreement, but for jealousy and deception, is why this photo makes me angry.  As Richard Fuld leaves the stone pillars of the courthouse, no doubt manufactured and engineered by the genius of private industry and paid for with the stolen profits of business leaders before him, it appalls me to see Fuld being labeled the crook while he’s dragged down the steps of an organization that funds itself at the point of a gun… while the rest of America watches and spits on him- not even close to realizing who the real villains are.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/feeds/278327555712424795/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=513710724906503704&amp;postID=278327555712424795&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/278327555712424795'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/278327555712424795'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/2008/10/richard-fuld-and-crooks.html' title='Richard Fuld and the Crooks'/><author><name>Erik Voorhees</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01780045950459697961</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='28' height='32' src='http://bp2.blogger.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/R5sK0XtoHvI/AAAAAAAAAA8/NMS9qZv6DOA/S220/self-photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/SQYK1qawhBI/AAAAAAAAAPk/l_Nii4RslcE/s72-c/fuld.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-513710724906503704.post-2972897318102988930</id><published>2008-09-18T19:49:00.002+04:00</published><updated>2008-09-18T19:57:21.706+04:00</updated><title type='text'>Hadron Collider</title><content type='html'>http://edition.cnn.com/2008/TECH/09/10/lhc.collider/index.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;meta equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;

If they think more money should be given to the poor, they are well within their rights to go make some money and donate it!  Trading in their VW and Birkenstocks would be a good way to get some seed capital…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comment example one: “Huge waste of time and money. The big bang has never been proven, it is a theory ONLY. How can you have nothing and then it blows up. Get a life.” – Charlie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comment example two: “This much of money can be diverted to uplift backward African nations who are dying of hunger and famine. Moreover the scientists should have read THE HOLY BIBLE to know how excatly the creation started and what exactly the matter is.” – Prem Kanchi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ugh!  This is why I increasingly despise democracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, on the issue of funding, to the extent that this was funded by Governments is the extent to which I don’t think it should’ve been funded.  But damn is it cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://edition.cnn.com/2008/TECH/09/10/lhc.collider/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/feeds/2972897318102988930/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=513710724906503704&amp;postID=2972897318102988930&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/2972897318102988930'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/513710724906503704/posts/default/2972897318102988930'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://evoorhees.blogspot.com/2008/09/hadron-collider.html' title='Hadron Collider'/><author><name>Erik Voorhees</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01780045950459697961</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='28' height='32' src='http://bp2.blogger.com/_TsYRUtwyVtA/R5sK0XtoHvI/AAAAAAAAAA8/NMS9qZv6DOA/S220/self-photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry></feed>
