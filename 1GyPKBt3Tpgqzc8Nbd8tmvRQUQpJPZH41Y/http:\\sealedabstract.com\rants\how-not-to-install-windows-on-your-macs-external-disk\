onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Torito_(CD-ROM_standard)');"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Torito_(CD-ROM_standard)">El Torito standard</a> was born, which allowed computers to be bootable with CDs by emulating floppy disks and without changing existing software, and keeping the existing 2-bootloader toolchain.  And Phoenix Technologies saw it, and it was good.  And it was evening, and it was morning: the fourth day.</p><p>And soon, the venerable floppy disk passed away.  Nonetheless, every conceivable boot option, to maintain compatibility, basically emulated floppies.  Intel introduced PxE (known to PC builders as the world&#8217;s most useless boot option) which contained a full TCP/IP stack the sole purpose of which was to download 1.44MB floppy disk images over a network.  El Torito was updated to support the El Torito boot process over USB-based CD/DVD drives; USB hard disks and flash drives were variously configured either to emulate El Torito emulating floppy disks, or to emulate floppy disks themselves.  And <strong>at the core of all of these boot options</strong>, to the present day, are a severely size-restricted boot sector that is constrained to only access 32-64Kb of memory and only use instructions available on the original 8086 processor.  Not kidding.</p><p>And lo, Apple wanted to build an Intel computer.  And it looked at the landscape of everybody emulating 1980s computers and determined that this was complete chaos.  Apple wanted to obsolete, not just the floppy drive, but also the optical drive; not just the optical drive but also the spinning hard disk; not just the hard disk but the entire computer form factor.  (And they also had competing replacements for things like PxE that they did not want to port to the 8086.) So they collaborated with Intel to create a new standard, called EFI, which we will discuss in some detail later in the article.  But for now, know this: it was very, very incompatible with the way everybody else did things.  Thus for Windows support, they shipped a very small BIOS.</p><p>But this BIOS was not the BIOS of 2001 with twelve kinds of USB support for emulating floppies.  Rather, it was the minimum viable BIOS.  So minimal, that the single error message that it can print&#8211;&#8221;no boot disk available &#8211; insert a boot disk and press any key to continue&#8221; &#8211; neither looks for boot disks nor does anything at all, not even print the message again, when you press any key.  It literally hangs there.  Apple&#8217;s position seems to be &#8220;if people want a reasonable boot environment, maybe they shouldn&#8217;t be emulating floppy disks&#8221;.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Apple&#8217;s representatives could not confirm the authenticity of this statement at press time</p></div><p>And Apple shipped the BIOS, and it ran Windows on internal hard disks, and the customers saw it was good.  And it was evening, and it was morning, the fifth day. And thus there is no way to convince your Mac&#8217;s BIOS emulation layer &#8212; other than by writing your own BIOS emulation firmware &#8212; to touch a USB drive.  It won&#8217;t happen.</p><h2>What if my USB disk is &#8220;internal&#8221;</h2><p>You may say, &#8220;okay.  Boot Camp only works with internal disks.  But what exactly would happen if you install OSX onto an external disk, boot into it, and use Boot Camp on the &#8216;internal&#8217; (booting) disk?&#8221; Checkmate, Apple.</p><p>Well, I&#8217;ll tell you what will happen.  You&#8217;ll launch Boot Camp Assistant, press Continue, and&#8230; nothing will happen.  The console will helpfully log that &#8220;index 0 is beyond the bounds for empty array.&#8221;  Checkmate, Windows user.</p><p>And as we&#8217;ve talked about, it&#8217;s really the firmware on your computer that is the culprit in this story.  The BIOS emulation hiding in your firmware could care less what disk the Boot Camp Assistant is running on.  The BIOS plain won&#8217;t poke a USB disk period.</p><h2>What if we wrote our own special bootloader to boot from USB devices?</h2><p>There is such a bootloader and it&#8217;s called <a

/> - You may have too much time on your hands.<br
/> - I assume you actually need to boot Windows on the hardware or you would just install it as a VM (with Parallels) then move the VM file over to your external drive.<br
/> - As someone who was around on &#8220;the first day&#8221; I really enjoyed your recap of the history. I also read and enjoyed and found useful several of your other articles.<br

class="date">Sat 04th Jan 2014 at 5:12 pm</span><p>Drew, your well-written and highly informative piece was a walk down memory lane for me. In the good old days you just set your front panel switches on your PDP8, loaded your paper tape and away you went. Ah well, times have changed, as have we all.</p><p>FWIW I&#8217;ve had some success booting a Mac Pro 4.1 (early 2009, OSX 10.8.4) into W7 SP1 Ult on an external RAID0 array (2xM4 64GB SSD&#8217;s) connected to a Marvell 88SE9230-based PCIe X2 4-port SATAIII controller card,  Syba&#8217;s SI-PEX40057 (cheap-cheap).</p><p>The array was created with Marvell&#8217;s MSU app in Win7 booted from an internal bootcamp drive, with the SATA card in slot 4. After a reboot to OSX, Disk Utility was used to partition the RAID0 drive as GUID/HSFJ. iPartition was then used to shrink that partition to a minimum size (214.6 MB for me, YMMV) and partition the rest for MS Data w/NTFS format, &#8220;Visible to Windows&#8221; and &#8220;Active&#8221;. Finally a previously-saved W7 SP1 Ult winclone image made from the internal boot camp partition was restored to the MS partition on the external RAID0 disk. Reboot, wait for the chkdsk in Win7 (invisible, just a loooong blank screen, then restart) and voila, bootcamp on an external disk &#8211; a RAID0 array, even.</p><p>But not all is well. I have a problem, a problem of greed and stupidity. I have a second Syba card, an SI-PEX40058. Same Marvell chip but 2 SATA + 2 eSATA ports. And I have another RAID0 array I want to use.</p><p>Obviously I&#8217;m criminally oblivious to the risk of RAID0 configurations on consumer SSD&#8217;s, but I confess, I may have experimented with &#8220;drugs&#8221; at MIT back in the 70&#8242;s, so that&#8217;s the least of my flaws.</p><p>Anyway, if I have both cards installed (no matter which slots I pick) the W7 boot process reaches a blank screen and stays there, forever, or at least as long (45 minutes) as I&#8217;ve tried waiting.</p><p>It wasn&#8217;t always like this. Once I had everything working, if you call a 5+ minute boot delay (blank screen for 2 1/2 min, brief card bios displays, blinking cursor screen for another 2 1/2 min, a weird green Microsoft loading bar and finally login) &#8220;working.&#8221;</p><p>But, silly me, after numerous efforts (too many to list here) to mitigate this galling delay, I finally took the drastic step of updating the BIOS and firmware on the cards, from a binary image found on &#8220;station-drivers.com&#8221;, a French website, as Syba and Marvell offer nada. And now darkness lies over the land.</p><p>Syba, sadly, disavows any knowledge of firmware flashing and cannot provide an image of the original firmware &#8211; if that is indeed at the root of my current problem. Because it could be any one of so many other things.</p><p>There&#8217;s the slot the cards are plugged into: same as before but still a question because only Slot 4 for boot and Slot 2 for the other array worked then. Or the ports that the array&#8217;s drives are plugged into: also restored as before but always confusing, as the port numbers don&#8217;t match the physical location of the sockets. There&#8217;s the partition map on the boot drive array: the firmware flash necessitated recreating the array and the partitioning process described above. And the winclone image, taken from the same drive array when working but shrunk to fit on the infinitesmally smaller partition created after flashing.</p><p>Oh, I could go on but the miracle of factorial growth in the number of possible combinations (compound interest, cry your heart out) makes this all quite academic. I&#8217;m stuck at a blank screen.</p><p>Gee though, it was fun while it lasted, if you don&#8217;t count that 5+ minute boot delay. And I can still run my Mac Pro in W7 SP1 Ult on an external RAID0 array. But I&#8217;m greedy and want another, and I&#8217;m too stupid to get it back.</p><p>Now let me be clear about one thing: I understand that those faults of greed and stupidity are my own. They are not the fault of Syba, or Marvell, or the cards&#8217; BIOS and firmware, or of OSX. They&#8217;re not even Windows&#8217; fault, and think how rare that is.</p><p>For that tiny tithe of understanding I am grateful. And if you, Drew, or any other readers can help further, I&#8217;d be ever so much more so.</p> <span
