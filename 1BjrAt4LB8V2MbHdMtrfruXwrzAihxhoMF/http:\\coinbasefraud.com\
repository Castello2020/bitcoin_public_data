"Now, they held my "locked-in price" in my Transactions screen, showing the purchased time and expected "landing" time. After almost a week, and a BIG price change, they short me 4.42630006 BTC.

<b>Another ripoff report from TheKLB at</b> <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=344604.20" target=_blank>Bitcointalk.org</a><p>
"I too was ripped off by coinbase. Bought 10BTC last Friday at $424 each (instant buy). Was sitting on them til while the price was soaring. Come Wednesday, they cancel my transaction. I would have sold while it was hovering at $850. $4,000 profit gone. Just like that. I contacted support multiple times with no response. Also tried from a different email address and they didn't respond. Now any time I try to purchase they cancel the order. Stating it is a high risk transaction. I have made eight purchases from them since January. Now the last 2 canceled and its like I'm on some blacklist."<p>

I am a relative newcomer to the world of cryptocurrency and wanted to get started as soon as possible. <P>
On Friday, November 15 I created an account at Coinbase.com and followed all their verification procedures. &nbsp I scanned and uploaded my driver's license and a utility bill and gave them my bank account information.<p>
Bank account verification was completed on Monday, November 18. &nbsp I immediately put in an order for $288.57 to purchase .5 BTC (BitCoin).<p>
At this point I was told they had exceeded their buy order for that day, and that I would have to wait all week, until Friday morning, to get what I was paying for. &nbsp I also wouldn't get the current exchange rate, but whatever it happened to be on Friday.  &nbsp Some deal, right?<p>
I waited and waited. &nbsp 1 BTC was worth around $575 on Monday - it would keep going higher all week.<P>
Finally Friday morning arrived - I received an email (image below) telling me that my order was canceled due to it being a "high risk" transaction.<p>

A "high risk" transaction - of less than $300 - where they verified my identity and my bank account, <b>and took the money out of my bank account to sit on it for days!</b><P>
These con artists are just playing games with other people's money. &nbsp If the price of BTC goes down, you'll get your BTC. &nbsp <B>If the price goes up they'll cancel your transaction, blame in on their "robot," and say to try again in a few weeks.</b>  &nbsp <p>Really - think of how absurd that is! &nbsp They'll label it a "high risk" transaction but then in the same email ask you to try again without any additional verification - so they have another chance to steal your potential profit.<p>

 "5 days ago I bought 2 btc @ 320 each. Today the btc suppose to be clear in my coinbase account @ 615 each, When suddenly i receive a coinbase email stating that the transaction is suspicious and my money has been reversed.<p>

I had almost $100k back and forward with coinbase for the past year and never had any problems at all but today they shut my transactions because of this bitcoin raise.<p>
Not a good strategy for coinbase.  <p>
