									Our tips regarding arrangement of the meeting with your Russian lady.
								</h2>
                                                                       <br/>
									<p>
										First of all, we would highly recommend you to go and meet Russian woman in her own country. If you send her money to come and visit you then there is high risk that you will be used by scammers who will take money and disappear. No matter how beautiful or appealing Russian woman is – do not send money! If for some reasons you cannot travel you can help her not sending money directly to her, for example, buying tickets for her, paying for hotel, or compensating her half of her expenses when she comes to you and you see her in real, but do not send money for the people whom you know from internet. Never! Make it your principle and follow it!
									</p>
                                                                        <br/>
									<p>
										Second advice – go and stay in hotel (or an apartment). If it is just a first meeting with a woman then we would not advise you to stay in her apartment. Maybe you will not like her or she will not like you, and your staying in her apartment just will make things worse. If you stay in the hotel you will be more independent in your decisions. 
									</p>
                                                                        <br/>
									<p>Regarding your passport we can give  you the same advice as we give to women – everything can happen, you can lose  your passport for example somewhere, so better do some copies of your passport  and keep  it apart from your passport. </p>
<br/>
<p>
							Of course, you should bring some souvenir for your woman, it should not be necessarily something expensive and with diamonds. Let it be something simple from your country, but it should be carefully chosen with attention to her interests and  it will show your care about her, that you not just went to have a good time with her or without her, but that you planned to meet exactly her,  thought also about her and her interests before going. If she has children then you should bring something for her children also (toys, sweets, books, etc)

								<h2>Virtual relationships can be successfully turned into real relationships if you are interested in it and really want that</h2>
								<p>We know a lot of successful stories  of relationships that were born in Internet and were successfully turned into  real ones. What matters in such relationships is a wish to be together and wish  of 2 people to fight any problems, especially problem of distance. Besides as  usually in such relationships the Russian woman is the one who moves to the man  he should show more care about these relationships and appear to be really  strong, show that he is able to fight with problems and take responsibility to develop relationships further.</p>

								<p>Many men seeing  so many beautiful women at one site start to suspect that it might be  fraud because such beauties could easily find a partner  in their own country. Unfortunately it is not true. Beauty does not guarantee your personal happiness. And also it can be quite  difficult for the women to find a normal man in Russia because Russian men like  to drink a lot and quite many of them do not percept women as Women, but just  as housewives who should just do work about the house and leave their hopes for  love and respect. That’s why many women decide to come and search for Western  men who know how to respect women and how to treat a woman for her to feel  loved and special.</p>

								<h2>A few of contacts can be a serious mistake in Internet dating</h2>
								<p>A few of contacts can become a  serious mistake in the process of meeting Your woman. You can invest all your  time in one person from the beginning and write to her only because on her  photos she looks like your ideal woman and you might think that it is the only  possible variant of finding your Woman. Yes, you can have luck and she will  appear the person that you have been searching for such a long time, but she  can also lose interest in you and find some other person, or you meet with this  person in real and you understand that he is not the person that you would like  to have relationships with. That’s why in the initial stages of correspondence  communicate with many women, write to them about everything – about your life,  interests, goals, and so on, and only after some months of correspondence you  can see if you get along with some woman and communicate with her only.</p>

							<h2>Using of fake photos by men (photos of models, actors)</h2>
							<img src="/static/a/500010973/a10033279_7.jpg" alt="" />
							<p>Some men place on the site photos of  some actors, celebrities, sportsmen, etc. instead of their own real photos.  Probably they think that they look somewhat alike these celebrities. Or maybe  they are not sure about their own appearance and try to hide behind fake  photos. Anyway, you should know that Russian women do not appreciate such fake  photos (even if they belong to the best looking celebrities in the world).  Women are real and they came on the site to meet with real men. When they see  fake photos they start to think that man who uses them has some psychological  complexes or has what to hide, and they will just not answer. Think why you  have come to this site.  If you came on  the site to find real normal relationships, then please place on the site your  real photos – it will be honest at least regarding the Russian women who have  real photos. </p>
