XAT-005 PHEORA
An AT developed by Yui Laryandor, Pheora is an example of why you shouldn't make her angry. It was built in a single night after Reese Ryship made the mistake of commenting that she was "The Chick", and served as Yui's personal unit for the remainder of the conflict. In almost all respects, it is far superior to the Kerykeion Mark III, but being customized specially for Yui's use its systems are too complex for almost anyone else to pilot, and as a result it was never mass-produced.
