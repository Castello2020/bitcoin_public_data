				<p>This week is Coin Congress, a special gathering of bitcoiners in San Francisco slated to discuss digital currency, monetization, integration, and user acquisition.  Featured speakers include Bobby Lee of BTCChina, Vinny Linghmam of Gyft and George Gilder, author of Microcosm and Telecosm (plus 15 other books on technology).</p>
<p>The Chamber of Digital Commerce will be holding a press conference this morning to issue an official response to New York’s BitLicense proposed regulations.</p>
<p>Last weekend was The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC) in Chicago where a number of other industry initiatives were announced.</p>
<p>Here is a not-so-boring week in review:</p>
<p><strong>Government Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/07/18/new-bitcoin-lobbying-trade-association-announced/">Bitcoin Gets Its First Trade Association</a></strong></p>
<p>This week I announced the formation of the <a href="http://www.digitalchamber.org">Chamber of Digital Commerce</a>, the industry’s first trade association.  Operating from Washington, DC, we will promote the industry’s goals, and its potential to innovate global finance for the benefit of society, to lawmakers, regulators, policy makers and the larger public.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/press2014/pr1407171.html">New York BitLicense Proposal Revealed</a></strong></p>
<p>Last week the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) published the first draft of the BitLicense proposed rules and regulations. Under the proposed BitLicense framework, any Bitcoin company wishing to do business with New York residents would require a BitLicense. The draft is set to be officially published on July 23 and will follow a 45 day comment period, hardly adequate time to for the industry to properly review and respond.</p>
<p>The industry needs guardrails to protect consumers and root out illegal activity, but these proposed regulations are onerous and in many cases simply misplaced, with the potential to seriously injure legitimate applications of this valuable emerging area. Instructions on how to submit comments can be found on the NYDFS website at http://www.dos.ny.gov/info/register.htm.</p>
<p><strong>Industry Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chinese Exchanges Battle It Out Over Features and Services</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.coindesk.com/chinese-exchange-okcoin-launch-usd-deposits-withdrawals/">China’s OKCoin announced</a> at TNABC that they will begin trades denominated in USD. OKCoin.com also released information about its new Financial Information Exchange protocol (FIX) and their websocket API. OKCoin is striving to become the top bitcoin trading platform with safer, more accurate and faster features such as “low-latency trading and market data.”</p>
<p>Just one day later <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2baq2u/press_release_btc_china_officially_launches_usd/">BTCChina issued a competing announcement</a> the very next day stating they have already “collected several million USD worth of deposits” in its trial period and will also start accepting Hong Kong Dollars. International account holders will have the option of depositing USD or HKD and will be processed by BTCChina’s HK affiliate.</p>
<p>This weekend’s Chinese exchange battle highlights the fact that we are in the early days of a feature and services war where exchanges are constantly trying to one-up each other.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.blockchain.com/2014/07/21/blockchain-releases-new-bitcoin-wallet/"><strong>Blockchain Launches New Wallet</strong></a></p>
<p>Blockchain launched a new Android wallet at TNABC this weekend, which is full of eye candy, designed for the next wave of bitcoin adopters, with an easy to use, clean interface. The new Android wallet features a directory of businesses that accept bitcoin. Blockchain’s Keonne Rodriguez played a large part in the development of the app and said they personally called the merchants to make sure they accepted bitcoin.</p>
<p>The next step for Blockchain is the development of an iOS wallet. Since Apple updated their app developers guidelines to allow for bitcoin wallets, developers are shifting resources back to iOS.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2454294/google-adds-bitcoin-exchange-rates-to-instant-search-answers.html">Google Adds Bitcoin Exchange Rate to Instant Search Answers</a></strong></p>
<p>Last Tuesday, the largest search engine in the world added the Bitcoin exchange rate to their list of instant search answers. Google uses Coinbase’s historical USD/BTC exchange rate, then calculates other exchange rates with existing fiat data.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.coinbase.com/post/92154013552/dell-com-partners-with-coinbase-to-become-the-largest">Dell Becomes Largest Ecommerce Business to Accept Bitcoin</a></strong></p>
<p>Dell and Coinbase announced a partnership this week, ushering a new giant into the Bitcoin ecosystem. With almost $60 billion in annual revenue, Dell is now the largest business accepting Bitcoin. Dell is currently offering a 10 percent discount when paid in Bitcoin on select Alienware products. At the moment, Dell is only accepting Bitcoin payments for US customers. According to Michael Dell, Dell’s founder, the partnership was forged within 2 weeks, highlighting the institutional ease of implementing Bitcoin.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.shopify.com/blog/14840585-shopify-merchants-can-now-accept-bitcoin-payments-with-coinbase">Shopify Allows Merchants to Choose Between BitPay and Coinbase</a></strong></p>
<p>Since November of 2013, Shopify has provided merchants with the ability to accept bitcoin through BitPay payment processing services, and thousands of merchants have signed up to do so. On July 15<sup>th</sup> Shopify announced their integration with Coinbase, which will allow Shopify merchants ‘more ways to accept Bitcoin payments online’. Shopify who have signed on to Coinbase payments includeincluding Soylent, Leap Motion, and IOgrapher. Shopify has a total of over 75,000 merchants.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000292418&amp;play=1">LinkedIn Co-founder, Reid Hoffman, is Focused on Bitcoin</a></strong></p>
<p>In a recent interview with CNBC’s ‘Squawk Alley,’ long time tech entrepreneur, Reid Hoffman, shared his thoughts on Bitcoin. Instead of suggesting viewers jump onto the latest wearable technology or home automation craze, Hoffman admitted that he has <em>“increasingly focused on Bitcoin.”</em> Hoffman has invested in Xapo, a Bitcoin wallet, and currently sits on their board of directors. He emphasized that Bitcoin’s true innovation will be its platform, its <em>“most interesting layer.”</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.payfast.co.za/blog/2014/07/17/accept-bitcoin-payments-payfast/">South African Payment Gateway, PayFast, Accepts Bitcoin</a></strong></p>
<p>South Africa’s PayFast announced a partnership with South Africa’s biggest Bitcoin exchange, BitX. With PayFast, South African merchants can accept Bitcoin payments and receive South African rands in their account. The service is currently in beta testing mode, but PayFast makes sure to emphasize Bitcoin’s ease of use to its existing merchants.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/16/popular-bitcoin-mining-pool-promises-to-restrict-its-compute-power-to-prevent-feared-51-fiasco/">Bitcoin Mining Pool, Ghash.io, Promises To Stay Under 40% of the Total Bitcoin Network Hashrate</a></strong></p>
<p>Twice this year, so far, Bitcoin mining pool, Ghash.io, has approached 50% of the total Bitcoin network hashrate, representing an unnecessary threat against Bitcoin’s network security. Previously Ghash.io has refused to self-regulate to remedy the problem, but after a closed-door meeting with industry heads, they have promised to implement a 39.99% ceiling. Ghash.io has promised to post warnings, but not raise fees, if the situation occurs again.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin Charity Feeds Over 100,000 Meals To The Homeless</strong></p>
<p>Sean’s Outpost, the largest charitable Bitcoin organization, led by philanthropist Jason King, announced they have fed over 100,000 meals to the homeless community in Florida. This initiative was mostly funded in bitcoin and other digital currencies. Sean’s Outpost is dedicated to serving the homeless community and also manages Satoshi Forest, which provides a place for homeless people in Pensacola to legally stay. Increasing regulation against “loitering” has created even bigger hardships to the homeless population, putting many of them in jail for the crime of being penniless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The digital currency and digital asset communities have come together to form the industry’s first trade association, the Chamber of Digital Commerce. Opening its doors this week in the nation’s capital and officially announced at the National Bitcoin Conference in Chicago, the “Digital Chamber” is embarking on a bold mission to promote among lawmakers and the larger public the industry’s goals and its potential to innovate global finance.</p>
<p>“Digital currencies and assets, such as Bitcoin, have captured the imagination of Silicon Valley and technology innovators around the globe,” says Perianne Boring, founder and CEO of the Digital Chamber. “Digital assets will soon be as important as email, Web browsing, and e-commerce. We are here to educate policymakers and consumers about how this new technology and asset class will improve the economy and access to financial services.”</p>
<p>The digital currency industry has an estimated value of $8 billion. Experts expect this to grow to over $1 trillion within six years. The Digital Chamber will be the authoritative source for legislators, regulators, policy makers, and the public to obtain accurate information about digital assets and currencies. It will also facilitate the adoption of responsible, prudent legislation and regulation, which will help support the vitality of the industry.</p>
<p>As an authoritative voice for the industry, the Digital Chamber will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promote understanding of the value of digital currencies and assets, and the use of these innovative services and payment mechanisms. Targets will be lawmakers and their staff members, along with all federal agencies, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice, Department of Treasury and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</li>
<li>Educate the public on how digital currencies work, and their value and benefits to consumers. Contribute to the international dialog around digital currencies, including clearing up prevalent misconceptions concerning the industry and provide experts to the national media for news, analysis and data.</li>
<li>Perform polling and produce expert commentary on all aspects of digital currencies, providing real time information to the general public.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About the Chamber of Digital Commerce:  </strong>The “Digital Chamber” is the first D.C.-based non-profit, trade association dedicated to promoting the acceptance and use of digital currencies. Website: (www.digitalchamber.org)</p>
<p>For more information, email Perianne at President@digitalchamber.org.</p>

				<blockquote><p><em>This guest post is by Eddy Travia, Co-Founder of<a href="http://www.seedco.in/home/"> Seedcoin</a>, a global Bitcoin startup virtual incubator with partners in Hong Kong, Singapore and London.  Travia is currently helping develop eight seed-stage Bitcoin startups around the world. Formerly, Travia worked in private equity in China. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>A common mistake observers make when witnessing the emergence of a new technology is to underestimate society’s capacity and celerity to adapt to it. In world-changing industries such as luxury cars and mainframe computers, the main actors in these markets have severely misevaluated the demand for their products and market trends in the last century. The former initially focused on chauffeur-driven cars and the latter failed to foresee the advent of personal computing. This lack of foresight opened doors for new players and removed the incumbents until the newcomers became the behemoths. From the industrial revolution to the IT revolution, we can see that the cycle repeats itself.</p>
<p>When Bitcoin started making headlines in the mainstream media in Spring 2013, it spurred a new wave of supporters and entrepreneurs. Bitcoin evangelists had understood early on the profound changes Bitcoin has the power to bring to financial and economic systems. Since May 2013, hundreds of new crypto-currencies, blockchain-based projects and asset classes have been created, and millions of dollars of VC and investment funds have been channeled into crypto startups. This has all happened in little more than one year’s time, in a world ruled by crypto-sceptical governments, dominated by change-averse, uncooperative banks, in a year during which the largest Bitcoin exchange failed and took with it 6% of the bitcoins in circulation.</p>
<p>In a public talk about Bitcoin a few months ago, someone asked how long it would take for people (in general, not just crypto startup team members) to accept salaries in bitcoin. Answers varied from 5 years to 20 years. Although this was only a few months ago, answers would be dramatically different today, because as time goes by we re-evaluate our own vision of the future, and we and re-assess the impact new technology such as crypto-currencies will have on our lives. As an investor in Bitcoin startups and a believer in the power of crypto-currencies, I have preferred to stay away from predictions about bitcoin price or adoption figures, but there is one vision that drives my focus, time and energy: the entrepreneurial ecosystem being created by crypto-currencies. From May to September 2013 the number of <a href="http://letstalkbitcoin.com/bitcoin-professionals-double-in-four-months/">linkedin profiles including the term ‘bitcoin’ doubled</a> and in April 2014 reddit’s <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/usa-leading-bitcoin-jobs-boom/).">r/Jobs4Bitcoin</a> subreddit reached 5,000 subscribers. These metrics are testament to the incredibly fast growth of the crypto sector in the professional, and notably, the entrepreneurial worlds.</p>
<p>Most Bitcoin-centric jobs have been provided by startups, although that is gradually changing with established financial institutions and big 4 auditing firms recently posting job offers for ‘Bitcoin-savvy’ candidates. <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-venture-capital/">Most Bitcoin projects</a> are small startups, with a few receiving in excess of $10 million funding and most having raised less than $1 million.</p>
<p>At<a href="http://www.seedco.in/home/%20"> Seedcoin</a>, the global virtual Bitcoin startup incubator I co-founded in July 2013, we receive two to three applications per day from creative crypto entrepreneurs around the world. I believe this is just the tip of the iceberg. As outlined in Tim Swanson’s<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Chain-Numbers-Contracts-Management-ebook/dp/B00IRUBMXO"> Guide to Smart Contracts, Smart Property and Trustless Asset Management</a>, there are numerous applications of decentralized organizations and blockchain asset management that will disrupt entire sectors of our economy, including the public sector.</p>
<p>In addition to crypto startups’ high potential in job creation, the blockchain, this simple yet extremely powerful decentralized protocol for storing assets and data, can disrupt key components of the public sector such as the management of deeds, company incorporations or any sensitive data that should be both public and validated. Currently the government administration and professionals with a government granted authority, such as public notaries, are the trustable third parties. Tomorrow the blockchain may fill this role at a much lower cost for society and enabling easy access to sensitive data, as stated by David A. Johnston in his eponym law, <a href="http://www.johnstonslaw.org/">“<em>Everything that can be decentralized, will be decentralized.</em>&#8220;</a></p>
<p>Well-known VCs such as Marc Andreessen have compared Bitcoin to the Internet. As a modest participant and an observer during the Internet years back in the 90s, I agree with this parallel. I feel the same energy and enthusiasm, and it seems Bitcoin supporters share the feeling that we are living in world-changing times. One of the differences with the &#8217;90s is that the Crypto movement is not just about money or being first to market. The new generation of entrepreneurs have a broader social agenda. Facilitating remittances from migrant workers to their relatives and enabling the unbanked to join the global network of electronic payments and financial services via crypto-currency based services are examples of the objectives of these new startups, such as Seedcoin-backed <a href="http://www.mexbt.com">meXBT</a> in Mexico. These entrepreneurs can also rely on new methods to raise funds such as issuing shares on the blockchain using different protocols such as <a href="http://www.coinprism.com">&#8216;colored coins&#8217;</a>, or issuing tokens using the Master protocol such as <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/06/03/mastercoin-maidsafe-crowdsale/">Maidsafe&#8217;s crowdsale</a>.</p>
<p>My definition of Bitcoin is not limited to the currency/protocol features, I see Bitcoin as a disruptive technology redefining our relationship with money and triggering a wave of entrepreneurs with access to new funding opportunities. Although it is too early to grasp the extent of its impact on society, we can already feel the first shockwaves of Bitcoin.</p>

				<p>This week the Bitcoin Community is gearing up for the North American Bitcoin Conference in Chicago on July 19 and 20. This conference is slated to be the largest and one of the most influential ever held. 50 of the top CEOs / entrepreneurs in bitcoin are scheduled to attend and speak.</p>
<p>Here is a review of Bitcoin’s not-so-boring week last week.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin Government Initiatives: </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://newsbtc.com/2014/07/09/ben-lawsky-nydfs-making-good-progress-virtual-currency-regulation/"><strong>New York BitLicense Proposal Expected In 2 Weeks</strong></a></p>
<p>Benjamin Lawsky, New York State’s first Superintendent of Financial Services, announced on Twitter that New York’s Department of Financial Services is “making good progress on virtual currency regs” and should release their proposal on Bitcoin regulation within a week or two. This proposal will be the first state licensing program specifically for Bitcoin transmission and trading, and is highly anticipated, as many other states are expected to follow suit.</p>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/07/09/bitcoin-foundation-lobbying/"><strong>Bitcoin Foundation Hires Lobbying Firm</strong></a></p>
<p>The Bitcoin Foundation has retained Thorsen French Advocacy to lobby the US Congress in Washington, DC.  Jim Harper, Global Policy Counsel for the Foundation, said <em>&#8220;You can expect to see us do the same in Europe and do the same in major capitals around the world.&#8221;  </em>The Foundation has suffered serious reputational and credibility challenges in recent months, as a number of board members have been found unfit to serve and forced to step down.</p>
<p>Thorsen French Advocacy covers a wide range of clients, from ASCAP to PhRMA, to Western Union, a competitor to Bitcoin.</p>
<p>On the same day of this announcement highly respected Bitcoin evangelist, Andreas Antonopoulos tweeted that he is resigning his membership from the Foundation.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I can no longer have even the smallest association with the Bitcoin Foundation, because of the complete lack of transparency</p>
<p>— AndreasMAntonopoulos (@aantonop) <a href="https://twitter.com/aantonop/statuses/486926129409052672">July 9, 2014</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.coindesk.com/government-backed-bitcoin-industry-association-launch-japan/"><strong>Japan Forms a Self-Regulating Organization for Digital Assets</strong></a></p>
<p>The Japan Authority of Digital Asset (JADA) has recently been established and will serve as the self-regulating organization for bitcoin and digital assets in Japan.  According to <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/author/jon-southurst/">Jon Southurst</a> of CoinDesk, the Japanese government does not intend to regulate digital assets and will lean on JADA to establish security protocols and consumer protections for the industry.  JADA has been established with help from Kraken, who also played an integral role in forming the Digital Asset Transfer Authority (DATA) in the US.  DATA, although in its infancy, has not prevented the US government from regulating digital assets.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/07/11/france-plans-transparency-rules-for-bitcoin-businesses/"><strong>France Implements New Tax and Reporting Requirements For Bitcoin</strong></a></p>
<p>France’s finance ministry has announced plans to implement new regulations for bitcoin requiring financial institutions to verify the identity of their customers. These proposed regulations will not affect most industry players because most credible exchanges are already compliant with anti-money laundering reporting requirements. The finance ministry also implemented a capital gains tax that would tax profits made from the sale of bitcoins, similar to the tax regulations of the US and UK.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.uif.gov.ar/uif/index.php/en/"><strong>Argentine Financial Regulator Implements Bitcoin Reporting Requirements</strong></a></p>
<p>Argentina’s Unidad de Información Financiera (Financial Intelligence Unit) has directed financial service providers to report bitcoin activity. The UIF’s decree made amendments to previous regulations involving anti-money laundering concerns and terrorist and criminal financing.  The UIF will require companies to give a monthly report on digital currencies. Argentina has been tightening its stance on Bitcoin as the country faces a struggle to pay its debt.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/danelderforcongress"><strong>Congressional Candidate Announce He Will Only Accpet Bitcoin Donations</strong></a></p>
<p>Dan Elder is running for US House of Representatives in Missouri District 1 and announced on his facebook page that he will only accept bitcoins for his political campaign. This would make Elder the first US politician to solely accept bitcoin.</p>
<p>“I’d love to see the Fed [Federal Reserve] audited and eventually phased out, but until then we should find other ways to do our business. Thankfully, we have alternatives today, and one of them is bitcoin.” said Elder in a post.</p>
<p>Since the Federal Elections Commission has limited bitcoin contributions to $100 per person, Elder has put himself at a financial disadvantage against his competitors.  This will be an uphill battle for Elder, but will make him a Bitcoin champion.</p>
<p><a href="http://sundinmathias.blogspot.se/2014/07/the-worlds-first-political-bitcoin.html"><strong>Sweden’s First Bitcoin-only Politician</strong></a></p>
<p>Mathias Sundin is running for Sweden’s parliament and announced last week that he will only accept bitcoin donations for his campaign.  The Sundin campaign platform includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resist knee-jerk regulation of Bitcoin, other digital currencies, and disruptive innovation in general.</li>
<li>Continue the education reforms in Sweden.</li>
<li>Help develop a tax system that promotes fast growing, innovating companies.</li>
<li>Defend privacy rights</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Industry Analysis:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.globaladvisors.co.uk/"><strong>Bitcoin Gets Its First Fully Regulated Bitcoin Investment Vehicle</strong></a></p>
<p>Global Advisors Jersey Limited (“GAJL”), an investment management company based in Jersey, recently received regulatory approval for the Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment (GABI) Trust fund and will launch August 1, 2014.</p>
<p>Daniel Masters, Director of GABI, will be operating his fund in Jersey, a UK Crown Dependency in the British Isles. Jersey runs a self contained regulatory financial center which has helped enable this rapid move.  GABI will not be servicing American clients.</p>
<p><a href="http://dcmagnates.com/pantera-capital-launches-pantera-bitindex-states-venture-capital-will-drive-bitcoin-growth/"><strong>Pantera Launches BitIndex to Track Bitcoin</strong></a></p>
<p>Pantera Capital launches a BitIndex to track bitcoin growth over the medium term. The BitIndex uses seven factors to determine Bitcoins value:</p>
<p>Developer interest on GitHub</p>
<p>Merchant adoption</p>
<p>Wikipedia views</p>
<p>Hashrate</p>
<p>Google searches</p>
<p>User adoption as measured by wallets</p>
<p>Transaction volume</p>
<p>The index was created to help determine Bitcoins value without looking at the price, which has been largely influenced by large traders and negative news.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.itbit.com/blog/2014/7/7/leading-itbit-into-a-new-era"><strong>itBit moves to NYC</strong></a></p>
<p>itBit the bitcoin exchange for ‘serious traders’ once focused in Singapore is moving its headquarters to New York City. The move comes at the precipice of the looming Bitcoin ETF’s that are still awaiting approval. Although Singapore is a global hub for finances, the US has taken the lead in Bitcoin trading.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to start an exchange that would operate on the same level of sophistication as the global exchanges of traditional finance: powerful enough to trade large volumes, protected by bank-level security, powered by state-of-the-art technology, and most importantly, regulatory compliant and trustworthy.” &#8211; Chad Cascarilla</p>
<p>Rich Teo will stay in charge of the operations in Asia while Chad Cascarilla will take on the role of CEO.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.xapo.com/post/91149704707/xapo-raises-20-million-investment-led-by-greylock-partne"><strong>Xapo Leads the 4-Horsemen, Raising Another $20 Million</strong></a></p>
<p>Xapo announced last week that they have raised another $20 million in a series A-1 funding.  The company had previously raised $20 million in a Series A back in March. This brings Xapo’s total funding to $40 million making them the most well funded bitcoin company.  Xapo’s bitcoin debit cards are expected to be released this month.</p>
<p>The “Four Horsemen” of Bitcoin are Xapo, BitPay, CoinBase and Circle, the only companies with over $20 million in Venture Capital funding.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.coindesk.com/state-of-bitcoin-q2-2014-report-expanding-bitcoin-economy/"><strong>CoinDesk Published Q2 State of Bitcoin Report</strong></a></p>
<p>CoinDesk&#8217;s latest State of Bitcoin report highlights the measurable accomplishments of the Bitcoin community each quarter. In Q2 alone, $73 million has been invested into Bitcoin-related startups by venture capitalists around the world. With data concerning total amount of Bitcoin wallets and Bitcoin-accepting merchants, the report also predicts that there will be approximately 8 million Bitcoin wallets and 100k Bitcoin accepting merchants by the end of 2014.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.zipzapinc.com">ZipZap Expands Operations In Latin America</a></strong></p>
<p>On Tuesday, ZipZap announced that they are now open for business in Latin America. ZipZap had been operating in Brazil since 2013; however, this latest expansion bring ZipZap&#8217;s services and bitcoin access to millions more. In June 2014, ZipZap partnered with Payzone, a leading UK consumer payments and cash distribution network, to expand ZipZap operations to the UK. Though their focus is on international markets, ZipZap is headquartered in San Francisco and was founded in 2010. With ZipZap&#8217;s network, users in many locations around the world are able to buy digital currencies with cash using ZipZap and one of ZipZap&#8217;s exchange partners. Latin America&#8217;s thriving Bitcoin population welcomes the new financial services. They will be holding their first <a href="http://labitconf.com/">Latin American Bitcoin Conference</a> at the end of the year.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2014/07/08/175-years-later-the-mellons-have-never-been-richer-howd-they-do-it/"><strong>Mellon’s  Family Preserving Their Wealth In Bitcoin</strong></a></p>
<p>The Mellon family’s $12 billion fortune makes them America’s 19th largest family by net worth. Preserving that fortune has been challenging, however, Matthew Taylor Mellon II, heir of Thomas Mellon, entrepreneur and banker of the late 19th and early 20th century, is keeping the family fortune by investing in Bitcoin companies.</p>
<p>“The banks are going to be scratching their heads” said Mellon II in a Forbes interview. Matthew believes “we need to live in a more transparent, free democracy” and that citizens are fed up with current financial system. Subsequently, he has invested two million dollars in Bitcoin startups.</p>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/07/07/floating-fees/"><strong>Floating Fees Introduced In Bitcoin Core 0.10</strong></a></p>
<p>On July 7, Gavin Andresen announced the release of Bitcoin Core 0.10. It will have floating transactions determined by size, priority and other factors. Andresen believes that transaction fees will continue to rise as transaction volumes rise, and to fix this problem some “smart engineers” will have to fix the “bigger blocks take longer to broadcast” problem. This could be a great way to incentivize innovation for traffic, by creating priority on particular transactions.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.goxdox.org/2014/07/magicaltux-strikes-again-tibanne-takes.html"><strong>Mt. Gox Pays Mark Karpeles $200k, Infuriating Customers </strong></a></p>
<p>A new document filed with the Tokyo District Court shows that Mt. Gox paid Tibanne Co. (Mark Karpeles’ holding company) $200,000 in May 2014 for expenses incurred to keep Mt. Gox alive during bankruptcy proceedings.  While it is important for the carcass of Mt. Gox to remain open to allow for bankruptcy proceedings and investigations to continue, the community is repulsed that even a penny of customer funds have paid out to Tibanne, i.e., Karpeles.</p>
<p>According to John Betts, CEO of Sunlot, which is also spearheading the SaveGox.com initiative,</p>
<p>&#8220;This shows the deplorable continuing theft of customer assets. The theft at Mt Gox is a major crime and the interested parties are allowing those responsible to get away without recourse, tacitly encouraging the whole situation to be swept under the rug.”</p>
<p><a href="http://newsbtc.com/2014/07/07/rise-rise-bitcoin-screened-tnabc-kick-party-house-blues-chicago/"><strong>The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin</strong></a></p>
<p>The North American Bitcoin Conference is holding a screening of The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin, at Chicago’s House of Blues on July 18.  The film is the first documentary on Bitcoin, and follows some of the early adopters, entrepreneurs, and investors of the industry. This will be the second screening of the film. According to Ben Bledsoe,</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bitcoin community has embraced our presence throughout the entire process of filming, letting us into their homes and offices, and supporting us with posts and at meet-ups.  We are currently preparing for distribution and feel that it is important to debut the fully finished film directly to the Bitcoin community.  We are thrilled to have the screening at the House of Blues Chicago for the kick-off of the North American Bitcoin Conference.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://kryptoradio.koodilehto.fi/"><strong>Kryptoradio</strong></a></p>
<p>A Finnish initiative, Kryptoradio, plans to broadcast the Bitcoin blockchain through DVB-T (Digital Video Broadcasting &#8211; Terrestrial) signals. The project aims to start its pilot phase this September 1st and will broadcast the Bitcoin transactions, blocks and currency exchange data to roughly 95% of the Finnish population, about 5 million people.</p>
<p>Broadcasting this data through DVB-T signals would mean that Bitcoin users wouldn’t need internet to make transactions. Other radio technology such as FM can used but the team has decided to use DVB-T because of its widespread use throughout Europe, Africa and Asia.<br />
The costs to run the program will be about 2,000 Euros per month and Kryptoradio is looking for funding and partnerships to keep it running.</p>
<p><strong>George Gilder Is Writing A Book On Bitcoin</strong></p>
<p>Gilder is 45,000 words into writing <em>Bitcoin and Gold, the Information Theory of Money</em>, which builds on his book <em>Knowledge and Power, The Information Theory of Capitalism</em>. Gilder is outlining how the creation of the gold standard is similar to the emergence of bitcoin. He also drawls parallels to Sir Isaac Newton, the discovery of light and bitcoin.</p>

				<p>Bitcoin was the talk of central bankers this week. Government discussions around Bitcoin – although scary for some – can also be viewed as a step towards legitimizing the “magic internet money.” While it is important governments do not choke off innovation for Bitcoin, basic consumer protections and security protocols are necessary for widespread adoption of digital currencies. It is in the community’s best interest to engage with policy makers and legislators to keep an open dialogue on how best to oversee the industry, and ideally, implementing self-regulatory measures.</p>
<p><strong>Government Bitcoin Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@vaurum/88f04a1d8598"><strong>Tim Drapers Wins All The Govt’s Coins And Partners With Vaurum</strong></a></p>
<p>The US Marshals Service auctioned off nearly 30,000 bitcoins last week that were seized from the online drug bazaar Silk Road. Shockingly, Tim Draper, managing director of VC firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, was the sole winner of all three blocks of coins, beating out over 40 bids including SecondMarket and Pantera.</p>
<p>Draper is partnering with Vaurum, a bitcoin exchange, to “provide liquidity and confidence to markets that have been hamstrung by weak currencies.” Draper was an early investor in Vaurum; he met the start up at the <a href="https://www.boost.vc/about">Boost Incubator</a> last summer.</p>
<p>Draper has declined to release the official numbers of how much he paid for the bitcoins.</p>
<p><a href="http://cryptocrimson.com/2014/07/us-marshals-mistake-causes-bitcoin-fund-lose-100-btc/"><strong>Bitcoin Fund Hacked After Government Carelessly Leaks Emails</strong></a></p>
<p>On June 18th the USMS accidently leaked the emails for prospective bidders in last Friday’s auction. Most unfortunately, this was the catalyst that caused Bitcoin Reserve to lose 100 bitcoin, valued at about $65,000, in an email hack. The hacker posed as Linda Jackson from BitFilm Production and asked Bitcoins Reserve co-founder Sam Lee to answer a series of interview questions in a shared Google Doc.</p>
<p>When Lee opened the Google Doc it allowed for a malicious cyber-attack giving the hacker access to his company’s admin accounts. Should Lee have known better?</p>
<p><em>“Is it the US Marshals’ fault that the attack occurred? Absolutely! Is it their fault that we lost some Bitcoin? No</em>” <a href="http://cryptocrimson.com/2014/07/us-marshals-mistake-causes-bitcoin-fund-lose-100-btc/">Said Lee</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/657547/EBA-Op-2014-08+Opinion+on+Virtual+Currencies.pdf"><strong>European Banking Authority Calls For Crack Down On Bitcoin</strong></a></p>
<p>Last Friday, the European Banking Authority (EBA) released an Opinion on ‘virtual currencies’ outlining 70 (admittedly boiler-plate) risks of using digital monies</p>
<p><em>“Some of these are similar, if not identical, to risks arising from conventional financial services or products.”</em></p>
<p>This is not the first time that the EBA has released documents on virtual currencies, however, this opinion also called for comprehensive regulatory action, bringing the EU one step closer to Bitcoin legitimacy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/press-area/speeches/Pages/GarethMurphyBitFin2014.aspx"><strong>Central Bank of Ireland Headlines at BitFin Conference In Dublin</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.coindesk.com/irish-central-banker-envisions-hybrid-bitcoin-fiat-future/">CoinDesk reported</a> that Gareth Murphy, Director of Central Bank of Ireland became “the first government backed bank representative to speak at a digital currency conference.” However, this is not entirely true. David Andolfatto from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis spoke at the Digital Asset Transfer Authority’s annual meeting in April 2014, which I wrote about on <a href="http://moneyandtech.com/highlights-data-inaugural-meeting/">Money &amp; Tech</a>.</p>
<p>Murphy’s speech proposed a “Spectrum of Regulatory Engagement,” which outlined seven steps of policy formation for virtual currencies. The Irish central banker made clear that he has concerns with virtual currencies being used to facilitate tax evasion and money laundering, but he did not seem to realize that <a href="http://moneyandtech.com/how-bitcoin-strengthen-america/">bitcoin can actually be a tool</a> for preventing both of these.</p>
<p>His most interesting concern was that virtual currencies could undermine the integrity of government economic statistics unless governments also “gathered data on activity in virtual currencies.” There is very little data, statistics or research on the Bitcoin economy, a void the BBR is even looking to fill. Ironically, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/perianneboring/2014/02/03/if-you-want-to-know-the-real-rate-of-inflation-dont-bother-with-the-cpi/">government statistics have not always been the most reliable</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Bank For International Settlements Is Monitoring Bitcoin </strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/russia-softens-stance-on-bitcoin-1404305139">Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href="http://rt.com/business/170112-russia-may-legalize-bitcoin/">RT</a> and <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/bank-of-russia-bitcoin-should-not-be-rejected/">CoinDesk</a> all reported last week on a statement by the Bank of Russia that signals the bank could take a softer approach to Bitcoin. However, what I found more interesting in this statement was a reference to the Bank for International Settlements, the first one I’ve heard to date:</p>
<p><em>“We advocate a careful approach to bitcoin and are monitoring the situation along with the Bank for International Settlements.”</em></p>
<p>The Bank for International Settlements is the central bank of central banks. According to Robert Wenzel of <a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com">EconomicPolicyJournal.com</a>, this could be a sign of tighter privacy controls:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;The Bank of Russia and the BIS are not interested in Bitcoin as a way for individuals to operate in a manner that prevents the prying eyes of government from being aware of transactions.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin Industry Analysis:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.gulf-times.com/eco.-bus.%20news/256/details/398622/kuwait-finance-firm-suggests-trading-oil-in-bitcoins"><strong>Kuwaiti Report Suggests Trading Oil In Bitcoin</strong></a></p>
<p>Kuwait Financial Centre, an investment and asset management firm, issued a report last week outlining possible benefits of trading oil in bitcoin. This is rather shocking and bold because since 1971 OPEC oil is exclusively quoted in US dollars. This is known as the Petrocurrency and provides a huge stronghold for the US of the world’s reserve currency. In recent years Iran, China and Russia have been trading oil in their respective currencies, posing a threat to the US dollar as the world reserve currency, but this has not been widely reported. The question of whether bitcoin could become the next world reserve currency has been discussed in <a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/12272/congress-divided-bubble-reserve/">US Congressional hearings</a>, but was not taken very seriously. This report brings a bit of legitimacy to that possibility.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.coindesk.com/mastercard-patent-would-add-bitcoin-to-global-online-shopping-cart/"><strong>MasterCard Patent Would Add Bitcoin to Global Shopping Cart</strong></a></p>
<p>MasterCard is seeking to improve its global online shopping cart and filed a patent that would incorporate bitcoin. The online shopping cart is a project by MasterCard that is looking to improve the online shopping experience. Bitcoin could be the “payment interchange” that provides “additional convenience to consumers.”</p>
<p>The filing has not yet been approved. Visa and Western Union are also waiting for patent approvals. This could be an indication that the five lobbyists MasterCard registered to lobby US Congress on “Bitcoin” and “virtual currencies” could be giving a more positive message to Members.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.coinbase.com/post/90552757447/the-future-of-bitcoin-storage-wallets-vaults"><strong>CoinBase</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href="http://blog.bitpay.com/2014/07/01/bitauth-for-decentralized-authentication.html"><strong>BitPay</strong></a><strong> Ramp Up Security Features </strong></p>
<p>In an attempt to make and keep bitcoin safer, easier and cheaper to use than using credit cards, CoinBase and BitPay announced last week they are both adding new securities features.</p>
<p>CoinBase is rolling out ‘Vault,’ a new highly secure account for storing large amounts of bitcoin.  The ‘Vault’ is described as a secondary savings account for bitcoin and offers options such as time delayed withdrawals and multiple approvers. Bitcoins stored in the ‘Vault” are not as easy to access as bitcoin stored in a e-wallet, but they are more secure. Coinbase also promises to roll out multi-signature technology in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Merchant servicer BitPay added a new passwordless means of authentication named BitAuth.  Instead of using a password, BitAuth users sign in with a private key then matches it to the public key for access. Since the private key isn’t stored on the server it is more secure. This type of innovation isn’t just great for Bitcoin but could play a role in the future of passwords everywhere, since attacks on website servers continually compromise millions of consumer usernames and passwords each year.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.coindesk.com/winklevoss-bitcoin-etf-trade-nasdaq-coin-symbol/"><strong>Winklevoss Update ETF Filing With SEC</strong></a></p>
<p>The Winklevoss twins have updated their ETF filing for the fourth time since first filing a year ago on July 1, 2013. According to their latest update the ETF will trade under the symbol COIN.  In a race to issue the first publically traded bitcoin ETF, there is still no launch date for the COIN but hopes are aimed for the symbolic tenth anniversary of gold ETF (GLD) on November 18, 2014.  SecondMarket’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) plans to launch in the fourth quarter of this year. The BIT however, will bypass the regulatory framework the Winklevoss ETF will go through by transforming the BIT to an open fund for public investors.</p>
<p>One should note that hundreds of firms have tickers registered with the NASDAQ and that does not mean the ETF is a sure thing yet, but it is a sign of being another step closer.</p>
<p><a href="http://boringbitcoinreport.com/2014/07/chicago-sun-times-ballin-bitcoin-jay-z-beyonce/"><strong>Chicago Newspaper Prints First Bitcoin-Enabled Ad</strong></a></p>
<p>It is a market test that has never been done before. On Thursday, July 3, <em>The Chicago Sun Times</em> print edition included an ad with a QR Code that allowed readers to purchase concert tickets directly off the newspaper via bitcoin<strong>.</strong> The test is to see if a newspaper can successfully sell goods and services to its readers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.law111.com/dmpg.html"><strong>California Law Firm Forms Digital Money Practice Group</strong></a></p>
<p>On July 2<sup>nd</sup> Berns Weiss announced the formation of the new Digital Money Practice Group, “to protect consumers from the possibility of unfair practices in the financial sector.” Berns Weiss is a class-action law firm that believes that digital currencies will empower individuals instead of financial institutions. The Digital Money Practice Group will work hand-in-hand with consumer protection organizations and other entities to create basic safeguards for the industry. According to partner Lee Weiss, the Digital Money Practice Group is preparing to file class-action lawsuits against entities that have allegedly mishandled consumer’s digital money.</p>
<p><a href="http://storj.io"><strong>Storj, Decentralized Storage App, Prepares Metadisk and Crowdsale</strong></a></p>
<p>As announced today, Storj, a decentralized cloud storage network akin to Maidsafe, will release Metadisk to customers over the next several weeks while attempting a crowdsale of Storjcoin. Metadisk is the name of the software that will allow users to upload files into a distributed cloud storage service without a central point of failure. Files in “Storj” are chunked, encrypted, and stored piecewise in many other peoples’ computers, making data loss a thing of the past. Storj intends to work side-by-side with other Bitcoin 2.0 protocols once they have taken off. Shawn Wilkinson founded Storj just 4 months ago after winning an award at the Texas Bitcoin Hackathon.</p>

				<p>It is a market test that has never been done before. On Thursday, July 3, <em>The Chicago Sun Times</em> print edition will include an ad with a QR Code that will allow readers to purchase concert tickets directly off the newspaper via bitcoin<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>The test is to see if a newspaper can successfully sell goods and services to its readers. Bitcoin just might be the new technology to facilitate this service.</p>
<p>“We believe this to be the first time a major newspaper or any other print publication is doing a ‘direct to consumer’ bitcoin-enabled ad,” says Josh Metnick, who is overseeing the project at <em>The Chicago Sun Times.</em></p>
<p>The ticketing provider, Gold Coast Tickets purchased the ad space from <em>The Chicago Sun Times</em>, in partnership with bitcoin companies, CoinBase and Blockchain.</p>
<p>The first 24 people to scan the QR will receive 25 percent off Jay-Z and Beyonce concert tickets. After the 24<sup>th</sup> customer, tickets purchased in bitcoin through the Gold Coast ad, will receive 5 to 10 percent off their purchase.</p>
<p>The Boring Bitcoin Report acquired an advance copy of the ad, with the QR code (removed of course) that will appear in Thursday&#8217;s paper.</p>

<p>The merging of the declining industry of newspapers with financial services technology, such as digital currencies could potentially help newspapers make a comeback.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to inspire new types of transactions and blend the retail experience with digital money”, said Nic Cary, CEO of Blockchain.info.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer based technology that is starting to decentralize industries all across the economy. According to Cary, “Bitcoin allows for writers and content creators to immediately accept payments without fees. It also opens up exciting opportunities like micro-transactions that are ideal for paywalls.”</p>
<p>It will be interesting to track the results of <em>The Chicago Sun Times’ </em>innovative approach to directly engaging readers in digital commerce, a clear first for print medium.  The next step, perhaps, getting Jay-Z to rap about how Chicago is ballin’ on Bitcoin?</p>

				<p>I am pleased to announce the relocation of the Boring Bitcoin Report.  Previously viewed on Forbes.com the report will now be available here, on BoringBitcoinReport.com.</p>
<p>The BBR has been incredibly well received by the Bitcoin community allowing for a stand-alone website exclusively focused on bitcoin reports.</p>
<p>Boring &amp; Company is working on building up the website to allow for added features, including direct communication channels.  Our focus will continue to be catered towards Bitcoin news most relevant for investing, including government initiative updates.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another not-so-boring week in review:</p>
<p><strong>Government Bitcoin Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>Last week I predicted that the price of bitcoin would decrease due to the US Marshal’s Bitcoin Auction. When the government announced the details of this auction the week before, the price began to decline.</p>
<p>My prediction was based on conversations with numerous bitcoin investors and auction participants. The general consensus was that enough bids would be placed under market value for this widely watched auction that it would move the market. However, this was not the case. In fact, the market price of bitcoin increased about 1.8 percent this week. Bitcoin proved to be resilient through the week, a celebrated accomplishment!</p>
<p><strong>US Marshal’s Bitcoin Auction:</strong></p>
<p>Today we are anxiously awaiting the results of the bitcoin auction. The US Marshal’s office will release the winners anytime now.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Results of our US Marshals bitcoin syndicate: Bidders &#8211; 42 Bids received &#8211; 186 BTC quantity bid &#8211; 48,013 Winners notifed by USMS on Mon</p>

<p><a href="http://gao.gov/assets/670/663678.pdf"><strong>GAO Releases Bitcoin Report Looping CFPB In</strong></a></p>
<p>United States Government Accountability Office released a report on the emerging regulatory, law enforcement, and consumer protection challenges as requested by Sen. Tom Carper, Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.</p>
<p>The GAO found that the multiple government agencies looking to regulate Bitcoin will need to streamline efforts, and interagency collaboration would be necessary to mitigate the risk of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The GAO has tasked the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with identifying interagency working groups and overseeing the collaboration process. The CFPB was the agency born out of the Dodd-Frank financial reform act, with jurisdiction under the Federal Reserve and essentially has a blank check budget. Bitcoin does have one saving grace with the CFPB, Former CFPB Deputy Director Raj Date currently <a href="https://www.circle.com/board-of-directors">sits on the board of Circle</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140AB129&amp;search_keywords="><strong>California Legalizes Bitcoin</strong></a></p>
<p>Assembly Bill 129 repealed <a href="http://law.onecle.com/california/corporations/107.html">an archaic law</a> that effectively made it illegal to use any other alternative currency besides US legal tender as money, which would include community currencies, reward points or digital currencies, such as Amazon Coins and Starbucks Stars.</p>
<p>The bill was introduced on January 15, 2014 by Assemblymember Roger Dickinson (D-Sacramento) and Gov. Jerry Brown signed it into law on June 28.</p>
<p><em>“This bill is intended to fine-tune current law to address Californians’ payment habits in the mobile and digital fields.”</em> said Dickinson in a press release.</p>
<p>11 Assembly members voted no on this bill:</p>
<p>Frank Bigelow (R- 5th District), Joan Buchanan (D &#8211; 16th District), Steve Fox (D &#8211; 36th District), Adam Gray (D &#8211; 21st District), Shannon Grove (R &#8211; 34th District), Diane Harkey (R &#8211; 73rd District), Brian Maienschein (R &#8211; 77nd District), Jim Patterson (R &#8211; 23rd District), John A. Pérez (D &#8211; 53rd District), Sharon Quirk-Silva (D &#8211; 65th District), Marie Waldron (R &#8211; 75th District)</p>
<p>California is also one of the top spots for Bitcoin startups with over $90 million in <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-venture-capital/">venture capital</a> out of a global amount of $216 million.</p>
<p><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jz2pwjd9t20-en"><strong>The OECD’s Positive Take On Bitcoin</strong></a></p>
<p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development published a rather positive paper on bitcoin titled, <em>The Bitcoin Question: Currency versus Trust-less Transfer Technology.</em></p>
<p>The paper outlines how the effects of the 2008 financial crisis caused distrust in the financial system and was essentially the catalyst for new digital technologies, such as Bitcoin. Further, an added benefit of Bitcoin is the blockchain, which removes the need for trusted third parties.</p>
<p>The OECD does not believe, however, that Bitcoin will become an alternative to legal tender and that if Bitcoin adoption begins to undermine the financial system, governments will probably take action.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.news.admin.ch/NSBSubscriber/message/attachments/35355.pdf"><strong>Swiss’ Federal Council Issues Report On Virtual Currencies</strong></a></p>
<p>This report is in response to <a href="http://www.parlament.ch/d/suche/seiten/geschaefte.aspx?gesch_id=20133687">postulate Schwaab</a>, which asked the federal Council to report on the risks of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The Council concluded that risks such as anonymity features could present an opportunity for illegal acts. Bitcoin could be used to acquire illegal goods, launder money, and can be stolen with relatively little reparations. This boilerplate report provided little difference between the risk of using bitcoin, fiat currencies, or other digital currencies. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/perianneboring/2014/05/09/secs-investor-warning-on-bitcoin-could-stifle-innovation/">Such reports can stifle innovation</a>.</p>
<p>The report did note that “Bitcoin is a ground-breaking innovation that can enable consumers to escape from the dependency of the financial system and revolutionize payment transactions.”</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/06/25/bitbeat-why-bitcoins-scoring-goals-in-argentina/"><strong>Bitcoin’s Success in Argentina</strong></a></p>
<p>Argentine businesses are benefiting from accepting bitcoin because they get paid in a more accurate exchange rate as opposed to the government’s fixed rate of 8.15 pesos per dollar. The Argentine peso is undergoing volatility and hyperinflation; the black market exchange rate is closer to 12 percent. Bitcoin is liberating Argentinean business from the country’s strict currency controls.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires is becoming a hotspot for Bitcoin. It hosts the world’s largest Bitcoin meet-up and is now home to payment processor, BitPay.</p>

<p>Temasek Holdings is an investment company owned by the Singapore government with a portfolio value of S$215bil ($171bil USD) in 2013.   On Thursday, Temasek opened up shop in New York City to cultivate relationships on Wall Street. Prime Minister Lee Hsien told guests at the opening party that a significant amount of Temasek’s portfolio consist of US investments.</p>
<p>Temasek chairman Lim Boon Heng also gave a speech where he divulged that Temasek held a company-wide Bitcoin experiment, where all employees from the top down had to donate bitcoin to a charity operating a bitcoin wallet. While, Temasek does not currently hold any Bitcoin related investments, Mr. Lim said “Temasek … has its eye on the opportunities of tomorrow’s digital world”.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin Industry Analysis: </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0881422D:US"><strong>Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust Takes One Pending Step Forward</strong></a></p>
<p>The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust (WBT) is now on Bloomberg “Pending Listing” which might mean the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust could be listed on the NASDAQ as soon as this year. In May the news came out that the twins had chosen the NASDAQ to list their Bitcoin ETF, but earlier this year the prospects didn’t look so good, after the Mt. Gox debacle.</p>
<p>“Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust is an investment company.  The Company provides investment participation in the Bitcoins market through investment in securities.”</p>
<p>The WBT and SecondMarket’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) are in a procedural race to become the first publically traded Bitcoin ETF. The WBT took the more traditional route, requesting <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1579346/000119312514058712/d562329ds1a.htm">approval through the SEC</a>. However, this process could take years. Barry Silbert’s BIT is not asking for SEC approval, rather going through procedural motions at FINRA, he expects to be in business by Q4 2014.</p>
<p><a href="http://nypost.com/2014/06/25/its-david-vs-goliath-in-race-to-launch-nys-first-regulated-bitcoin-exchange/"><strong>NASDAQ and Andreessen Race to Launch NY’s First Regulated Bitcoin Exchange</strong></a></p>
<p>While Barry Silbert and the Winklevi race to introduce the first publically traded Bitcoin ETF, the NY Post reports that Marc Andreessen and NASDAQ might soon be in a race to launch New York’s first regulated Bitcoin exchange.</p>
<p>“Andreessen, whose venture capital firm was an early investor in tech darlings like Twitter, has reached out to the New York Department of Financial Services about the upcoming rules and what it would take to create an exchange, sources said.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/video/western-union-ceo-we-ll-use-bitcoin-when-regulated-SulUCvcZQEixMGv9Mu~akw.html"><strong>Western Union Appears Not To Have A Bitcoin Strategy</strong></a></p>
<p>This week Bloomberg’s Trish Regan interviewed Western Union CEO Hikmet Ersek and asked him about new competitive transaction methods like Bitcoin. Ersek began speaking very fast and said his company was innovating with new technology and the company would use Bitcoin if it were regulated like a currency. However, under FinCEN, the US Treasury department overseeing money transmitters, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/perianneboring/2014/04/02/bitcoin-could-strengthen-the-world-economy-if-washington-doesnt-destroy-it/">bitcoin is treated as a currency</a> and regulated.</p>
<p>Ersek later went on to say that “it’s not easy to move money across borders.” Apparently he has not spent much time looking at bitcoin as a remitter, because that is simply not the case.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Just like that. Sent $5 from Ghana to <a href="https://twitter.com/Mbwana">@Mbwana</a> in Tanzania. Thanks to bitcoin, it arrived in 3 seconds. Didn&#8217;t pay a 25% fee to no bank.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.coinbase.com/"><strong>Quickbooks Online Now Accepting Bitcoin</strong></a></p>
<p>Coinbase and QuickBooks Online partnered up to offer PayByCoin by Intuit Labs for small businesses who use QuickBooks to accept bitcoin payments. The simple add-on costs a one percent payment processing fee. Merchants can elect to have bitcoins converted to government currencies or keep bitcoins in their accounts.</p>
<p>624,000 small businesses use Quickbooks online, and last year Intuit processed over 40 billion in transactions.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-jersey-27921445">Jersey Island, UK Trying to Become the Bitcoin Isle</a></strong></p>
<p>The small island between France and Great Britain is trying to become the next Bitcoin Isle. The island has a population of about 100,000 people and 43 percent of its economy comes from the financial services industry, a perfect fit for a Bitcoin hotspot.</p>
<p>Robbie Andrews, of bit.coin.je, an industry body that promotes the use of bitcoin said &#8220;At the moment there is a big push for a digital industry in Jersey to grow, and if you asked any technologist what is the one technology that fits between technology and finance, it would be a crypto-currency like Bitcoin.&#8221;</p>
