Part 1: Changing Automatic Transmission Fluid & Filter On A BMW/MINI
blog.BavAuto.com -- Most people think that because BMW and MINI call their
transmission fluids "Lifetime" or "Extended Service" it doesn't have to be
changed. Not true. To get the most out of your transmission and avoid a
costly, catastrophic failure, you should change the fluid and filter every
50,000 miles. Watch Bavarian Otto demonstrate how to do this on a BMW E39
(5 series 97 thru 03). You'll find the specific fluid and filter your
BMW/MINI needs in our online store at www.BavAuto.com.

Replacing an engine with a brand new one is usually too expensive for
many people's budgets, so the choice comes down to a re-manufactured engine
(or short block) or, a used engine (and the risks that go with it). A used
engine is a temporary fix at best and buys the owner only a little time.
Sooner or later most used engines experience problems and have to be
replaced or rebuilt.
