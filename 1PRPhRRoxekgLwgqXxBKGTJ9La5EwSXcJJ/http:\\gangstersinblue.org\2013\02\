<p>Tim was arrested a few months back for filming police in Milwaukee. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW799njhxAM" ><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Here is that video</span></a>.</p>
<p>I find it interesting that this man, Johnny Sgrignouli, is willing to do such a poor investigation without flinching. Is this how they all end up?</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Justice?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Can there ever really be justice? I never thought I would question this</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Really never cared or had a reason to give it too much thought before</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> I arrived in Las Vegas in 2000 due to the passing of my father</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It was  a sad time for me reconnecting with my little sister</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Who I hadn&#8217;t seen in many years. This is how I met Stanley L. Gibson</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">My brother in law and him were friends and he had come over one day</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And that basically was the day we started our life together</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">For the next 12 years it was just Stan-N-Rondha</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Two orphans against the world, but we had love</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We shared a love that no-one could ever understand</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">But it was our love and then in one quick instant it was gone</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">By the hands of the people that say they are here to serve and protect</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">What they don&#8217;t tell you is they only serve and protect each other</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">They say if you are robbed you should call the police but</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I ask you who do I call when Metro was the one who robbed me</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This power LVMPD has to kill without consequence needs to end</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Too much blood has been spilt due to their actions</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Too much innocent blood has been shed</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Stand beside me and let our voices be heard</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">NEVER FORGET!  NEVER FORGET!</p>

<p>The first &#8220;Police Fatality Public Fact-Finding Review,&#8221; regarding the murder of <a href="http://nvcopblock.org/265/justice-for-stanley-gibson-or-just-an-end-around-coroners-inquest-reforms/">Stanley Gibson by Metro Officer Jesus Arevalo</a>, is scheduled to take place on Thursday February 28th beginning at 9:00 am and will be located at the Clark County Government Center, where the Clark County Board of Commissioners hold their regular meetings.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be meeting up at 8:00am in order to organize together and go over the specifics of what we will be doing to bring attention to Stanley&#8217;s murder. It&#8217;s incredibly important for anyone that cares about justice and supports accountability for police that commit crimes against people within the Las Vegas community to be there and make their voice heard for past victims of police violence and to prevent future innocent victims.</p>
<p>In spite of the long-winded name change, the new process that was created by LVMPD&#8217;s Sheriff Gillespie and Chris Collins of the Las Vegas Police Protective Association (Police Union) is designed to do anything but allow the public to find facts. The reality is that it is much worse than the original, much maligned, Coroner&#8217;s Inquest system that it will be replacing.</p>
<p>Unlike the Coroner&#8217;s Inquest, the Police Fatality Review will involve no opportunity for testimony from witnesses and only voluntary testimony by the police involved in the shootings, which the LVPPA has already gone on record as saying that pretty much has no chance of happening. What it amounts to is a choreographed staging of the police department&#8217;s version of events with zero representation from a genuine neutral party, the victim&#8217;s family, or independent witnesses.</p>
<p>Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson actually referred to it as a &#8220;performance,&#8221; while endorsing it, during the Commissioner&#8217;s meeting in which it was initially proposed. That&#8217;s just how much of a blatant and callous cover up the Police Fatality Review is.</p>
<p>The first case to go before this Police Fatality Review involves the murder of Stanley Gibson, an unarmed man who was shot seven times by Jesus Arevalo in spite of having committed no actual crime and having had his vehicle blocked in by several police cars so that it was unable to move.</p>
<p>Stanley, a disabled veteran, who was lost and suffering a panic attack as a result of PTSD and other ailments he suffered during his time in the Persian Gulf, represented no direct or imminent probability of harming anyone at the time.</p>
<p>There was no reason for any of the dozens of heavily armed police to feel in any way threatened by him. And the fact that of all those cops there, only Jesus Arevalo felt the need to fire the shots that killed Stanley Gibson only supports that conclusion.</p>
<div id="attachment_824" style="width: 355px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CautionPoliceState.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-824" alt="CautionPoliceState Unite with Nevada Cop Block to Oppose the Cover Up of Stanley Gibsons Murder by LVMPD" src="http://nvcopblock.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CautionPoliceState.jpg" width="345" height="400" title="Unite with Nevada Cop Block to Oppose the Cover Up of Stanley Gibsons Murder by LVMPD" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Caution Police State ahead</p></div>
<p>Instead of holding someone that at best was grossly negligent that night accountable for his actions, D.A. Wolfson, Sheriff Gillespie, LVPPA&#8217;s Chris Collins, the Clark County Board of Commissioners, and every other member of the LV Metro Police Department are closing ranks around him in a misguided attempt to cover up yet another officer involved shooting under what could only mildly be called questionable circumstances.</p>
<p>Anyone living in Las Vegas should be well aware that there is a longstanding problem with brutality and outright murder by members of Las Vegas area police departments, especially those of the LVMPD. In several cases, especially those involving Stanley Gibson, Erik Scott, Trevon Cole, Henry Rowe, and Rafael Olivas, the circumstances behind the shooting have been incredibly questionable, if not completely inexcusable.</p>
<p>The obvious reason for the mounting body count by local police is the fact that no Las Vegas area police officer has EVER been held accountable for shooting someone, no matter how questionable that shooting has been.</p>
<p>Replacing what was already a terribly flawed system with one that not only retains those flaws, but incorporates even less transparency and can only be seen as a conscious effort to ensure the police never have to fear being held accountable for deaths they cause not only doesn&#8217;t address this problem, but in reality actually makes it harder for the police to do the things they are supposed to do by creating a lack of trust and discouraging any support for police from the people living within the community that they work.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a self-perpetuating downward spiral that only exacerbates an already toxic and often violent relationship. The time to put an end to this has already passed and things can only get worse at this point if the transparency and accountability that Sheriff Gillespie promises so often isn&#8217;t actually upheld truthfully and with honest intentions.</p>
<p>As of right now, I have been unable to find any info regarding the specifics of the expected length of the kangaroo court that will begin Thursday or restrictions on public entry into the chambers where it will be held. Although, I suspect this lack of information is intentional, if I do come across that information I will post it here.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mintpress.net/disputed-suicide-by-man-handcuffed-in-squad-car-highlights-who-pays-for-police-misconduct/">Full Story</a></p>
<p>Who pays when police misbehave?</p>
<p>In 2006, Rennie Simmons, a 20-year Chicago Water Department employee — and stroke victim — visited the home of Glenn Evans to issue a notice that that water to the property could be cut off, due to lack of payment. Court records indicate that while there, Evans tackled the man to the ground, causing multiple injuries, according to a court complaint. Following the altercation, Evans arrested him — turns out Evans is a lieutenant.</p>
<p>Simmons was arrested and charged with committing battery against Evans and was eventually found not guilty in Cook County Court, during a time in which the judge shared harsh words with Simmons. Evans kept his job, and continues to receive a six-figure salary. He did not contribute to the $99,999 payout given to Simmons after a settlement was reached over a civil complaint regarding the same incident.</p>
<p>In July, two settlements led to the payouts of $7.17 million for victims who alleged torture by former Chicago Police Cmdr. Jon Burge.</p>
<p>In these cases, Burge was convicted of trying to cover up the torture, and he served more than four years in prison as a result. Yet the cost of the settlements fell on the shoulders of the government agency, funded through taxpayers.</p>
<p>In February, the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) announced a victory when they reached a $6.2 million settlement in a class action lawsuit stemming from the arrest of 700 anti-war protesters in 2003 by Chicago officers. While the NLG did not argue police brutality, they did cite police misconduct, as arrests made were violations of the protesters’ right to peacefully assemble. The crowd was also not ordered to disperse before arrests were made.</p>
<p>In Seattle, an agreement was reached between the police department and Justice Department in July to create a police commission tasked with monitoring police behavior and increasing citizen input following the shooting of a homeless Native American man in 2010. He died from gunshot wounds inflicted by an officer. In that case, investigators deemed the action to be unconstitutional, as excessive force had been used.</p>
<p>These incidents only represent the thousands of cases of police misconduct and brutality carried out in the U.S. each year. According to the CATO Institute’s National Police Misconduct Statistics and Reporting Project (NPMSRP), $347.4 million was spent between April 2009 and June 2010 on settlements and judgements related to misconduct and brutality. That price tag reflects 5,986 separate incidents during that time period, 382 of which resulted in fatalities.</p>
<p>In its annual report, the CATO Institute claims the numbers through 2010 remained consistent, with $346.5 million spent on related judgements, settlements, court costs and attorney fees from January-December 2010. During that time, the organization’s statistics show 4,861 incidents reported throughout the year, involving more than 6,600 law enforcement officials and 6,826 victims.</p>
<p>Yet with consistently high numbers and settlements reaching in the millions, it seems there has been no other solution presented other than to deal with the issue at hand, reach into the settlement funds and move on. The numbers show the tactic isn’t necessarily deterring the actions, and the cost continues to mount for taxpayers.</p>
<p>What’s the solution?<br />
When a law enforcement official steps out of his or her bounds and harms an individual without due cause, the initial action by an officer’s department is to launch an internal investigation. During that time period, the officer is typically put on administrative leave, a time in which they continue to receive salary payments.</p>
<p>If a settlement is reached, the law enforcement department is tasked with turning over the payment — the financial threat to the officer in question is nothing more than a pink slip, or in some cases, the loss of employment. The financial burden of such settlements and leaves lies on the shoulders of the very people who are attempting to hold the officials accountable for their harmful actions.</p>
<p>Creating a system within the law enforcement departments that would somehow tie officers’ wages to settlements relating to their behavior could perhaps deter officers from acting out, knowing that the burden would be seen within their bank account, rather than a settlement fund they have no control over.</p>

<p>A D.C. man who shot a pit bull that was attacking a child might end up facing charges as police investigate whether he legally owned the gun. The man said he saw three pit bulls attacking a boy and rushed into his house to retrieve a gun. He shot and killed one of the dogs, and the sound of the gunfire attracted a nearby police officer, who shot the other two dogs. Illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition is punishable by a $1,000 fine and up to a year in prison. The boy suffered severe lacerations in the attack, according to police</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see what happens to an 89 year old man&#8217;s gun collection as he simply says he&#8217;ll fight to keep his house as the 407 highway wants to take his property for their highway extension. Note he didn&#8217;t say he&#8217;d shoot people &#8211; he didn&#8217;t even take any of his guns out of their storage. His words were all legal, but the cops saw fit to get a warrant and take his guns anyways. I&#8217;m disgusted, and you should be too.<br />

<p>CA- San Diego Police Chief, William Lansdowne said in an interview that the implementation of new gun laws will take guns off the streets of America within a generation.</p>
<p>According to San Diego 6, Lansdowne said that it may take a generation but guns will eventually be taken off the streets through new laws like Senator Dianne Feinstein&#8217;s proposed assault weapons ban:</p>
<p>&#8220;Chief Lansdowne, who plays an active role in the western region of the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) association, said it may take a generation but guns will eventually be taken off the streets through new laws like Senator Diane Feinstein&#8217;s proposed assault weapons ban legislation. Some of the items his organization is addressing include; a ban on assault weapons, restricting high-capacity magazines, closing loopholes that allow firearm sales between private owners without background checks, and implementing much stricter background checks by using a comprehensive database.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lansdowne called for tougher gun laws in an interview with KPBS, and praised President Obama for his initiative on gun control.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not be more supportive of the president for taking the position he has,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s courageous with the politics involved in this process. But I think it&#8217;s goin to eventually make the country safer and certainly safer for my officers that have to respond to these calls.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lansdowne believes that the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut weakened the gun lobby&#8217;s power and has opened the door for new gun control legislation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We broke the NRA,&#8221; Lansdowne said off-camera.</p>
<p>Lansdowne&#8217;s position on gun control appears to be in the minority among sheriffs across the nation, however.</p>
<p>As CNSNews.com previously reported, sheriffs from Florida to California have stated publicly that they will not comply with any new gun control measures proposed by the federal government.</p>
<p>http://cnsnews.com/blog/gregory-gwyn-williams-jr/police-chief-within-generation-guns-will-be-taken-streets</p>
<p>Second Amendment hypocrites: Senators Schumer and Feinstein have concealed gun permits.</p>
<p>A recent poll conducted by the National Association of Chiefs of Police indicated that almost 64 percent of police commanders and sheriffs favor a law allowing private citizens to carry concealed firearms for protection. Almost 73 percent said that citizens should not be restricted from purchasing more than one weapon, and 96 percent say they believe criminals obtain firearms from illegal sources.</p>
<p>Unfortunately most states &#8211; especially those called Blue States due to their Liberal-leanings &#8211; continue to prohibit private citizens from carrying concealed handguns.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are outspoken opponents of gun ownership, such as Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Diane Feinstein (D-CA), who are carrying concealed weapons, according to WABC Radio&#8217;s Mark Levin. Levin, a recognized constitutional expert, heads the Landmark Legal Foundation. The LLF&#8217;s goal is to protect American&#8217;s from unreasonable and illegal government intrusions and violations of the US Constitution, including the Second Amendment.</p>
<p>The mainstream news media have been aware that several antigun proponents are carrying concealed firearms but have failed to expose this hypocrisy. This writer&#8217;s efforts to discover how many other anti-gunners are also packing heat &#8211; a right they wish to deny other citizens &#8211; met with limited results.</p>
<p>Not only does Schumer carry a handgun, the New York City Police Department also provides armed escorts for the good senator. In fact, the Government Accounting Office &#8212; the investigative arm of the US Congress &#8212; slammed Schumer&#8217;s use of police resources for personal protection. It&#8217;s clear that Schumer believes he&#8217;s special. He wishes to ban private citizens&#8217; ownership of firearms, while he enjoys layers of protection.</p>
<p>&#8220;No wonder Chuckie Schumer shoots his mouth off so much &#8211; he&#8217;s able to protect himself,&#8221; says a 25-year police veteran.</p>
<p>Also, a check of Pistol License records shows that Senator Schumer possesses an &#8220;unrestricted&#8221; pistol permit, a rarity in New York City. Licenses are distributed in different categories in the Big Apple: Target Permits allow only use of a firearm at a licensed firing range; Premises Permits allow weapons to be kept in a home or apartment; Restricted Permits allow the gunowner to carry their firearms concealed but only within the purview of their job (security, jewelers, armored car guards, etc.). So it&#8217;s evident that Senator Schumer has two sets of rules &#8212; one for Americans and one for himself.</p>
<p>And then we have Senator Diane Feinstein on the Left Coast who possesses something more rare than a conservative Republican in San Francisco &#8211; an unrestricted concealed weapons permit. Apparently without shame, she participated in a citywide gun turn-in program that was intended to create some kind of statue from the donated guns that were to be melted down. One of her police body guards let it slip that she contributed a cheap model for the meltdown, while retaining her .357 magnum revolver for her own personal self-defense.</p>
<p>Hypocrisy is not limited to politicians when it comes to the Second Amendment. For Example, well-known Washington-based columnist, Carl Rowan, often wrote about the ills of firearms ownership. Until, that is, he shot and wounded a teenager who trespassed on his property. The white teenaged boy claimed he wanted to try Rowan&#8217;s swimming pool. Rowan, an African-American, retaliated with deadly force using a firearm. That&#8217;s when the news came out that Carl Rowan, gun-control advocate, actually possessed a license to own firearms.</p>
<p>Another example is the loudmouth entertainer, Rosie O&#8217;Donnell, who once ran roughshod over conservative actor Tom Selleck because of his stance supporting the Second Amendment. Although Ms. O&#8217;Donnell doesn&#8217;t carry a gun, she has three armed bodyguards who protect her, her wife and her children, something the vast majority of hardworking Americans could never afford. Isn&#8217;t it comforting to know all these Liberals are looking out for us?</p>

					<p>Introduction to Robin Hooding – http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7aOsBxPiE</p>
<p>Robin Hooding is an activity where liberty activists try to save people from having their money stolen by the state by feeding the meters before a parking enforcement officer can write a ticket on an expired meter. Like Robin Hood, the activists are standing up against oppressive government taxes. This form of activism has been performed periodically in the past in the Keene Area and recently begun again.</p>

<p>Ideally, a business card is left on each vehicle saved informing the person that they have been saved. This activism has been quite popular among many of the locals and the feedback received has been overwhelming positive.</p>

<p>Financially speaking, the economics of robin hooding are very sound. Below are the facts from the FY13 Proposed Budget of the City of Keene (Link: http://www.ci.keene.nh.us/sites/default/files/FY13%20Proposed%20Operating%20Budget.pdf).</p>
<p>Annually, 25,000 tickets are issued by the city of Keene, which results in over $250,000 of revenue to the city (roughly $10/ticket). Tickets are $5, but if they are not paid in a “grace period” the amount skyrockets. Additionally, if a vehicle already has a ticket, it can receive another ticket if it is not moved within two hours. If the tickets are not paid, the “violator” vehicle is towed and impounded. In theory, each “save” costs activists $0.05, or a nickel, and costs the city $10 in lost revenue. Additionally, the city still has to pay the expenses associated with enforcement including: labor, vehicles, meter maintenance, etc.</p>
<p>If your local area has meters that you can pay, robin hooding is a very easy to startup form of activism that is effective, affordable, and popular.</p>
<p>Finally, Mario endorses robin hooding as a fun and safe way to interact with your local bureaucrats and get some exercise. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIMomZr2Fes</p>
