Don't know when it was taken, but from the looks of it, at the time the photo was taken, he looks healthy, for now. Also, he 'Looks' to be in good spirits.
Hope Adam finds whatever internal, personal 'Rock' he needs, to sustain himself, and emerge victorious through this current ordeal.
Whatever anyone may think of Adam, his tactics, and antics, a free man was kidnapped by state thugs, illegally. I for one will pray for his health, and contribute financially what I can. I hope for those of y'all who can, please do so, or consider doing so in the future, thanks.

There's a rally that was scheduled for today, by my time, I suppose it's over; anyone attend? Any online updates?
“Free Kokesh” rally to be held outside jail on Saturday.

Barefoot and wearing the same shorts he was arrested in, combat veteran, radio host and freedom activist Adam Kokesh is still being held without bond in a frigid, ant-infested jail cell less than 50 square feet in size.
Kokesh is currently charged with possession of a Schedule 1 or 2 drug and possession of a Schedule 1 or 2 drug while in possession of a firearm.
A sheriff’s deputy informed Kokesh, held at the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center, that authorities are also considering to charge him with armed sedition and illegal transportation of a firearm. ================================================================
Regardless, may Adam come out a better, more dedicated man, at the conclusion of this ordeal.
Please, Pray for him, and his loved ones.
Secularist? Please meditate on good intentions of well being.
Thanks.

UPDATE 1: Adam's girlfriend Carey Elizabeth actually got to visit him, recently.

Stay Tuned for words from Adam himself. The R3VOLUTION grows. You can not stop what we do

An interesting tidbit? Carey, a Californian, used to be an Obama voter:

Then became a Ron Paul supporter/R3VOL. To now, an AnCap, not to mention a GF to, now an infamous, AnCap activist.
Politics: apparently, sometimes...a love finder. lol.
Eitherway, I'd venture to guess that Dr. Ronald Ernest Paul has single-handedly inspired, and has converted more minarchists to Anarcho-Capitalists/Voluntaryists, than ANY other single person in history!
