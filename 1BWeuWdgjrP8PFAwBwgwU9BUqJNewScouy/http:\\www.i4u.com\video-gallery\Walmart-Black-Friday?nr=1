World Cup Finals: Germany 1, Argentina 0
In a shocking move, Germany won the World Cup in overtime when Mario Götze scored the only goal. Waze Navigation App review
Waze is a social GPS (Global Positioning System) Maps and traffic system application. It is among the world’s leading traffic and navigation applications that are community-based. With Waze, you can join all drivers in your community and local area who share traffic and road information in real time. This in turn assists in the saving of time and most importantly fuel money. CSR Racing App Review
CSR Racing is among the best drag racing games in the Android application store today. The game is much better than what you expect when you just have a glance at the cover, with numerous races and exceptional racing cars at your disposal as long as you have what it takes. Max & Ruby App review
Max & Ruby: Max’s Mole Mash is a very fun arcade game for putting your reflexes to the test. This is a very entertaining game that does not require a lot of effort in order to fully enjoy. It is a classic app that is full of style and can also be quite a learning experience. Visit our Homepage	for the Latest Rumors, News	and Shopping Tips	Apple
