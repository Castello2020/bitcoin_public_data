								<p>Apr 8 &#8211; <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/news/business/bus_general/detail/101877/#ixzz1YNErhLrM">Agricultural tycoon explains why he is suing government</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Just last year, Oleksiy Vadatursky was the agrarian king, flying high as one of Ukraine’s 10 richest people, worth more than $1 billion and looking to invest to help keep his company, Nibulon, as one of Ukraine’s top grain traders.</p>
<p>But the government’s decision to ignore Nibulon when handing out quotas to export grain this year has caused huge losses to the company. Meanwhile, authorities granted a huge export quota to a previously unknown company that is partly owned by the state and partly by unknown private investors.</p>
<p>Now Vadatursky, a 67-year-old former Soviet collective farm worker, is fighting back, taking the state to court for what he and others say are opaque decisions about who is allowed to make huge profits through grain exports.</p>
<p>Through groups such as the American Chamber of Commerce and Ukrainian Grain Association, domestic and top international grain companies operating in Ukraine have threatened numerous times in the past months to sue the government for damages caused by protectionist and non-transparent policies.</p>
<p>But so far, Vadatursky’s company is the only one of Ukraine’s large grain market players to act on such a threat.</p>
<p>“We have sued in order to draw the attention of the country’s authorities to non-transparent allocation of quotas,” Vadatursky said in a telephone interview from the southern city of Mykolayiv, where Nibulon is based.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Poll: Party of Regions of Ukraine losing support</strong><br />
Apr 28 at 10:09 | Interfax-Ukraine<br />
If elections to the Verkhovna Rada were held in mid-April, five parties would have garnered enough votes to qualify for the parliament, i.e. the Party of Regions (13.9% of the vote), the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc (10.6%), the Front for Change led by Arseniy Yatseniuk (7.1%), the Communist Party (3.2%), and the Udar (Strike) party led by Vitali Klitschko (3.1%), as can be seen from a nationwide public opinion poll of 1,020 respondents conducted by the Kyiv International Sociology Institute on April 8 to 18.</p>
<p>The Strong Ukraine party led by Sergiy Tigipko would have been supported by 2.8% of the voters, the all-Ukrainian association Freedom led by Oleh Tiahnybok by 2.7%, and Anatoliy Hrytsenko&#8217;s Bloc &#8216;Civil Position&#8217; by 1.6%, which is below the 3% qualification threshold.</p>
<p>The number of voters ready to go to polling stations has dropped by 23 percentage points to 50% from 73% since June 2010, the institute said in a statement.</p>
<p>This decline is mainly attributed to Party of Regions supporters, as their number has dropped from 38% to 13.9% in this period of time, it said.</p>

<p>As part of continuing complaints against the regime of Ukrainian President Yanukovych, Svoboda and other opposition groups protested in Kiev today about several issues they believe are detrimental to Ukrainian sovereignty.</p>
<p>Svoboda&#8217;s protest in Taras Shevchenko park today focused on the Kharkov (Kharkiv) Agreements of 2010, against the Kremlin talk of &#8220;improvements&#8221; Russian-Ukrainian relations, the continuation of the lease to Russia&#8217;s Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol, threats to Ukraine&#8217;s national-economic security, gas deals with Russia, and other issues. Svoboda believes President Yanukovych&#8217;s regime is systematically surrendering to the Kremlin&#8217;s appetite for gobbling up Ukraine&#8217;s national sovereignty. </p>

<p>The hope is that these high-priced advocates will be able to generate favorable international publicity that somehow helps to win the case in Ukraine.</p>

London, May 16 (Interfax-Ukraine) &#8211; Reform has ground to a halt in Ukraine, which is losing its investment appeal, investors said during the seventh Adam Smith Conference summit in London.</p>

<p>Israeli Agents abduct Palestinian man in Ukraine</p>
<p>Following the abduction of Dirar Abu Sisi, deputy director of operations of the Gaza’s only power plant, and his subsequent deportation to Israel for imprisonment, public confidence in the security services has been dramatically reduced. Mass media rumors, citing government sources, implicated the security services themselves in the abduction. At least this rumor suggests that the Ukrainian security services are in control of the activity of foreign agents on Ukrainian soil – for the alternative is quite disconcerting.</p>

<p><strong>Ukrainians cut cars in half to reduce import tax at customs</strong><br />
&#8220;oday I received some tax saving wisdom from a taxi driver in Ukraine. He told me that people who import cars to Ukraine sometimes cut the car in two separate pieces and carry it through the customs this way. By doing this, they save a fortune on import tax. A car carried in two pieces is seen as spare parts and therefore is taxed at a much lower rate than a normal car.&#8221; (<a href="http://todayilearned.co.uk/2011/08/03/ukrainians-cut-cars-in-half-to-reduce-import-tax-at-customs/">more</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Profitability of grain production in Ukraine to almost halve in 2011</strong><br />
The Ukrainian Agribusiness Club&#8217;s analysts said that the reason for the fall in the profitability of grain production is the introduction of import duties on grain, the cancellation of VAT refunding to grain traders and a rise in expenses on grain production. They said that expenses on mineral fertilizers and fuel and lubricants grew by 50% this year, expenses on seeds by 60%, expenses on wages by 32% and expenses on rent rates by 20%.</p>

<p>The lowering of the limit of the general open long currency position for banks from 20% to 5% by the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) is aimed at supporting the hryvnia exchange rate and reducing inflation pressure, according to bankers polled by Interfax-Ukraine.</p>
<p>&#8220;The NBU reduced the limit of the general open long currency position, retaining the limit of the general short open currency position – this shows that the central bank is trying to support the hyrvnia exchange rate on the interbank market,&#8221; Deputy Board Chairman of Kyiv-based Finance and Credit Bank, Serhiy Borysov, said.</p>

<p>My comment: Supporting the exchange rate and reducing inflation pressure are opposite dynamics.  The NBU cannot do both.</p>

<p><strong>Yanukovych signs law creating equal conditions for starting business</strong><br />
May 23 at 13:33 | UNIAN<br />
President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych has signed the Law “On Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of Ukraine on the Simplification of Procedures for Starting Businesses”, which creates equal starting conditions for those willing to do business in Ukraine, according to the Press office of Yanukovych.</p>
<p>The Law was introduced under the Program of Economic Reforms for 2010-2014. Its implementation will allow simplifying and optimizing the procedure of legal entities registration, which in turn will encourage entrepreneurs to start their own businesses and improve Ukraine’s rating in The Doing Business Project by the “Starting a Business”.</p>

May 22 at 15:05 | Mark Rachkevych<br />
A Russian company has successfully completed anti-trust clearance in Ukraine to take control of Brocard, Ukraine&#8217;s largest perfume seller with 63 outlets throughout the country.</p>

<p>As Donald puts it: “Without confessions and guilty pleas, courts everywhere would grind to a halt in an instant; more than 90 percent of all charges in the Russian and Ukrainian judicial systems end in guilty pleas, and only experienced criminals and highly educated defendants stand a chance. This is what the cops are doing behind their closed doors—the feudal system’s trial by ordeal is still much with us.”</p>

<p><strong>Ukraine farmland privatization &#8216;only for Ukrainians&#8217; &#8211; minister</strong><br />
31/05/2011</p>
<p>Foreigners will be barred from buying Ukraine&#8217;s farmland when Kiev launches a massive privatization program next year, the country&#8217;s agricultural policy minister said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ukraine&#8217;s parliament voted to liberalize its land market in a tight vote in March.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the first stage, we will only be introducing the land market for Ukrainian nationals,&#8221; Mykola Prysyazhnyuk told RIA Novosti.</p>
<p>&#8220;We understand that if we make the market free, then $30 billion will be enough &#8211; and that&#8217;s not a lot for world financial corporations &#8211; to buy up all of our land,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Prysyazhnyuk said Ukraine would export about 1 million tons of maize, wheat and barley before this year&#8217;s harvest is gathered in.</p>

<p><strong>Next wave of changes in Ukraine&#8217;s tax system could start in autumn, says vice premier</strong><br />
Jun 3</p>
<p>&#8220;In almost all countries the same principle is operating: earn more – pay more. And in terms of percentage ratios people pay more. Our practically level scale of taxation differs [from the widely spread international practice],&#8221; Tigipko said.</p>
<p>In addition, according to him, imperfect legislation leaves significant parts of the economy untaxed.</p>
<p>Tigipko also criticized the current system of tax benefits because of its disorder and lack of efficiency, and called the penal system &#8220;burdensome and not always adequate.&#8221; The ineffective judicial system worsens the situation, as does corruption and the low level of training of employees of the tax service regarding some issues, the vice premier added.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Lord help us.  Let&#8217;s hope Ukraine&#8217;s tax system stays inefficient.</p>
